                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind visited Krishna Kutir at Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh today (June 27, 2022) and interacted with the inmates.  

Addressing the gathering, the President said that in our culture, women have been called Goddess. It has even been said ‘where women are respected, there the Gods reside’. But over a long period of time, many social evils have arisen in our society. Like child marriage, sati and dowry, widow life is also a social evil. This social evil is a blot on the culture of our country. The sooner this stigma is removed, the better. 

The President said that it has been seen that after the death of a woman's husband, the attitude of not only that family but of society changes towards that woman. We have to come forward and awaken the society to stop the neglect faced by widows. From time to time many saints and social reformers have made efforts to improve the difficult life of such despised mothers and sisters. Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Swami Dayanand Saraswati got some success in their efforts but still, much remains to be done in this area.

 The President said that the establishment of shelters like 'Krishna Kutir' is a commendable initiative. But, in his view, there should be no need for the construction of such shelter homes in the society. Instead of this, efforts like remarriage, economic independence, share in family property and protection of social and moral rights of destitute women should be encouraged. And, through these measures, self-reliance and self-respect should be promoted in our mothers and sisters.

 The President said that such a large and important section of the society cannot be ignored. Together, we all have to raise social awareness towards these despised and neglected women. Social evils, religious beliefs and discrimination related to inheritance rights have to be removed. The problems of discrimination in the distribution of property and the denial of women's rights over children will have to be addressed. Only then, these women will be able to live a life of self-respect and self-confidence. He appealed to the responsible citizens of the society to make efforts for including these women in the mainstream of the society.

                Participants of the annual Heads of Missions Conference called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (June 30, 2018) at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

Addressing the gathering, the President said that there are tectonic shifts taking place in the world, and not just in the realm of geopolitics and geoeconomics. Technology, communication and societal mores are also changing rapidly. Terrorism and nonconventional threats pose a constant challenge to our security.  To manage India’s rise in such an environment is not an easy task. As Heads of Missions, they have to be masters at strategic thinking, nimble-footed action and be able to quickly adapt to change.

The President said that the government has a clear and well marked approach to diplomacy today. The litmus test of our engagement with the external world is what we are able to do to propel domestic growth and development. Our diplomats are doing well on this account. And as they do so, there is expectation for much more, especially when the country aspires for transformational change. The Indian growth story and our flagship programmes, be it Make in India, Digital India, Skill India, Smart Cities or Start-up India, have a multilayered connect with the external world. As diplomats, it is part of their mandate to secure new investments, scout for appropriate technologies, create markets for Make-in-India products and bring the best of business practices to India. 

The President said that engaging the different States of India is a vital part of our diplomacy today. He stated that he sees real value of “twinning arrangements” in promoting people-to-people relations between our States and diaspora countries. Today, there are higher expectations from us as a country from our citizens living outside. He complimented the External Affairs Minister for her exemplary leadership and work in this regard. He stated that the EAM has given a new confidence to our people abroad in the ability of our Government to reach out to them when in need. Our Missions and our Ambassadors are seen as responsive to public needs, always ready to give a helping hand to our citizens and to members of the Indian diaspora. Our E-Visa scheme, similarly, has come in for praise.     

The President said that our diplomats should remember that they don’t just represent the Indian state and the Government of India. They represent 1.3 billion Indians, and their hopes and aspirations. They represent our diverse and plural culture, they represent the richness of our 5000 year old civilization and they represent a society that in its essence is a force for good and for stability in an unpredictable world.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, laid the foundation stone for an auditorium of the Kanpur Bar Association in Kanpur today (June 29, 2018).

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said the legal profession is a very noble profession. Every advocate is an integral part of the justice system. That is why he or she is also called ‘Officer of the Court’. From this broad perspective, every advocate is a friend of the court as well as of the justice system and of society.

 

The President said that justice delivery becomes more effective with coordination between judicial officers and advocates. In this context, Bar Associations have an important role to play. He urged the Kanpur Bar Association and the Lawyers Association to strengthen this aspect of our judicial system. He stated that in the past few years, strikes by advocates in district courts and their discontent with the justice system have been noticed. Such incidents interfere with the process of justice. All Bar Associations should try and avoid such obstacles.

 

Later in the day, in Allahabad, the President graced and addressed the centenary celebrations of the Allahabad Medical Association and inaugurated the AMA Convention and Rehabilitation Centre. 

 

 

Addressing the gathering, the President said that medical associations have the social and moral responsibility to keep in mind the interests of patients, especially the poorer sections, in addition to taking care of the interests of doctors.

 

 

The President said that the government has taken many steps under the ‘National Health Mission’, ‘National Health Policy’ and ‘Ayushman Bharat’ scheme to provide citizens adequate health services at low cost. Prices of medicines and medical devices have also been reduced. But ultimately, doctors play the key role in providing effective health services to fellow citizens.

I consider it a privilege to be addressing some of the brightest young minds in the country and in fact the world. IIT Kanpur sets the benchmark for education in engineering and technology, in the sciences, and even in humanities, management and allied disciplines. 


 


	Starting with the first batch of just 100 students in 1960, the Institute has come a long way. Today, it has 6,500 students. Its 35,000 alumni comprise engineers, entrepreneurs and technologists who have helped build India. They have also added to our country’s global reputation. IIT Kanpur alumni can be found from Silicon Valley to Singapore. They have contributed substantially to research and business across the world. And yet their primary identity remains their alma mater. Many educational institutions are known by their alumni. In the case of your Institute, old students are known by virtue of being from IIT Kanpur.


 


	The evolution of IIT Kanpur has mirrored scientific and technological education in independent India. The IIT Kanpur model forms the core of the engineering curriculum in premier institutions of the country. Way back in 1963, IIT Kanpur was a pioneer in offering programmes in computer science. This anticipated the IT revolution in the country by a good three decades. Such achievements have been possible due to the commitment and dedication of several generations of faculty members and students. I congratulate all those who have been part of this journey. 


 

 


	The students graduating today are drawing from this great legacy. This is a day of celebration for you and I wish you a satisfying future. It is also a day of fulfilment for your professors, parents, family members and all those who have helped you navigate the process of acquiring your degree. I am confident you will prove worthy of the trust that your teachers and family members have reposed in you. Please strive and live up to the support that other stakeholders, from the government to tax payers to civil society, have given you and given IIT Kanpur. As and when you can, and in a manner of your choosing, you must return this debt to society. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen and Dear Students


	Those who are graduating today are doing so at a juncture marked by excitement and opportunities. Today’s India offers unprecedented hope and avenues. Your professional future may well lie in aerospace engineering, Artificial Intelligence, biomedical research, energy storage, smart grids, renewable energy, financial mathematics, precision manufacture or so many other fields. Our fast-growing economy offers you huge scope. With your talent, your education and your IIT degree, each of you can be a game changer for India.


 


	To improve the quality of life of our fellow citizens, the Government of India has undertaken many initiatives. Among others these include the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation or AMRUT, the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojna, Digital India, Make in India, Start-up India, and the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Technology can be a force multiplier for all these programmes. As you build your careers, please attempt to contribute to such national missions. 


 


	Every educational institution and every educated individual exists in a social context. Kanpur, the urban centre your IIT belongs to, has an illustrious history. Like you, I too was fortunate to be a college student in this city. In the 20th century, Kanpur was one of the earliest industrial townships in our country and its textile mills won it the nickname “Manchester of the East”. In the age of the digital economy and of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is important to upgrade and re-imagine Kanpur as an industrial and commercial hub. The city is also critical to the success of Namami Gange. This is a programme to not merely de-pollute the Ganga and conserve it from industrial effluents. It goes further. It seeks to rationalise the allocation and usage of the river’s waters as well as to develop the Ganga basin.


 


	All of these are shared tasks. Governments and citizens, industry and academia – a variety of stakeholders will play a role. IIT Kanpur too must be part of the mix. It is necessary for scientific and research institutions such as this one to assume a larger responsibility in programme design, monitoring and implementation strategies for the renewal of Kanpur.


 

Dear Graduating Students


	You represent an extraordinary generation in our country’s history. Your generation faces extraordinary challenges. But it also has extraordinary opportunities and is equipped with extraordinary skills and scholarship to meet and defeat those challenges. 


 


	As you go into the world outside, a world buzzing with energy and passion, I would like to leave you with four mantras.


 


	First, Get Inspired: To achieve big things it is important to understand the lives and motivations of those before you who have done big things. What abilities made them special? What can you learn from their experiences, both their successes and their failures? Sometimes the answers to these questions are an education in themselves. 


 


	Second, Think Big, Think Risks: Do not be afraid of failure. Ordinary goals are for ordinary people. For you, the cream of our educational system and of our youth, it is crucial to set yourselves significant and nontrivial goals. Whether in a research lab, a start-up, a business corporation or a government institution, please imbibe a risk-taking culture. Yes, there will be setbacks – but pick yourselves up and learn from them. Great societies and great nations are not built by an over-cautious and risk-averse attitude.


 


	Third, Maintain Discipline: To accomplish whatever mission you set yourself, it is essential that you do not compromise with discipline. Clearly understand the boundaries of your personal and professional lives. Devote yourselves to work, but keep time for physical exercise, for music and hobbies, and above all for your families and friends. 


 


	And fourth, Be Humble and Sensitive: Do not get carried away by your success as it may distract you from new frontiers. Always remember that whatever knowledge you may have acquired, at the end of the day it amounts to a few drops in the ocean of human experience. Carry your learning and your achievements lightly, and use them for the welfare of our country and of humanity.


 


	With those words, I wish you the best possible future. And I wish the IIT Kanpur community a continued march towards even greater excellence.


 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

Addressing the young students, the President congratulated them for their success in JEE (Advanced) examination. He expressed confidence that they will achieve their future goals with the same determination with which they have achieved this success. He also appreciated GAIL and CSRL for their initiative.

On this occasion, he also launched the Solar Charkha and MSME Sampark Portal. 

The President said that the Udyam Sangam-2018 is an important effort in developing effective eco-systems for MSME sector. He noted that the Sangam will provide representatives of finance, training and educational institutions, industry, media, state governments and NGOs an opportunity to engage in extensive discussions to strengthen the eco-systems in this sector. He was happy to note that entire process chain of the MSME sector was kept in mind in this Sangam. The President said that the ‘Sampark Portal’, launched today, will be very useful in developing skill-pool and in enabling trained youth to know about different employment opportunities.

The President said that MSME sector is called the backbone of our economy. This sector is the second largest employment provider after the agricultural sector. Our demographic dividend shall be most gainfully utilized in this very sector. This sector generates more employment opportunities at a lower cost of capital. And the most important thing about this sector is that it creates jobs in rural and backward areas. This sector could help in achieving the goal of inclusive growth through empowerment of weaker sections and decentralization of development.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the National Awards for Outstanding Services in the field of Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drug) Abuse today (June 26, 2018) in New Delhi on the occasion of International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that problem of drugs addiction and alcoholism negatively impacts the individual, family and society in multiple domains such as health, culture, development and politics. Drug addiction spurs poverty and also poses a challenge to our national security as well as to our development and public welfare goals.

The President said that our geographical location between Myanmar-Laos-Thailand’s ‘Golden Triangle’ and Iran-Afghanistan-Pakistan’s ‘Golden Crescent’, makes the problem of Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking even more acute and complicated. Increase in drug trafficking and drug abuse in the border areas is also associated with issues of terrorism and political unrest. That is why there is a need to be more vigilant in Border States like Punjab and Manipur.

The President said that misuse of illegal drugs is creating health challenges especially for the young generation and school going children. He stated that the problem of drug abuse can be solved by awareness, prevention, incentives, and support efforts. In these efforts compassion and sympathy for the drug addicts is also necessary. Parents, teachers, doctors, voluntary organizations should be associated in the medical and rehabilitation efforts. He was happy to note that the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has taken necessary steps in these directions.

Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot; Ministers of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Ramdas Athawale, Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar and Shri Vijay Sampla.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received His Excellency Mr Danny Antoine Rollen Faure, the President of the Republic of Seychelles, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (June 26, 2018). He also hosted a banquet in his honour.

Welcoming President Danny Faure to India, the President said that India recognises the leadership role of Seychelles in Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and on climate change and maritime security issues.  Seychelles has also emerged as the top African country in the Human Development Index.  It has consistently figured among the top five ranking countries in Africa for overall governance.  He complimented the Government of Seychelles for these extraordinary achievements.  

The President said that India and Seychelles have a very special relationship, built on the foundation of mutual trust, enormous goodwill and shared values.  The two countries are happy to share the same geostrategic vision of maintaining peace, security and stability in the Indian Ocean. Our countries need to work together as partners in strengthening the regional architecture of the Indian Ocean.  

The President said that the vast natural resources provide limitless opportunities for the growth and prosperity of our future generations. Our common goal should be to harness the full potential of the ocean based Blue Economy in sustainable manner. He stated that India is happy that Seychelles is partnering it in the International Solar Alliance initiative as a founding member.  India looks forward to working with Seychelles to develop solar energy projects in Seychelles.  

The President assured the President of Seychelles India’s continued commitment for extending development assistance to Seychelles in all the areas which the Government of Seychelles considers critical and of direct benefit to its people.    

 

Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Kovind said that close bonds of friendship between India and Seychelles have stood the test of time. For the past four decades, since the independence of Seychelles, our countries have been working together as partners in tackling common challenges, addressing critical issues, and strengthening regional and global cooperation frameworks. 

The President said that India has a robust defence, security and strategic cooperation with Seychelles. India-Seychelles strategic convergence has reinforced the resolve to secure their oceanic space, in the region and beyond. India views the Indian Ocean and the Pacific as a contiguous construct sharing similar economic opportunities and security challenges. Our vision is for a free, open, peaceful, prosperous and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, based on a rules-based order and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.

	It gives me great pleasure to welcome you, Your Excellency, and your delegation.
	India is not unfamiliar to you. You have visited our country several times in the past. We were pleased to welcome you in India in March this year for the International Solar Alliance Founding Conference. But today is a special day as this is your first State Visit to our country.


Excellency,


	The close bonds of friendship between India and Seychelles have stood the test of time. For the past four decades, since the independence of Seychelles, our countries have been working together as partners in tackling common challenges, addressing critical issues, and strengthening regional and global cooperation frameworks.
	We laud your vision for Seychelles, particularly your emphasis on transparency, good governance and accountability in public life. Your focus on economic growth, poverty alleviation and social welfare is indeed commendable. It is heartening to note that Seychelles, has emerged as the top African country in the Human Development Index. I would like to compliment your Government for this extraordinary achievement.
	Though Seychelles is small in terms of size, it has gained global recognition for its pioneering role in Blue Economy, Sustainable Development, Environment and Clean Energy. Indeed, Seychelles occupies an important place among the Small Island Developing States and the African Union.


Excellency,


	We have a robust defence, security and strategic cooperation with Seychelles. Our strategic convergence has reinforced the resolve to secure our oceanic space, in the region and beyond. India views the Indian Ocean and the Pacific as a contiguous construct sharing similar economic opportunities and security challenges. Our vision is for a free, open, peaceful, prosperous and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, based on a rules-based order and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.
	Bilaterally, our defence and security cooperation has deepened during the last four decades.  Indian Navy contingents have been regularly participating in your National Day parades. This is not only a matter of great honour for us but also a manifestation of our strong bilateral relations. As I speak here, Indian Naval Ship, INS Tarkash, has entered Port Victoria to participate in your National Day celebrations on 29th June. The second Dornier Maritime Surveillance Aircraft, which is our gift for your National Day, would also be joining the Seychelles Air Force on this special day.


Excellency,


	You have just visited Gujarat. A substantial part of our Diaspora in Seychelles comes from this State. Our traditional linkages, cultural affinities and people-to-people exchanges are the cornerstone of our bilateral relationship. Indians were among the first settlers in your country and form the bedrock of the Seselwa society.  
	Excellency, nature has been very kind with you. When we talk of Seychelles in India, we are told of colourful sands, the largest nut in the world and the special Aldabra tortoise. We thank you for gifting us what today, uniquely belongs only to you. Thank you, indeed, for the friendly tortoises.


Excellency, 


	I would like to assure you of our continued commitment to extend development assistance in diverse areas that are of priority to the friendly people of Seychelles. I am confident that the Agreements we have signed today would open new vistas of bilateral cooperation and would further deepen and diversify our strategic partnership.
	With these words, Mr. President, I once again welcome you and the distinguished members of your delegation and wish you a productive and enjoyable stay in India.


Ladies and Gentlemen, may I now request you to join me in raising a toast to:


	the health and wellbeing of His Excellency President Danny Faure; 
	the continued progress and prosperity of the Republic of Seychelles and its friendly people; and 
	the everlasting friendship between India and Seychelles.  


 

Thank you.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, delivered a lecture at Havana University in Cuba yesterday (June 22, 2018) on the subject - “India and the Global South”.  

 

The President said that the subject - “India and the Global South” - he has chosen to speak on happens to be central to both Cuban and Indian foreign policy. And it is an area of multilateral engagement, where we have seen real and robust impact of India-Cuba close cooperation, with both countries playing a stellar role in powering South-South Cooperation and standing up for a stronger voice for the Global South or Developing Countries. The solidarity of the Global South lay at the heart of the international vision of great leader and statesman of Cuba, Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution. He said, his talk was a tribute to Fidel Castro’s contribution and vision to make the world a better place for the citizens of the developing world.

 

The President said that the values of South-South Cooperation have stood us in good stead. Mutual respect and solidarity among developing countries form the core of it. The success of South-South Cooperation must encourage our developed country partners to see how best these modalities can be utilized by them as well. The decision of the United Nations for hosting the second High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation in Buenos Aires in 2019 is a welcome move.     

 

The President said that development partnership secures the interests of the Global South, but only partially. We have to work together to push for greater space for developing countries in global governance structures. In this context, we must give a greater push for reform of the United Nations including the Security Council. Similarly, the Bretton Woods Institutions must factor in the growing weight of the countries of the South in their decision making. Alongside our reform agenda, we must counter any move to weaken multilateralism. Preserving a rules-based global trading order remains critical to promote the interests of developing countries. At the World Trade Organization Doha Round of Negotiations, it is essential that issues of food security and livelihoods are given utmost sanctity. 

 

The President said that globalization may have lifted millions out of poverty but the unmet needs in developing countries still remain. The growth agenda centered on poverty eradication, therefore, must be at the heart of the global development discourse. We must also push for greater availability of finance and technology to help developing countries combat Climate Change and meet their development needs. 

 

The President said that the Global South has come a long way in its journey since the 1960’s. Today, the Group stands stronger and taller. It is a diverse Group with countries at various levels of development. But it is important that the unity of the Group be preserved. That’s how we can strengthen multilateralism and promote Right to Development for all. 

 

Earlier in the day (22.06.2018), the President was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the Revolution Palace. Subsequently, he led the delegation level talks with the Cuban side led by President Diaz-Canel. Both sides reviewed the entire gamut of bilateral relations and exchanged views on global issues of mutual concern.  

 

Both countries agreed to enhance cooperation in the fields of Biotechnology, Renewable Energy, Traditional Medicine and Trade and Investment.  Two MOUs were signed in the areas of Biotechnology and Traditional Medicine and Homeopathy. President Kovind was accompanied by 9 Indian biotechnology companies on this visit and these companies had engaging discussions with their Cuban counterparts. Both countries thus set the stage for making significant progress in biotechnology cooperation. 

 

President Kovind thanked President Diaz-Canel for Cuba’s becoming a founding member of the International Solar Alliance and sought his support to help the Alliance combat Climate Change. India offered a Line of Credit of US Dollars 75 million to support a 100 Mega Watt solar power project in Cuba. India also offered additional 10 slots to Cuba under the ITEC programme, taking the total annual scholarships given to Cuba to 70.

 

Both Leaders also conveyed their continued commitment to the reform of the UN Security Council. Cuba reiterated support for India’s candidature for a permanent seat in the Security Council.  

 

On the issue of terrorism, both sides conveyed their deepest concern on terrorism and the grave threat it poses to humanity.   They agreed to work closely to develop a strong global response to fighting terrorism. In this context, both sides called for early adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism at the United Nations.  

 

The President will leave for New Delhi after a successful conclusion of his state visit to three countries- Greece, Suriname and Cuba. He is expected to reach New Delhi on 24.06.2018.

	A very good morning to all of you. It is my privilege to be celebrating the International Day of Yoga amid the breathtaking beauty of Suriname. Your country and your hospitality have been both charming and calming. I cannot think of a more appropriate location to practice yoga. My privilege is enhanced because of the generous gesture of President Bouterse and Vice-President Ashwin Adhin in having agreed to be part of this commemoration. 



	Nowhere else in the world today, and on no previous International Day of Yoga, have two heads of state been co-participants. This is a unique event. And Mr President let me tell you that friends who do yoga together are true friends – they always stay friends.
	Yoga is an ancient Indian tradition, but it does not belong to India alone. It is part of humanity’s intangible heritage. Millions across the world, in every continent and among all communities, have embraced yoga and interpreted yoga in their own way. The practice of yoga has had a beneficial impact on their bodies as well as their minds. Particularly in today’s world of stresses and life-style diseases, yoga can help all of us.
	On India’s urging, and with unanimous support of all members of the United Nations, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to mark June 21 as the International Day of Yoga. The first International Day of Yoga was celebrated in 2015. Since then, the passion for yoga has spread even further and even wider. Today, along with Suriname and India, the fourth International Day of Yoga is being celebrated in practically every country in the world. To my mind, yoga is the ultimate expression of Indian soft power. It has won us love and affection among yoga practitioners in all corners of the planet, including of course here in Suriname.
	Yoga embodies the symbiotic relationship of mind and body; and of thought and action. It promotes harmony between human beings and nature, a sentiment that is so much at home in the culture of Suriname. It promotes a holistic approach to health and wellbeing. In our complex world, with a bewildering range of public health challenges and diseases, governments and health agencies face a tough task in ensuring the wellbeing of people. A multipronged approach and a combination of treatment and prevention are necessary. I would say that yoga needs to be part of the mix. It is a low or no investment tool for keeping our people healthy and avoiding many common ailments.
	The benefits of yoga must also spur us, in different countries and cultures, to explore traditional wisdom and consider how this could be useful for the modern age – or simply repackaged for our times. Many societies, including Suriname and India, have a wealth of traditional knowledge to offer. During my visit here, our countries have come to an agreement on cooperation in ayurveda and traditional medicine. Here too there is much for us to learn and adopt. And I am confident that we can do it together.   
	It has been an absolute honour to have visited Suriname and interacted with President Bouterse and his colleagues in the government, as well as with the friendly people of your wonderful country. As I leave, I will take back with me many, many memories. But the memory of celebrating the International Day of Yoga in your beautiful country will always remain. I can never forget this day. Thank you so much Mr President, thank you everybody. My best wishes to all of you present here and to all the people of Suriname.

	I thank you for your gracious words of welcome and your warm hospitality. It is an honour for me to be the First President of India to visit Suriname. Today, indeed, is a special and historic day for our bilateral ties.
	Our natural affinities and close people-to-people ties have brought us together. Stories of Suriname, of your lush green landscape and your warmth and affection abound in India. But what I have seen and experienced since my arrival here has far exceeded our expectations. I must say you have made my visit truly special.  
	Mr. President, in our talks this morning we have committed ourselves to enhance and deepen our friendship. It has been a singular honour for me to address the Extraordinary Session of your Parliament, and to pay my deepest respects at your national monuments.   


Excellency, 


	We share many things in common. Both our countries are multi-religious and multi-cultural; we both are deeply attached to our ancient traditions. Our age-old values provide the anchor that keeps us rooted and stable, even as we navigate the opportunities and challenges of a fast-changing world. 



	Your country, Mr. President, is part of the “New World’’. People and ideas from far and wide have mingled here. Whoever came to these shores soon became your own. I pay my deepest respects to your people for this togetherness.  In that context, I find it a truly humbling experience to have set foot in your captivating country among the celebration of the 145th Anniversary of the arrival of Indians in Suriname. This glorious chapter of our shared history shall ever remain a source of strength for both of us.


Excellency, 


	Our two countries have an engaging relationship. Development Partnership, cultural collaboration and close people-to-people ties have laced it with many achievements. Many more are waiting to be accomplished. 



	I see high potential to enhance our trade and investment relations. Agriculture, tourism, forestry, mining, energy and health are areas which we need to explore.  



	I am happy that we have made a new beginning in the field of solar energy today. As two countries deeply committed to protecting the environment, be it the rich rain forests of the Amazon or the sacred River Ganga, we have to act together, to save our tomorrow and to give our future generations what rightfully belongs to them.
	I am thankful to Suriname for supporting the International Solar Alliance. Your presence is a source of strength to us and to the global community in our common quest to tackle climate change.


Excellency, 


	As we talk of our shared future, we must also focus on our youth. They can do many things together. They can collaborate over cyber space or in understanding the benefits of Ayurveda and Yoga. Tomorrow, the world would be celebrating the International Day of Yoga. I am happy Mr. President that you will be joining me in celebrating this special day dedicated to yoga. Yoga may have originated in India, but today is part of our shared global heritage. To our delight, this will be the first time ever that two Heads of State will jointly be celebrating the International Day of Yoga. I invite all of you to join us as well in our quest to be healthier and to be at peace with our inner self.


Excellency, 


	As friends we have come a long way since we travelled together. Today, we have agreed to an ambitious roadmap for the future. Let us work for stronger Suriname -India relations. Let us be united in Friendship. “Foorwaarts in Vriendschap”.
	On this optimistic note, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, please join me in raising a toast: 



	
	
		To the health and happiness of President and First Lady of Suriname ;
	
	
	
	
		To the continued progress and prosperity of the people Suriname;
	
	
	
	
		And to enduring and everlasting friendship between the Republic of Suriname and the Republic of India.
	
	


 

Thank you!

	I am delighted to be in Suriname. I am honoured to be paying the first ever State Visit from India to your beautiful country. That my visit to South America happens to begin from Surinameis no coincidence. The warmth and closeness of our special bonds have drawn me to you first and foremost.  



	I am thankful to you for your love and affection showered on me since I arrived in this tropical paradise, the “beating heart of the Amazon..  
	Ladies and Gentlemen, Nations are built by brave men and women. But those who built Suriname were made of sterner   stuff, of higher determination and steely courage. These are no random thoughts but steady feelings that clouded me as I walked to the sacred Mama Sranan and Baba and Mai    monuments this morning. The story of JaneyTetary and the sacrifice of your Fallen Heroes reminded me of our own struggle for freedom - freedom from oppression, servitude and slavery.  



	And the one who led us to it was Mahatma Gandhi, our Father of the Nation. He belongs not just to us but to the entire humanity. We feel honoured that you have preserved his legacy in your surroundings. I had the opportunity to seek his blessings as I began my visit to Suriname. Later this year, we will begin worldwide celebrations of his 150th birth anniversary, including in Suriname. We would seek your support to revisit his life and his legacy.
	Ladies and Gentlemen, since my arrival in your beautiful country, I have been struck by your biodiversity but even more by the diversity of your people, your rich history and culture. You are many people, but One Nation.  



	The Creoles, Javanese, Chinese, Hindustanis, Maroons and Amerindians have all added their beauty to your rainbow. The Mama Srananholds all her children lovingly in her arm, giving equally care and respect to each. Your national spirit resonates perfectly with what Mahatma Gandhi said, and I quote - “I do not want my house to be walled-in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any” Unquote.    



	The Hindustani community is a colourful part of the Surinamese fabric.  I see them in large numbers here. They carry the stories of the arduous journey of their forefathers, undertaken from Kolkata to Paramaribo, close to their hearts.  In the steps of Baba and Mai, they follow their past, their pride and their history. These inspire millions in India as well. The Baba and Mai monument in Kolkata, an exact replica of the one in Paramaribo, is testimony to our umbilical connect. 
	I am happy that the Hindustani community has beautifully assimilated in the Surinamese society and yet, has preserved and kept their traditions and culture alive. The best of India, be it music, art or language has a place of pride here.  And the best of Indian cinema is enjoyed by all.
	Tomorrow, we will be laying the foundation stone of an Indian Cultural Centre. This would be dedicated to the promotion of Hindustani music and culture. I hope other communities would also join in its journey and success.
	Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted that you are celebrating the 145th anniversary of the arrival of Indians in this country.  But what is deeply inspiring for me is that each and every member of the Surinamese society is sharing the festivities.And you are not just living in harmony with your communities, but also in harmony with nature. I am told you are the greenest country in the world.  Deep in your forests and river valleys, exist centuries old wisdom and traditional knowledge. We should bring them back into our modern lives. I am happy that you celebrate National Ayurveda Day in Suriname. Today, we have agreed to collaborate in the fields of traditional medicine and plants. I hope we will succeed in bringing the best of Surinameand India together. 



	Ladies and Gentlemen, as two developing countries with similar political trajectories, we have grown hand-in-hand. This morning we agreed to enhance and accelerate our partnership. We are committed to sharing our expertise with Suriname for your growth and development. It is in that spirit that we are keen to assist you in developing solar energy projects. We hope these would soon glow, both in day and night, as shining examples of our partnership under the International Solar Alliance. 



	Mr. President, India has many bright stories to tell. We are the fastest growing major economy in the world. The face of India is changing rapidly. From Smart Cities to Digital Highways, from Artificial Intelligence to Big Data, from clean energy pathways to electric-mobility, a lot is happening in India. Let us create new networks of collaboration amongst our youth, our universities and our research communities. Technology and innovation have limitless power to provide solutions for Climate Change, for sustainable agriculture and for managing our forests. Let us work together for progress and prosperity of our peoples.
	India is taking lead to provide choices for a sustainable, secure and healthy world. Our efforts led to the United Nationsadopting a resolution with unanimous voice to celebrate the International Day of Yoga each year. Tomorrow, 21 June, is International Day of Yoga. I am happy that President Bouterse will be joining me in these celebrations. This will be for the first time since 2015 when the UN declared this special Day that two Heads of State would be celebrating yoga together. This will, indeed, be historic. Yoga is an ancient practice that promotes physical and spiritual wellbeing. It is about bringing a balance between your mind and body, between your thought and action. Come join us in our journey, a journey that as much belongs to you and, indeed, to the whole humanity I look forward to your participation at the Yoga Day activities in Paramaribo tomorrow.
	Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am amazed at your lingual diversity.  We Indians appreciate it more as we ourselves speak hundreds of languages and dialects. I have been informed that apart from Dutch and Sranan-tongo, you speak 20 different languages.  I must try my hand at some. In honour of the Hindustanis preserving Hindi in this country, I would like to say a few words in Hindi:


भाइयों और बहनों, आप सब से मिलकरमुझे सचमुच बहुत खुशी हो रही है।  यह बड़े ही सम्मान की बात है कि आपने यहां हिन्दी को जीवित रखा है। मैं गर्व से कह सकता हूं किइस नाते आप सब सूरीनाम में भारत की भाषा और संस्कृति को यहां के विभिन्न समुदायों के बीच फैलाने का काम बखूबी कर रहे हैं। इस प्रकार आपने अपने पूर्वजों के स्मृति को भी जीवित बनाए रखा है।इस के लिए आप सब बधाई के पात्र हैं। मैं आप सबसे आग्रह करता हूं कि इस कार्य को इसी तरह जारी रखिए। मैं कामना करता हूं कि यह उत्साहपूर्ण वातावरण सदैव कायम रहे।


	 And now a few words in Sranan-Tongo :ब्रादाआंगासीसामेंटैगउनुग्रानतांगी,मेंविंसउनवानस्‍वीटनेतिगोमोरोफारा।


 

            Thank you.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, participated in the 4th International Yoga Day celebrations in Paramaribo, Suriname today (June 21, 2018) along with the President of Suriname, Mr Desiré Delano Bouterse, the Vice President of Suriname, Mr Michael Ashwin Adhin and other dignitaries. 

Addressing the gathering, the President said that yoga is an ancient Indian tradition, but it does not belong to India alone. It is part of humanity’s intangible heritage. Millions across the world, in every continent and among all communities, have embraced yoga and interpreted yoga in their own way. The practice of yoga has had a beneficial impact on their bodies as well as their minds. Particularly in today’s world of stresses and lifestyle diseases, yoga can help all of us.

The President said that yoga embodies the symbiotic relationship of mind and body; and of thought and action. It promotes harmony between human beings and nature, a sentiment that is so much at home in the culture of Suriname. It promotes a holistic approach to health and wellbeing. The benefits of yoga must also spur us, in different countries and cultures, to explore traditional wisdom and consider how this could be useful for the modern age – or simply repackaged for our times. Many societies, including Suriname and India, have a wealth of traditional knowledge to offer.

The President said that along with Suriname and India, the fourth International Day of Yoga is being celebrated in practically every country in the world. Yoga is the ultimate expression of Indian soft power. It has won us love and affection among yoga practitioners in all corners of the planet, including in Suriname.

Later today, the President also laid the foundation stone of an Indian Cultural Centre in Paramaribo. The Indian Cultural Centre in Suriname will be dedicated to the promotion of Hindustani music and culture. Later, he will be leave for Cuba - the last leg of his visit to three nations.

Yesterday (June 20, 2018), the President attended a luncheon banquet hosted in his honour by the President of Suriname. He also addressed a community reception in Paramaribo. 

Speaking at the banquet, the President said that Suriname is part of the “New World’’. People and ideas from far and wide have mingled in Suriname. Whoever came to these shores soon became its own. He paid his deepest respects to the people of Suriname for this togetherness. He stated that he found it a truly humbling experience to have set foot in Suriname among the celebration of the 145th Anniversary of the arrival of Indians to Suriname.

The President said that India and Suriname have an engaging relationship. There is high potential to enhance trade and investment relations between the two countries. Agriculture, tourism, forestry, mining, energy and health are areas which we need to explore.

At the community reception yesterday (20.06.2018), the President said that the Hindustani community is a colourful part of the Surinamese fabric. He was happy to note that the Hindustani community has beautifully assimilated in the Surinamese society and yet, has preserved and kept their traditions and culture alive.

	I am happy to  address the India-Greece Business Forum.  First of all, I would like to thank Entreprise Greece for bringing us together this morning. I am  happy that  30 companies from India, led by the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture and the Trade Promotion Council of India are participating in this business engagement. 



	India and Greece are two ancient civilizations. Our economic, trade and cultural engagement go back over 2500 years. There was flourishing trade network between Greece and India as early as the 3rd century  BC.  With such rich history of engagement to inspire and build on, one cannot, perhaps, be more optimistic of the future of India-Greece trade and investment relations.   



	Yesterday, I had meaningful discussions with President Pavlopoulus on the way forward for India-Greece relations.  Both of us were convinced that there is immense potential to take India-Greece economic ties to a higher level. Similar sentiments were echoed in my interaction with Prime Minister Tsipras There are ample opportunities for our businesses to grow in the areas of trade, technology and investment.   



	Our bilateral trade at US Dollars 530 million is way below what had been achieved in the past, and what possibly could be a reasonable target for the future. As per market survey, with some efforts this can easily be made to cross US Dollars 1 billion in the next few years. My Government is keen to take lead in this effort. We have accepted the Greek Government’s invitation to be the “Honoured Country” at the ThessalonikiInternational Fair, Greece’s flagship business event, to be held in September 2019.  I hope this will   give a major boost to our bilateral trade. And while the two Governments are taking lead, we would expect Chambers of Commerce, Export Promotion Councils and Industry Groups to participate in the Thessaloniki fair in large numbers and make our partcipation a grand success.  


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,   


	There are clear complementarities  between the Indian and Greek economies. Both have their strong points. India happens to be the fastest growing major economy in the world with a growth rate of 7.7%.  We have undertaken  an ambitous plan to build next-generation infrastructure including 100 Smart Cities, airports, high-speed trains, highways and cyber connectivity. Last year, we built nearly 10,000 kilometers of national highways – that is 27 kilometers daily, almost double the speed few years  ago.  Our Sagarmala project proposes to develop a string of new ports including  5 major ports along our vast coastline. It has initiated a robust programme for portled industrialisation and connectivity. We have  also designated 111 rivers as National Waterways. In addition, we have opened coastal shipping  to international players. These measures will change the way we harness our maritime and inland river transport corridors in India. 


 


	To boost our manufacturing sector and Make In India programme, we have undertaken pathbreaking reforms. The most transformative of them has been the introduction of Goods and Services Tax which makes India into a single unified tax market  for the first time in its modern history.  We have repealed over   1400   outdated laws. Both the Central and State Governments have undertaken over 10,000 measures to make it easier for business to establish and grow in India.  Due to these reforms, we have jumped 42 places in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index in the last four years. As a result, Foreign Direct Investment flows into India have risen from US dollars 36 billion in 2013-14 to US dollars 60 billion in 2016-17.  All in all, India is set to be a 5 trillion dollar  economy by 2025 with the 3rd largest consumer market in the world. This sort of growth and demand opens up immense business  opportunities. 


 


	The Greek economy has global reputation in several  fields including shipping, tourism and agriculture. I would encourage greek shipping, agriculture, food processing, tourism, infrastructure, technology, defence and Start-up companies to look at investment and technology tie-up openings in India. There are lucrative opportunities for the Greek Shipping Industry in the Indian growth story. Greece is also a frontrunner in agriculture and food processing sectors. We have a target to double farm incomes by 2022 in India.  This represents major prospects for Greek agro-based companies. There are opportunities for us to collaborate in defence manufacturing, pharma, tourism, real-estate, entertainment, infrastructure and technology sectors as well. Both our countries have a strong renewable energy programme, especially in the solar energy sector. India’s target is to produce 175 Gigawatt of renewable power by 2022.  We should explore how we can leverage each other’s strength in the field. On the Start-up side, India has the third largest network in the world. I undertand that Greece also has a niche start-up sector in place.  We should explore opportunities in this sector as well. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,   


	Indian companies have a  global standing in the fields of IT, pharmaceuticals, infrastructure, automobiles, energy, technology,  entertainment and hospitality sectors. We have our business representatives from these sectors present here. There are still others here from agriculture, electronics, real-estate, footwear, mining and skill development  sectors.  I am hopeful they  would all  have an engaging day ahead with their greek counterparts. On skills side, I must highlight that we have an ambitious Skill India programme to train 150 million youth by 2022. Greece with its proven capacity in the tourism sector could be a potential partner for developing skills for the hospitality sector in India. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,   


	Opportunities before us are manifold. It is for us  to  see how we convert them into real business prospects. I wish the participants in this business engagement a fruitful day of deliberations and discussions.  


 

Thank you.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed a gathering of diplomats, policymakers and academics in Athens today (June 19, 2018) on the subject “India and Europe in a Changing World”. The event was organised by the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy (ELIAMEP) – a leading foreign policy think tank in Greece and in Europe.

The President said that India is committed to world peace. He said that India sees peace not just as the absence of conflict but as a reflection of sustainable development and indeed of any effort that anticipates and prevents strife and suffering. When we work for combating climate change, we contribute to world peace. When we assist other developing countries, as per their priorities, and strive for a less unequal world we contribute to world peace. When we rescue and evacuate not just our own citizens from troubled regions, but those of 40 other countries – as we did during the Yemen crisis of 2015 – we contribute to world peace. When we put considerable troops and resources at the disposal of United Nations peacekeeping operations, we contribute to world peace. 

President said that radicalisation and terrorism are pressing global concerns. Pockets of instability and extremism can be found in the region to Europe’s east and India’s west. They are a worry for both Europe and India. Promotion of terrorism by state and non-state actors; extremism in a variety of forms and rooted in senseless hate; the proliferation of sensitive weapons; the use of regular communication and financial channels by terror groups – these pose a challenge to not one nation or the other but to all humanity. 

The President said that India and the EU must persuade the world to not distinguish between so-called “good” and “bad” terrorists, to shame and sanction state sponsors of terrorism, and to strengthen multilateral platforms such as the Financial Action Task Force and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. He expressed India’s willingness to share its domestic experiences and success stories in a manner that may be useful to EU.

On clean energy and climate change, the President said that India and the EU are united in their commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement. India is scaling up the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix. This will go up from the current 31 per cent to 53 per cent by 2027. We are targeting 175 gigawatts of renewable energy, of which 100 gigawatts will be solar energy, he said. The President invited Greece to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA). He also expressed happiness at the European Investment Bank’s willingness to mobilise finance for affordable solar energy projects in ISA member countries.

The EU is among India’s largest trading partners. President said that EU is a critical source of investment and technology, especially for sustainability programmes. Indian companies are significant investors in the EU, in industries as far apart as pharmaceuticals and automobile components. President Kovind said that India remains committed to an India-EU Broad-based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), to be achieved in a generous spirit of mutual accommodation and of pragmatism.

Earlier in the day, the President addressed the India – Greek Business Forum meeting in Athens.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India-Greek bilateral trade at US Dollars 530 million is way below its potential. With some efforts this can easily be made to cross US Dollars 1 billion in the next few years and India is keen to take lead in this effort.

The President said that there are clear complementarities between the Indian and Greek economies. He urged Greek shipping, agriculture, food processing, tourism, infrastructure, technology, defence and Start-up companies to look at investment and technology tie-up openings in India. He stated that there are lucrative opportunities for the Greek Shipping Industry in India's ambitious Sagarmala project. He also touched upon the opportunities to collaborate in defence manufacturing, pharma, tourism, real-estate, entertainment, infrastructure and technology sectors as well.

Yesterday evening (June 18, 2018), the President attended a banquet hosted in his honour by the President of Greece. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that both India and Greece have a common stake in promoting multilateralism and global peace and security. He thanked the Government of Greece for its consistent support for India’s candidature for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. He also highlighted the possibility of collaborating in areas of renewable energy and climate change. 

Later in the day (June 19, 2018), the President departed for Suriname – the second leg of his visit to three countries – Greece, Suriname and Cuba.

During his meeting with the Greek President and the delegation level talks, President Kovind emphasized the age-old civilizational ties between the two nations. The President said that India and Greece shared values of democracy, rule of law and multi-cultural ethos, and these have added depth to our bilateral and multilateral engagements. The President expressed that India was keen to deepen the ongoing co-operation with Greece especially in political and economic fields.

President Kovind highlighted India’s commitment to promote trade and investment engagement between the two nations. He stated that bilateral trade between the two countries of US dollar 530 million was below potential and more efforts must be made to expand and diversify trade between the two countries. He informed the Greek delegation that India had accepted the invitation to participate in the prestigious Thessaloniki International Fair, 2019 as the “Honoured Country”.

He also apprised the Greek delegation of the steps taken by India to improve business climate in the country and said that India wished to collaborate with the Greek companies to become partners in the growth story of India. In particular, India could benefit from expertise of Greece in areas such as Shipping, Food and Dairy, and Tourism. On the other hand Indian companies especially in the areas of pharma, IT, agriculture, real estate, infrastructure and start-ups are keen to establish presence in Greece.

India also thanked Greece for its support for India’s candidature for a non-permanent seat in the UN Security Council and for membership to the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

On the subject of India-Greece cultural ties, the President said that as two ancient civilizations that have interacted with each other for centuries, we have a deep cultural understanding of each other. He also said that the two countries should work together to develop Greek and Indian traditional medicinal practices as healthcare options for people.

After the delegation level talks, the President also met the Prime Minister of Greece Mr Alexis Tsipras and the two leaders discussed different issues of mutual interest to both nations. Later, Mr Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Leader of Opposition of the Hellenic Republic also called on the President.

During the day, three Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) were signed- (i) the MoU between Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and National Quality Infrastructure System/Hellenic Organization for Standardization on Cooperation in the Fields of Standardization; (ii) MoU between Foreign Service Institute (FSI), India and Diplomatic Academy, Greece on Cooperation in Diplomatic Training and (iii) the Programme of Cultural Cooperation for the year 2018-2020.

Later in the evening, the President will lay a wreath at the Phaleron Indian Cremation Memorial where the remains of the 74 soldiers of undivided India who sacrificed their lives during World War II were laid to rest. The President will also attend a State Banquet hosted by the President of Greece.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, reached Greece yesterday evening (June 16, 2018) on the first leg of his 3 - nation State Visit to – Greece, Suriname and Cuba. 

Today (June 17, 2018), the President addressed an impressive gathering of Indian community in Athens at a reception hosted by the Ambassador of India in Greece, Ms Shamma Jain.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Greece and India are ancient civilizations having old and deep relations. Both nations greatly respect the democratic values followed by each other. These similarities have ensured that relations between the two countries have remained strong over the years. He expressed confidence that his visit, which is a visit by an Indian President after around 11 years, will further strengthen these relations. 

The President emphasized the strong economic potential between the two nations across a variety of areas. He said that Greece has expertise in the fields of agriculture, food and dairy technology, and shipping whereas India is extensively expanding its capacity in the areas such as infrastructure, supply chain, energy, etc. He said that the two nations have immense potential for working together. He stated that Greek companies have been active in India. He noted that Indian businessmen and companies have also started setting up enterprises in Greece, and thus are generating employment opportunities in Greece. 

Addressing the Indian community, the President said that we are proud of our overseas Indians and their success. He said that that today there are plenty of opportunities for business, innovation and investment in India. He stated that Indian diaspora has an emotional connection with India and they will continue to make their contribution towards the development of India. 

The President said that there is considerable scope for increasing investment and trade between India and Greece. The two countries will benefit greatly from a mutual partnership. He said that the Indian community in Greece has an important role in strengthening the economic relations between the two countries. He stated that while there is an Indian ambassador in Greece appointed by the Government of India to look after our interests. But according to him, it is each member of the Indian community in Greece who is a cultural ambassador of India. He urged the community to help enhance economic, cultural and people-to-people links between the two countries. 

Earlier in the day, emphasizing India’s deep respect for the age old civilization of Greece, the President visited the Acropolis as well as the Panathenaic Olympic Stadium and Temple of Zeus. 

Tomorrow (June 18, 2018), the President will hold bilateral meetings with the Greek leadership and lead the India-Greece delegation level talks.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the National Highway from Matabari to Sabroom in Udaipur, Tripura today (June 7, 2018). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said a state such as Tripura can progress with a combination of its human talent and infrastructure advance. Development of the Northeast is high on the Government of India’s list of priorities. Road projects covering a length of 5,200 km are being constructed in the region to enhance connectivity. The Bharatmala project too is giving special attention to the Northeast. As part of these programmes, 500 km of roads are being constructed in Tripura. He expressed confidence that Tripura will develop rapidly after the completion of these projects.

The President noted that there is immense potential for tourism in Tripura and this too will be helped by connectivity projects. The state’s natural beauty, lush green forests and cultural heritage is a draw for domestic and international tourists. Better rail and road connectivity will increase tourism and ancillary economic activity in the state. The President also visited the Matabari Temple complex in Udaipur and laid the foundation stone for its re-development and augmentation as a centre for religious tourism.

In the evening, the President attended a civic reception hosted in his honour by the State Government. At the reception in Agartala, he formally declared the “Queen Pineapple” as the state fruit of Tripura.

Addressing the gathering, the President said that only a few days ago, the first consignment of the Queen Pineapple had been exported to West Asia. He said this was an important step in linking Tripura and the Northeast region with global trade. He expressed hope that pineapples from Tripura will reach markets across the country and abroad, especially in neighbouring countries.

The President emphasised that the Northeast and Tripura have a pivotal place in India’s Act East Policy. This will help enhance business with ASEAN countries and serve to realise Tripura’s economic potential.

The President said that Tripura has abundant forest resources. The conservation and sustainable use of forests, as well as providing assistance to tribal communities that are dependent on forests for their livelihood, is extremely important. The people of Tripura present a model for the country as to the harmonious balance between human livelihood needs and natural heritage.

The President said that the job for the Indian Foreign Service Officers is clearly laid out. They have to maintain robust relations with all our friends and partners to fashion a secure and prosperous environment and meet our developmental aspirations. They have to engage, contest and reconstruct global governance structures that adequately reflect and accommodate our interests.

                The two-day 49th Conference of Governors concluded at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (June 5, 2018). 

In his closing remarks, the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, expressed satisfaction that participants at the Conference contributed to meaningful discussions. He was confident the deliberations would strengthen our national effort to improve the lives of every Indian.

The President noted that today (June 5) is World Environment Day. The approach of ‘Think Global, Act Local’ is considered effective for environment protection. Keeping in mind the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Accord and the International Solar Alliance, local and state-level contributions are very important to achieving national goals. The Directive Principles of our Constitution specifically mention issues of the environment and conservation of forests and wildlife. In this context, Governors can make efforts to develop Raj Bhavan complexes and state universities as an environmental ideal.

The President said that Raj Bhavans must take the lead in adopting modern technology and methods. By using a wide variety of IT initiatives, including real-time dashboards, Raj Bhavans can create a demonstration effect and motivate other institutions.

The President said that Governors can inspire universities towards USR (University Social Responsibility). University students should visit villages at regular intervals. They should engage with residents of the village in regard to cleanliness, literacy, immunisation and nutrition programmes. Governors could hold discussions with Vice Chancellors to make the ‘Swachhta Internship’ programme more effective.

The President urged Governors to convene meetings of Vice Chancellors of state universities from time to time. He was happy that some Governors were already doing this. He emphasised that the agenda of such conferences could be decided in consultation with the VCs. And to find quick solutions, representatives of State Education and Finance Departments, as well as officials from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, the UGC and other institutions, could be invited.

The Vice President, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs also addressed the concluding session of the Conference. Earlier in the day, the Conference of Governors discussed ideas on the commemoration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Presentations were made on the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan and Swachhata Internship. Governors/Lt. Governors gave their suggestions.

	A very warm welcome to all of you to Rashtrapati Bhavan and to the 49th Conference of Governors. I would especially like to welcome the Governor of Madhya Pradesh, Smt Anandiben Patel, the Governor of Odisha, Professor Ganeshi Lal, and the Governor of Mizoram, Shri K. Rajasekharan, who are participating in the Conference for the first time. 


 


	This Conference is held annually, generally towards the beginning of the year. However, the 2017 Conference could only be held in the month of October. Hence this year’s Conference is taking place about seven months after the previous one. Such Conferences provide an opportunity for Governors to interact and have meaningful discussions with the Vice President, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Home Affairs, members of the Council of Ministers, the Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog and senior officials of the Government, all of whom are participating in the Conference. We will be discussing important issues and charting out the future course of action for these. In this context, the Conference of Governors holds a distinct significance.


 


	As per the Constitution, the post of Governor has an exalted place in the scheme of governance. The Governor is a mentor and guide to the state government and an important link in the federal structure. The people of the state view the office of the Governor and the Raj Bhavan as a fount of ideals and values.


 


	In the previous Conference, we had discussed issues related to “Infrastructure”, “Public services”, and “Higher Education in the States and Skill Development”. Extremely useful and valuable suggestions were received from all of you.


 


	As agreed to at the previous Conference, a Committee of Governors was constituted. The Committee submitted its report in January 2018. The report envisages the role of Governors as “Change Agents” in society. There will be a discussion on the actions taken on this report in session IV today. 


 


	While drafting the agenda for this year's Conference, the central focus has been to sensitise all of you to the programmes being implemented for the benefit of  those of our fellow citizens who have been left behind in our development journey, and to hold an in depth discussion on these programmes.  One hundred and fifteen (115) Aspirational Districts, across various states, have committed themselves to speedy development. There will be a presentation and discussion on the schemes being implemented in these districts. Understanding this background will help you guide a spectrum of stakeholders in their efforts to work for the welfare of the poor, women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, farmers and young people. There are approximately 100 million people in our country who belong to the Scheduled Tribes. A majority of this population lives in regions that are covered under the Fifth and Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India. As Governors you can help in the shaping of a road map for the betterment of lives of our fellow citizens, who have not benefited as much as expected from our development journey.


 


	India is blessed with the largest youth population in the world. As Governors, you are guardians of our youth – in the sense that you can inspire young people to absorb the right moral values and you can motivate them to both pursue modern education and remain sensitive to our Indian ethos.


 

 


	As had been mentioned in the previous Conference of Governors, 69 per cent of all universities in our country come under the purview of state governments. About 94 per cent of students enrolled for higher education study in these universities. You are the Chancellors of most of these universities. In your capacity as Chancellors of state universities, it is for you to provide the necessary impetus and inspiration to these institutions and to enhance the level of scholarship. With the instruments of your office and with your rich experience in public life, you are ideally equipped for this responsibility. You can help ensure that admissions of students and appointments of teachers in state universities are completed well in time and in a transparent manner. You can also help ensure that examinations, declaration of results and convocations take place as scheduled. It is for you to inspire state universities to maintain this discipline and integrity. In a fast changing, globalised environment, it is equally essential to keep the academic curriculum updated so as to maintain the contemporary relevance of education. As Governors of your states, it is for you to engage the youth and motivate them to use their academic achievements for the welfare of society and of our country. We need to strive collectively for a better life for our coming generations.


 


	The Government of India has decided to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi over a 24-month period commencing October 2, 2018. A National Committee chaired by the President has been constituted for this purpose. The first meeting of the National Committee was held on May 2, 2018, in the Rashtrapati Bhavan complex. Many noteworthy suggestions were received during the meeting. This Conference has an entire session dedicated to discussing the commemoration of the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation. As we know, Gandhiji believed in constructive and actionable programmes that made a difference to the lives of ordinary people. There would be no better way to cherish his memory than to strive for genuine and meaningful social transformation. Gandhiji gave us an unfailing talisman. He said that to judge the efficacy of any action we contemplate, we should ask ourselves if it would be of help to the weakest, poorest and most disadvantaged person we know. We must keep this talisman in mind and I would welcome suggestions from all of you to put Gandhiji’s ideals and values into practice.


 


	I am confident that the presence and the contributions of the Vice President, and of the Prime Minister, the Minister of Home Affairs and their senior ministerial colleagues will make the deliberations of this Conference even more meaningful. All of you have rich experience in public life. I am confident that all of you will give valuable suggestions during this Conference. The deliberations will help us in our efforts to build a society marked by sensitivity, fraternity and inclusion. 


 


	With these words, Ladies and Gentlemen, I declare the Conference of Governors 2018 open. I request the Minister of Home Affairs to take forward the proceedings.


 

Thank you,  

Jai Hind!

                The six women officers comprising the crew of INSV Tarini, who recently completed a circumnavigation of the globe, called on  the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (June 1, 2018).

 

Welcoming the women officers to Rashtrapati Bhavan, the President said that the expedition they undertook was full of challenges - sailing across the world in the face of rough weather and rough seas and covering over 20,000 nautical-miles in 194 days of sailing. Their success exemplifies a never-give-up attitude, determination, teamwork, mental and physical fitness and professional excellence.

 

The President said the crew’s success is not just its own. It belongs to and inspires each girl child in our country. This success exemplifies the power of women. 

 

The expedition aboard INSV Tarini was flagged off on September 10, 2017 from Goa and ended with the return to Goa on May 10, 2018. The vessel was skippered by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi, and the crew comprised Lieutenant Commanders Pratibha Jamwal, P Swathi, B Aishwarya and Lieutenants S Vijaya Devi and Payal Gupta.

 

During its 254 day voyage (including stopovers), the vessel visited Australia, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands (UK), South Africa and Mauritius. The crew also collated and updated meteorological, ocean and wave data on a regular basis for accurate weather forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), and monitored and reported marine pollution on the high seas.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that every citizen must play an active role in nation building. People are not merely recipients or beneficiaries but active agents of change, he said while addressing the gathering on the occasion of 125th Birth Anniversary of Prof. Mahalanobis in Kolkata, today. Minister of Statistics and Programme Implementation in the Government of India, Shri D. V. Sadananda Gowda, Minister of Information & Technology, IT, Govt. of West Bengal Shri Bratya Basu, and other dignitaries were present at the venue. 

 

Vice President called Prof. Mahalanobis an iconic visionary who introduced the Indian sub-continent to the field of statistics. His vision, focus, and his application-driven research in the field of statistics, is the bedrock of the modern official statistical system in practice in our country today, he said.

 

The Vice President said that over 65% of our population is under 35 years of age and it is crucial to turn this ‘potential’ asset into and ‘actual’ asset. If we fail to tap into this reservoir of human resources and turn it into human capital, it will be a missed opportunity and the country would have to cope with a number of socio-economic consequences including poverty inequality, social unrest and unsustainable growth, he said.

 

We need to equip this young population with the skills, knowledge and attitude required for the knowledge economy of the twenty first century to realize the demographic dividend, he said.

 

The Vice President said that statistics is truly the backbone of good governance. It is absolutely essential for planning and indispensible for monitoring and evaluation. We need data to improve the quality of life and to make informed choices, we need statistics, we need tools to analyze and synthesize, he said.

 

The Vice President said that India has a tradition that was built by numerous mathematical geniuses like Bhaskaracharya, Aryabhata and Srinivasa Ramanujan. There is a need to continue this tradition of excellence and strengthen the quality of mathematics teaching at school, college and University level, he added.

 

 

 

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

 

“It is a pleasure to attend the function celebrating the 125thbirth anniversary of the iconic visionary who introduced the Indian sub-continent to the field of statistics. Prof. Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis was not only a great scholar but also an esteemed Institution-builder. He visualized this great institution, the Indian Statistical Institute, as early as 1931. 

He was also the architect of the national sample survey organisation.  His vision, his focus, and above all his application-driven research in the field of statistics is the bedrock of the modern official statistical system in practice in our country today. 

Prof. Mahalanobis was a versatile genius.  Along with enriching statistics, Prof. Mahalanobis had also introduced the idea of using statistics as a key tool for national development and social empowerment. With his all encompassing vision, statistics found numerous applications in the fields of social sciences, biological sciences and earth sciences. 

Prof. Mahalanobis was the first to bring the computer to India, thus laying the foundation of fabrication of computers in our country. I am delighted to note that this is the first institute in the country to start a formal training programme in computer science under the leadership of this great visionary. It is an apt way to celebrate the legacy of the legendary personality who first introduced the concept of statistical quality control, fundamental to the manufacturing sector of India.

Sisters and Brothers, 

I am reminded of Prof. Mahalanobis’s famous article ‘Why Statistics’ written in the 1950’s. Quoting Kautilya’s ‘Arthasastra’, he explains how, through a rich and precise tradition of statistical measures that were practiced in ancient India, we can rediscover a solid foundation of what we claim today as good governance. His thoughts on development in post-independent India on issues such as food safety, national security, industrial development, and the concept of national income are so pertinent and relevant even today. 

I would like to draw your attention to a significant line in this article, Prof. Mahalanobis says “Our vast population is a great asset, but only in a potential form.” This observation is relevant even today. Over 65% of our population is under 35 years of age.  This demographic statistics is significant if we can turn this ‘potential’ asset into and ‘actual’ asset.  We cannot realize the demographic dividend unless we equip this population with the skills knowledge and attitude required for the knowledge economy of the twenty first century. If we fail to tap into this reservoir of human resources and turn it into human capital, it will be a missed opportunity and the country would have to cope with a number of socio-economic consequences including poverty inequality, social unrest and unsustainable growth.

I am also struck by another prophetic statement by Prof. Mahalanobis. He had said “It is a matter for serious thought whether or not the wiser policy would be to rally the common man into a great effort for national welfare. We look to our political leaders for guidance, decision, and action.”

Prof. Mahalanobis’s vision was democratic, people centric and fully recognized the critical role of each individual in the country in nation building.

People are not merely recipients or beneficiaries but active agents of change.  Mass movements that channel people’s energies towards constructive ends have been a part of national development strategy.  We have been witness to the community development programes, total literacy campaigns, pulse polio programe, green revolution, white revolution and the recent Swacch Bharat programme.  This is what Prof. Mahalanobis talked about at the beginning of our country’s five year plans.

This institute owes its existence to the far-sighted vision of this great son of modern India. While this Institute was blooming, Prof. Mahalanobis had started the journal ‘Sankhya', an Indian journal of Statistics. Such was the influence of Prof. Mahalanobis that his invited statesmen and scientists formed a reputed congregation of great scholars and leaders who decided to stay on in this campus, only to enrich the institute and its human resources.  

Of all the lessons we can learn from the life of a multifaceted visionary such as Prof. Mahalanobis, the greatest lesson is the ability to adopt an objective view to a problem, be it social or scientific. The need of the hour is to assess the importance and impact of a problem in a principled and quantitative manner.  

Statistics gives us an ability to objectively measure a phenomenon. 

It enables us to make evidence based decisions. 

It enables us to examine past trends and make predictions about the future. 

It enables us to understand different dimensions of everyday life from education levels to health status, from air quality to water purity, from production to productivity, from income to expenditure. 

We cannot think of a situation in which we don’t use numbers, where we don’t quantify. 

Counting and accounting is part of our daily life. 

Data is useful. The process of collection of data analyzing and synthesizing gives us new insights. 

We move away from mere opinions or guesswork to getting closer to reality. Statistics provides the essential tools for enhancing this objective appreciation of reality. 

Statistics is truly the backbone of good governance. 

It is absolutely essential for planning and indispensible for monitoring and evaluation.

Sisters & Brothers,

As we remember this great stalwart who gave us new statistical measures and a model of development that has left an indelible footprint on the sands of Indian history, we should recall with legitimate pride the grand mathematical tradition of India of which he is a shining lighthouse. 

It is a tradition that gave the concept of zero to the world.

It is a tradition that was built by numerous mathematical geniuses like Bhaskaracharya, Aryabhata and Srinivasa Ramanujan. 

We need to continue this tradition of excellence. 

We should strengthen the quality of mathematics teaching at school, college and University level.

Sisters and Brothers,

We live in a world in which technology has become all-pervasive. 

We live in a world in which knowledge explosion, information overload and data-driven lives have become common place. 

Statistics and big data management along with artificial intelligence will play an even more significant role in the years to come. 

We need to harness the power of computing, communication and robotics to improve the quality of life. 

This requires wisdom. 

It requires each one of us to make wise choices. 

How do we use these tools once we acquire them? 

We must remind ourselves that in the ultimate analysis what ultimately counts is not merely what we can count but what we experience. 

To improve the quality of life and to make informed choices, we need data, we need statistics, we need tools to analyze and synthesize. 

How do we apply this knowledge is entirely up to us. Let me conclude in this context, with the wise advice of Prof. Mahalanobis we are remembering today on his 125th birth anniversary

“It is not enough to have a large number of scientists in research institutes publishing many papers most of which may be useless and therefore called pure research, but which have no connection with economic growth. ….. Therefore, today, I should like to say to our young graduates and to my colleagues, our teachers and our students, and also to our guests from neighbouring countries which are underdeveloped, that you must realize that the essential need is the most difficult transition of lifting our country into the modern age by establishing a sound and growing tradition of science. This is the task which is before us, nothing less would be enough.”

As we dream of a New India and are working had to make it a reality, let us take inspiration from the lives of great India who were pathfinders.

Great visionaries like Prof. Mahalanobis give us the courage to dream big, set high benchmarks and achieve them through untiring effort. 

As Swami Vivekananda had exhorted many years ago echoing the Upanishadic message “Spring up, get enlightened and do not stop till you reach the goal”.

That is the spirit of excellence, spirit of scientific enquiry and spirit of using out knowledge for enhancing the quality of life that should drive us all to a new trajectory.

I look forward to the days ahead when all of us use the glorious past illumined by legends like Prof. Mahalanobis as a springboard for the big leap forward.

Thank you for inviting me to pay homage to one of the illustrious sons of modern India.”

Jai Hind

He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Facility for Research in Experimental Nuclear Astrophysics (FRENA) at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata, today. Shri  Bratya Basu, Hon’ble Minister of Information & Technology, IT, Govt. of West Bengal  and other dignitaries were present at the venue 

The Vice President said that one should always be thankful Farmers, Scientists and soldiers for their service to the nation. We must recognize and respect them for their great service- Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan & Jai Vigyan, he said.

The Vice President said that Professor Meghnad Saha was a great astrophysicist, visionary and science reformer and said that his visionary genius is evident in the reorganization of the physics syllabus of the university and plans to build a cyclotron.  

The Vice President said that Prof. Saha’s initiative to introduce the pre-PhD course, the first of its kind in the country to train M.Sc students for PhD was truly impressive. It is really noteworthy that only recently the UGC has realized the importance of such a bridging course and made it mandatory for all universities, he said.

The Vice President went around the research facilities in the institute and lauded the accomplishments of scientists, faculty members. My interaction with the members of the institute convinced me that there is so much that has been accomplished and that the grand tradition of learning, research, teaching and innovating will continue with renewed vigour and persistent passion, he said.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:   



SPEECH BY HON’BLE VICE PRESIDENT OF INDIA AT SAHA INSTITUTE OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS ON 28THJUNE 2018 

Sisters & Brothers, 

I am pleased to be with all of you today in an institution that was founded by Professor Meghnad Saha – a great astrophysicist, visionary and science reformer of India and the founder director of this institute. I have gained immensely from the interaction with all of you and have learnt more about the work you are doing and the inspiration you derive from the founder’s work. 

Prof. Saha was the first person in the country to initiate courses in nuclear physics in 1938. 

Following the discovery of nuclear fission in 1939, Prof Saha had foreseen an immense potential of nuclear physics in the country. 

His visionary genius is evident in the reorganization of the physics syllabus of the university and plans to build a cyclotron. He accomplished this path-breaking task with a generous grant from the Dorabji Tata Trust. 

It is truly remarkable that the construction of the cyclotron began in 1941, long before the foundation of the Department of Atomic Energy by the Government of India in 1954. 

After 1940, the rapid growth of nuclear physics in the world inspired Prof Saha to propose an independent institute with close link to the university. That is the genesis of this Institute. Institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) was formed in 1949, which was later renamed as Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP) after the untimely death of Prof Saha in 1956. 

I am privileged to visit this historical institute which was formally inaugurated by Madame Irene Joliot Curie, a Nobel Prize winner and daughter of the famous scientist and Nobel laureate Marie Curie, on January 11, 1950. 

I am glad to learn about the pioneering work done by Prof. Saha. His introduction of innovative initiatives like the pre-PhD course, the first of its kind in the country to train M.Sc students for PhD is truly impressive. 

It is really noteworthy that only recently the UGC has realized the importance of such a bridging course and made it mandatory for all universities. 

You have today given me an excellent glimpse into how young scientists are being encouraged by your institute to take up scientific research and how this has been done over the past 67 years. With about 40 students being inducted into the research & teaching program through a nation-wide selection test, it is heartening that scientists are being mentored and many of them are participating in large international collaborations in CERN, Geneva. 

It is good to see that you are focusing on several outreach programs, and school and college level students are participating in debates, quiz, visit to the institute laboratories, essay competitions and popular lectures. 

I notice that you have not confined yourself to merely urban areas and have conducted programmes even in the remote areas of West Bengal. 

I am glad that the journey which started around the design and development of a small cyclotron initiated by Prof. Saha has traversed a long path, and you are now setting up a facility for Research in Experimental Nuclear Astrophysics (FRENA) which will unravel some more mysteries of the Universe. 

I must say that I am quite impressed by the range of programmes taken up by this centre including an underground laboratory named as Jaduguda Underground Science Laboratory (JUSL) at the existingUranium mines in Jharkhand. 

Dear sisters and brothers 

I am filled with a sense of optimism for the future as I see about 15 young scientists with diverse skills and backgrounds joining hands for working on novel multidisciplinary project related to cancer cells and therapeutic strategies. 

Similarly your focus on encouraging young students to become scientists is a welcome initiative. The Vigyan Prathiba programme launched by you on 31st July 2017 would undoubtedly train and motivate school students from class 8 onward to become scientists. 

All in all, my interaction with you today in this historic institute convinces me that there is so much that has been accomplished and that the grand tradition of learning, research, teaching and innovating will continue with renewed vigour and persistent passion. 

My good wishes to the Director and entire faculty, the researchers and students who are keeping the light of learning burning bright. 

May your path be full of well earned success and if at all there are any failures, as they are bound to be in any endeavour, I do hope you will take them as stepping stones for leaping higher. 

I wish you all the very best in your endeavours.

 

       Jai Hind

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has asked policy makers to put in efforts to make cancer treatment affordable. Addressing the gathering after inaugurating the new State Cancer Institute Block at Kidwai Cancer Institute, Bengaluru in Karnataka today, he expressed concern over the rising cost of cancer treatment. Governor of Karnataka, Shri Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala, Chief Minister of Karnataka, Shri H.D. Kumaraswamy and other dignitaries were present at the venue.

 

Vice President called for strengthening of preventive, curative and palliative care programmes at national and regional levels to combat the rising incidence of cancer.

No doubt, huge investments are needed for trained man power and equipment necessary for offering optimal treatment, but the government should explore various policy alternatives that would make cancer treatment affordable, he said.

 

The Vice President asked doctors to establish a regular communication with the patients, especially in a dreaded disease like cancer. Patients and their families need comfort. They need palliative care and more importantly kind words that make the pain bearable, he said. 

Empathy and patience, care and compassion are qualities that can infuse hope in the hearts of patients and calm the troubled minds of the families, he said.

The Vice President stressed on the need to create greater awareness on the dangers of pollution, obesity, harmful use of tobacco, betel nuts and alcohol, leading sedentary lifestyle, eating junk and other foods linked to cancer. It is also equally important to take up periodic screening of people, especially those at risk of developing cancer.

The Vice President asked policy makers to evolve effective cancer prevention strategies and said that there is a need for making increased investments in the area of cancer prevention research. 

We need to establish cancer units for early detection, diagnosis, treatment and to provide palliative care in rural areas where about 70 per cent of our population resides. We need to have more medical and para-medical professionals in this field of medicine, he said.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

Speech of Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, Hon’ble Vice President of India at the inauguration of new State Cancer Institute Block at Kidwai Cancer Institute, Bengaluru

 

 

Dear sisters and brothers,

At the outset, let me express my appreciation for establishing new Cancer Institute Block at the prestigious Kidwai Cancer Institute in Bangalore to offer the latest and best treatment to cancer patients.

With the spread of cancer continuing unabated, there is a need for more exclusive cancer treatment facilities across the country.

It is indeed a matter of serious concern for all of us that the incidence of cancer is increasing in the country. Although preventive, curative and palliative care programmes have been initiated at national and regional levels, these measures seem to be too negligible for combating the spread of cancer.

Documented findings reveal mammoth proportions of cancer growth which warrants not only scientific, but also sustained and consistent efforts with appropriate planning, monitoring and evaluation of cancer control programmes.

While the incidence of cancer has been increasing worldwide, developing nations like India are showing steep increase over the years. In India, it is estimated that there are about 30 lakh cases of cancer at any particular point of time with 10 lakh new cases occurring every year. About 5 lakh deaths occur annually in the country due to cancer in India.

According to projections of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in 2016, the total number of new cases is expected to touch 17.3 lakh by 2020. It has been estimated that the number of deaths due to cancer is likely to reach 8.8 lakh cases by 2020. Breast cancer was the most common among women, while the incidence of mouth cancer was highest among men.  Clearly, this is a major healthcare challenge that needs to be adequately and effectively addressed.

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

The data regarding cancer in India show that only 12.5 per cent of patients come for treatment in the early stages of the disease. This clearly indicates the need for greater awareness and early detection.

The genetic make-up of an individual, environment, dietary habits, hygiene and the modern day lifestyle are affecting the health of individuals.

From the data available from National Cancer Registry Programme of ICMR, it has been estimated that on an average one among every 15 men and one among every 12 women in the urban centres could develop cancer in their lifetime.  It is important, therefore, to create greater awareness on the dangers of pollution, obesity, harmful use of tobacco, betel nuts and alcohol; leading sedentary lifestyle, eating junk and other foods linked to cancer. It is also equally important to take up periodic screening of people, especially those at risk of developing cancer.

Accurate data helps understand the magnitude as well as various dimensions of the problem. I am glad that efforts have been made by the ICMR to make cancer a notifiable disease on a national basis with the objective of generating authentic data to enable proper diagnosis, treatment and targeted interventions for cancer control. Availability of reliable scientific data will also enable planners and policymakers to evolve effective cancer prevention strategies. At the same time, there is a need for making increased investments in the area of cancer prevention research. 

I am pleased that the Government of Karnataka has already declared cancer as a notifiable disease. This will go a long way in correctly understanding the magnitude of the disease in the state and formulating a better more targeted cancer care policy.

As I had mentioned earlier, it is a matter of great concern that a vast majority of the cancer patients are reporting at cancer treatment centres when the disease is manifesting itself in an advanced stage. Lack of awareness and several other socio-economic factors, could be the reason for the delay in seeking medical intervention.

While cancer hospitals and treatment facilities are available in many urban areas, we need to establish cancer units for early detection, diagnosis, treatment and to provide palliative care in rural areas where about 70 per cent of our population resides. We need to have more medical and para-medical professionals in this field of medicine.

A major concern for all stakeholders involved in the health sector is the cost of treatment. No doubt, huge investments are needed for trained man power and equipments necessary for offering optimal treatment, but the government should explore various policy alternatives that would make cancer treatment affordable.

It should be noted that increased life expectancy has exposed more population to cancer risks. It is, therefore, extremely important for creating greater awareness on cancer and the associated risks. Adequate attention has to be paid to preventive aspects and promotion of healthy lifestyles.

Apart from initiating measures to establish oncology wings in various medical colleges, I am happy that the Central Government has upgraded several Regional Cancer Centres into State Cancer Institutes by providing adequate funds to build infrastructure, procure state of art equipments for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. One of the beneficiaries of this national initiative is the State of Karnataka which has successfully upgraded the cancer care facilities at Kidwai Cancer Institute.

It is a matter of great satisfaction that this Institute, which has been in existence for the past four decades, has emerged as one of the premiere Regional Cancer Centres for Treatment and Research in the country. I am happy that it is catering not only to people of Karnataka but also to patients from other parts of India, including those from north eastern states.

Any scientific and medical institution can grow as a centre of excellence only if it keeps pace with the latest advances in the field.

Its faculty and staff must constantly strive to update their knowledge and professional expertise.  They should keep researching and add to the corpus of knowledge.

The institutional ethos should be shaped by the managers in such a way that patients get world class treatment in a humane, caring environment. 

Physical infrastructure is essential and needs periodical upgradation and regular maintenance.

I am happy that this institute has taken a major leap in extending the state of art cancer treatment through robotic surgery and hi-tech linear accelerator facilities, I am sure that it will help the ailing poor cancer patients and their families in combating cancer and bouncing back to good health.

Beyond the physical infrastructure and equipment, what is crucial is the communication with the patients. 

Especially in a dreaded disease like cancer the patients and the families need comfort. 

They need palliative care and more importantly kind words that make the pain bearable. 

Empathy and patience, care and compassion are qualities that can infuse hope in the hearts of patients and calm the troubled minds of the families.

I am happy to see this institution grow and develop into a centre of excellence. I compliment the management, the doctors and the entire staff for serving the people who seek medical help and advise.

I wish you all a satisfying professional life in the service of humanity.

 

JAI HIND!

                Dear Sisters and Brothers, 

I am happy to launch this collection of essays and lectures by Dr. R.P. Dhokalia. 

The thrust of the book is on the connection between human rights and the intrinsic and core human values which in turn manifest in the cultural ethos of a society. 

Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been the basis for the formulation of many provisions in the Constitutions of many countries around the world including India.  Over the last seven decades, there has been a tremendous proliferation of laws in all countries with focus on rights of human beings.

Notwithstanding the plethora of laws recognizing human rights, there is no country in the world where these human rights are not violated in one form or another and in varying degrees. 

The author has therefore highlighted at the outset that there should be an equally important focus on fundamental duties as well as on nurturing the cultural ethos. He feels that human rights and human values are easiest to protect if they become a part of the cultural ethos. 

The author believes that core human values alone can ensure civilized, good quality of human life. In his view, a life without values remains value-less.   

Since primitive times, man alone, in contrast to all other living beings, has been relentless in pursuit of a good quality of worldly life and transformation in living conditions through successive periods of history. This he has achieved by making innovations in technology - first by muscle power followed by wheel power, the electric power and the nuclear power. These endeavors have resulted in the evolution of the modern technological civilization of material prosperity. 

Besides the remarkable achievement of science and technology, the unquenchable curiosity of mankind also led him to explore the secrets of nature and of the Soul within the body, the question of birth and death and the quest of an invisible power directing the universe. This led to his philosophical, spiritual journey, the concept of God, founding of varieties of beliefs, faiths and religions, and a quest for higher values of life and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment and wisdom, and living a complete life and enjoying a better quality of life. 

The author has brought out the need to encourage the pursuit of higher values - whether moral, political, economic, social, cultural, constitutional, scientific or spiritual - through an effective State policy, vision and a philosophy of education. In his view, culture encompasses all aspects of living – the beliefs, habits and behaviour. 

Cultural ethos has to be founded, according to the author, on the bedrock of human rights, values and duties and enlightened citizenship. 

A vision and a philosophy of education has, therefore, to provide for the total development of citizens, including the development of the physical, intellectual, emotional, material and spiritual aspects of their personality. 

The Epilogue of this book succinctly elaborates the role of education in ‘man-making’ , life-building’ and ‘character- strengthening’. Education should also focus on  strengthening the cultural ethos through a teaching learning process that fosters universal ethics and moral conduct. It should lead to total human development by creating conditions for ‘learning to be’ as well as ‘learning to do’. 

According to the author, the globalized world of our times needs both scientific and spiritual development. This would require recognition and respect for cultural diversity and a better appreciation of universal human rights. 

This book is a timely reminder to all of us that human rights and values should become a part of the cultural ethos and we need to incorporate these universal values into our education system. 

 I would like to compliment the author on producing this excellent book.  The theme is very relevant and the exposition is thought provoking. 

Human rights are sacred.  We cannot allow any system to continue if it tramples on these rights and violates them.  Democracy is a system that gives respect to each individual’s rights and, therefore, is considered as the most preferred governance system all over the world now.  

However, one must recognize that authoritarian tendencies, terrorist activities and lack of empowered citizenry can potentially very easily derail democracy.  

Which is why eternal vigilance is required to safeguard human rights and restore human dignity to each and every person.  Civil liberties are well protected when each of us respects others’ rights.  As I said yesterday, citizens must be guardians of liberty of fellow citizens.  Violence in any form needs to be condemned.  That’s the duty of every citizen.  That’s the way to reform our polity. 

This is the lesson that the history of our own country teaches us through the dark chapter of emergency in the 1975-77 period as well as through the sporadic despicable incidents of violence of all kinds and atrocities, especially against women, in contemporary India. 

It is a matter of great satisfaction and a source of optimism in the inner strength of all Indians that as a nation, we have risen up as a strong force against such violations of human rights, and against violence and oppression.  

It is not surprising that we have condemned authoritarianism and violation of human rights.  We are a country that has valued freedom and respected each living creature including human beings. We are inheritors of an ancient heritage which has at its core the timeless universal value system that has valued freedom and tolerance, acceptance and assimilation and has believed that the world is one family and that every creature, small or big has a distinct value and therefore has to be respected. 

This fountain of ancient thought has been nourishing our cultural and social roots for many centuries.  

This is the spring that has ensured that we remain one of the most vibrant, functioning democratic systems in the world. 

This cultural ethos must be preserved, protected, propagated and nurtured further.  

This can be achieved not only through education but also through media and the ideal behavior of leaders in all walks of life. 

I see this as the essential message of this work.  It is a view that reflects India’s holistic vision.  It is a view that illumines the way forward.  I hope it will generate new ideas for further action at various levels for improving the quality of life of each citizen in our country.

 

Jai Hind!

                Distinguished invitees, friends from the media, Brothers and Sisters!

During the last ten months, I have associated myself with the release of quite a few books on various themes and issues and each such occasion was a joyous one. But today, I am doing so with a heavy heart. The reasons for the same are obvious as all of you would have known by now. All of us would have been happy if there was no need and occasion like this. But it was not to be. The reasons for our coming together this evening are too compelling and cannot be ignored. 

For more effective appreciation of the context of this event, I would like to give a brief narrative of India that prevailed for 21 long months. It was an India, wherein;

1.The Government of India through it’s Attorney General informs the Supreme Court that a Police Officer can shoot down a person on the ground of personal enmity and there would be no recourse to justice as no court can intervene in such matters;

2. The Prime Minister of the day strongly feels the need to give a ‘shock treatment’ to the people of the country, just a few days after an adverse High Court Judgment in an election related case holds the said Prime Minister guilty of electoral malpractices during the LokSabha elections;

3. The Prime Minister of the day asks the President late at night tosign  a Proclamation that was not approved by the Union Cabinet saying there was no time to call the Cabinet;

4. The Prime Minister writes to President on a plain white sheet seeking to issue such a proclamation instead of the official letter head;

5. The President of the day signs on the dotted line on June 25, 1975 without any  consideration of the disastrous implications of such bizarre surrender and without insisting on the Cabinet Decision on a very major issue; Thousands  of opposition leaders woken up from sleep and were taken to the nearest jails;

6. Prime Minister sends a revised letter to the President giving reasons for issuing such a proclamation a day after the said proclamation was issued;

7. The very next day, the President suspends the citizens of their right to move courts to defend their Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution;  

8. President of India was empowered to amend the Constitution at will through executive orders;

9. The Law Minister, the Cabinet Secretary and the Home Secretary and almost the entire Cabinet come to know of such a very major decision only the next day;

10. The top bureaucracy of the day conducts in a pathetic manner and without spine becoming a party to the blatant violation of the provisions of the Constitution of India;

11. The Government brazenly tells the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) that papers relating to the context of decisions taken will not be given to the CAG;

12. An extra constitutional coterie emerges and runs the affairs of the State with no accountability but will  full powers; This coterie directs Jail Superintendents to build prison cells with asbestos roof for political prisoners and also asks them to send some of the political prisoners to the Lunatics Cells;

13. Inspectors-General of Police become the Chief Editors of news papers censoring the news and deciding which news would be published and not;

14. Electricity supply cut off to news papers to prevent their publication;

15. Journalists with integrity and honesty were arrested, jailed and police was set after them and their family members harassed. The author of these books Shri Surya Prakash was warned of dire consequences by the Karnataka Government after he published the news of harassment of Lawrence Fernandes and other reports of excesses by the state machinery and  his parents constantly worried about  his safety;

16. News paperscategorised as friendly, neutral and hostile and were dealt with accordingly; Accreditation of non-complinant journalists gets cancelled;

17. Advertisements stopped to news papers that were critical of the government of that period;

18. News papers banned from publishing quotations of Tagore, Gandhiji and even Nehru on freedom, democracy and fundamental rights;

19. Journalists come under the surveillance of Intelligence Bureau and the Press Council was abolished by the Government;

20. Broadcast of BBC and Voice of America stopped;

21. Screening of films like KissakursiKa, Aandhi, Andoalan and All the President’s Men  banned

22. The government sets of a Committee to review the Constitution under late  ShriSwaran Singh which within ten days submits a Report recommending radical changes in the Constitution amounting to destroying the sacred law of the land and abrogating the basic features of the Constitution. 

These perversions that happened with regard to the Executive, one of the three constitutional organs were indicative of the subversion that took place during those 21 months. That was how the executive became authoritarian and dictatorial. Now let us look at how the Parliament conducted during that forgettable period.

23.  The Parliament enacts five major Constitution Amendments virtually destroying the Constitution and abdicating it’s responsibility to the Executive;

24. Through 38th Constitution Amendment, the disastrous proclamation of June 25, 1975 was taken out of the purview of the Judicial Review;

25. The Parliament prohibited the Supreme Court from hearing the Election Petitions against the high constitutional functionaries including the Prime Minister;

26. Parliament became a party to suppression and oppression of media by placing the anti-media laws in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, thereby taking them out of the pale of Judicial Review;

27.The apex legislature of the country made laws strangling the media; The Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Act, famously known as the Feroze Gandhi Act that protected the press from defamation and libel while reporting on the proceedings of the Parliament was repealed; The Prevention of Publication of Objectionable Matter Act,1976 was passed that empowered District Magistrates to barge into news paper offices and seize the press on mere suspicion of publication of objectionable news;

28. RajyaSabha passed within a few hours theBill that shielded the top constitutional functionaries including the Prime Minister from penal action for acts committed before entering the office and while in office barring civil proceedings against them. This meant that if the Prime Minister defaulted on a personal bank loan, no action could be taken; 

29. Through the bizarre 42nd Constitution Amendment, Parliament took out any Constitution Amendment including depriving the Fundamental Rights of Citizens from Judicial Review; Parliament assigned to itself unlimited powers to amend the Constitution; Courts were prevented from hearing election petitions and disqualifying MPs on the ground of corrupt electoral practices and the Constitutional provision of requirement of quorum in the Legislatures was removed; and 

30. Parliament also amended Election Laws thereby allowing government officials to assist contestants in the elections. 

Then the Judiciary, the custodian of the Constitution did not cover itself with glory either. The Apex Court sank to its lowest. How?

31.Giving  a go by to the doctrine of ‘Basic Features of the Constitution’ propounded by the Supreme Court in the famous Keshavananda Bharti Case in 1973, the Apex Court did not question the said Constitution Amendments that destroyed the Constitution; 

32. The Supreme Court went along with the Government’s view that citizens had no right to seek remedies to violation of Fundamental Rights like the right to life and liberty. This meant that a police officer can kill a person on the ground of personal enmity;

33. The Apex Court upheld the election of the then Prime Minister to the LokSabha without questioning the law made just to save that Prime Minister, there by upholding the validity of the 39th Constitution Amendment with retrospective effect.

Equality before law is enshrined in the saying  “Be you ever so high, the law is above you”. But during those 21 months, it was brazenly violated with the Supreme Court becoming a mute party to placing some individuals above the law. Real bad days for the judiciary. It was only Justice H.R.Khanna that dared to differ with the Government’s position in the ADM, Jabalpur Vs.Shiv Kant Shukla case and asserted that “The Constitution and the law of India does not permit life and liberty to be at the mercy of the absolute power of the Executive”. He paid a price for his conscience by losing out on the office of the Chief Justice of India. I see him as one of the great heroes of what I call the second freedom struggle. The other beingRamnathGoenka of the Indian Express.

Friends !

Virtually, during those 21 months, the democracy in our country was sterilized, sapping it of it’s profound energy and vitality. It was the the infamous “Emergency: Indian Democracy’s Darkest Hour” and the title of Hindi, Kannada, Telugu and Gujarati versions released today. The original in English was also authored by veteran journalist Shri A. Surya Prakash. The 33 aberrations that I have highlighted, spanning the Parliament, Judiciary and Executive holda  mirror to what had happened in our country during June 25, 1975 and March 21, 1977. The Emergency had to be revoked following the democratic revolt by the people of our country in the General Elections of 1977. The poor and illiterate people of our country stated profoundly that they don’t just live by bread alone and they cherish their right to life and liberty and would not accept authoritarianism and dictatorship.

I have illustrated these 33 aberrations on the occasion of the 43rd anniversary of Emergency today for the benefit of those borne during the 1970s andlater to help them get a view of the extent of subversion of the Constitution and it’s principle organs. These books tell us about the terrible consequences that follow when democracy gets derailed.

That is why I say, the term ‘Emergency’ should not be bandied about casually or irresponsibly. Emergency means dictatorship and the worst abuse of executive power.

Talking vaguely about the Emergency would not help Young India understand it’s impact and reach. I thought a detailed account would make them understand and appreciate better the extent and sweep of the perversion that guided the State apparatus during those dark 21 months. It would also help the present generations to be more aware of the importance of personal freedoms and fundamental rights.   

It would be in order to know as to how did it all happened? 

On June 12, 1975 came the Judgment of the Allahabad High Court against the election to the LokSabha of the then Prime Minister. On the 24th of the same month, Justice V.R.KrishanIyer of the Supreme Court stayed the High Court verdict but directed the then Prime Minister not to participate in the debates and not to vote in the Parliament. This made the position of the then Prime Minister untenable and the opposition immediately sought the  resignation of Prime Minister. Anti-corruption agitations were spreading across the country. Jai Prakash Narayan gave the call for SampoornaKranti. The rulers of the day became insecure and decided to give a ‘shock treatment’ to the people of the country. So called ‘growing internal disturbance’ was presented as a threat to the national security and Emergency was clamped overnight. A small coterie was responsible for this dark age of Independent India. Internal disturbances were presented as the cause for abrogation of the freedoms and rights of the people even though the regular reports of the Governors and the Chief Secretaries of the States did not report any such law and order incidents in any part of the country. 

Our country had passed through the dark medieval era of about a thousand years. This was followed by about two hundred years of colonial rule. As the Independent India was finding its feet, then came the dark era of the emergency. While our history books and text books talk of those medieval dark days and the British Raj, the fallacious causes and consequences of Emergency is not made a part of the learning of the young. It is time, the dark sage of Emergency becomes part of the curriculum so that present generations are sensitisedto the dreaded events of 1975-77 and they learn to value the democratic freedoms they enjoy today. They must also learn to pay homage and respect  to all those who fought to bring democracy back on the rails. 

I compliment Shri Surya Prakash for chronicling all the major details of that darkest age of our democracy in a very lucid manner and in great detail in these books. I particularly appreciate him and Meghnirghosh Media for bringing out these Indian language versions. I am told that this book will be brought out in more Indian languages. Various aspects of the Emergency, the intrigues, the State of the Nation, the insecurity of the then leadership and the manifestation of that perversion, the villains and the heroes etc., have been included in fourteen chapters. It makes a compelling reading and the present generation shall read it. The author says in the introduction to the book and I quote “The purpose of this book is to keep the eternal flame of vigilance alive”. 

In the name of internal disturbance, those who were found a threat to national security and thrown into jails include; Jai Prakash Narayan, AtalBehari Vajpayee, LalKrishanAdvani, Chandrasekhar, Charan Singh, MadhuDandavate, Ramakrishna Hegde, Morarji Desai, BijuPatnaik, NanajiDeshmukh, SikanderBakht, BalasahebDeoras of the RSS, H.D.DeveGowda, Ram BilasPaswan, Nitish Kumar etc.

I was a student activist those days and was active on matters of public importance. I went underground for two months coordinating resistance to Emergency. I was then arrested and jailed for over seventeen months. That jail term brought me close to the veterans of opposition, writers and journalists. It gave me a clear perspective of life, the country, politics and it’s negative side and the larger purpose. 

Prime Minister Shri NarendraModi  was an RSS Pracharak during those days. Shri Surya Prakash writes in these books; “He (Shri Modi) led the underground movement and played a key role in helping the families of those jailed by the Government. He had the responsibility to organise secret meetings of the resistance, distribute literature and keep track of the needs of senior leaders”. 

As per the information of the Government, of the 6,330  MISA (Maintenance of Internal Security Act)detenues from political parties and banned organisations as on February 12, 1977, 4,026 were from the RSS and the Jan Sangh. These include; ArunJaitely, Anant Kumar, Ravi Shanker Prasad, Prakash Javdekar who are now ministers in the central government. 

India’s founding fathers had warned citizens of such exigencies like the Emergency if they were not alert. Dr.SarvepalliRadhakrishnan, a member of the Constituent Assembly, said and I quote, “Our opportunities are great but let me warn you that when power outstrips ability, we will fall on evil days…a free India will be judged by the way in which it will serve the interests of the common man…unless we destroy corruption in high places, root out every trace of nepotism, love of power… we will not be able to raise the standards of efficiency in administration”. 

How true was his premonition! The determination of one individual to somehow retain power threw the country into darkness and the citizens, the patrons of democracy rendered helpless in the face of violation of their fundamental rights to life and liberty. 

Friends!

That darkest hour of democracy threw up several lessons for the country, the leadership and the citizens. But I would like to refer to one important lesson.

With dissent stifled, media muzzled and even the well meaning not able to speak up to the coterie behind the Emergency, the government of the day lost connect with reality on the ground. The IB and other agencies of the government that lost the direction made big virtues out of the so called improved discipline in government offices, trains running on time etc. The top leadership fed on falsehoods that people were happy with the Emergency even as thousands of the young and old were indiscriminately deprived of their right to become fathers and the whole of democracy was sterilized.

The then leadership believed all that false feedback about the people’s pulse and called for general elections to the LokSabha. The people spoke their mind out. The then ruling party got just two out of the 300 LokSabha seats in northern and central India. That historic verdict was a second freedom struggle won for the country. This goes to highlight the need for a free media and the need for the governments to keep their ears close to the ground. 

One good thing, however, that flowed from the dark days of the Emergency was an unequivocal assertion of the people that they value their freedoms much more than the bread. We need to keep this spirit alive.

Friends !

Democracy is not new to India, while it was to many countries including the developed nations. Ancient India had several functional democratic republics. This glorious tradition was trampled during the medieval period and later during the Emergency in post-Independent India.

After the resounding pro-democracy verdict of the people of our country, I am confident and so are you that no sensible government would dare to repeat what was done during the fateful night of June 25, 1975. That was clearly a state sponsored ‘intolerance’ to democracy and individual freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.

But we need to guard against ‘intolerance’ on the part of certain misguided citizens. We have been occasionally witnessing some such words and deeds of intolerance by some citizens in the name of so called cow protection, Love Jihad, eating habits, watching films etc. Such incidents lead us to the point that individual freedoms can be in full play only when every citizen respects such freedoms of fellow citizens. Post emergency, the State apparatus would think twice before riding roughshod over the liberties and freedoms of citizens. But it is the enlightened citizens who would enable fuller manifestation of such liberties and freedoms. 

It is to sensitise citizens to the adverse consequences of loosing out on such rights and freedoms, I gave a detailed list of the aberrations of emergency. We know the value of freedom, when some one encroaches on it. What I like to drive home is that it is now the responsibility of each citizen to uphold the liberties and freedom of fellow citizen so that every citizen is assured of such freedoms. Every citizen shall be the guardian of the rights of fellow citizen. Then only democracy can fully manifest itself to the benefit of all.

The core Indian values and ethos have no place for intolerance. That is why all the major religions of the world flourish in our country. Pluralism is ingrained in our outlook. Indian has taken into its lap all those who had come here for different reasons including the invaders and plunderers.  

On the 43rd anniversary of Emergency, I would like the message to go out that any citizen who violates the freedoms of fellow citizen would have no right to be called an Indian. It is because he is hurting the Constitution of India and all that India stood for ages. So, as citizens of India, let us resolve to defend democracy and the fundamental rights of all the citizens. 

I once again compliment Shri Surya Prakash for his lucid and factual account of various aspects of the Emergency and also for bringing out the same in different languages. I also appreciate the publishers Meghnirghosh Media for their support to this noble cause.

I thank the Vivekananda Foundation for enabling the release of these books today.

                            On the occasion of the 43rd anniversary of ‘Emergency‘ that shook the nation, Vice President of India Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today asserted that intolerant citizens violating the freedoms of fellow citizens have no right to be ‘Indians’ as it goes against the core values and ethos of India. He spoke at length on the fallacious causes and the consequences of Emergency after releasing Hindi, Kannada, Telugu and Gujarati versions of ‘Emergency: Indian Democracy’s Darkest Hour’ authored by Chairman of Prasar Bharti Shri A. Surya Prakash.

2.       Stating that no sensible Government would dare to resort to Emergency after the resounding pro-democracy verdict of the people in 1977, Shri Naidu said that now the threat to individual freedoms is from some misguided citizens.He said “I am confident that no sensible government would repeat what was done during the fateful night of June 25, 1975. That was clearly a State sponsored ‘Intolerance’ to democracy and individual freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. But we need to guard against intolerance on the part of certain misguided citizens. We have been occasionally witnessing some such words and deeds of intolerance by some citizens in the name of so called cow protection, Love Jihad, eating habits, watching films, etc. Such incidents lead us to the point that individual freedoms can be in full play only when every citizen respects such freedoms of fellow citizens. Post emergency, the State apparatus would think twice before riding roughshod over the liberties and freedoms of citizens. But it is enlightened citizens who would enable fuller manifestation of such liberties and freedoms. ”

3.       The Vice President asserted that the core Indian values and ethos have no place for intolerance due to which all the major religions of the world are flourishing in India. He further said; “On the 43rd anniversary of Emergency, I would like the message to go out that any citizen who violates the freedoms of fellow citizens would have no right to be called an Indian. It is because he is hurting the Constitution of India and all that India stood for.” 

4.       Referring to the medieval period of about a thousand years that destroyeddemocratic traditions of ancient India and the British Raj finding a place in the text books and not the Emergency in the post-Independent India, Shri Naidu said “Its time, the dark days of Emergency becomes part of the curriculum, so that present generations are sensitized to the dreaded events of 1975-77 and they learn to value the democratic freedoms they enjoy today.”  

5.       Referring to his own imprisonment of over 17 months during Emergency, Shri Venkaiah Naidu listed 33 aberrations of that period, which he said sterilised democracy in the country, destroyed the Constitution and deprived the citizens of their Right to Life and Liberty. He expressed concern over the way the Executive became dictatorial, Parliament abdicated its responsibility to the Executive and Judiciary sank to its lowest during the Emergency. 

6.       Shri Naidu referred to strangulation of media during Emergency through various measures which include police officers becoming the editors of news papers censoring news, snapping electricity supply to prevent publication of news papers, arrest and harassment of upright journalists and their family members, stopping of advertisements to news papers critical of Emergency, abolition of the Press Council, the Parliament passing various laws stifling media, etc.

7.       Shri Naidu expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court accepting the Government’s position that citizens had no right during Emergency to seek remedy even if they were killed by police officers on account personal enmity, not opposing the 42nd Constitution amendment that went against   the doctrine of ‘Basic features of Constitution’ propounded by the apex Court in the famous Keshavanand Bharti Case in 1973. 

8.       The Vice President took objection to the then President signing the Proclamation of Emergency during the fateful night without the backing of the Cabinet decision and the President being empowered to amend the Constitution at the will of the Government through executive orders. He also lamented the emergence of small coteriethat ran the affairs of the State with no accountability but with full powers. 

9.       Shri Naidu, quoting government records said that of the 6,330 MISA detenues from political parties and banned organisations, 4,026 were from the RSS and Jan Sangh. He referred to how Prime Minister Shri NarendraModi as RSS Pracharak during those days led the underground movement and played a key role in helping the families of those jailed by the Government besides organising secret resistance meetings.  

10.     Referring to the heroes and villains of the Emergency period, Shri Naidu described the then Supreme Court Judge Shri H. R. Khanna as one of the great heroes for defending   the Fundamental Rights of citizens and differing with four fellow judges. Shri RamnathGoenka of Indian Express was among the other heroes, he said.  “Emergency should not be bandied about casually or irresponsibly. Emergency means dictatorship and the worst abuse of executive power”, Shri Naidu said.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that cooperatives have the potential to revive agriculture and make it sustainable. He was delivering the 19th Vaikunth Bhai Mehta Memorial Lecture organized by National Cooperative Union of India (NCUI), here today. The Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shir Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

The Vice President has asked cooperatives to take up the task of training farmers in the right use of fertilizers, and also help them understand new technologies in farming. We need to strengthen cooperatives so that they can work for the welfare of the farmers and give them credit at the time they need at a reasonable rate of interest, he added.

The Vice President called for an increased participation of women in cooperative movement. He further said that the cooperative sector has a big role in bridging the urban-rural divide and creating opportunities for income generation. Women’s participation will further strengthen economic activity in rural areas, he added.

Keeping in view the strategy of Government’s Seven Point Agenda for doubling farmers income by 2022, the Vice President said that agricultural cooperatives can play a vital role in educating the farmers to reduce the cost of cultivation through balanced use of fertilizer, improve water-use efficiency, establish more warehouse to avoid distress sale of produce, link with National E-market (e-NAM), emphasize value addition and encourage farmers to take up other allied activities like poultry, beekeeping, fisheries.

The Vice President urged cooperatives to take active part in skilling rural youth. He further said that cooperatives have tremendous opportunities in solving the problem of unemployment, so, skilling the rural population through cooperatives can be a big leap forward.

Cooperative training must not only be imparted to employees in cooperatives, but also extend beyond cooperatives, to children in schools, colleges, universities, technical and professional institutions, and also for those who want to form cooperatives, but who are not aware of the various modalities, and requirements.

Highlighting the need to have a transparent, accountable and efficient system, the Vice President has asked the cooperatives to make effective use of digital technology in their functioning, especially in governance, banking and businesses.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am glad to be with all of you today to deliver this year’s Vaikunth Bhai Mehta Memorial Lecture being organized by National Cooperative Union of India (NCUI).

On this occasion, I am happy to see various eminent cooperators and dignitaries who are present on the occasion of this event. I welcome the initiative of NCUI to organize this Lecture in the memory of a cooperative leader who was fully dedicated to the principles and values of cooperatives. His pioneering contribution to the growth of cooperative movement, particularly education and training is acknowledged by all. In 1953 he was appointed Chairman of the All India Khadi and Village Industries Board He had been a member of the Bombay Province   Banking Inquiry Committee (1929), Textile Labour Inquiry Committee (1939-40), Textile Inquiry Commission (1953-54) and Chairman, Commission on Agricultural Co-operative Credit (1959). We are also aware of the valuable contribution made by him when he was the Finance Minister of Maharashtra. A devoted Gandhian, Vaikunthbhai was more interested in the Mahatma’s constructive activities than in politics. He accepted the Finance Ministership in 1947 only after personal pressure was brought upon him by Gandhiji and Sardar Patel. He spun daily and wore only Khadi. His one hobby was reading and he built up a rich library of his own. He was a man of genuine humility who abhorred publicity of any kind. His life provides an excellent example of quiet dedicated service to the nation in the fields of co-operative movement and village industries. I pay my respects to this illustrious son of our great country.

The concept of cooperation has inherent strength in its principles and values.

The principles and values provide a unique character to a cooperative organization which is not found in a private enterprise. They not only help a cooperative to sustain its business, but also create social harmony in the society by bringing people together irrespective of caste, creed or any other distinction.

Cooperatives are socio-economic organizations which have community service as the essential ethos, and are not merely driven by profit motive. They are primarily meant to help the poor sections of the society.

Agriculture plays an important role in our national economy and livelihood of more than 55% population of our country is dependent on agriculture and allied activities.

As per the recent data published by the International Cooperative Alliance in the ‘World Cooperative Monitor’ among the 300 largest cooperatives in the world, about 30% are found in the agriculture and food industry sector. 

Agricultural cooperatives throughout the world have played a significant role in organizing the small farmers and it is worth noting that these small farmers are responsible for 80% of the world food production.

Keeping in view the strategy of Government’s Seven Point Agenda for doubling farmers income by 2022, the agricultural cooperatives can play a vital role in educating the farmers to reduce the cost of cultivation through balanced use of fertilizer, improve water-use efficiency, establish more warehouse to avoid distress sale of produce, link with National E-market (e-NAM), emphasize value addition and encourage farmers to take up other allied activities like poultry, beekeeping, fisheries etc.

In the recent years, after globalization of economy the cooperative movement has been facing many problems.  The Indian cooperative movement, the world’s largest movement, has its own inherent strength and weakness. With more than 8 lakh cooperatives, the cooperatives have significant presence in all the areas of socio-economic activities.

Dairy cooperatives have ushered in milk revolution in the country. AMUL has become a household name. The big institutions like IFFCO, KRIBHCO, AMUL, etc. are the big success stories in cooperative sector. Besides, there are a large number of cooperatives at the state level, like urban cooperative banks, primary agriculture cooperative societies, housing, fishery and other forms of cooperatives which are making untiring efforts to improve the socio-economic condition of the people in the rural areas.

At grass-root level, the impact of cooperative sector has a big role in bridging the urban-rural divide and creating opportunities for income generation.

Sisters and brothers,

I am a son of a farmer from a small village. Having strong background in agriculture, I am aware of the problems of the farmers. It is a pity that the farmers are still at the mercy of moneylenders, despite the presence of a large number of agricultural cooperatives. We need to strengthen cooperatives so that they can work for the welfare of the farmers and give them credit at the time they need at a reasonable rate of interest.

I am pleased that the present government is committed to encourage the cooperative movement. We have an example in case of NAFED where Govt. has given a guarantee to a tune of Rs.40000 crores. 

The cooperatives for their sustainable existence and to serve the members better, have to diversify their operations in new areas like honeybee production, seaweed farming, etc. The cooperatives should also train the farmers in the right use of fertilizers, and also train them in new technologies related to agricultural farming.

The cooperatives through their wide network in the rural areas have won the trust of the farmers more than any other institution. Various schemes of the government like Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Mudra Scheme. provide a good opportunity for cooperatives to collaborate with the government and reap multiple benefits. The cooperative sector has immense professional manpower spread across the country, huge infrastructure of its own, and it has strong community roots in the rural areas. In the times to come, I feel cooperatives need to find mutual synergies with the public and private sector so as to explore new avenues of resource generation. At present, we talk only of public-private partnership. The third element of cooperatives must be aligned with this, so that we have a public-private- cooperative partnership which can provide a new model of development having wide relevance for the farming community in the villages.

I find tremendous opportunities for cooperatives in solving the problem of unemployment, more particularly in the rural areas where the poor lack skills. So, skilling the rural population through cooperatives can be a big leap forward. This is in accordance with the current government’s emphasis on skill development. Many of the cooperatives like NCUI, NCDC, IFFCO, etc. have their projects and programmes in the rural areas. So making these programmes focus on skill generation can not only prepare the rural youth to take up employment, but also provide them opportunities for becoming good entrepreneurs.

India has set a goal of establishing 100 smart cities in different States.  To achieve this task the services of labour & contract cooperative societies such as Uralungal Labour Contract and Construction Society need be engaged in modern and high-tech infrastructure development and such models of organized labour cooperative societies can be replicated in other proposed cities. 

As mentioned earlier, the contribution of Vaikunth Bhai Mehta to the cause of cooperative education and training was significant. This is very relevant in the current times when the cooperatives need to professionalize their functioning through effective training.

Cooperative training must not only be imparted to employees in cooperatives, but also extend beyond cooperatives, to children in schools, colleges, universities, technical and professional institutions, and also for those who want to form cooperatives, but who are not aware of the various modalities, and requirements.

Since “Cooperation” is a state subject and cooperatives are participatory and people-based organizations, the cooperative movement needs to be strengthened by the states.

Today, the use of digital technology has been transforming governance banking and businesses. The Cooperatives must also fully utilize the power of technology in their functioning.

I am glad that the Government of India has given a substantial budgetary support to computerize more than 63000 Primary Agriculture Cooperatives (PACS).  PACs are the most important cooperative societies serving the farmers in rural areas.  So strengthening the PACS through application of appropriate technology is indeed the need of the hour.

It is high time that cooperatives at all levels gear up to meet the future challenges in a professional manner. 

India with a rich cooperative culture and a vibrant cooperative movement can march ahead only if we have a strong leadership which can provide a new direction to the growth of the cooperative movement.  The ICA Blue-Print of Cooperative Decade lays emphasis on cooperatives emerging as the most preferred model of development of the people by 2020.  To achieve this objective, the cooperative leadership today must have vision, dedication and commitment and transparency. This internalization of the noble ideals of the cooperative movement will be the real tribute to Late Vaikunth Bhai Mehta.

I wish you all in your endeavor to strengthen the cooperative movement for the welfare of our people.

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that it is the pious responsibility of everyone to take care of widows.  Addressing the gathering on the occasion of International Widows' Day, here today, he said that ‘we as a society need to reflect on the social attitudes towards widows and how the stigma, humiliation and isolation attached to widowhood can be overcome’. The Union Minister for Electronics & Information Technology and Law & Justice, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that it is a matter of concern that widows are looked down upon and at times meted out unjust treatment even in the present digital era. A powerful social movement is required to change the mindset of people towards widows, he added.

The Vice President said that indigent widows need to be empowered financially by providing loans to be self-employed. Preference should be given to widows while extending Mudra loans, he added.

The Vice President stressed on the need to create livelihood opportunities through vocational training programmes in various areas, including tailoring, garment making and packaging for widows. He further said that States like Haryana and Rajasthan are giving preference to widows seeking government jobs through competitive examinations. This should be emulated by other States too, he added.

Highlighting the need to empower widows, the Vice President said that providing livelihood skills and education for their children is at most important. He further said that under the social welfare schemes like housing and land distribution, entitlements need to be given in the name of women and preference should be meted to widows. Such measures will help in empowering them, he added. 

The Vice President said that the concept of New India encompasses economically emancipated women and if that vision is realized, many of the social ills like atrocities on women and neglect of widows can become a thing of the past.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""At the outset, let me compliment Loomba Foundation for working exclusively for the uplift of widows and their children. As there are several million widows worldwide, there is a need not only for more such charitable organizations, but also increased focus on their welfare by the governments.

Widowhood is probably the most tragic phase in a person’s life—be it of men or women. Unfortunately, it causes greater distress among women for a variety of reasons, depending on the socio-cultural mores and norms of the country they hail from.  In India too, widows are a highly marginalized and neglected section and face discrimination and exploitation.  In thousands of cases, widows not only have to fend for themselves, but also take care of their children. 

According to 2011 census data, there are about 4.3 crore widows in India, equivalent to the populations of some  countries. They need to be treated with special care, compassion and empathy as they not only have lost their most loved ones, but are suddenly faced with economic and emotional distress and have to cope with life-shattering emptiness and void. 

It is a matter of concern that widows are looked down upon and at times meted out unjust treatment even in the present digital era.

There have been many progressive reformers in India who tirelessly worked for the welfare and emancipation of widows. For instance, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar pioneered widows’ remarriage. The others in this league include Raja Ram Mohan Roy and well-known Telugu social reformer, Kandukuri Veeresalingam, who had also promoted widows remarriage and had also established Widows Home. They had made herculean efforts to overcome prejudices of a conservative society at that time.

The most pressing need in the present times is to provide livelihood skills for women and education for their children. I am aware that the Central Government and various State Governments have taken various initiatives to empower widows by providing pensions, shelter and launching skill development programmes. I am happy that the Central Government is providing monthly pension to widows under a national scheme.

Under the social welfare schemes like housing and land distribution, entitlements need to be given in the name of women and preference should be meted to widows. Such measures will help in empowering them.  

Some of the major problems faced by widows include societal restrictions on widow remarriages and denial of inheritance rights, among others.

According to 2011 census data, 58 per cent of widows are above 60 years, 32 per cent between 40 and 59 years, nine per cent are in the age group of 20-39 years and a negligible group is under 19 years.

Since nearly one-third of the widows are in the 40-59 years age group, the Government should promote skill development and create livelihood opportunities through vocational training programmes in various areas, including tailoring, garment making and packaging. Indigent widows need to be empowered financially by providing loans to be self-employed. Preference should be given to widows while extending Mudra loans. I am happy that some States like Haryana and Rajasthan are giving preference to widows seeking government jobs through competitive examinations. This should be emulated by other States too. 

As mentioned earlier, there is a need for greater participation of NGOs and the private sector in the noble cause of empowering widows. The private sector should earmark some of the CSR funds exclusively for the welfare of widows.

Another important aspect that needs special focus is to provide education to the children of widows. Here too, the government, civil society and the private sector should join hands to give preferential treatment to such children.  

Sisters and Brothers, 

I am glad that Loomba Foundation has taken up a good number of initiatives to ameliorate the economic situation of widows. In fact, we as a society, need to reflect on the social attitudes towards widows and how the stigma, humiliation and isolation attached to widowhood can be overcome. It is inter-twined with the gender discrimination, which runs as an unfortunate undercurrent in contemporary Indian society.

Girls and women need to be provided equal and equitable access to good education and livelihood opportunities. Our concept of New India encompasses economically emancipated women. If that vision is realized, many of the social ills like atrocities on women and neglect of widows can become a thing of the past.

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today said that making agriculture sustainable and profitable should top the agenda of both central and state governments as food security is the key foundation of national security.

 

Addressing the concluding session of the two-day National Consultation on Agriculture at Vaikunth Mehta National Cooperative Institute of Management, he said that a multi-pronged strategy needs to be adopted to make agriculture viable and ensure that the interests of the farmers are protected. 

 

The Vice President said that the recommendations of the two-day deliberations on six themes will be shared with a wider audience and key stake holders including the union and the state governments and farmers’ organisations. He further said that the outcomes of the national consultation along with inputs received from the wider cross section of people will be placed before the nation. This is expected to generate informed debate on critical issues in this sector and lead to tangible action touching the lives of farmers across the country, he added.

 

Expressing his concern that the system was in favour of the articulate and organised urban sector, the Vice President said that the time has come for a sharper focus on rural, agrarian population and a positive bias towards farmers. Interests of both farmers and consumers need to be balanced, he added.

 

One of the new challenges in the agricultural sector is the problem of plenty. ‘We have become self sufficient in food grains. However, this has not translated into higher incomes for the farmers. Unless agriculture is made profitable, we cannot attract more people, especially youth, to take up farming,’ the Vice President emphasised.  

  

The Vice President said that farmers have contributed immensely in transforming our nation into an exporter of food grains and we owe a lot to them. He further said that food security is central to national security and our kisans are continuously ensuring it.  That's why our nation salutes the farmers and says ‘Jai Kisan!’, he added.

 

While farmers are ensuring food security, our armed forces guarding our country are ensuring national security. They have demonstrated highest standards of professional excellence and are among the best in the world. We salute their sense of dedication and say ‘Jai Jawan!’, the Vice President added.

 

The Vice President said that the nation owes a great deal not only to farmers and to the defence forces but also to the eminent scientists who are extending the frontiers of knowledge and contributing to the development of our nation continuing in the same vein he lauded the great heights reached by Indian scientists and said ‘Jai Vigyan’. 

 

Disrespecting or neglecting or ignoring these three pillars is not in the interest of the nation, he emphatically declared.

 

The Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Shri Parushottam Rupala, expressed his deep appreciation at the novel initiative taken up by the Vice President of India and assured that the recommendations will receive serious consideration.

 

Shri Girish Bapat, the Minister for Food, Drugs, Administration & Civil supplies for Maharashtra was also present on the occasion. 

 

More than hundred scientists, agricultural experts, Vice Chancellors of various agricultural universities, representatives of ICAR, NAFED, NABARD, and NITI Aayog took part in the two day consultation organised by Indian Institute of Public Administration in collaboration with CII and FICCI. 

 

The following themes were discussed during the two-day meeting;


	Creating an enabling policy framework
	Intensification of Farming, diversification to High value agriculture
	Marketing and Agri Logistics
	Agricultural trade policy
	Transfer of Technology –lab to land
	Agricultural Insurance and credit

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that local bodies should always place citizens at the centre of civic governance, adding that people’s participation in formulating and planning projects and services will improve execution and delivery of the services. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the new building of Pune Municipal Corporation, in Pune, Maharashtra today. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Fadnavis, the Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Prakash Javadekar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

The Vice President said that Pune has the chance to become a trailblazer in urban governance by adopting a futuristic and people-centric approach. He complimented the Municipal Corporation for issuing municipal bonds for augmenting resources to take up developmental projects in the city. He has also asked the local body to improve its credit worthiness to borrow finances from lending agencies.  

 

Highlighting the importance of healthy lifestyle, the Vice President suggested authorities to create non-motorized zones. Every city must have dedicated bicycle tracks, pedestrian lanes and parks, he added.

 

The Vice President said that local body representatives must work collectively, irrespective of political affiliations, to protect water bodies and prevent their encroachment. While expressing his appreciation at the progress made in the implementation of projects under the Smart City mission, he cautioned against cost and time overruns while executing various projects. To improve the governance in urban local bodies, a bottom up approach has to be implemented with zero tolerance towards corruption, he added.

 

The Vice President said that local bodies need to be provided with the three 3 Fs - Funds, Functions and Functionaries - for effective governance. He said that 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments should be implemented in letter and spirit. 

 

The Vice President said that authorities must ensure that people get better and quality services. It should be noted that in the present digital age, citizens are seeking prompt and quick action on every complaint or petition submitted by them to the municipal authorities, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am extremely happy to inaugurate Pune Municipal Corporation’s new building which is equipped with modern facilities. 

 

Pune is one of the most progressive cities in Maharashtra and India. It has witnessed rapid growth over the last decade and is fast becoming a model city for peers, international agencies and governments. With this kind of economic and urban growth, the expectations from various sections will be high.

 

Pune is the second largest city in Maharashtra in terms of population. From being known as the retired people’s paradise to being one of the key growth centers of the country, Pune has come a long way in the recent past. All this has been achieved while implementing sustainable practices (Pune is rated as the 1st best city in India in terms of quality of life according to Mercer’s Quality of Living Rankings in 2017). The GDP of Pune city is 69 billion USD which is fifth highest in the country.

 

The city also has a huge presence of academic and educational institutions, apart from a strong industrial base.

 

I am told that the PMC has made provisions to make the new building more citizen-friendly with a single window feature to accept all applications. It also has a Citizen Facilitation Centre.  I am sure the vision of the corporation is to make Pune of the most liveable cities with clean, green, beautiful and liveable neighbourhoods. 

 

With people from rural areas increasingly migrating to urban areas in the country, it is estimated that half the Indian population will be living in the urban areas. While it is wonderful to have a new swanky building, there should also be a new work culture to meet the rising expectations of the people. 

 

As one of the cities selected under the Smart Cities Mission, Pune city today has the chance to become a trail blazer in urban governance by adopting a futuristic and people-centric approach. The Smart Cities Mission seeks to develop cities into sustainable, resilient, inclusive and citizen-friendly urban centres and turn them into hubs of economic activities. It is vital to ensure that there are no cost or time overruns while executing various projects under the Smart Cities Mission. 

 

Local bodies should always place citizens at the centre of civic governance. The greater the participation of the people in formulating and planning various projects and services, the better will be the execution and delivery of the services. I am happy to note that Pune Municipal Corporation has issued municipal bonds for augmenting resources to take up various projects.

 

Friends, burgeoning population in urban areas had led to haphazard and unplanned growth in many cities. As a result, cities are finding it difficult to cope with the increasing demand for civic amenities and services. Inadequate finances have also handicapped the functioning of   municipal bodies and there is a need to augment their resources to improve civic infrastructure.   

 

To improve the governance in urban local bodies, a bottom up approach has to be implemented with zero tolerance towards corruption. Tax-paying public will rightfully demand accountable, effective and transparent governance and both officials and non-officials must work towards achieving this endeavor.

 

While reducing the interface between officials and citizens, it should be ensured that the local bodies are provided with the three Fs—funds, functions and functionaries— for effective governance.

 

It should be noted that in the present digital age, citizens are seeking prompt and quick action on every complaint or petition submitted by them to the municipal authorities. Simply put, people want better and quality services.  

 

The Pune Municipal Corporation, which was established in  1950, is catering to the needs of 34 lakh people. 

 

I am told the other features of the new building include a post office, public transport bus pass center. In addition, the building will have a dome-shaped general body meeting hall having capacity of 224 Persons, standing committee hall, offices of mayor, deputy mayor, party leaders and municipal secretary. I am happy that the construction of the new building is according to the norms of the Indian Green Building Council with eco-friendly measures.

 

I am also happy to know that Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has conceptualized “Plan 2020-Pune towards Urban Transformation”. Under this plan, several key projects such as Pollution Abatement & Rejuvenation of Pune Rivers, Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS), Pune Metro project, High Capacity Mass Transit Route, Comprehensive Pune Bicycle Plan, Smart City Plan, Storm Water Drainage Project, Solid Waste Management Project, Sustainable Livelihood “Lighthouses of Pune” project to empower under privileged youth and 100 per cent Digital Literacy Project, among others are taken up. I am sure these will impact Pune city’s development in a positive way and help in providing better delivery of urban services to citizens.

 

Various other projects of PMC like City-wide Cycle Plan, Policy for Pedestrian safety, proposals to increase share of public and non-motorized transport, provide safe and equitable water supply to the entire population for the next 30 years and the Riverfront Development Project will go a long way in making Pune one of the best livable cities.

 

I am told that Pune now features in the list of very few Indian cities by floating Municipal Bonds worth Rs.200 crore. It further plans to raise additional Rs. 2,000 crore through municipal bonds  to fund Rs. 3,000 crore to 24x7 Water Supply Project.

 

I am happy that various projects under the Smart City Mission are progressing rapidly. With its forward looking attitude, PMC’s aspiration to become one of the most digitized Municipal Corporations through its citizen-centric initiatives is laudable. I am happy that PMC is also collaborating with many international bodies to bring the best know-how.

 

Lastly, I would like to emphasize that it is important for the civic body and its official and non-official representatives to constantly engage with the citizens for improving governance and proving better services.

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for making agriculture viable, profitable and sustainable to improve the lot of farmers and ensure home-grown food security.

 

Inaugurating a two-day National Consultation on Making Agriculture Sustainable and Profitable at Vaikuntha Mehta National Institute of Cooperative Managemen, Pune in Maharashtra today, the Vice President said concerted, coordinated and focused action is required to double the farmers income in the coming years. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Fadnavis, former Union Minister for Agriculture, Shri Sharad Pawar, renowned Agricultural Scientist, Prof. M.S. Swaminathan, former Agriculture Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao, Indian Agricultural Economist, Shri Ashok Gulati, several farm experts, farmers and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

Saying that evolving a multipronged strategy to make agriculture viable, profitable and sustainable was the main purpose of this consultation, the Vice President stressed the need to identify gaps in policy formulation. Our policies should be more pro farmer and there should be a pronounced bias towards agriculture, he added.

 

The Vice President emphasized that 4 Is - Irrigation, Infrastructure, Investment and Insurance sectors - need to be strengthened for an integrated development of farm sector. He further said that it was important to make agriculture sustainable through a judicious use of scarce resources like water, electricity and by avoiding indiscriminate use of fertilizers and pesticides.

 

Observing that populist programs like loan waivers and free power would not provide lasting solutions, the Vice President said that farmers must be provided timely credit at affordable interest rates.  Farmers have to be given the latest know-how and trained in the do-how to improve farm productivity, he added.

 

The Vice President said that along with increased production, we need efficient distribution of food grains. Only then can we move our country forward to achieve the goal of zero hunger and adequate nutrition for all, he added.

 

The Vice President wanted e-NAM implementation to be further streamlined and expedited. Expressing his concern over the restrictions on export of agriculture produce, he advocated to strike a balance between the interests of farmers and consumer. He said that consumers are vocal and well organize, he added. 

                                                               

The Vice President said that Lab-to-Land transfer of technologies need to be enhanced. Referring to the need to promote diversification of crops, he said that farmers should be encouraged to cultivate high value crops like fruits, vegetables, condiments, pulses, spices and sugarcane. 

 

The Vice President said that it is important to encourage farmers to take up allied activities like poultry, dairy, fisheries and aquacultures to not only enhance farmers income but also to provide a cushion against the adverse impact of failed crop.

 

Referring to the Prime Minister’s call for doubling farmer’s income by 2022, the Vice President said although many initiatives were taken to boost agricultural growth, there is a need to examine if policy changes are required. Let us do some prudent thinking, apply our minds and offer solutions to improve the lot of farmers, who are the backbone of our economy, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

 

“Agriculture today is at cross-roads and is facing many challenges.  We need to evolve multipronged strategy to make agriculture viable, profitable and sustainable. That is the purpose of this consultation. 

We have made significant progress over the years. From a food deficient country at the time of our independence, we have become self-sufficient in food grains.  As FAO has noted, “From 50 million tons in 1950, India's food grain production rose more than five times, to over 257 million tons in 2014-15. India is the world's largest milk producer, producing over 130 million tons annually. The dairy sector is also one of the largest employers of rural people, especially women. With an annual production of over 10 million tons, India ranks second in global fish production and aquaculture, next only to China.”

The challenges today are mainly two. 

The first is to make agriculture sustainable through a judicious use of scarce resources like water, electricity as well as protect the soil by avoiding indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. 

The second is to make agriculture more profitable so that existing farmers lead a better quality of life and more young people get attracted to this profession. 

Water scarcity and falling water tables have been a key concern in recent years. Niti Aayog's recent analysis of water use and ranking of the states on a composite water management index (CWMI) highlights the need to adopt agricultural practices that make optimum use of water. 

Although, successive Governments have accorded priority to agriculture right from independence, the sector continues to face problems.  It is time for all us to get our act together. Parliament, political parties, press, policy makers and Planning Commission should focus on an integrated approach to agriculture.  

After Independence, the Father of the Nation “Mahatma Gandhi” gave the slogan “back to villages”. However, we have not heeded his advice. That is why we are facing the present problems.

As all of you are aware, the Prime minister has called for doubling farmers’ income by 2022. Although, both Centre and various State Governments are taking several initiatives to boost the agricultural growth, we have to critically examine if there are any policy changes or programmatic improvements that can make them more effective.

Let us do some prudent thinking, apply our minds and offer solutions to improve the lot of farmers, who are the backbone of our economy.

It is obvious that a concerted, coordinated focused action is required on a number of issues that impact the growth of agriculture sector and the quality of life of people who depend primarily on this sector.

We cannot be complacent about the food security situation as it exists today. The growing needs of our country’s increasing population require our own home-grown food security strategy as suggested by eminent scientist and Father of Green Revolution, Prof. M S Swaminathan. 

Firstly, the four I’s namely Irrigation, Infrastructure, investment and Insurance sectors need to be strengthened for development of farm sector. Second, Lab- to- Land transfer of technologies need to be enhanced. Third, strengthening of marketing systems is the need of the hour. 

Given the small size of land holdings, it is imperative that we should enhance our productivity and focus on “intensification”.

Increased productivity is possible if farmers have greater access to knowledge, technology and credit.

We have to innovate. 

We have to work with farmers to infuse knowledge and technology. Knowledge sharing and encouraging adoption of new technologies is an integral and key part of this eco-system. However, the most important aspect is the effective transfer of the transformative technologies to the farmers. The farmers have to be given to the latest know-how and trained in the do-how as well to improve farm productivity. 

We need to bring a major shift from in Indian agriculture, moving it from a low-productivity stage to a high productive level and at the same time ensure that it is sustainable and equitable.

At the same time, diversification of crops must be promoted. Farmers should be encouraged to cultivate high value crops like fruits, vegetables, condiments, pulses, spices and sugarcane. 

Along with increased production, we need efficient distribution of food grains. Only then can we move our country forward to achieve the goal of zero hunger and adequate nutrition for all. 

Along with diversification we need value addition. 

Scientists must work with the government’s extension machinery like Krishi Vignan Kendras to advise the farmers on the cropping patterns and post-harvest processes and food processing technologies. The Government is rightly focusing on developing rural roads, supplying reliable power, establishing godowns, cold storage facilities, refrigerated vans and market yards. The insurance schemes kisan credit cards and the Pradhan Mantri fasal bima yojana (PMFBY) are steps in the right direction and need to be further strengthened.

Timely financial credit facilities at reasonable interest rates and farmer-friendly insurance policies are vital to boost agricultural growth. 

Forecasting the seasonal conditions in advance, testing the soil and ensuring water availability will go a long way in mitigating the problems of farmers.

 

Selling agricultural produce and getting a fair return is a big challenge for most farmers. The farmers still rely on local markets and have to resort, very often, to distress sale. Reliable, real time information is the key. E- NAM implementation needs to be further streamlined and expedited.  

Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) act needs to be amended by introducing single-point levy of market fee across a state and a unified single trading license.

We must enable farmers to export the produce for getting better returns. In many of our policies, consumers are given more importance because of their large number, but farmers’ concerns should not be ignored. How do we balance the two conflicting interests in practical terms? That is the major challenge!

Loan waivers are not a permanent solution. In long-term, it will affect the agriculture sector and hurt the farmers. 

As huge population is dependent on agriculture for livelihood, increasing the income and the purchasing power of this group is extremely important.

Friends, the major challenge is to make agriculture economically viable. The solution lies in identifying the gaps in policy formulation.  We should make our policies more pro-farmer. Second we should streamline implementation processes keeping the end consumer- the farmer- always in view. 

Another important aspect is to encourage farmers to take up allied activities like poultry, dairy, fisheries and aquaculture which can not only enhance farmers’ income but also cushion them against the adverse impact of failed crop season. 

As I hail from an agriculturist’s family and have personal experience of the distress faced by farmers, I am eager that we should find some practical solutions to their current problems. 

We have a number of success stories of farmers who have doubled their incomes. These were show cased in the Prime Minister’s interaction with farmers yesterday.  

The question is: how do we draw lessons from these excellent experiments and reform our governance pattern and implement a “transformative” agenda effectively across the country.  

I hope in this two-day national consultation, we get some meaningful and practical solutions to improve the farming sector. We also need to come out with suggestions to fine-tune the existing policies and programmes to enhance the income of farmers.

I am happy that seniors like Shri Sharad Pawar ji along with CM of Maharashtra Shri Devendra Fadnavis ji and Sobhanadreeswara Rao garu who are passionate about the welfare of farmers are with us today. I am glad that we have in our midst Dr M.S Swaminathan ji, the father of Indian Green revolution, renowned thinkers like Prof. Gulatiji and a number of eminent Vice Chancellors, agricultural scientists, economists, researchers and policy makers as well as farmers.

I think it is appropriate that we are meeting in this institute that fosters “cooperative” effort and an institution that has the motto drawn from our ancient heritage: “Saha veeryam karavaavahai” which celebrates the spirit of active collaborative learning and collective, concerted action. 

That’s what India needs today. 

We need a comprehensive, 360 degree perspective on the issues at hand. This can come in when experts and stakeholders come together for this kind of a brainstorming meeting, when they can ask relevant questions and seek tangible solutions. We also need swift and sincere action.

I am therefore quite hopeful that with your active involvement, we shall be able to come up with a few concrete suggestions at the end of the two day meeting.

Incidentally, we are also celebrating the International Yoga day today. In this celebration, we are also celebrating India’s holistic perspective and the ability to perceive life as an integrated whole combining the physical, mental and the spiritual aspects. Yoga teaches us to focus and concentrate. It enhances our efficiency and the sense of well being. It is an attitude that can help us achieve our objectives.

I hope all of you from various organizations like CII, FICCI as well from government and the academia will focus sharply on key issues we have set out for examination. This is, I think, a labour of love, an expression that demonstrates how deeply you care for the core issues in our society. 

I look forward to the outcomes of your fruitful deliberations.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Yoga is a holistic approach towards health and well-being with physical, emotional and spiritual dimensions to it. Addressing the gathering while participating in the International Day of Yoga 2018 celebrations, in Mumbai today, he said that the ancient science of Yoga is India’s invaluable gift to the modern world. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Fadnavis and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

Quoting Sage Patanjali who compiled the first yoga philosophy, the Vice President said that Yoga helps a person to control his or her own random thoughts and allows achieving stillness, a calmness that creates inner harmony.

The Vice President said that Yoga has nothing to do with religion and it is a holistic science embodying the basic principle of organic, interconnectedness of different facets of life. It is unfortunate that some people attribute religious overtones to this ancient scientific system, he added. 

The Vice President called on people to make Yoga a part of daily routine to combat modern day health problems. He said that the time has come to introduce yoga as part of school curriculum so that India becomes a nation of healthy and happy people in the coming years.

The Vice President Yoga promotes concentration and focused attention. Apart from enhancing physical and mental agility, Yoga practice makes a person to adopt a balanced attitude towards life at all times, he added.

Outlining the importance of Yoga in daily life, the Vice President said that the worrisome trend of youngsters resorting to extreme steps like ending their lives can be curbed if they develop sense of equanimity and calmness of mind, which can be developed through yoga and meditation.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 


	""I am happy to be with all of you here on International Yoga Day. This is a momentous occasion, a moment of celebration. This is a celebration of dedication to the ancient Indian Science of Yoga.
	Yoga is a holistic approach to well being. It has physical, emotional and spiritual dimensions. 
	Sage Patanjali who compiled the first yoga philosophy defines yoga as an ability to control one’s own random thoughts and achieve a stillness, a calmness that creates inner harmony. This philosophy is usually referred to as Ashtanga Yoga.
	Yoga is a holistic science embodying the basic principle of organic, interconnectedness of different facets of life. It is not a mere set of exercises. It goes beyond the physical exercises and connects the body with thought processes. It seeks to build a lifestyle that values calmness, harmony and positive thinking.  It is probably one of the most effective therapies for many psycho-somatic disorders.  
	It advocates purity of mind, speech and body, contentment, acceptance of others, perseverance, self study, self reflection, contemplation of the supreme being.
	The word Yoga is derived from two roots. One signifying “connection” and the second signifying “concentration”. It connects physical health with mental equilibrium and emotional tranquility. It promotes concentration and focused attention. Apart from enhancing physical and mental agility, yoga practice makes a person to adopt a balanced attitude towards life at all times.
	The worrisome trend of youngsters resorting to extreme steps like ending their lives can be curbed if they develop sense of equanimity and calmness of mind, which can be developed through yoga and meditation.
	It is a matter of concern that the WHO had recently stated in its report that 61 percent of all deaths in India every year are because of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), which include cardiovascular diseases , cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, among others.
	Yoga should become a part and parcel of our daily routine to combat the modern-day health problems, both physical and mental. There is also a misconception that Yoga is only a sort of physical exercise meant to help the fitness of an individual. Nothing could be farther than this. It is a holistic system where the mind and body act in unison and get completely rejuvenated as physical postures, breathing exercises and meditation help in overall well-being of an individual. And of course Yoga also helps in the spiritual quest of an individual through understanding of the inner Self and achieving complete peace with the surroundings. 
	Yoga adopts a holistic approach towards health and well-being. While Yoga has nothing to do with religion, some people unfortunately attribute religious overtones to this ancient scientific system. 
	Thanks to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, the United Nations declared June 21 as the International Yoga Day and is now being celebrated across the globe. The ancient science of Yoga is India’s invaluable gift to the modern world.
	The time has come to introduce yoga as part of school curriculum so that India becomes a nation of healthy and happy people in the coming years.""

This Consultation is organized in the context of the ongoing debate and efforts at various levels to double farmers’ incomes by 2022. 

The two day brain storming on various issues relating to farm sector will be attended by the Union Minister for Agriculture, Shri Radhamohan Singh, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Fadnavis, former Union Minister for Agriculture and senior  Parliamentarian, Shri Sharad Pawar, former Agriculture Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri V. Sobhanadreeswara Rao, veteran Farm Scientist, Prof. M.S. Swaminathan, renowned farm sector expert and economist, Prof. Ashok Gulati, senior officials of Central Government agencies like ICAR, farm scientists, representatives of Farmers Unions, CII, FICCI, NAFED and other stakeholders.

The two-day Consultation is being organised by the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) of which the Vice President of India is the Chairman and Shri Vaikuntha Mehta National Institute of Cooperative Management, Pune.

The two-day Consultation will focus on six themes viz. Creating an enabling policy framework; Intensification of farming diversification to high value agriculture and supplementation of incomes through allied activities; Marketing and Agri-logistics; Agricultural Trade Policy; Transfer of technology from labs to the land and Agricultural credit and insurance.

The concept paper for the National Consultation prepared by IIPA refers to the felt need and an opportunity to reorient governance and further improve policy and programmes to transform farmers’ lives. The two day deliberations will result in practical recommendations to fine tune existing policies and programmes to enhance farmers’ incomes.  They will also focus on the inherent biases in the existing policy framework and suggest a way forward to make it more balanced. Policy interventions required to enable farmers move towards green and sustainable agricultural practices and also to address the paradox of rising foodgrain production and per capita incomes co-existing with increasing number of malnourished children are also on the agenda.

The concluding session will be presided over by the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radhamohan Singh.

The National Consultation on farm sector issues is the second in the ‘Swarajya to Surajya’ series of National Consultations initiated by the IIPA at the behest of the Vice President, Shri Venkaiah Naidu. The first one on ‘Strengthening of Local Self Governments’ was held in Marczh this year in Hyderabad.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has received the book ""Vedvigyan Alok"" (Maharishi Aitareya Mahidas Praneet - Aitareya Brahmina ki Vaigyanik Vyakhya) authored by Acharya Agnivarat Naishthik, here today. The book is divided into four broad volumes.

 

The Book Vedvigyan Alok is the scriptural verse in Vedas' prose. The Brahman textbooks are placed second in order of preference of Vedic literature. These texts were composed only by the Brahmin community; hence their names are called “Brahmins”. Their language is Vedic Sanskrit which has been considered extremely complicated. All these are written according to the Vedas that means all the four Vedas get different Brahmins.

                The Vice President and Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu urged the MEDIA to effectively function as Means of Empowerment for Development through Informed Actions of people. He also stressed on the need for a positive and constructive public discourse in the country on all major issues and reminded the media of it’s role in the same. 

Addressing the professionals of Rajya Sabha Television (RSTV) here today, Shri Naidu said “Public discourse should not be negative, acrimonious and divisive. It should unite the people and should not seek to divide them”. Shri Naidu hosted High Tea for about 100 RSTV professionals on the occasion of the channel one million YouTube subscriber base this month.

Shri Naidu complimented RSTV for gaining 5,74,378 new subscribers during the last ten months as against 4,25,622 subscribers acquired during the earlier six years since the launch of the channel in August, 2011. 

Shri Naidu said “A nation’s forward march is impacted by the public discourse in the country. Such a discourse needs to be positive and constructive aimed at collectively addressing the challenges being faced by the nation”.

The Vice President further said “Media, as the fourth pillar of democracy has an important role in facilitating such a positive discourse. It needs to highlight the problems, deficiencies in policy and governance at various levels and present different perspectives so that people can make informed decisions. Media can be and in fact needs to be critical without, however, being motivated”. 

Stating that RSTV is an institution of Parliament, Shri Naidu said that the editorial policy and coverage of the channel should be guided by the mandate of the Parliament which is catalysing the cause of socio-economic development by addressing the contemporary and future challenges.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that development and environment need not be antithetical to each other, but must foster a complementary and symbiotic relationship. He was interacting with the research scholars, students and faculty of the North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology (NERIST), in Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh today. The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, Brig. (Dr) B.D. Mishra, the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Shri Pema Khandu and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that institutes like NERIST have a special responsibility to take the lead in developing environment-friendly technologies in the wake of climate change and its adverse impact. He further said that all scientific endeavors must aim at finding solutions to the problems faced by the society. Science has no meaning if it does not the touch the lives of the people. Scientists and technocrats cannot remain in ivory towers, he added.

 

The Vice President said that teachers have a major role to play in helping the students strike a healthy balance - while making proper use of technology. Their collective energies have to be channelized towards making technology a potent tool for intervention in bridging the developmental gaps, he added.

 

Complementing the NERIST for adopting a modular pattern of education, the Vice President said that employability ratio of our engineering and management graduates remains a cause of concern.

 

The Vice President advised the young graduates and youth of the state to make full use of the skill development programme run by the government. He called on institutions like NERIST to play an active role in imparting skill-based education at various levels. Give your best with all honesty and be proud of all your ventures in life and contribute significantly towards the avowed task of nation building, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

“I am indeed delighted to be here amidst the verdant surroundings of Itanagar and among the research scholars, students and faculty of the North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology (NERIST).

Starting its footprint in 1984 with a modular pattern of education by offering certificate, diploma and degree in different branches of engineering, NERIST in subsequent years has paved the way for many more institutions to follow with a similar academic structure. With its status of a deemed to be university, NERIST has been offering post graduate and doctoral programs and has made a mark in the recent years in terms of cutting edge research and consultancy programs. The alumni of this institute have contributed significantly in bridging the techno-management gap between the North Eastern Region and the rest of the country.

Arunachal Pradesh with its rich diversity in terms of flora and fauna and unique customs and traditions followed by the indigenous people, has proven to be an island of peace with sustained development, while keeping its cultural fabric intact. I am happy that NERIST has been living up to its mission of providing technical manpower and appropriate solutions to some of the pressing problems of the north east and the nation.

It should be remembered that the institute, located in one of the 18 biodiversity hotspots, has a special responsibility to take the lead in developing environment-friendly technologies in the wake of growing concerns over climate change and its adverse impact. Development and environment need not be antithetical to each other, but must foster a complementary and symbiotic relationship.

But the road to development and progress of a society rests firmly on the foundations of education. The role of education is no longer confined to producing skilled manpower. In the present times of erosion of values, it is crucial to impart values and morals to the students, make them aware of their responsibilities and cultivate a sense of tolerance, an attitude of sharing and caring. It is important to make students develop a humane approach towards dealing with the problems of the society coupled with a fair sense of justice, self-discipline, dedication and passion to overcome the formidable odds. 

While science and technology has made our lives easier today, a sense of alienation haunts our younger generation in that we find them glued to their gadgets more often than not. The benefits of connectedness is fast proving to be a contradiction—although we remain connected with the help of technology,  we are also distancing ourselves from the real people-- the people with flesh, blood and soul. 

Teachers have a major role to play in helping the students strike a healthy balance—while making proper use of  technology, they should give priority to remain connected to people. Their collective energies have to be channelized towards making technology a potent tool for intervention in bridging the developmental gaps, even as they remain rooted to culture and tradition. 

As one of the oldest and premier institutes of the North East India, NERIST has the potential to become the hub for technological innovation, patents and cutting edge research. Such a leap will remove the constraints of geographical inaccessibility and location disadvantage. But to affect such a change, the zeal, passion and determination have to come from within and each stakeholder has to contribute towards achieving this goal. An educational institute can neither afford to remain oblivious to the challenges of the rapidly changing world nor can it be content by basking in the past glory. NERIST will not only have to keep abreast of the latest trends, but also come out with futuristic technologies.

Technical education in India is at crossroads today. Overall employability ratio of our engineering and management graduates remains a cause of concern. In the recent years, with fluctuating job markets and scourges of downsizing and rightsizing, the challenge has become all the more acute not only for the students but for the degree-awarding institutions like NERIST as well. I commend NERIST for having adopted a modular pattern of education. It has paved the way for some other prominent institutions of the country to follow the same pattern over the years. The model has proven to be successful and it is evident from the illustrious alumni of this institute. However, no model is immune to change. If its success ratio has to be kept intact, then it is imperative to take stock of the evolving scenario and make amends to the model. Apart from making them employable, NERIST can encourage its students to go for startups by garnering support from the alumni and corporate sector. The students and their parents have invested their time, energy, money and above all, hope to see themselves or their wards successful and employed at the end of the day. And NERIST, like every other institution, is answerable and accountable to them. 

At the same time, the students must shoulder the responsibility of nation building and contribute positively towards actualizing the goals of the institute. Your identity and growth are intricately linked with the fame and progress of your institute, the state and the nation at large. 

With the aim to enhance the levels of employability of our youth, the Government had launched skill development programme. This is where institutions like NERIST can play a more active role and impart skill-based education at various levels. While the location of the institute may pose  a challenge, this challenge can be transformed into an opportunity if we are able to properly identify the nature of problems the region has to deal with and provide long-term solutions to bring it at par with other developed regions of the country.

Dear brothers and sisters, scientists and technocrats cannot remain in ivory towers. Science has no meaning if it does not the touch the lives of the people. All scientific endeavors must aim at finding solutions to the problems faced by the society.  Technology must be accessible to the masses. It should become the vehicle to maximize opportunities through calibrated innovation and tapping the locally available resources. The north east in general is a huge storehouse of both material and human resources. It is also known for a rich and varied traditional knowledge system. NERIST can be a pioneer in identifying and archiving these resources into a hub. These resources can be suitably contemporized to provide customized solutions to the problems of the region. I am happy that women enjoy an almost equal space in terms of decision making and community participation in the north eastern states. NERIST can lead the way by providing need-based training to women on entrepreneurship and setting up of small scale businesses. That will be a huge contribution towards women empowerment and NERIST should act as a harbinger of change in the society.

It is important for NERIST to ensure that all the new courses starting from the basics of engineering to the cutting-edge research align with the growing needs of the country. The north east in general, and Arunachal Pradesh in particular are a storehouse of abundant natural resources. It is a biodiversity hotspot, full of tourism and hydropower potential. The need of the hour, therefore, is to make optimum utilization of these resources by striking a balance between nature, the traditional knowledge systems, and the indigenous rights. The onus is on the researchers to come up with innovative solutions towards achieving this goal and this is where NERIST can play a leading role.

Getting a degree is important. But this is certainly not the end of your journey and a whole new world awaits you. After getting your PhD, whatever you do, wherever you go, you have to be aware that on your shoulders rest the reputation of your family, your state, your community and your institution. You have a responsibility to do your bit and contribute your expertise towards finding solutions to the problems faced by this region and the country. 

I hope you will give your best with all honesty and be proud of all your ventures in life and contribute significantly towards the avowed task of nation building.

Thank you. Jai Hind.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that peace, both beyond and within the boundaries is crucial for rapid development of our country. He was addressing the gathering after laying foundation stone for Septage Management System and Storm Water Drainage System for the benefit of the people of Itanagar under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) Scheme, in Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh today. The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, Brig. (Dr) B.D. Mishra, the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Shri Pema Khandu, the Deputy Chief Minister, Shri Chowna Mein and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

The Vice President said that India believes in resolving differences through negotiations in an atmosphere of trust and good will and added that no problem or issue is beyond solution if the intentions are right. Our country has all along demonstrated right intentions and we don’t set our eyes on other’s properties and would never allow others target ours, he added.

 

The Vice President called for determined efforts to address the few unresolved issues so that this cradle of nature would prove to be a real heaven for its people. It is only in an atmosphere of peace that the full potential of this region could be realized, he added.

 

The Vice President said that Atal Mission will help Arunachal address infrastructure issues relating to water supply, septage management and sewer networks, storm water drains, non-motorised urban transport and open spaces and parks.

 

The Vice President also recalled the launch of the AMRUT Mission in June, 2015 as the then Minister of Urban Development. 

 

The Vice President has said that winds of change are sweeping across the country driving the much needed transformation. He further said that new energy, new resolve, new hope, new approaches and new thinking are driving this change. North-Eastern Region is an important vehicle of this change and can lead the march of our country on the path of progress by reaching new horizons, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the fight against corruption must become people’s movement. Reaching out to the people, delivering system are important in the context of North-East and the Digital, Online, DBT, JAM are the way forward. Transparency and accountability are very important for the success of development and for speedy development, he added. 

 

The Vice President complimented the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Shri Pema Khandu for his efforts to bring the transparency and accountability in the State of Arunachal Pradesh.   

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

“I am indeed delighted to be here with all of you today on the happy occasion of laying foundation stone for some important projects for the benefit of the people of Itanagar under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). I am glad to have not missed this occasion as my visit to Itanagar  was virtually derailed by the weather and I was advised to drop my visit on that count. But I was keen to come here on two counts. 

I thought that when the people of the North-East could live with the challenges of difficult terrain and associated problems on a daily basis, why should not I take a few risks to keep my tryst with Itanagar and make my first visit as Vice President and meet all of you. 

Second reason being that I had the good fortune of being associated with the conceptualization and launch of the AMRUT Mission in June, 2015 as the then Minister of Urban  Development. This mission was one of the four major new urban missions launched abut three years back to make a radical difference to the urban landscape of our country. The other missions being – Smart City Mission, Swacchh Bharat Mission and Prime Minister’s Awas Yojana (Urban).  

At that time, while formulating these new urban missions, the central government has ensured that the towns in North-East would benefit substantially though urban population is relatively smaller when compared to other States and regions. It was so done with the objective of enabling the North- East herald a New Era by addressing the serious gaps in urban infrastructure. 

I share your happiness over Arunchal Preadesh getting two smart cities – Itanagar and Pasighat. Itanagar is also among the 500 AMRUT cities in the country. 

Could any one of you have imagined an investment of Rs.1,242 cr investment in Itanagar and Rs.1,535 cr in Pasighat for core urban infrastructure development. This order of huge investments have been approved under Smart City Mission launched in June, 2015 and these plans are under implementation. This is a clear indication of the major transformation taking place in the country. This is also a clear indication of ‘big and bold’ thinking which is needed for the quick transformation of our country. I am happy that North-East is also enthusiastically marching forward with this big and bold thinking unlike in the past. 

The new urban missions were launched three years back with a holistic perspective to make our towns and cities better places to live. Each mission was to address specific deficiency in urban infrastructure so that on completion of the planned projects, mission cities would be radically different from what they were earlier. This was a paradigm shift introduced in urban planning with the personal interest taken by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. 

To elaborate further, Atal Mission is aimed at addressing basic infrastructure deficit relating to  water supply, septage management and sewer networks, storm water drains, non-motorised urban transport and open spaces and parks. Smart City Mission targeted urban mobility, core infrastructure, education and health care, improved service delivery and efficient use of infrastructure through technology solutions. Swachh Bharat Mission seeks to make urban areas free from Open Defecation and solid waste menace. PMAY intends to ensure a decent home to all. This is what is a holistic vision targeting specific outcomes in specific time frames. This is a clear beginning of urban renaissance in our country. I am confident of ‘acche din’ in our towns and cities on completion of these new urban missions. 

I am indeed happy to be associated with the laying of foundation stone for Septage Management project for Itanagar under which an investment of Rs.16.59 cr and Storm Water Drainage System at a cost of Rs.14.53 cr. These two projects would help in addressing the problems of septage flowing into near by drains and finally entering water bodies and flooding. Given the nature of the terrain of Itanagar, it would not be feasible to build sewer networks. I am happy that it is planned to construct 73 septic tanks to prevent flow of sewer into water bodies, a 100 kilo liter per day capacity septage treatment plant besides procurement of 18 suction vehicles.  The byproducts of treated septage include Biogas, Reused Water and Organic Manure. This avoids public health and environmental hazards. 

Storm Water Drainage System planned will avoid flooding which many times leads to huge loss of life and assets. This is necessary as Itanagar receives annual rainfall of 2,229 mm per year. I am glad the city and state governments are rising to the occasion taking advantage of Atal Mission. I hope that these projects would be successfully executed in time so that the people of Itanagar can heave a sigh of relief. 

I am also particularly happy that  the urban planning and execution capacities of city governments are fast improving under the new urban missions. Adequate capacity building is crucial to address chronic urban problems.    

Friends !

Winds of change are sweeping across the country driving the much needed transformation. New energy, New resolve, New hope, New approaches and New thinking are driving this change. North-Eastern Region is an important vehicle of this change. 

For long, it used to be  said that the North-East needs to be brought into the mainstream. Not anymore. The current flavor is that the so called mainstream needs to rally behind the North-East as this region is the gateway to realizing the Act East Policy as our country strives further expand partnerships with the leading growth centres of the world. 

North East is yet another jewel in the crown of India given its strategic location and huge potential. Arunachal Pradesh has a pride of place in our national scheme of things being a very important border state. 

The people of North East are cultured, educated and enlightened. They can prove to be effective vehicles of enterprise and progress if adequately empowered and  backed up. I would like to assure the people of North East of the full support and good wishes of your fellow citizens and the Government of India. It is an undeniable fact  that the development of North East and the rest of our country are closely interlinked. 

Peace, both beyond  and within our boundaries is crucial for rapid development of our country. True to our civilisational values, we are a peace loving nation. We believe in resolving differences through negotiations in an atmosphere of trust and good will. No problem or issue is beyond solution if the intentions are right. Our country has all along demonstrated right intentions. We don’t set our eyes on other’s properties and would never allow others target ours. 

Who would have imagined that the top leadership of the USA  and North Korea shake hands and sit across the  table in the quest for the much desired peace. This historic summit in Singapore earlier this week underlines the importance of peace for the  progress of humanity across the oceans. Let mankind live and progess in an atmosphere of peace. 

North Eastern Region was troubled by violence for  too long. People of this region are now longing for peace in their quest for a better life. Let all of us make determined efforts to address the few unresolved issues so that this cradle of nature would prove to be a real heaven for its people. It is only in an atmosphere of peace that the full potential of this region could be realized. 

I would like the North Eastern Region to lead the march of our country on the path of progress by reaching new horizons. 

I am indeed  delighted to be here today against all  odds. Otherwise, my heart would have got heavier. 

I thank the Chief  Minister and all  concerned for this opportunity. 

Thank you all ! Jai Norht-East ! Jai Arunachal Pradesh !

Jai Hind ! Jai Bharat !”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Raj Bhavans are not parallel power centres and advised the Governors to play the role of mentors in the development process. He was addressing the Valedictory Session of the 49th Conference of Governors 2018 in Rashtrapati Bhawan, here today, and said that India has made rapid progress in different sectors over the last seven decades. However, the last four years have witnessed the country demonstrating a new development trajectory, he added.

The Vice President advised the Governors to become catalysts of development and set examples of simplicity and promote handlooms and locally-made goods. He told the Governors “You are wise counsel, a mentor, a friend, philosopher and guide”.

The Vice President said this new development trajectory has a new momentum, new sense of purpose and a new direction. The strong political will is clearly getting translated into a number of programmes and the administrative skills of our vast, competent bureaucracy are being used to deliver results, he added.

The Vice President said what was remarkable, however, is that we are breaking new ground and development was now becoming more and more people-centred and people-driven. In fact, development has become a societal mission, he added.

The Vice President said that by maintaining a close rapport with the state government, they can exert a positive influence on the policies and programmes and guide the government. “We have an opportunity to change the course of development by focusing on inclusive and sustainable development. We should not lose this opportunity”.

The Vice President advised the Governors to highlight the sacrifices made by local freedom fighters to inspire the youth. He also wanted them to encourage people to get involved in social movements by leading and guiding. 

The Vice President wanted the Governors to impress upon the State Governments to promote local languages and make them compulsory up to 10th standard. He also asked the Governors to emphasize on ending colonial practices and mindset and highlight our history, tradition, civilization and values. He wanted the Governors to encourage Yoga for physical and mental well- being.

The Vice President also advised the Governors not to air personal views, hold press conferences and post tweets on sensitive and political issues. He advised them to follow the spirit of the advice given by Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi to ‘Reform, Perform and Transform’.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am happy to be with the Hon’ble Governors and Lt Governors in this Conference. 

I have been closely interacting with many of you during my visits to various states and I have seen the excellent contribution you have been making to the growth story of India.

India, as you are all aware, has been making rapid progress over the last seven decades after independence. However, the last four years have seen India demonstrating a new development trajectory.

This new development trajectory has a new momentum, a new sense of purpose, a new direction.

The strong political will is clearly getting translated into a number of programmes. 

The administrative skills of our vast, competent bureaucracy are being used to deliver results.

What is remarkable, however, is that we are breaking new ground. 

Development is now becoming more and more people- centred and people-driven. In fact, development has become a societal mission.

Our government is tapping into the hidden talent and energy in every section of our society. It is building up a team India engaged in a collective endeavour that focuses on national development.

While the elected governments are primarily responsible to plan and implement programmes, there is always a need for a wise counsel, a mentor, a friend, philosopher and guide to steer the ship of development.

This is especially true when narrow perspectives tend to distort the development process. That’s where your role becomes so very important.

You have rightly called yourselves, the catalysts of development. I am glad you have also shared some of your experiences in shaping Raj Bhavans as catalysts of positive change. 

Raj Bhavans are not parallel power centres. Governors should play the role of mentors in the development process.

I am sure that you will have a much greater role in the coming years in fostering change. Change in the way governments deliver services, change in the societal consciousness about critical issues, change in the way society grapples with social evils like untouchability, atrocities against women and discrimination. 

Your enlightened leadership can make a lot of difference. 

Maintaining a close rapport with the state government, you can be a positive influence on the policies and programmes and guide the government.

Through your gentle advice, you can ensure that the benefits of all the programmes reach all sections without any bias or discrimination.

Through your objective, equidistant approach, you can maintain a constant dialogue between various political parties and create a climate that builds consensus on development issues.

Through your position, you can ensure that the policies and programmes are in consonance with the Constitutional provisions

Through your stature as an elder statesman, provide inspiration to civil society and youth to get more actively involved in nation building

Today, we have a unique opportunity. 

An opportunity to change the discourse on development by involving all stakeholders. 

An opportunity to change the course of development by focusing on inclusive, sustainable development. We should not lose this opportunity.

You as constitutional authorities have multiple responsibilities. The country looks up to you with great expectations. The people are attentive to every word you say and they are watching every step you take. 

These expectations are rising every day and you have a vibrant media that constantly shines a spot light on each of us. The question is: How do we speak, how do we act and how do we carry out the main mission of protecting the Constitution in both letter and spirit?

Each one of you have a long experience in various walks of life. So, I am sure you will be able to create a legacy you and the country can be proud of while you are in this exalted position. 

In the current context, you need to be mindful, however, of a few aspects. 

Objectivity and equidistant approach should get reflected in our speeches and activities.

We should “live” the values we espouse in public. Empathy, harmony, integrity, environmental protection and academic excellence as well as integrity are key.

The public should feel that we are responsive and are willing to listen to their viewpoints. They are then more likely to be the initiators of societal change we all want.

As we move into the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must remind ourselves that among his innumerable, timeless messages, there are two that would be helpful in our tasks. 

He had told us: 

“Be the change you wish to see”.

Second, he said:

""I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man [woman] whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him [her]. Will he [she] gain anything by it? Will it restore him [her] to a control over his [her] own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to swaraj [freedom] for the hungry and spiritually starving millions?
Then you will find your doubts and your self melt away.""

I wish you all the best in your endeavours in the service of our country.

 

Jahind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that cycling is the best and cheapest form of exercise to keep our-self healthy and people must be encouraged to adopt such environment friendly mode of transport.

 

Addressing the gathering of cyclists and environmentalists after inaugurating the Bicycle Rally and inaugurating Smart Cycle Station for Public Bike Sharing in NDMC on the occasion of the first World Bicycle Day, here today, the Vice President said that the campaign to promote the use of bicycle must be taken up on a sustained basis and it should not be confined to a ritualistic exercise on World Bicycling Day. The Union Minister for Science & Technology; Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Talking about the rising pollution levels, the Vice President said that many cities the world over have virtually turned into chimneys due to pollution and the gases emitted from vehicles. He said that the time has come for cities and other urban places to promote bicycling in a big way. Dedicated bicycling tracks to be created in our cities and people have to be encouraged to pedal their way to better health, he added.

 

The Vice President said that one should not see World Bicycle Day as a mere symbolic exercise and said that it addresses two most pressing problems like growing environmental pollution and rising lifestyle diseases. Bicycling will greatly help in reducing adverse health outcomes. Apart from burning calories, strengthening muscles and promoting fitness, bicycling daily will reduce the risk for heart diseases and cancers, he added.

 

The Vice President also complemented the authorities of NDMC for starting Smart Cycle Station for Public Bike Sharing in the National Capital and said that similar initiatives are needed elsewhere in the country and the youth in particular must take full advantage of such facilities.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that a self-reliant nation cannot be built unless each individual is empowered to contribute to it.  Delivering the 8th Nanaji Memorial Lecture organized by the Deendayal Research Institute, here today, the Vice President said that the country needs selfless leaders like Nanaji at the grass root level to inspire and empower each citizen to become a proud partner in India’s progress. The Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thaawar Chand Gehlot and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that for deepening the roots of democracy and strengthening pluralism, it is important for people across the social strata to contribute in a conscientious manner towards building an egalitarian, healthy, inclusive and responsive society. Progress can be achieved only when there is peace, social, communal and cultural harmony, he added.  

The Vice President said that the civil society has a critical role to play in societal transformation, in heightening awareness, changing the behavior and attitudes to achieve a better quality of life.

The Vice President said that ancient Indian thought is underpinned by humanism, pluralism and spiritualism. At the centre of this world view has been the belief that human empowerment is key and individual development in all dimensions and in an integrated manner is central to progress as a society and as a nation, he added.

The Vice President said that Nanaji demonstrated how the concept of integral humanism of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya and its applicability on the ground is achieved. In a way, he was the pioneer of the present day corporate social responsibility and had in those days inspired many industrialists to contribute towards social causes, he added.

Describing the need to have collective efforts to transform rural areas into thriving hubs of economic activities, the Vice President said that Nanaji Deshmukh inspired people to take actively participate in rural development.  

The Vice President said that a strong nationalistic fervor and idealism distinguished leaders like late Shri Nanaji Deshmukh and Late Shri Deen Dayal Upadhyay from many other leaders and this passion had its roots in the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh and its ideological moorings. 

Recalling his long association with RSS, the Vice President said that the organization taught him a lot about life, values, culture and the nation and his duties to the nation and fellow citizens. It offered him a perspective of humanity, a sense of purpose for life and a framework for positive action and thousands have spent a life time in public life like him, he added.

The Vice President said that RSS is all about Self-discipline, Self-respect, Self-defence, Self- reliance, Social reform, Social consciousness, Social movement, Selfless service, all guided by the philosophy of Supremacy of the nation. I see no reason for anyone to have any objection to these principles which are primarily aimed at character development based on core ancient Indian ethos and values which advocated the philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, meaning the whole world is one family, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

“I deem it an honor and privilege to deliver the 8th Nanaji Memorial Lecture. 

Nanaji Deshmukh is one of the illustrious icons of modern India who has inspired and continues to inspire millions of Indians to dedicate themselves to nation building.  One of those millions is myself. 

He was a unique individual who placed the interests of the country above everything else. 

Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi said his commitment and dedication to nation-building was unparalleled and described him a paragon of simplicity.  

Nanaji faced hardships during his childhood and his zeal for education made him to sell vegetables and raise money to realize his objectives.  This struggle and urge to bring light into the lives of people in rural areas inspired him to take up social work. 

He was truly a Rajarshi, a social activist par excellence and a man of deeds and not merely words. His work continues to be an inspiration to hundreds of people across the country even today. 

I was closely associated with him and will always remain an ardent admirer of his social philosophy. As he used to say, “My life is not for me, but for others. And who are the others – they are the oppressed and the neglected sections of our society.” 

आदरणीय नानाजी ने 1968 में अपने सहयोगी दीनदयाल जी की पुण्य स्मृति में दीनदयाल शोध संस्थान की स्थापना की। संस्थान दीन दयाल जी के अन्त्योदय, ग्रामोदय जैसे संकल्पों को सिद्ध करने की दिशा में प्रयासरत है। ""मैं अपने लिए नहीं, अपनों के लिए हूँ। अपने वे हैं, जो पीड़ित और उपेक्षित हैं।""  नानाजी का यह दर्शन ही संस्थान का आदर्श वाक्य (Motto) है। 

Nanaji believed and demonstrated through his actions and programmes in Chitrakoot that a self-reliant nation cannot be built unless each individual is empowered to contribute to it.

He believed in active participation of the people in an integrated and holistic development of the country in all sectors including health and education, agriculture. 

He did not allow this to remain an idle, ideal dream.  

He was both a visionary philosopher and a missionary organizer all rolled into one. 

He had successfully implemented Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya’s concept of integral humanism at the grass root level and founded the Deendayal Research Institute (DRI) in 1968 to give shape to his conceptualization for development of rural India. 

Dear Sisters and Brothers, we have given ourselves a great constitution with a preamble in which we have solemnly resolved, to constitute India into a sovereign socialist secular democratic republic and to secure to all its citizens:- Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. 

We envisaged a democratic future for the country in which we, the people, are at the centre. We have been collectively working together to deepen the roots of democracy. Our ancient Indian thought is underpinned by humanism, pluralism and spiritualism. This has been underscored by numerous later day thought leaders as well.  At the centre of this world view has been the belief that human empowerment is key and individual development in all dimensions and in an integrated manner is central to progress as a society and as a nation. 

बहनों और भाइयों, आप जानते हैं कि स्वाधीन भारत का संविधान समाज के समावेशी विकास का दस्तावेज है। 

संविधान सभा में नये संविधान का प्रारूप प्रस्तुत करते हुए डॉ. अंबेडकर ने समाज के समक्ष आने वाले विरोधाभासों पर चिंता जाहिर की थी, उन्होंने कहा था : 

“On the 26th of January 1950, we are going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality....We must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political democracy which this Assembly has so laboriously built up.”

अत: यह वृहत्तर समाज का पुनीत संवैधानिक कर्तव्य है कि विकास समावेशी और सर्वस्पर्शी हो। दीनदयाल जी की अन्त्योदय की परिकल्पना और नानाजी के ग्रामीण  स्वावलंबन के प्रयास इसी आदर्श से प्रेरित हैं।

The concept of integral humanism of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya and its applicability on the ground by Nanaji Deshmukh clearly demonstrates the paramount role of people in the development of the country. 

Nanaji placed people at the centre of development and wanted the society to take the lead.  He believed in collective responsibility and collective efforts to transform rural areas into thriving hubs of economic activities. In a way, he was the pioneer of the present day corporate social responsibility and had in those days inspired many industrialists to contribute towards social causes.

Dear sisters and brothers,

The time has come for us to rethink governance.  

We have a unique opportunity today. 

Wide ranging, far reaching reforms are transforming our country.  

People are eagerly looking forward to new modes of service delivery.  They are not content with being passive recipients of the fruits of development. 

They would like to be active change agents. 

They wish to plant new trees. 

We must make this positive energy, collective will and aspirational idealism work for national development. 

Present government’s Swachh Bharat program is an example of people’s participation in transforming the nation. Swachh Bharat has now become a people’s movement and is contributing hugely in changing the mindset of the masses – from celebrities to common man.

Today, even after 70 years of Independence, the country is facing various challenges like poverty, illiteracy, lack of skills among youth and urban- rural divide to name a few. Collective efforts are needed to overcome these challenges and people should be in the forefront of complementing the initiatives of the government. 

In fact, the constitution lists several fundamental duties of the citizens and one of them is “to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievements.”

For deepening the roots of democracy and strengthening pluralism, it is important for people across the social strata to contribute in a conscientious manner towards building an egalitarian, healthy, inclusive and responsive society. Progress can be achieved only when there is peace, social, communal and cultural harmony. 

We are aware of the many factors that can create divisions among the people: caste, religion, region and language and many others. 

It is high time for us to find a cause that can bind us together, make us work as team India.  And that cause is not hard to find.  In fact, a number of challenges continue to stare us in our face. 

If we can reform our governance pattern, we can transform our lives.  

If we can focus on the output and outcomes, if we can avoid wasting our energies and precious resources on unproductive and counterproductive actions, if we can collaborate rather than confront, if we can think of pooling our individual strengths, we can fast track development.  

The government creates an enabling framework, provides infrastructure, sets the pace, monitors quality and encourages public participation.  

The civil society has a critical role to play in societal transformation, in heightening awareness, changing the behavior and attitudes to achieve a better quality of life. 

Dear sisters and brothers,                                                                              

The country needs selfless leaders like Shri Nanaji at the grass root level to inspire and empower each citizen to become a proud partner in India’s progress.

देशमुख जैसे कर्मयोगी, धन्यजीवी, यदि काम करते रहेंगे तो देश का मुखचित्र बदलेगा और नया सक्षम भारत उभरेगा ।

Inspired by Nanaji’s illustrious example, I have been actively associated with Swarna Bharat Trust, a voluntary organization dedicated to the welfare of youth, farmers and women. I get rejuvenated every time I visit this remarkable social service institution.

As we talk of late Shri Nanaji Deshmukh and Late Shri Deen Dayal Upadhyay, it would be good to know how their vision, philosophy and their mission of tranforming India had evolved and how they were inspired to dedicate themselves to the cause of the society and the nation. I think it is essentially their strong nationalistic fervor and idealism which distinguished them from many other leaders. This passion has its roots in the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh and its ideological moorings. 

This world’s largest voluntary missionary organization has attracted all those who put country above everything else like Nanaji and Deen Dayal Upadhyajaji. Even Mahatma Gandhiji had acknowledged the positive values propounded by RSS.  In 1934, Bapu said:

“When I visited the RSS camp, I was very much surprised by your discipline and absence of untouchability”. He personally enquired about this to Swayamsevaks and found that volunteers were living and eating together in the camp without bothering to know each other’s caste.

My own initiation into public life was through RSS. This organization taught me a lot about life, values, our culture and the nation and my duties to the nation and fellow citizens. It offered me a perspective of humanity, a sense of purpose for life and a framework for positive action. Like me, thousands have spent a life time in public life. 

From my association with RSS, I can assure you all that RSS is all about Self-discipline, Self-respect, Self-defence, Self- reliance, Social reform, Social consciousness, Social movement, Selfless service, all guided by the philosophy of Supremacy of the nation. I seen no reason for anyone to have any objection to these principles which are primarily aimed at character development based on core ancient  Indian ethos and values which advocated the philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, meaning the whole world is one family.

Late Shri Jaiprakash Narayan said of RSS in 1977 and I quote “RSS alone has the capacity to transform society, end casteism and wipe the tears from the eyes of the poor. I have great expectations form this revolutionary organization which has taken up the challenge of creating a new India”. 

In conclusion, I wish to congratulate the Deen Dayal Research Institute for conducting this Nanaji Memorial Lecture. The true tribute to this legendary Indian leader is to recall his deeds, reflect on his words and re-tread the enlightened path he walked in his whole life.

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today reviewed the progress towards holistic development of islands. 

The Union Government had constituted the Islands Development Agency on June 1st, 2017. 26 islands have been listed for holistic development. 

NITI Aayog made a presentation on the elements of holistic development, including key infrastructure projects, digital connectivity, green energy, desalination plants, waste management, promotion of fisheries, and tourism-based projects. 

Reviewing the work done in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Prime Minister emphasized on the need for developing an integrated tourism-centric ecosystem, in the areas identified for tourism development. He called for expeditious pursuit of energy self-sufficiency in the islands, which could be based on solar energy. 

The Prime Minister was also briefed on the decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs, to dispense with the requirement of Restricted Area Permit for foreigners visiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Greater connectivity of these islands with South East Asia was also discussed.

During the review of development work in Lakshadweep, the Prime Minister was apprised of the steps taken to boost Tuna fishing, and the promotion of “Lakshadweep Tuna” as a brand. The Prime Minister appreciated Lakshadweep’s initiatives on cleanliness. 

Development of vital infrastructure in both Andaman and Nicobar islands, as well as in Lakshadweep was discussed. 

The Prime Minister asked the concerned officials to explore the possibility of seaweed cultivation, and other initiatives which could be of help for the agriculture sector.

The meeting was attended by Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh, the Lt. Governors of Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep, CEO NITI Aayog, and senior officials from the Union Government.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today met and interacted with a group of over 140 sugarcane farmers at Lok Kalyan Marg in New Delhi.

The farmers were from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Maharashtra and Karnataka.

The Prime Minister announced that the Union Cabinet would approve the implementation of Minimum Support Price of 150% of the input cost, in its forthcoming meeting, for the notified crops of Kharif season 2018-19. This would ensure a significant boost to the income of farmers.

He also stated that within the next two weeks, the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane for the sugar season of 2018-19, will also be announced. He said that this will also be higher than the 2017-18 price. It will also provide incentive for those farmers whose recovery from sugarcane will be higher than 9.5%. 

The Prime Minister apprised the farmers about the various decisions taken to liquidate the arrears of sugarcane farmers. In the last seven to ten days itself, more than Rs. 4000 crore of arrears have been given to the farmers as a result of new policy measures enforced, the Prime Minister said. He further assured the farmers that State Governments have been requested to take effective measures for liquidation of cane arrears.

The Prime Minister exhorted farmers to use sprinkler and drip irrigation, latest farming techniques, and solar pumps. He urged farmers to install solar panels in their farms as a source of power, as well as additional income. He called for emphasis on value addition of crops. He also urged them to use farm waste judiciously, as a source of nutrients and for additional income. He exhorted farmers to aim for upto 10% reduction in chemical fertilizers by 2022. 

The Prime Minister apprised farmers of his recent interactions with corporates, where he has called for greater private sector investment for value addition, warehousing, storage facilities, better quality seeds, and market linkages for improving farmers income. 

In the course of the interaction, the Prime Minister also recalled the earlier interventions made by the Union Government in 2014-15 and 2015-16, to ease the burden of sugarcane farmers, who were struggling under a huge amount of arrears worth more than Rs. 21,000 crore. This payment was ensured through sugar mills to farmers. 

The farmers thanked the Prime Minister, and appreciated the various steps taken by the Union Government in the recent past, including increase in import duty on sugar from 50% to 100%, and provision of Rs. 5.50 per quintal as performance based grant to sugar mills for payments to farmers, amounting to Rs. 1540 crore.  Farmers also took note of Union Government’s intervention to the tune of Rs. 1175 crore as interest subvention support for 30 lakh metric tonnes of buffer stock by mills, to enable payment to farmers. 

The Prime Minister elaborated on the Government’s approach for 10% blending of ethanol in petrol, as a long-term solution for providing stability in the sugar industry.

                My colleagues from the Council of Ministers, Mr. J.P. Naddaji, Ashwini Choubey ji, Anupriya Patel and Mr. Randeep Guleriaji present on this stage, Shri I. S. Jha, Dr. Rajesh Sharma and all the dignitaries,

This day is really special in terms of treatment, for the people of Delhi, for those coming to Delhi and in a way for all of you. I am glad that we have managed to erect some pillars to help the poor, the common man, the lower middle class and the middle class to overcome the difficulties in their lives and to fight against the diseases. Just a few hours ago, a project worth approximately Rs.1700 crores was launched. Consequently, a new capacity of more than 1800 beds has been added to the Delhi's two important hospitals i.e. AIIMS and Safdarjung.

Friends,

Considering the increasing pressure on AIIMS, the capacity of all its campuses in Delhi is being expanded. Today, the National Center for Ageing, which is built at a cost of more than 300 crore rupees, has also been laid. This center will be of 200 beds. Efforts will be made to complete this in the next 1.5 - 2 years. There will be a lot of facilities for senior citizens. It will also have old age, science research center, where research can be done to address problems related to old age. Besides, work has also been done to modernize the facilities in the hospital by spending more than Rs.1300 crore in Safdarjung Hospital. Under this, services of a super-specialty block on an emergency block have been dedicated to the country. Safdarjung Hospital will become the largest emergency care hospital in the country, with a new capacity of 500 beds for just medical emergencies.

Friends,

There is also a Power Grid Relaxation House among the 5 projects that were launched today. This is one of the best examples of their responsibility towards the public sector and society. It is a great relief for not only the patients but also those who care for them.

Friends,

Timely treatment plays a crucial role in saving lives. But often traffic of Delhi becomes a hindrance. Earlier, there was a huge problem especially with the movement of patients and doctors between different centers and the campus of AIIMS. These problems have also been resolved between the main building of AIIMS and the Jai Prakash Narayan Trauma Center. I have also got the opportunity to inaugurate the one kilometer long underground tunnel sometime back. This tunnel ensures hassle-free movement of patients, their relatives, doctors and essential medicines and equipment.

Friends,

You are well aware of the great responsibility upon us to mobilize affordable, accessible, safe and modern healthcare facilities for our vast and developing country like India. In the last four years, a new direction has been given to public health care. Every policy intervention of the central government aims at providing good quality, accessible and affordable health care facilities to the poor and the middle class. The central government along with the state governments is creating a modern infrastructure related to healthcare services across the country. The relentless efforts of the central government has increased the number of institutional deliveries in the hospitals. Maternal Mortality Rate and Infant Mortality Rate have reduced considerably due to the regular monitoring of the health of pregnant mothers and children and the addition of 5 new vaccines in the immunization programme.

The government is trying to ensure that the health Infrastructure in and around the big cities should be strengthened and similar facilities should be made available in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. For this, the government is working at two broad levels. Firstly, our existing hospitals are being laced with more facilities. Secondly, health care services are being delivered to the remote areas of the country.

Friends,

The number of AIIMS that has been approved in the last 4 years is more than those approved in the last 70 years of independence. Thirteen new AIIMS have been approved of which work on the 8 has already been started. Besides, the construction of super-specialty hospitals in 15 medical colleges across the country is in progress.

Friends,

A health care system is being developed for New India where hospitals will be affordable and adequate with best facilities and the number of doctors and beds will be more. New opportunities are also being created in Medical Education keeping this goal in mind. Our government is working to upgrade hospitals in 58 Districts into Medical Colleges. In this year's budget, the government had decided to set up 24 new Medical Colleges. The Government has tried to have at least one medical college for three Lok Sabha seats. In the last four years, around 25,000 new seats of undergraduate or postgraduate medical courses have been added nationwide. The government has also made the admission process more transparent.

Friends,

The vision of this government is not limited to just hospitals, illness and medicines or modern facilities. A National Health Policy has been framed with the same objective, to ensure the treatment of every person in the country and to reduce the causes that make people sick. Our government has also tried to take out health care from the purview of the Ministry of Health. Ministry of Rural Development is also associated with this vision on health care. The ministry of sanitation and drinking water is also linked with it. The Ministry of Women and Child Development has also been associated with it. And they are all getting support from our traditional health services and also from the AYUSH Ministry. Schemes have been formulated by the government in view of the link between illness and poverty. There has been a lot of effort to implement them. The major cause of poverty is illness. Therefore, preventing disease means reduction of poverty as well. Ceaseless efforts are being made in this direction. The construction of toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, vaccination in remote areas under Mission Indradhanush, National Mission on Nutrition and myriad ambitious schemes like Ayushman India are reducing the expenditure by the poor on diseases. The country was never before so serious about the work on Preventive or Affordable Healthcare.

National Health Protection Scheme or Ayushman Bharat is also an important link in this direction. Under this scheme, work on setting up of Health and wellness centres in about 1.5 lakh i.e. in every major Panchayat is going on. In the future, these centers will provide modern facilities for testing and treatment for identifying the disease. The people living in towns and villages are going to highly benefit out of it. The work is underway to provide free treatment up to Rs.5 lakhs to the poor and the lower Middle class in case of serious illnesses. We are making efforts to link maximum possible states with this scheme. Discussions are going on also with the private hospitals. Broadly speaking, various stakeholders have agreed upon different matters and very soon we are going to come up with the world's largest health insurance scheme.

Friends,

This scheme is not only for giving a life to the poor, but also for bringing about a new revolution that will create an unprecedented opportunity in the medical sector. Due to this scheme, the hospitals surrounding the villages and small towns of the country are sure to form a vast network in the future. It is quiet natural to have a large network of new hospitals because once someone else will bear the burden of medical expenses, the patients will definitely visit the hospitals. Earlier they used to avoid going to the hospitals despite being sick. The hospitals and the doctors will also come forward to provide their services as they will be certain about getting their fees. In a way, a system is developing in which we are going to enter a new era in terms of Human Resource Development, medical sector, infrastructure development and a health conscious society. Employment opportunities in this sector is definitely going to rise. We are all aware of the fact that several workers are associated with a single doctor. There is a possibility of providing jobs to several people. Yes, I believe that the compulsion of accommodating modern medical facilities in big cities will also be reduced. People can easily avail these services close to their homes.

Friends,

In the beginning of this month, I had personally communicated with the beneficiaries across the country to know how much did the common man benefit from the affordable health care schemes in the last four years. According to my estimate, there were about 30-40 lakh people before me interacting through approximately 3 lakh centers. One thing was clear from the discussion that there has been a tremendous decline in the medical bills of the lower middle class and the poor people. Friends, you are well aware of the reason for the same. About 1100 essential medicines have been brought under the ambit of the price control system by the government. This has saved the expenditure of about Rs.10 thousand crores on medicines for those families. This scheme has resulted in the savings of more than Rs. 10 thousand crores in one year. More than 3,600 public-medicine centers have been opened across the country. In these centers, more than 700 medicines and more than 150 tools for surgery are available at cheaper prices. Nearly 75-80 lakh patients have also taken advantage of the 50% low-cost medicines in Amrit Stores. Besides, the reduction in the cost of stents and knee plants has saved the country's poor and middle class nearly 5,500 crore rupees. Their prices have become 1/3rd i.e. they have reduced by three times. Moreover, prices of several medicines have fallen after the GST was imposed and the people have benefitted immensely out of it. Dialysis centers have been created in almost every district of the country. Free dialysis facility is being provided to the poor here. So far, 2.5 lakh patients have taken advantage of this. Earlier, the poor had to travel for hundred or two hundred kilometres for getting a free dialysis. Now they are getting this facility in their own districts. Since it was difficult for them to travel such a large distance, they had to spend huge amounts of money for getting a dialysis done in nearby hospitals. Now this dialysis facility will help them to save about Rs.1500- Rs.2000. Under this programme, about 25 lakh free dialysis sessions have already been conducted. Besides, Yoga has also established its identity as a Preventative Health Care mechanism. Earlier people used to make fun of Yogis, but now yoga has carved a niche for itself in the entire world. Although I cannot claim that yoga can turn a hedonist into a Yogi but it can definitely save him from falling ill. Today, yoga has become a mass movement in the world. We have seen that the International Yoga Day was celebrated a few days back. I was also told that of late, there has been a lot of awareness regarding yoga even in AIIMS. All my doctor friends were also doing yoga. I was delighted!

Friends,

It is the aim of the government to deliver healthcare services to every citizen but it is not possible without your i.e. the entire medical sector's cooperation and support. Just as the country is progressing towards a New India, the people associated with the health sector should also make some resolutions. If I am a doctor or a medical professional, I should achieve these targets by 2022 that will mark 75 years of India's independence. This is the environment that needs to be created. The government is working to make India TB-free by 2025. Financial assistance of Rs.500 will be provided to the TB patients every month, keeping their health in mind.

Friends,

The other countries have set their target to make themselves free of TB by 2030. We have to fulfil our resolution as soon as possible. The world wants to become TB-free by 2030 but we want to achieve this goal by 2025. The entire world is watching India and wondering if she can achieve this goal. I have complete faith in the country's medical sector that it will work on this challenge with full commitment and will bring fame to the country. Maternal Mortality Rate and Infant Mortality Rate are also important issues in this context. Like I said, the country has made great strides in this area in the last four years but to minimize the maternal and infant mortality rates we all need to make greater efforts. Thus, work on mission mode is going on under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva abhiyan, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and National Nutrition Mission. Work must be done by making this mission as life's mission. Maximum people should be associated with this in the form of a mass movement so as to get the desired results as soon as possible. We need to move ahead with this belief.

Friends,

Due to the prevalence of an environment of honesty and transparency, more and more people are coming forward to make their contributions to the nation building. People now believe that every penny of their taxes paid is being used for the welfare of the country. We can see the results of this faith at every level of the society. You might remember that while I had requested the people of my country those who could afford to, from the Red Fort to give up the gas subsidy. I had received such a great response from 1crore 25 lakh families who gave up their subsidies. Otherwise, it is believed that in our country people are reluctant to give up any provision. This is a natural behavior. If you are travelling by flight and the seat next to you is empty, and the flight is about to take off and no passenger has yet occupied it, you start putting your things like mobile phone, book etc. on that seat even if it's not your seat. However, if the passenger comes and sits, you have a feeling of not letting go of that seat. You are reluctant to give it away. There are 25 crore families with this mentality and 1 crore 25 lakh families out of them have given up their gas subsidies just on one appeal of mine. We can clearly see the country's strength and mood. I want to share one more thing with you. You must be knowing that senior citizens get a concession on their tickets. In a similar manner, a few days ago, I had thought of announcing it but the railway authorities included it in the form -"" senior citizens willing to give up their concession"". You will be surprised to know that just by adding this in the railway reservation form, about 42 lakh senior citizen passengers have given up their subsidies in the last 8-9 months. This is the strength of our country. This is the environment in the country. Once I had appealed to the doctors of my country that they should come forward on the 9th of every month to aid the poor pregnant women. They should check them up and guide them. I am glad that thousands of doctors have come forward. They have put a board outside their hospitals and free services are provided on the 9th of every month to the pregnant women. Crores of sisters have benefitted out of it. I would like more of my doctor friends to come forward as we all together have to carry our nation two steps ahead for dealing with these challenges of the country. About 1crore 25 lakh pregnant women have been diagnosed under Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva abhiyan. I would like to praise all the doctors and the medical professionals for their cooperation. I would like this to be taken ahead. This expression of service is being used in Gram Swaraj Abhiyan. We had organized a programme. Some things are not shown on the television for 24 hours or are not written about in the newspapers' headlines. We had organised a Gram SwarajAbhiyan. We had selected 17 villages on the basis of certain parameters and 7 tasks were allotted. Those villages have to complete the 7 tasks 100%. One of the tasks is immunization. This means people from different sectors are being linked to increase the level of immunization in the health sector in the country. It is something commendable. It has been possible only because of your cooperation that today the rate of vaccination has increased to 6%. 6% might sound like a very low amount. But it was not even 1% before. Due to your commitment, the country is moving more and more towards achieving the goal of 100% immunization. 

The resolution of immunization of every pregnant woman and infant in the country will play a crucial role in the formation of a New India by creating healthy families.

Friends,

A healthy society is created only by a healthy family and a healthy nation is created by a healthy society. All of us and specially you are responsible for keeping the nation healthy. Therefore, the President also labelled you as an important lobby for nation building. Come, let us together with the government accomplish the resolution of 'सर्वेभवन्तुसुखिनःसर्वेसन्तुनिरामयाःसर्वेभद्राणिपश्यन्तु। माकश्चित्दुःखभाग्भवेत्॥'  to make this world and its people disease-free and move towards building a New India. I would like to congratulate this department for making all the arrangements and providing all the facilities to Delhi and the country. They had made every effort to complete all these tasks in a time bound manner. This is because I had requested them that only that work should be started which can be completed. Once there was a situation in the Parliament that commitments were made on the sacred floor of the Parliament during Railway budget. I noted that in the last 30, 40, 50 years, almost 1500 things were announced just in the railways sector. When I questioned about those things, they were not even on papers, forget about getting it done on ground. We don't want to deviate to that path. We have not come here to flash our achievements but to accomplish our resolution of bringing about a transformation and to ask for your cooperation. We have started off with our journey to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the country with your cooperation. Friends, I believe that you will also cooperate with us.

Thanks a lot!

                Greetings (Namaskar)! My regards to the Saheb. I consider myself fortunate today that I got the opportunity to attend this program organised to pay respects to the great Sufi poet Sant Kabir Das Ji. I bow down to this holy land.  

Popular and well known Chief Minister, Shriman Yogi Adityanath Ji; my colleague in the Union Council of Ministers Shriman Mahesh Sharma Ji; my colleague in the Union Council of Ministers Shriman Shiv Pratap Shukla Ji; Minister in the state government Dr. Rita Bahuguna Ji; Minister in the state government Shriman Lakshmi Narayan Chaudhari Ji; my colleague in the Parliament and President of Bhartiya Janta Party in Uttar Pradesh my friend Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey Ji; a young, courageous, active colleague in the Parliament who is also a son of the soil Shriman Sharat Tripathi Ji; Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh Shriman Rajiv Kumar; other dignitaries present here and my dear brothers and sisters from all over the country who are present here today,

     I have a feeling of gratification as I visit this sacred land of Maghar,.    

Brothers and sisters, 

Everyone has a desire to visit pilgrim centres. That desire of mine has been fulfilled today. Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to offer flowers to the shrine of Sant Kabir Das Ji, I got the opportunity to offer a chador on his shrine. I also saw the cave where Kabir Das Ji used to meditate. He was providing direction to the society for centuries, a torch-bearer, an epitome of equality and religious harmony, I bow down to Mahatma Kabir on this land of his salvation. It is being said that Sant Kabir, Guru Nanak Dev and Baba Gorakhnath Ji have together discussed spiritual issues while sitting at this place. I feel a kind of fulfillment by visiting Maghar. Today is Jyeshth Shukla Purnima. Also, the Yatra of Bhagwan Bholenath (Lord Shiva) is beginning from today. I convey my best wishes to the pilgrims for a happy yatra. 

An yearlong festival - Kabir Mahotsav – has begun here on the occasion of the fifth death centenary of Kabir Das Ji. He  has left an excellent legacy behind for the mankind and we all are going to benefit from it. Sant Kabir Ji said :

‘Teerth Gaye To Ek Fal, Sant Mile Fal Char.

Sadguru Mile Anek Fal, Kahe Kabir Vichar.’ 

 It means that a person gets one holy reward by going on a pilgrimage but his reward becomes four fold if he is in the company of a saint. 

 This Kabir Festival on the land of Maghar is going to give us such holy reward. 

Brothers and sisters,

The foundation stone for the Sant Kabir Academy has been laid here just a while ago. The institutions for preserving the legacy of Mahatma Kabir will be built here by spending nearly Rs. 24 crore. The social awakening for which Kabir worked throughout his life, there is a plan to develop all these things: a training house for Kabir’s singings, Kabir dance training house, a research center, a library, an auditorium, a hostel and an art gallery. Sant Kabir Academy will also work for the preservation and development of regional languages and popular arts of Uttar Pradesh. 

Brothers and sisters,

The entire life of Kabir was spent in the quest to find the truth and countering the falsehood. Kabir emphasised not on  belief, but on knowing. He was a free spirit, pennyless and austere ; he was like a servant before the servants of God but very courageous in front of emperors. A person with clean heart and sound mind, he was soft inside though appeared tough outside. He became worthy of worship because of his deeds and not because of the occupation of the family he was born into.

The great saint had risen from the dust but he became the tilak applied on the forehead. Mahatma Kabir Das became a seeker of the ultimate truth. He represented an idea that immortalised him . Not only did he give vision to the society but he also awakened its spirit. He came to Maghar from Kashi for this social awakening. He selected Maghar as a symbol. Kabir Saheb had said if someone has the Lord Ram in his heart then for him Maghar is the most sacred place. And he said:

Kya Kasi Kya Usar Maghar, Ram Hriday Baso Mora.

    He came from Kashi and was initiated by Ramanand. Saint Kabirdas Ji used to say:

Hum Kashi Mein Prakat Bhaye Hain, Ramanand Chetaye. 

Brothers and sisters, 

    Kabir can be called the song, flavor and essence of India’s soul. He had expressed the inner feelings of the common Indian. He was a disciple of Guru Ramanand so how could he believe in the caste system. He broke down the barriers of caste based discrimination and declared that the entire mankind was one. And he paved the way for realisation of God present in every soul by demolishing one’s own ego. He belonged to everyone and that is why everyone belonged him. He said: 

Kabira Khada Bazar Mein, Mange Sabki Khair

Na Kahu Se Dosti, Na Kahu Se Bair.

       No dictionary is required to understand his couplets. He explained the most complex mysteries of life to the ordinary people in their language with the simplicity and ease. He said: Please look inwards to discover Lord Ram present in you, Lord Hari is present in your conscience, why do you waste your time in the external rituals. Reform yourself and you will find the Lord. 

Jab Main Tha Tab Hari Nahin, Jab Hari Hai, Main Nahi.

Sab Andhiyara Mit Gaya, Deepak Dekha Mahi. 

     ‘I could not see the Lord as long as I was driven by  ego but when the Lord came I vanished. The darkness of ignorance was gone and I saw the light.’ 

Friends, 

   This is the virtue, this is the holiness in our great land that from time to time sages, wise people, godmen and saints have shown the right path to eradicate the internal vices of the society that creep up with the passage of time. It was only due to the influence of those great souls and saints that the soul of the nation, the equality and harmony in the country survived during the hundreds of years of long period of slavery.

     In order to show the right path to the society, Lord Buddha was born, and a whole lot of saints such as  Lord Mahavir was born, Sant Kabir, Sant Soordas and Guru Nanak continued to show us the right way. Whether it is north or south, be it east or west, in every region of the country such great souls preserved the country’s spirit and protected it from being tarnished by evil traditions. 

    In south, Madhavacharya, Nimbagaracharya, Vallabhacharya, Saint Basaveshwar, Saint Tirugal, Saint Tiruvalluvar and Ramanujacharya. When we look at western India we find Maharshi Dayanand, Mira Bai, Saint Eknath, Saint Tukaram, Saint Ramdas, Saint Gyaneshwar, Narsi Mehta; if we look at north we find Ramanand, Kabirdas, Goswami Tulsidas, Soordas, Guru Nanak Dev, Saint Ruidas,  and when we look at east we find Sri  Ramkrishna Paramhans, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and the saints like Acharya Shankar Dev  who blazened the society’s path.  It was the teachings of these great souls that helped India to overcome hurdles and move ahead. Instead of discrimination in the name of skin and occupation, the path of devotion to the Lord which was shown by Ramanujacharya, following that path Saint Ramanand has struck a blow on the caste system by accepting people from all the castes and sects as his disciples. Sant Ramanand showed Sant Kabir the path of Lord Ram. And Kabir has been asking generations after generations of people to follow the path of Lord Ram. 

Brothers and sisters,

     Ruidas came long after Sant Kabir. A few centuries later came Mahatma Phule, Mahatma Gandhi and Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. All of them showed the path to end  inequality in the society. 

      Baba Saheb gave us the Constitution of the country. He gave us equal status as a citizen. Unfortunately, today an attempt is made to create a platform for vested political interests in the name of these great souls who have been trying to divide the society. Some political parties don’t want peace and development in the society, they want discord, they want chaos. They feel that the more they create the environment of dissatisfaction and chaos, the more political benefit they will get. However, this is also true that these people are far away from the ground realities. They don’t have any idea that what is the fundamental character of our country that follows Sant Kabir, Mahatma Gandhi and Baba Saheb.

    Kabir used to say: look inward and you will find the truth. However, these people have never read Kabir seriously. Sant Kabirdas Ji used to say: 

Pothi Padhi-Padhi Jag Mua, Pandit Bhaya Na Koy. 

Dhai Akhar Prem Ka Padeh So Pandit Hoy. 

      If one orients his mind towards public, towards country, towards society and its development then one will find the ultimate goal – development, the Lord in the form of development. However, they are inclined towards a grand bungalow. I remember what was the attitude of the previous government of this state when Prime Minister’s  Awas Yojana was started to provide the houses to the poor and middle class. 

        Our government wrote to them letters after letters, several times we called them over phone so that the previous government could come forward, it should have informed about the minimum number of houses to be constructed for the poor people. But it was the government which was interested in their bungalows. They did not do anything. And since the time Yogi Ji has formed the government, a record number of houses for poor are being constructed in the house. 

Friends, 

      Throughout his entire life Kabir followed his principles. These were not the worldly principles. He followed the principles devised by him and understood by him. And this was the reason for coming to Maghar. He was not fascinated by the ultimate salvation. However, today we see it very well, the hunger for power of those people who talk about socialism, who talk about masses, who give false assurance to the poor people. 

      Just two days ago we have completed 43 years of emergency in our country. The greed for power is so much that the people who had imposed emergency at that time and those who opposed it then are today walking together shoulder to shoulder to grab the power. They are not concerned about the country or society, they are concerned only and only about their own  interest and the interest of their families. These people are those who build bungalows worth crores of rupees for themselves by betraying the poor, dalits, backwards, deprived and exploited people. They are going to amass property worth crores and crores of rupees for their brothers and relatives. People of the country and the people of Uttar Pradesh must be beware of these people. 

     Friends, you have seen their attitude towards triple talaq. Throughout the country the sisters of Muslim society have been consistently raising the demand for abolishing the triple talaq to get rid of this evil custom.  However, these political parties, these people who play the vote bank politics to grab the power, have been putting hurdles in the passage of triple talaq bill in the Parliament. They want to keep the society permanently week to serve their own interest. They don’t want to see it free from its vices. 

Friends, 

     When Kabir was born, at that time India was under a massive attack. The common man of the country was facing difficulties. Sant Kabirdas Ji had challenged the then emperor. And the challenge of Kabirdas Ji was:

Dar Ki Bat Kaho Darvesa Badshah Hai Kaun Bhesa.

Kabir had said that the ideal ruler is he who understands the plight of the people and tries to alleviate that. King Ram was an ideal ruler. His dream state was democratic and neutral to sects. Alas ! Today, there are several families who consider themselves as the master of destiny of public and they are busy in completely rejecting the teachings of Sant Kabir Das Ji. They have forgotten that the basis of our struggle and our ideals are great souls like Kabir.

     Kabir dealt a blow to the dogmas. He challenged the system that discriminated among people. Kabir wanted to empower those who were oppressed, who were deprived and exploited. He did not want to see them as beggar. 

Sant Kabir used to say: 

Mangan Maran Saman Hai, Mat Koi Mango Bheekh;

Mangan Te Marna Bhala, Yeh Satguru Ki Seekh. 

     Kabir himself relied on his labour for livelihood. He understood the importance of labour. However, our policy makers never understood this philosophy of Kabir even so many years after the independence they continued to made the poor dependent on the politics of vote bank in the name of eradication of poverty. 

    Friends, we have made every effort in the last four years to change that policy and approach. Our government has been following the path of empowering the poor, dalit, persecuted, exploited, deprived, women and youth. We have done the job of empowering people by opening more than 5 crore bank accounts of poor people in Uttar Pradesh under the Jan Dhan scheme; by giving free gas connections to more than 80 lakh women under the Ujjwala scheme; by providing the insurance shield to 1.7 crore poor people at a premium of one rupee per month and 90 paise per day; by constructing more than 1.25 crore toilets in the villages of UP; and by transferring the money directly into the bank accounts of people. We have taken upon ourselves to provide an affordable, easy and best health care service to our poor families under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana. The government has made these things priority for itself: Self respect for poor people and making the lives of poor people easier.

Friends, Kabir respected labour, he was a doer. Kabir said:

Kal Kare So Aaj Kar. 

      Kabir believed in doing the work, he believed in his Lord Ram. Today, the schemes that are being completed at fast speed, the roads that are constructed twice as fast, new highways; electrification of railway lines that is taking place at twice the speed, the airports that are being constructed at fast speed; the houses that are being built at more than twice the speed; the optical fiber network which is being laid to every village body; the speed of all these works is just a reflection of the path followed by Kabir. This is as per the spirit of our government – Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas. 

Friends, 

      As Maghar was considered wasteland and cursed during the time of Kabir similarly even so many years after the independence fruits of development reached only some parts of the country and a large part of the country is still  feeling aliented. Starting from eastern Uttar Pradesh, Northern India, North-East India was starved of development. The way Kabir shook off the curse of Maghar similarly it is the effort of our government that development must reach  every single inch of Indian land. 

Brothers and sisters,

        The entire world recognizes Maghar as the place of final salvation of Sant Kabir. However, even so many years after the independence the condition of this place was not like what it was supposed to be. When farmer President Abdul Kalam had visited this place 14-15 years ago he had a dream for this place. We are going to develop Maghar at a fast speed as a centre of goodwill and harmony on the international map to realise his dreams. 

       The government has taken upon itself the task of development of places like Maghar as the centres of faith and spirituality under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme. Whether it is Ramayan circuit or Bauddha circuit or Sufi circuit, different places are being developed by developing circuits like these. 

Friends, 

      The teachings of Kabir are a very important and an easy medium for protection of humanity, for universal brotherhood and for mutual love. His messages are so filled with the feeling of equality of all the religions and social harmony that they are like a source of light for us even today. 

    What is required is that his message should be communicated to everyone and we should follow it in our conduct. I hope that Kabir academy will play an important role in this thing. Once again I express my gratitude to the devotees who have come to this holy land of saint Kabir from outside. We would be able to realise the dream of a New India by truly following the immortal message of Sant Kabir in our lives. With this hope, I conclude my speech. Thank you very much to all of you.

Saheb Bandgi, Saheb Bandgi, Saheb Bandgi.

(I bow down to the great soul, I bow down to him, I bow down to him).

                नमस्‍कार। साहिब बंदगी। आज हम अपने के बड़ा सौभाग्‍यशालीमानत हाणि कि महान सूफी संत कबीरदास जी के स्‍मृति में हो रहे ई आयोजन में ये पावन धरती पर पाय लागी। आज हमके यहां आके बहुत नीक लगता। हम ये पावन धरती के प्रणाम करत बाड़ी और आप सब लोगन के पाय लागी। 

राज्‍य के लोकप्रिय एवं यशस्‍वी मुख्‍यमंत्री श्रीमान योगी आदित्‍यनाथ जी, केंद्र में मंत्रिपरिषद के मेरे साथी श्रीमान महेश शर्मा जी, केंद्र में मंत्रिपीरिषद के मेरे साथी श्रीमान शिवप्रताप शुक्‍ला जी, राज्‍य सरकार में मंत्री डॉक्‍टर रीटा बहुगुणा जी, राज्‍य सरकार में मंत्री श्रीमान लक्ष्‍मी नारायण चौधरी जी, संसद में मेरे साथी और उत्‍तर प्रदेश भारतीय जनता पार्टी के अध्‍यक्ष मेरे मित्र डॉक्‍टर महेन्‍द्र नाथ पांडे जी। हमारी संसद में एक युवा, जुझारू, सक्रिय और नम्रता और विवेक से भरे हुए, इसी धरती की संतान, हमारे सांसद श्रीमान शरत त्रिपाठी जी, उत्‍तर प्रदेश के मुख्‍य सचिव श्रीमान राजीव कुमार, यहां उपस्थित सभी अन्‍य महानुभाव और देश के कोने-कोने से आए मेरे प्‍यारे भाइयो और बहनों। आज मुझे मगहर की इस पावन धरती पर आने का सौभाग्‍य मिला, मन को एक विशेष संतोष की अनुभूति हुई। 

भाइयो-बहनों, हर किसी के मन में ये कामना रहती कि ऐसे तीर्थ स्‍थलों में जाएं, आज मेरी भी वो कामना पूरी हुई है। थोड़ी देर पहले मुझे संत कबीरदास जी की समाधि पर फूल चढ़ाने का, उनकी मजार पर चादर चढ़ाने का सौभाग्‍य प्राप्‍त हुआ। मैं उस गुफा को भी देख पाया जहां कबीरदास जी साधना किया करते थे। समाज को सदियों से दिशा दे रहे, मार्गदर्शक, समधा और समता के प्रतिबिम्‍ब, महात्‍मा कबीर को उनकी ही निर्वाण भूमि से मैं एक बार फिर कोटि-कोटि  नमन करता हूं। 

ऐसा कहते हैं कि यहीं पर संत कबीर, गुरू नानक देव और बाबा गौरखनाथ जी ने एक साथ बैठ करके आध्‍यात्मिक चर्चा की थी। मगहर आ करके मैं एक धन्‍यता अनुभव करता हूं। आज ज्‍येष्‍ठ शुक्‍ल पूर्णिमा है। आज ही से भगवान भोलेनाथ की यात्रा भी शुरू हो रही है। मैं तीर्थ यात्रियों को सुखद यात्रा के लिए हृदयपूर्वक शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। 

कबीरदास जी की पंचशति पुण्‍य तिथि के अवसर पर सालभर यहां कबीर महोत्‍सव की शुरूआत हुई है। सम्‍पूर्ण मानवता के लिए संत कबीरदास जी जो उम्‍दा संपत्ति छोड़ गए हैं, उसका लाभ अब हम सभी को मिलने वाला है। खुद कबीर जी ने भी कहा है- 

तीर्थ गए तो एक फल, संत मिले फल चार। 

सदगुरू मिले अनेक फल, कहे कबीर विचार।। 

यानी तीर्थ जाने से एक पुण्‍य मिलता है तो संत की संगत से चार पुण्‍य प्राप्‍तहो सकते हैं। 

मगहर की इस धरती पर कबीर महोत्‍सव में, ये कबीर महोत्‍सव ऐसा ही पुण्‍य देने वाला है। 

भाइयो और बहनों, थोड़ी देर पहले ही यहां संत कबीर अकादमी का शिलान्‍यास किया गया है। करीब 24 करोड़ रुपये खर्च करके यहां महात्‍मा कबीर से जुड़ी स्‍मृतियों को संजोने वाली संस्‍थाओं का निर्माण किया जाएगा। कबीर ने जो सामाजिक चेतना जगाने के लिए अपने जीवन पर्यन्‍त काम किया, कबीर के गायन, प्रशिक्षण भवन, कबीर नृत्‍य प्रशिक्षण भवन, रिसर्च सेंटर, लायब्रेरी, ऑडिटोरियम, होस्‍टल, आर्ट गैलरी; इन सबको विकसित करने की इसमें योजना है। 

संत कबीर अकादमी उत्‍तर प्रदेश की आंचलिक भाषाओं और लो‍क विधाओं के विकास और संरक्षण के लिए भी काम करेगी। भाइयो और बहनों, कबीर का सारा जीवन सत्‍य की खोज तथा असत्‍य के खंडन में व्‍यतीत हुआ। कबीर की साधना मानने से नहीं, जानने से आरंभ होती है। वो सिर से पैर तक मस्‍तमौला स्‍वभाव के फक्‍कड़, आदत में अक्‍खड़, भगत के सामने सेवक, बादशाहत के सामने प्रत्‍यंत दिलेर, दिल के साफ, दिमाग के दुरुस्‍त, भीतर से कोमल, बाहर से कठोर थे। वो जन्‍म के धधें से ही नहीं, अपने कर्म से वंदनीय हो गए। 

महात्‍मा कबीरदास, वो धूल से उठे थे लेकिन माथे का चंदन बन गए। महात्‍मा कबीरदास व्‍यक्ति से अभिव्‍यक्ति हो गए और इससे भी आगे वो शब्‍द से शब्‍दब्रह्म हो गए। वो विचार बन करके आए और व्यवहार  बन करके अमर हो गए। संत कबीरदास जी ने समाज को सिर्फ दृष्टि देने का ही काम नहीं किया बल्कि समाज की चेतना को जागृत करने का भी, और इसी समाज जागरण के लिए वे कांसी से मगहर आए। मगहर को उन्‍होंने प्रतीक स्‍वरूप चुना। 

कबीर साहब ने कहा था कि यदि हृदय में राम बसते हैं तो मगहर भी सबसे पवित्र है। और उन्‍होंने कहा- 

क्‍या कासी क्‍या उसर मगहर, राम हृदय बसो मोरा 

वे किसी के शिष्‍य नहीं, रामानंद द्वारा चेताए हुए चेला थे। संत कबीरदास जी कहते थे’ 

हम कासी में प्रकट भए हैं, रामानंद चेताए। 

कासी ने कबीर को आध्‍यात्मिक चेतना और गुरू से मिलाया था। 

भाइयो और बहनों, कबीर भारत की आत्‍मा का गीत, रस और सार कहे जा सकते हैं। उन्‍होंने सामान्‍य ग्रामीण भारतीय के मन की बात को उसकी अपनी बोलचाल की भाषा में पिरोया था। गुरू रामानंद के शिष्‍य थे सो जाति कैसे मानते। उन्‍होंने जाति-पांति के भेद तोड़े- 

सब मानस की एक जाति – ये घोषित किया और अपने भीतर के अहंकार को खत्‍म कर उसमें विराजे ईश्‍वर का दर्शन करने का कबीरदास जी ने रास्‍ता दिखाया। वे सबके थे इसलिए सब उनके हो गए। उन्‍होंने कहा था- 

कबीरा खड़ा बाजार में मांगे सबकी खैर। 

न काहु से दोस्‍ती, न काहु से बैर ।। 

उनके दोहों को समझने के लिए किसी शब्‍दकोश की जरूरत नहीं है। साधारण बोलचाल की हमारी-आपकी भाषा, हवा की सरलता और सहजता के साथ जीवन के गहन रहस्‍यों को उन्‍होंने जन-जन को समझा दिया। अपने भीतर बैठे राम को देखो, हरी तो मन में हैं, बाहर के आडम्‍बरों को क्‍यों समय व्‍यर्थ करते हो। अपने को सुधारो तो हरि मिल जाएंगे- 

जब मैं था तब हरि नहीं, जब हरि है मैं नहीं। 

सब अंधियारा मिट गया दीपक देखा माही।। 

जब मैं अपने अहंकार में डूबा था तब प्रभु को न देख पाता था, लेकिन जब गुरू न ज्ञान का दीपक मेरे भीतर प्रकाशित किया तब अज्ञान का सब अंधकार मिट गया। 

साथियों, ये हमारे देश की महान धरती का तप है, उसकी पुण्‍यता है कि समय के साथ समाज में आने वाली आंतरिक बुराइयों को समाप्‍त करने के लिए समय-समय पर ऋषियों ने, मुनियों ने आचार्यों ने, भगवन्‍तों ने, संतों ने मार्गदर्शन किया है। सैकड़ों वर्षों की गुलामी के कालखंड में अगर देश की आत्‍मा बची रही, देश का समभाव, सद्भाव बचा रहा तो ऐसे महान तेजस्‍वी-तपस्‍वी संतों की वजह से ही हुआ।   

समाज को रास्‍ता दिखाने के लिए भगवान बुद्ध पैदा हुए, महावीर आए, संत कबीर, संत सुदास, संत नानक जैसे अनेक संतों की श्रृंखला हमारे मार्ग दिखाती रही। उत्‍तर हो या दक्षिण, पूर्व हो या पश्चिम- कुरीतियों के खिलाफ देश के हर क्षेत्र में ऐसी पुण्‍यात्‍माओं ने जन्‍म लिया जिसने देश की चेतना को बचाने का, उसके संरक्षण का काम किया। 

दक्षिण में माधवाचार्य, निम्‍बागाराचार्य, वल्‍लभाचार्य, संत बसवेश्‍वर, संत तिरूगल, तिरूवल्‍वर, रामानुजाचार्य; अगर हम पश्चिमी भारत की ओर देखें तो महर्षि दयानंद, मीराबाई, संत एकनाथ, संत तुकाराम, संत रामदास, संत ज्ञानेश्‍वर, नरसी मेहता; अगर उत्‍तर की तरफ नजर करें तो रामांनद, कबीरदास, गोस्‍वामी तुलसीदास, सूरदास, गुरू नानक देव, संत रैदास, अगर पूर्व की ओर देखें तो रामकृष्‍ण परमहंस, चैतन्‍य महाप्रभु और आचार्य शंकरेदव जैसे संतों के विचारों ने इस मार्ग को रोशनी दी। 

इन्‍हीं संतों, इन्‍हीं महापुरुषों का प्रभाव था कि हिन्‍दुस्‍तान उस दौर में भी तमाम विपत्तियों को सहते हुए आगे बढ़ पाया और खुद को संकटों से बाहर निकाल पाया। 

कर्म और चर्म के नाम पर भेद के बजाय ईश्‍वर भक्ति का जो रास्‍ता रामानुजाचार्य ने दिखाया, उसी रास्‍ते पर चलते हुए संत रामानंद ने सभी जातियों और सम्‍प्रदायों के लोगों को अपना शिष्‍य बनाकर जातिवाद पर कड़ा प्रहार किया है। संत रामानंद ने संत कबीर को राम नाम की राह दिखाई। इसी राम-नाम के सहारे कबीर आज तक पीढ़ियों को सचेत कर रहे हैं। 

भाइयो और बहनों, समय के लम्‍बे कालखंड में संत कबीर के बाद रैदास आए। सैंकड़ों वर्षों के बाद महात्‍मा फूले आए, महात्‍मा गांधी आए, बाबा साहेब भीमराव अम्‍बेडकर आए। समाज में फैली असमानता को दूर करने के लिए सभी ने अपने-अपने तरीके से  समाज को रास्‍ता दिखाया। 

बाबा साहेब ने हमें देश का संविधान दिया। एक नागरिक के तौर पर सभी को बराबरी का अधिकार दिया है। दुर्भाग्‍य से आज इन महापुरुषों के नाम पर राजनीतिक स्‍वार्थ की एक ऐसी धारा खड़ा करने का प्रयास किया जा रहा है जो समाज को तोड्ने का प्रयास कर रही है। कुछ राजनीतिक दलों को समाज में शांति और विकास नहीं, लेकिन उन्‍हें चाहिए कलह, उन्‍हें चाहिए अशांति। उनको लगता है जितना असंतोष और अशांति का वातावरण बनाएंगे उतना उनको राजनीतिक लाभ होगा। लेकिन सच्‍चाई ये भी है- ऐसे लोग जमीन से कट चुके हैं। इन्‍हें अंदाजा ही नहीं कि संत कबीर, महात्‍मा गांधी, बाबा साहेब को मानने वाले हमारे देश का मूल स्‍वभाव क्‍या है।

कबीर कहते थे- अपने भीतर झांको तो सत्‍य मिलेगा, पर इन्‍होंने कभी कबीर को गंभीरता से पढ़ा ही नहीं। संत कबीरदास जी कहते थे

 पोथी पढ़ी-पढ़ी जग मुआ, पंडित भया न कोय, 

ढाई आखर प्रेम का पढ़े सो पंडित होय।। 

जनता से, देश से, अपने समाज के प्रति, उसकी प्रगति से मन लगाओ तो विकास के लिए विकास का जो हरि है, वो विकास का हरि मिल जाएगा। लेकिन उन लोगों का मन लगा हुआ है अपने आलीशान बंगले से। मुझे याद है जब गरीब और मध्‍यम वर्ग के लोगों को घर देने के‍ लिए प्रधानमंत्री आवास योजना शुरू हुई तो यहां जो पहले वाली सरकार थी, उनका रवैया क्‍या था। 

हमारी सरकार ने चिट्ठियां पर चिट्ठियां लिखीं, अनेक बार फोन पर बात की गई उस समय की यूपी सरकार आगे आएं, गरीबों के लिए बनाए जाने वाले घरों की कम से कम संख्‍या तो बताएं। लेकिन वो ऐसी सरकार थी जिनको अपने बंगले में रुचि थी। लेकिन वो हाथ पर हाथ धर करके बैठे रहे। और जब से योगीजी की सरकार आई, उसके बाद उत्‍तर प्रदेश में गरीबों के लिए रिकॉर्ड, रिकॉर्ड घरों का निर्माण किया जा रहा है। 

साथियों, कबीर ने सारी जिंदगी उसूलों पर ध्‍यान दिया। दुनिया के उसूलों को नहीं, अपने बनाए और सही समझे उसूलों पर। मगहर आने के पीछे भी तो यही तो वजह थी। उन्‍होंने मोक्ष का मोह नहीं किया। लेकिन गरीबों को झूठा दिलासा देने वाले, समाजवाद और बहुजन की बातें करने वालों का सत्‍ता के प्रति लालच भी आज हम भलीभांति देख रहे हैं। 

अभी दो दिन पहले ही देश में आपातकाल को 43 साल हुए हैं। सत्‍ता का लालच ऐसा है कि आपातकाल लगाने वाले और उस समय आपातकाल को विरोध करने वाले, आज कंधे से कंधा मिलाकर कुर्सी झपटने की फिराक में घूम रहे हैं। ये देश नहीं, समाज नहीं, सिर्फ अपने और अपने परिवार के हितों के लिए चिंतित हैं। गरीबों, दलितों, पिछड़े, वंचित, शोषित, उनको धोखा देकर अपने लिए करोड़ों के बंगले बनाने वाले हैं। अपने भाइयों, अपने रिश्‍तेदारों को करोड़ों, अरबों की संपत्ति का मालिक बनाने वाले हैं। ऐसे लोगों से उत्‍तर प्रदेश और देश के लोगों को सतर्क रहने की जरूरत है। 

साथियों, आपने तीन तलाक के विषय में भी इन लोगों का रवैया देखा है। देशभर में मुस्लिम समाज की बहनें आज तमाम धमकियों की परवाह न करते हुए तीन तलाक हटाने, इस कुरीति से समाज को मुक्ति के लिए लगातार मांग कर रही हैं। लेकिन ये राजनीतिक दल, ये सत्‍ता पाने के लिए वोट बैंक का खेल खेलने वाले लोग, तीन तलाक के बिल के संसद में पास होने पर रोड़े अटका रहे हैं। ये अपने हित के लिए समाज को हमेशा कमजोर रखना चाहते हैं। उसे बुराइयों से मुक्‍त नहीं देखना चाहते।

साथियों, कबीर का प्राकट्य जिस समय हुआ था तब भारत, भारत के ऊपर एक आक्रमण भीषण आक्रमण का ताज था। देश का सामान्‍य नागरिक परेशान था। संत कबीरदास जी ने तब के बादशाह को चुनौती दी थी। और कबीरदास की चुनौती थी-

 दर की बात कहो दरवेसा बादशाह है कौन भेसा 

कबीर ने कहा था- आदर्श शासक वही है जो जनता की पीड़ा को समझता हो और उसे दूर करने का प्रयास करता हो। वे शासक के रूप में आदर्श राजा राम की कल्‍पना करा करते थे। उनकी कल्‍पना का राज्‍य लोकतांत्रिक और पंथ निरपेक्ष था। लेकिन अफसोस आज कई परिवार खुद को जनता का भाग्‍य-विधाता समझकर संत कबीरदास जी की कही बातों को पूरी तरह नकारने में लगे हुए हैं। वे ये भूल गए हैं कि हमारे संघर्ष और आदर्श की बुनियाद कबीर जैसे महापुरुष हैं। 

कबीर जी ने बि‍ना किसी लाज-लिहाज के रूढ़ियों पर सीधा प्रहार किया था। मनुष्‍य-मनुष्‍य के बीच भेद करने वाली हर व्‍यवस्‍था को चुनौती दी थी। जो दबा-कुचला था, जो वंचित था, जिसका शोषण किया जा रहा था; कबीर उसको सशक्‍त बनाना चाहते थे। वो उसको याचक बनाकर नहीं रखना चाहते थे।

 संत कबीरदासजी कहते थे-

 मांगन मरण समान है, मत कोई मांगो भीख

 मांगन ते मरना भला, यह सतगुरू की सीख।।

 कबीर खुद श्रमजीवी थे। वे श्रम का महत्‍व समझते थे। लेकिन आजादी के इतने वर्षों तक हमारे नीति-निर्माताओं ने कबीर के इस दर्शन को नहीं समझा। गरीबी हटाने के नाम पर वो गरीबों को वोट बैंक की सियासत पर आश्रित करते रहे। 

साथियों, बीते चार वर्षों में हमने उस नीति-रीति को बदलने का भरसक प्रयास किया है। हमारी सरकार गरीब, दलित, पीड़ित, शोषित, वंचित, महिलाओं को, नौजवानों को, सशक्‍त करने की राह पर चल रही है। जन-धन योजना के तहत उत्‍तर प्रदेश में लगभग पांच करोड़ गरीबों के बैंक खाते खोलकर, 80 लाख से ज्‍यादा महिलाओं को उज्‍ज्‍वला योजना के तहत मुफ्त गैस कनेकशन देकर, करीब एक करोड़ 70 लाख गरीबों को सिर्फ एक रुपया महीना और दिन में 90 पैसे के प्रीमियम पर सुरक्षा बीमा कवच देकर, यूपी के गांवों में सवा करोड़ शौचालय बनाकर, लोगों के बैंक खाते में सीधे पैसे ट्रांसफर करके गरीबों को सशक्‍त करने का काम किया। आयुष्‍मान भारत से हमारे गरीब परिवारों को सस्‍ती, सुलभ और सर्वश्रेष्‍ठ स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य सेवा देने का एक बहुत बड़ा बीड़ा उठाया है। गरीब के आत्‍मसम्‍मान और उसके जीवन को आसान बनाने को सरकार ने अपनी प्राथमिकता बनाया है।

साथियों, कबीर श्रमयोगी थे, कर्मयोगी थे। कबीर ने कहा था- 

काल करे सो आज कर। 

कबीर काम में विश्‍वास रखते थे, अपने राम में विश्‍वास रखते थे। आज तेजी से पूरी होती योजनाएं, दोगुनी गति से बनती सड़कें, नए हाईवे, दोगुनी गति से होता रेल लाइनों का बिजलीकरण, तेजी से बन रहे नए एयरपोर्ट, दोगुनी से भी ज्‍यादा तेजी से बन रहे घर, हर पंचायत तक बिछाई जा रही ऑप्‍टीकल फाइबर नेटवर्क, तमाम कार्यों की रफ्तार कबीर मार्ग के ही तो प्रतिबिंब हैं। ये हमारी सरकार के ‘सबका साथ सबका विकास’ मंत्र की भावना है।

 

साथियो, जिस प्रकार कबीर के कालखंड में मगहर को ऊसर और अभिशप्‍त माना गया था, ठीक उसी प्रकार आजादी के इतने वर्षों तक देश के कुछ ही हिस्‍सों तक विकास की रोशनी पहुंच पाई थी। भारत का एक बहुत बड़ा हिस्‍सा खुद को अलग-थलग महसूस कर रहा था। पूर्वी उत्‍तर प्रदेश से लेकर पूर्वी और उत्‍तर, उत्‍तर-पूर्वी भारत विकास के लिए तरस गया था। जिस प्रकार कबीर ने मगहर को अभिशाप से मुक्‍त किया उसी प्रकार हमारी सरकार का प्रयास है कि भारत-भूमि की एक-एक इंच जमीन को विकास की धारा के साथ जोड़ा जाए।

 

भाइयो और बहनों, पूरी दुनिया मगहर को संत कबीर की निर्वाण भूमि के रूप में जानती है। लेकिन स्‍वतंत्रता के इतने वर्षों बाद यहां भी स्थिति वैसे नहीं थी जैसी होनी चाहिए। 14-15 वर्ष पहले जब पूर्व राष्‍ट्रपति अब्‍दुल कलाम जी यहां आए थे तब उन्‍होंने इस जगह के लिए एक सपना देखा था। उनके सपनों को साकार करने के लिए मगहर को अंतर्राष्‍ट्रीय मानचित्र में सद्भाव, समरसता के केंद्र के तौर पर विकसित करने का काम अब हम तेज गति से करने जा रहे हैं। 

देशभर में मगहर की तरह की आस्‍था और आध्‍यात्‍म के केंद्र को स्‍वदेश्‍ दर्शन स्‍कीम के तहत विकसित करने का बीड़ा सरकार ने उठाया है। रामयण सर्किट हो, बौद्ध सर्किट हो, सूफी सर्किट हो, जैसे अनेक सर्किट बनाकर अलग-अलग जगहों को विकसित करने का काम किया जा रहा है। साथियो, मानवता की रक्षा, विश्‍व बंधुतत्‍व और परस्‍पर प्रेम के लिए कबीर की वाणी एक बहुत बड़ा सरल माध्‍यम है। उनकी वाणी सर्व पंत समभाव और सामजिक समरसता के भाव से इतनी ओतप्रोत है कि वह आज भी हमारे लिए पथ-प्रदर्शक है।

 

जरूरत है कबीर साहब की वाणी को जन-जन तक पहुंचाया जाए और उसके हिसाब से आचरण किया जाए। मैं उम्‍मीद करता हूं कि कबीर अकादमी इसमें महत्‍वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाएगी। एक बार फिर बाहर से आए श्रद्धालुओं को संत कबीर की इस पवित्र धरती में पधारने के लिए मैं उनका बहुत-बहुत आभार करता हूं। संत कबीर के अमृत वचनों को जीवन में ढालकर हम नयू इंडिया के संकल्‍प को सिद्ध कर पाएंगे।

 

इसी विश्‍वास के साथ मैं, मेरी वाणी को विराम देता हूं। आप सभी का बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद। 

साहिब बन्‍दगी, साहिब बन्‍दगी, साहिब बन्‍दगी

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, visited Maghar in Sant Kabir Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh today. 

He offered floral tributes at Sant Kabir Samadhi, on the occasion of the 500th death anniversary of the great saint and poet, Kabir. He also offered Chadar at Sant Kabir Mazaar. He visited the Sant Kabir Cave, and unveiled a plaque to mark the laying of Foundation Stone of Sant Kabir Academy, which will highlight the great saint’s teachings and thought.

At a public meeting, the Prime Minister said that a wish which he had for years, had been fulfilled, by paying homage to the great saint Kabir, at the hallowed land of Maghar, where legend says that Sant Kabir, Guru Nanak and Baba Gorakhnath, had engaged in spiritual discussion.

The Prime Minister said that Sant Kabir Academy, to be built at a cost of about Rs. 24 crore, would create an institution to preserve the legacy of Sant Kabir, as well as regional dialects and folk arts of Uttar Pradesh. 

The Prime Minister said that Sant Kabir represents the essence of India's soul. He broke the barriers of caste, and spoke the language of the ordinary, rural Indian, Shri Narendra Modi added. 

The Prime Minister said that saints have risen from time to time, in various parts of India, who have guided society to rid itself of social evils. Naming many such saints from various parts of India, across different eras, the Prime Minister mentioned Babasaheb Ambedkar who ensured for every citizen of India, equality, through the Constitution. 

Making a strong statement against political opportunism, the Prime Minister recalled Sant Kabir's teaching that the ideal ruler is one who understands the feelings and suffering of the people. He said Sant Kabir had criticized all social structures which discriminated among people. In this context, the Prime Minister mentioned the various schemes of the Union Government which seek to empower the poor and under privileged sections of society, such as Jan Dhan Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, insurance schemes, toilet construction, and direct benefits transfer. He also mentioned the increase in pace in various infrastructure sectors such as roads, railways, optical fibre network etc. He said the Union Government is working to ensure that all parts of India receive the fruits of development. 

He hoped that the teachings of Sant Kabir would help us give shape to the vision of New India.

                These are the people who took wise decisions in time and prepared themselves for the every challenge of life. And I have full faith in this thing that the issues shared by them today will encourage millions and millions of people of the country. All of us know that one thing in life is extremely certain and it is that life is uncertain. None of us knows that what can be happened in the next moment, what tomorrow is going to bring to our lives. Social security schemes provide us the strength to deal with the uncertainties and situations of life and overcome them. And now this courage has reached to millions and millions of people of the country be it is Pradhan  Mantri  Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana or Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or be it Atal Pension Scheme or Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojna. 

Social security schemes have been empowering the common people particularly the economically weaker sections of the society so that they can face the difficult times, so that they don’t end up losing the battle of life. At a time when we formed our government then poor people did not even have their bank accounts, the matter of getting any kind of financial support was very away.

We laid emphasis on three things: dalits, oppressed, exploited, deprived, tribals, women, to provide banking services to these unbanked people in order to empower these people; and to provide financial assistance to small scale industries and small businessmen; and also to provide financial security to financially insecure people. It means banking the unbanked, funding the unfunded and financially securing the unsecured.

And you people would be happy to note that the World Bank’s FinTax Report has described Pradhan  Mantri  Jan  Dhan  Yojana as a successful financial inclusion program under which 28 crores new bank accounts were opened in three years between 2014 to 2017. This figure is 55% of the total bank accounts opened in the entire world during the same period, it means more than half of the total. Earlier there was a saying in our country – Ek Baju Ram Aur Ek Baju Gaon – it means on the one hand India and on the other hand the entire world. 

Besides this, the report also stated that the number of people having bank accounts in India, which was nearly 50-52% before our government was formed in 2014, that number has gone up beyond 80% in these three years. And especially the number of women bank account holders has gone up. This issue has been discussed for years that there are provisions for social security in several countries of the world but it is not there in India. 

When we formed the government then situation was like this only. The common man of the country was deprived of the social security. It is true that India traditionally had the joint family system. When 20-25 or up to 30 people used to live together in one family then that social structure itself used to ensure social security. However, the size of family is shrinking, old parents stay separately and children live separately. The social system has been changing. 

In order to bring about change in this situation, in order to provide security cover in this new situation, today an insurance facility is being provided as Life Cover, Rupay Card and Accident Cover under the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Scheme. In addition to this,a pension scheme and two insurance schemes have also been started as social security schemes. 

And as a result of this the number of subscribers of government insurance scheme which was 4.8 crore or less than 5 crore in 2014, today, the same number has gone up by 10 times under the social security scheme and nearly 50 crore subscribers are there.  

These schemes started under social security programs, are aimed at different situations. And they have been launched at a very low premium so that people of every section, every region, people of every age group in country can take advantage of these schemes. 

Today, I am going to talk to those people, I know that these schemes are such that they are related with grief and pain, these are related to a painful grief, however, those people who have faced difficult situations, those who have passed through difficult times and how these schemes have helped them when the poor people, ordinary people of our country will hear about their experiences then they will also be encouraged and they will feel that they too should take advantage of these schemes. And therefore….it is also painful to revisit those painful moments again and again, however, if somebody has received some kind of help in that difficult time and if other people hear about that experience then they can also find ways to protect them from difficulties in future.

My dear countrymen, you people would have noticed this thing that all of us feel pain after listening about these losses, because nobody can compensate any family for the loss of a member, even God himself can’t compensate the loss, however, if that family receives some financial support during this difficult time, if they find something to hold on to then they are able to come back on the track. And the Prime Minister’s Jeevan  Jyoti  Bima Scheme has been launched with this aim. 

Under this scheme…I feel that my countrymen should realise that a life insurance cover of Rs. 2 lakh in just Rs. 330. Rs. 330 for a year, it means it is less than one rupee per day. Today, you can’t find anything in market for such a small amount. They should try to understand that how can they take advantage of this scheme. More than 5.5 crore people have taken advantage of this scheme. And claims worth crores of rupees have already been disbursed under the scheme. Some people are with us…let us go across to them, let us hear their experiences. 

All of us realise that the tragedy never forewarns you, crisis never warns anyone before it strikes. And it is not like that if you are rich then tragedy will strike you and it will not strike you if you are poor.Nor is it like that tragedy will strike you if you are a poor but it will not strike you if you are a rich person. It is not like that either.A tragedy can strike you anywhere. However, we can prepare ourselves to face these difficulties.We can ensure our financial safety. 

Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana was started with this goal only. Under this scheme an accidental cover of Rs. 2 lakh is provided for Rs. 12 per year, it means for a premium of Rs. 1 per month. Nearly 13-14 crore people have adopted this scheme so far. If we look at the population  of  Mexico or Japan then the number of people having this coverage is more than the population of those countries. Such a vast coverage and such large number of people joining this scheme in such a short span of time reflect that people have become aware about insurance and its benefits. 

If some tragedy happens with a man then his entire family faces a massive challenge. All the dreams are shattered. Even if someone has planned that we will do this thing in the next year; we will do that thing in the next three years; all these things remain unfulfilled. Despite that, it has been common experience that people continue to neglect insurance. Sometimes they say like this: ‘We will buy insurance. It will be done. We have a lot of time. What is the need for insurance?’ And today the entire country is watching this thing and I wish that this kind of thinking with regard to insurance will change. More and more people should join the social security schemes. 

A few years ago, a daily wage earner never used to think about the insurance and it was due to the money required for paying the insurance premium. This kind of dilemma was always there that whether he should spend his money for meeting the current requirements or for securing his future. The people like vegetable vendors, auto rickshaw drivers or daily wage earners or those who manage their lives by doing some other small work, it would have been impossible for them to even think about insurance. 

Today, this impossible thing has been made possible. And it has been made possible for our dalits, for our persecuted and exploited people, for our deprived and poor people and for our sisters and daughters. The facility of life insurance has been provided to people for payment of just one rupee per month. Now the safety cover of an insurance scheme has also been added to the lives of a section of the society that has been living their life at the mercy of god.  Let us talk to some more people. 

Look, old age is an important period of life. There was a time when for several things we were dependent on others. Pension facility was conceived with this aim only so that we should be financially self-dependent at that age.  May we continue to receive the blessings of our elders and may we continue to work for the progress of the country due to the blessings of our elders. This government is committed for senior citizens and that is why this government has done the work of making their lives easier fromthe financial issues to their health issues. 

The government has formulated several schemes and policies in the last four years by taking into the account the seriousness of the problems related with the old age. Last year, the government has started Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Scheme. Under this scheme, a guaranteed return of 8% per cent is paid for 10 years to the people over the age of 60 years. Ups and downs in the interest rate are not allowed to affect the returns under the scheme. 

 

If the returns are less than 8% then the government’s exchequer provides for the difference. Under this scheme, senior citizens can opt for monthly, quarterly, half yearly and yearly return. Under this scheme, senior citizens can invest up to Rs. 15 lakh. More than 3 lakh people are taking advantage of this scheme so far. In addition to this, the government has been giving senior citizens the benefits of tax incentives. Tax exemption limit for senior citizens have been increased from Rs. 2.5 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh a year. Besides this, the ceiling on the deduction of interest income has been increased from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 50,000. It means, the interest earning of up to Rs. 50,000 on their deposits has been exempted from tax payment. 

Similarly, what are the benefits of all the initiatives that have been taken for senior citizens? If we look at these things as per the numbers then for example a senior citizen who has an annual income of Rs. 5 lakh back in 2013-14 before our government was formed then he was required to pay a tax of nearly Rs. 13,000 or Rs. 13,500, or nearly Rs. 13,390. However, after formation of our government we have changed the entire formula. 

In 2018-19, it has come down to just Rs. 2,600. It means earlier it was more than Rs. 13,000 and now it is just Rs. 2,600. It means that now it is just one third. It is such a huge change. Not only on the financial issues, but the government has also worked in a planned manner with regard to the issues related to senior citizens and their welfare. 

We all are aware that health related problems start troubling people with the onset of old age. The expenditure on treatment and medicines goes up. Jan Aushadhi scheme has been started while keeping this thing in mind so that medicines can be provided at affordable prices. Similarly, the price of stents has been reduced. The cost of knee transplant has also come down in comparison with the earlier period. 

Earlier senior citizens were required to present themselves in an office to prove that they were alive. However, now the facility of Jeevan Praman has been started to make it easier. We are making every effort to provide different facilities to senior citizens in an easy and convenient manner that are available near them so that they don’t have to run around here and there, so that they stay healthy and can lead their lives with self-respect. We have worked in the direction of ensuring this thing. 

They should not be dependent on anybody in their old age and their life should be full of dignity. And they should continue to get a certain amount as pension; the government has started Atal Pension Scheme in order to ensure this thing. There are more than one crore subscribers under this scheme and out of these nearly 40% are women like our sister Archna. An amount of Rs. 4,000 has been deposited under this scheme. 

If we take a holistic view then in the last 3 years nearly 20 crore people have been brought under the coverage of safety and insurance through Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana and Atal Pension Scheme. And 52% of the beneficiaries, more than half of them, are from our villages, they are from our rural areas. 

Every scheme has two fundamental pillars behind it – first everybody should get the insurance coverage and he should get it for the lowest premium so that the poorest of the poor person can take advantage of it. Our government is sensitive towards the poor people, it lays emphasis on the welfare of poor people and it has been consistently working to empower them. 

We just heard it from the beneficiaries of different schemes that how they and their families got financial support during the difficult time, how they got a support. 

I believe that their stories are a source of inspiration for all of us. It shows that how important insurance coverage is for all of us. I appeal to all of you that you people should take advantage of these insurance schemes and if there is someone around you, if there is someone in your office then you should also inform them about these schemes and encourage them to take advantage of these schemes. 

All the beneficiaries who are present here, you people are live examples of the utility of these schemes and I appeal to all of you that you should encourage the people around you for these things. I would like to inform you that you can enroll yourself in Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana in bank or post office; you can register yourself. 

You can enroll yourself in Atal Pension Scheme by visiting any bank branch. And for Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana, you can take benefit of this scheme by visiting any LIC office across the country. 

I would like to tell you one more thing. What kind of schemes are there for senior citizens so that they can lead their life with dignity. There are schemes for this purpose. However, senior citizens of our country are dignified people, they provide a lot of inspiration. May be you people are not aware about this thing as it has not been discussed outside. When I have appealed to the people of the country from the rampart of the Red Fort that why you people need gas subsidy. You should give it up. And one crore twenty five lakh people of the country gave up the gas subsidy. 

At present our senior citizens get some relief for buying railway tickets. However, the railways has added this thing in its form: ‘do you want to give up your subsidy? Do you want to pay the entire amount for your ticket?’

All of us will take pride in this thing that lakhs of senior citizens of our country who could have availed this benefit, they came forward and they refused to avail the subsidy for the rail ticket, they paid the full amount for their journey. This thing has not been publicly advertised, nor an appeal was made nor have I ever discussed this thing. It was just stated on the form and our senior citizens who lead a dignified life they made such a huge sacrifice. It’s not small news for the country. 

And when the people of our country do a lot of things like this, when my senior citizens do these things then all of us too feel like doing something or some other thing, something good every day for you people. Please come forward so that we can continue to work for the welfare of the poor people of our country, so that the welfare of our mothers and sisters can be ensured, so that our senior citizens, very senior citizens, all the respected people can get an opportunity to lead a dignified life. Once again I express my sincere gratitude to all of you.

Thank you.

Distinguished Delegates from India and abroad

Ladies and Gentlemen

I am happy to be here in Mumbai, for the Third Annual Meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. We are happy to have this opportunity to deepen our engagement with the bank and its members.

AIIB started its financing operations in January 2016. In less than three years, it has in its fold, 87 members. And a committed capital stock of 100 billion US Dollars. It is poised to play a critical role in Asia. 

Friends.

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a result of collaborative efforts of Asian countries to provide a better tomorrow to our people. As developing countries, we share similar challenges. One of them is to find resources for provision of infrastructure. I am happy that the theme of this year’s Meeting is “Mobilizing Finance for Infrastructure: Innovation and Collaboration”. Investments by AIIB in sustainable infrastructure can impact the lives of billions of people.

Asia still faces wide ranging disparities in access to education, healthcare, financial services and formal employment opportunities. 

Regional multi-lateralism through institutions such as AIIB can play a central role in helping to raise resources.

Sectors such as energy and power, transportation, telecom, rural infrastructure, agriculture development, water supply and sanitation, environment protection, urban development, and logistics require long term funds. The interest rates on these funds need to be affordable and sustainable.

In a short period, AIIB has approved 25 projects in a dozen countries with a total financing of over 4 billion US Dollars. This is a good beginning.

With committed capital of 100 billion dollars and huge need for infrastructure in member countries, I take this opportunity to call upon AIIB to expand from financing 4 billion dollars, to 40 billion dollars by 2020 and 100 billion dollars by 2025.

This would require simpler processing, and faster approval. It would also need high quality projects and robust project proposals.

I believe that India and AIIB are both strongly committed to making economic growth more inclusive and sustainable. In India, we are applying novel Public Private Partnership models, Infrastructure Debt Funds, and Infrastructure Investment Trusts to fund infrastructure. India is trying to develop brownfield assets as a separate asset class for infrastructure investment. Such assets, having passed the stages of land acquisition and environment and forest clearances, are relatively de-risked. Hence, for such assets, institutional investment from pension, insurance and sovereign wealth funds are likely to be more forthcoming.

Another initiative, is the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund. This aims to channel investments from both domestic and international sources into infrastructure. This Fund has received a boost with AIIB committing 200 million US Dollars for investment.

Ladies and Gentlemen.

India is one of the most investor-friendly economies in the world.  Investors look for growth and macro-economic stability. They want political stability and a supportive regulatory framework to ensure protection of their investment. From the point of larger scale of operations and higher value addition, an investor is also attracted by a large domestic market size, availability of skilled labour and good physical infrastructure. On each of these parameters, India is well placed and has performed very well. Let me share with you, some of our experiences and achievements.

India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy which is driving global growth as well. With a size of 2.8 trillion US Dollars, it is the seventh largest in the world. It is the third largest in terms of purchasing power parity. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we grew at 7.7 per cent. In 2018, we are projected to grow at 7.4 per cent.

Our macro-economic fundamentals are strong with stable prices, a robust external sector and a fiscal situation firmly in control. Despite  rising oil prices, inflation is within the mandated range. The Government is firmly committed to the path of fiscal consolidation. Government debt as percentage of GDP is consistently declining. India has achieved a rating upgrade after a long wait.  

The external sector remains robust. Our foreign exchange reserves of more than 400 billion US dollars provide us enough cushion. Global confidence in India’s economy is rising. Total FDI flows have increased steadily – more than 222 billion US dollars have been received in the last four years. As per UNCTAD’s World Investment Report, India continues to be one of the top FDI destinations in the world.

Ladies and Gentlemen.

From the point of a foreign investor, India counts as an extremely low risk political economy. The Government has taken a number of steps to boost investment.  We have simplified rules and regulations for businesses and undertaken bold reforms. We have provided investors an environment which is efficient, transparent, reliable and predictable.

We have liberalized the FDI regime. Today, most sectors are on automatic approval route.

The Goods and Services Tax is one of the most significant systemic reforms that our country has undergone. It works on the One Nation - One Tax principle. It reduces tax cascading, increases transparency, and adds to logistics efficiency. All of this makes it easier for the investor to do business in India.

These and other changes have been noticed by the global fraternity. India has jumped 42 places in three years to enter the top hundred in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report 2018.

The size and growth of the Indian market hold much potential. India’s per capita income has doubled in the last ten years. We have over 300 million middle class consumers. This number is expected to double in the next ten years. The size and scale of requirement in India gives the added advantage of economies of scale for investors. For example, the housing programme in India targets ten million houses in urban areas. This would be more than the total requirement of a lot of countries taken together. Therefore the use of new technology in house construction would have added advantage, if tried in India.  

Another example of scale would be the Renewable Energy Programme in India. We have set a target to construct capacity of 175 Giga Watt of renewable energy by the year 2022. Of this, the solar energy capacity will amount to  100 Giga Watt. And we are well on course to exceed these targets. We have added more capacity to renewable energy than conventional energy in 2017. We are also making collaborative efforts to mainstream solar energy in the form of an International Solar Alliance. The founding conference of the Alliance was held in New Delhi earlier this year. The Alliance aims at a solar capacity of 1000 Giga Watt with an investment of one trillion US Dollars by 2030.

India is working on e-mobility. The challenge before us is of technology, particularly with respect to storage. We will be hosting a global mobility conference this year. I hope that this will help us in moving forward. 

Friends.

In India, we are upgrading connectivity at all levels. The Bharatmala scheme is aimed at improving road connectivity by constructing national corridors and highways. The Sagarmala project has been undertaken for boosting port connectivity, port modernization and port-linked industries. Dedicated Freight Corridors are being developed to mitigate the congestion of our railway network. The Jal Marg Vikas project would augment capacity of navigation on National Waterways for internal trade carried through inland water transport. Our UDAN scheme works towards regional airport development and improved air connectivity. An area which I believe still remains untapped and needs attention is the possibility of utilising India’s large coastline for transportation and freight movement. 

While we talk about the conventional concept of infrastructure, I must mention some of the modern day infrastructure on which India has worked. Bharat Net is targeted at providing last mile internet connectivity in the country. India has  over 460 million internet users and 1.2 billion mobile phones in use. We are promoting the use of digital payments. Our United Payments Interface system or UPI along with BHIM App and RuPay Card has shown the true potential of digital economy in India. Through the UMANG App, more than 100 public services have been made available to the citizens through their mobile phone. Our Digital India Mission aims to bridge the rural-urban digital divide.

Agriculture is the lifeline of the Indian economy. We are promoting investments in warehouses and cold chains, food processing, crop insurance and allied activities. We are promoting micro-irrigation to ensure optimal use of water with increased productivity. I would like AIIB to look into potential investment opportunities in this field and associate with us.

We aim to provide every poor and homeless household a house with toilet, water and electricity by the year 2022. We are also looking at various strategies for effective waste management. 

We have also recently launched Ayushman Bharat, our National Health Protection Mission. This will provide a benefit cover of over 7000 dollars annually to more than 100 million poor and vulnerable families. The resulting expansion of health care facilities will lead to the creation of a large number of jobs. This will also promote the production of high quality medicines, consumables and other medical technology equipment. Jobs will also be created for ancillary activities including call centres, research and evaluation and IEC activities. The entire healthcare industry will receive a boost.

Moreover, with the Government assuring healthcare benefits, the savings of a family, can now be better used for other consumption and investment. This increased disposable income in the hands of a poor family would lead to increased demand in the economy. I see great untapped potential in this for investors. 

Friends.

The Indian story of economic resurgence closely mirrors that of many other parts of Asia. Now, the continent finds itself at the centre of global economic activity.  It has become the main growth engine of the world. In fact, we are now living through what many have termed the ‘Asian Century’.

A ‘New India’ is rising. It is an India that stands on the pillars of economic opportunity for all, knowledge economy, holistic development, and futuristic, resilient and digital infrastructure. We look forward to our continued engagement with our development partners including AIIB.

In conclusion, I hope that the interactions in this forum will be fruitful and enriching for all.

Thank you.

                एक्सेलेंसी राष्ट्रपति  Danny Faure , सेशेल्स delegation के सम्माननीय सदस्य, 

 

मीडिया के मित्रों, 



राष्ट्रपति फॉर और उनके शिष्टमंडल का स्वागत करना मेरे लिए बड़े सौभाग्य की बात है। वर्ष 2015 में मेरी सेशेल्स की यात्रा, जो Indian Ocean region में मेरी पहली यात्रा थी, उसकी यादें मेरे मन में अभी भी हैं। उसी साल तत्कालीन राष्ट्रपति जेम्स मिशेल ने भी भारत का दौरा किया था। 

ये यात्राएं हमारे घनिष्ठ strategic partnership के लिए हमारी प्रतिबद्धता दर्शाती हैं। जून 1976 में सेशेल्स के स्वतंत्र होने के बाद से ही, हम दोनों लोकतांत्रिक देशों के विशेष संबंध रहे हैं। आज भारत और सेशेल्स एक दूसरे के प्रमुख strategic partners हैं। हम दोनों देश लोकतंत्र की core values का समर्थन करते हैं और Indian Ocean में शांति, सुरक्षा और स्थिरता को बनाए रखने के geo-strategic vision को भी समान रूप से साझा करते हैं।


राष्ट्रपति फॉर और मेरे बीच आज की वार्ता बहुत ही सार्थक रही। सेशेल्स ने Africa में highest Human Development Index को प्राप्त किया है और Blue Economy के global leaders में से एक बन कर उभरा है। मैं, राष्ट्रपति फॉर को इन उपलब्धियों पर बहुत बहुत बधाई देता हूं।

भारत और सेशेल्स, Indian Ocean से जुड़े हुए हैं। हमारे नागरिकों की संपन्नता के लिए secure maritime environment में ocean economy का sustainable विकास बहुत ही महत्वपूर्ण है। परंपरागत और गैर-परंपरागत खतरों का सफलतापूर्वक सामना करके ही हम महासागर द्वारा प्रदत्त अवसरों का लाभ उठा सकते हैं। आज की हमारी वार्ता में, हमने ocean आधारित Blue Economy का पूरा लाभ उठाने की दिशा में संयुक्त रूप से कार्य करने की अपनी प्रतिबद्धता को दोहराया है। हमारे बीच Maritime चुनौतियों से निपटने के लिए सहयोग पर गहरी रणनीतिक convergence है।

घनिष्ठ भागीदारों के रूप में यह हमारी साझी ज़िम्मेदारी है कि हम अपने EEZ में तथा तटीय क्षेत्रों के आसपास सामूहिक maritime security सुनिश्चित करें। हमें पायरेसी, drugs और human trafficking तथा समुद्रीय संसाधनों का अवैध शोषण जैसे अंतर्राष्ट्रीय अपराधों से खतरा है। इनके विरूद्ध हमें अपनी चौकसी और सहयोग बढ़ाने होंगे। सेशेल्स को उसकी defence capabilities और maritime infrastructure को सुदृढ़ करने तथा defence personnel की क्षमता को बढ़ाने में सहायता करने के लिए भारत प्रतिबद्ध हैं। इससे सेशेल्स पारंपरिक और गैर पारंपरिक दोनों प्रकार की maritime चुनौतियों से प्रभावी रूप से निपट सकेगा तथा अपने समुद्रीय संसाधनों की रक्षा कर सकेगा। इस संदर्भ में मुझे सेशेल्स के defence के लिए 100 मिलियन अमेरिकी डालर credit के रूप में देने की घोषणा करने में प्रसन्नता हो रही है। इस credit से सेशेल्स अपनी maritime capacity को निर्मित करने के लिए भारत से रक्षा उपकरण खरीद सकेगा। मार्च, 2015 सेशेल्स की अपनी यात्रा के दौरान मैंने जिस दूसरे Dornier Aircraft का वायदा किया था वह कल सौंपे जाने के लिए तैयार है। इसका model अभी आप सब ने हमारे सामने देखा है। यह 29 जून को सेशेल्स के राष्ट्रीय दिवस के समारोह में भाग लेने के लिए समय पर वहां पर पहुंच जाएगा।


एज़ाम्पशन द्वीप प्रोजेक्ट के संबंध में एक-दूसरे के हितों के आधार पर मिलकर काम करने पर हम सहमत हैं। Navigation charts की उपलब्धता को सुधारने के लिए हाइड्रोग्राफी surveys करने के लिए हम व्यापक रूप से सहयोग कर रहे हैं। इस प्रयास के हिस्से के रूप में हमने आज White Shipping Data के आदान-प्रदान के लिए एक MOU साइन किया है। आज की हमारी बातचीत के दौरान, मैंने सेशेल्स की राष्ट्रीय प्राथमिकता की परियोजनाओं के लिए प्रभावी योगदान को जारी रखने की भारत की प्रतिबद्धता दोहराई है। इन परियोजनाओं से न केवल सेशेल्स की अर्थव्यवस्था बेहतर होगी बल्कि इस से हमारे आपसी संबंध कई गुना प्रगाढ़ होंगे।


Special grantके अंतर्गत सेशेल्स में तीन civilian infrastructure projects को finance करने के लिए भारत तैयार है। इनमें Government House, new Police Headquarters तथा Attorney General’s Office शामिल हैं।


आज हमने एक MoU पर भी हस्ताक्षर किए हैं, जिसके तहत सेशेल्स में कुछ high quality, high visibility तथा people-centric Small Development Projects को शुरू करने के लिए हमारी ओर से वित्तीय सहायता दी जाएगी। मैंने राष्ट्रपति फॉर को आश्वासन दिया है कि भारत सेशेल्स के आम नागरिकों समेत रक्षा कार्मिकों के लिए ITEC एवं अन्य कार्यक्रमों के अंतर्गत प्रशिक्षण प्रदान कर सेशेल्स की क्षमता विकास को बढाने के लिए हमेशा प्रतिबद्ध रहेगा। सेशेल्स द्वारा निर्धारित क्षेत्रों में भारतीय विशेषज्ञ सेशेल्स में deputation पर भेजे जाएंगे। सेशेल्स की अर्थव्यवस्था में भारतीय समुदाय का योगदान हमारे लिए गर्व का विषय है।* हमारे दोनों देशों एवं यहां के लोगों के बीच हमारी साझा संस्कृति हमारे लिए गर्व का विषय है और यह हमारे संबंधो को गाढ़ा बनाने के लिए कई संभावनाएं प्रदान करता है। मैं राष्ट्रपति फॉर को हमें दो बड़े अल्दाब्रा कछुए भेंट में दिए जाने के लिए धन्यवाद करता हूँ। सेशेल्स से, पहले भी, ऐसे दीर्घायु कछुए भारत ने प्राप्त किये थे। वे तीन शताब्दियों के साक्षी रहे। भारत में इस जीव को, और प्रकृति के अन्य अनेक जीव-जंतुओं, पशुओं-पौधों को बहुत श्रद्धा और प्रेम से देखा जाता है। ये दीर्घायु कछुए आगे भी हमारी चिरंतन मित्रता और उसके शुभ प्रभावों के प्रतीक रहेंगे।


मैं एक बार फिर से राष्ट्रपति फॉर तथा उनके प्रतिनिधिमंडल का हार्दिक स्वागत करता हूँ तथा कामना करता हूँ कि उनकी भारत यात्रा आनंददायक रहे। मैं राष्ट्रपति फॉर तथा सेशेल्स के लोगों को उन के राष्ट्रीय दिवस 29 जून के लिए भी अपनी ओर से और सवा सौ करोड़ भारतीयों की ओर से शुभकामनाएं भी देता हूँ।

                First of all many-many congratulations to all of you, to the people of Haryana and Delhi for operationalization of Bahadurgarh-Mundka Metro Line.

Today, Bahadurgarh in Haryana has been linked with Delhi Metro. After Gurugram and Faridabad, Bahadurgarh is third large area of Haryana which has now been connected with Delhi Metro. After the public dedication of this line today, the length of Metro Network in Haryana has become 26 kilometers.

Friends,

Everyone who has ever travelled in Delhi Metro is a witness to the fact that how Delhi Metro has changed the lives of people. I myself have several times travelled in Delhi Metro. The people travelling on Bahadurgarh-Mundka line will also experience this thing from today onwards.

People in Bahadurgarhhave been eagerly waiting for the Metrobecause of the rapiddevelopment of industries there. Also, several colleges, institutes and universities are located in Bahadurgarh and a lot of students from Delhi travel to Bahadurgarh daily. Now it will become much easier for the lakhs of entrepreneurs, students and people engaged in different professions in this area to travel to Delhi.

Usually Bahadurgarh has been called the Gateway of Haryana, however, this Metro line has reached here as a Gateway of Development.

When industries will grow, this Metro will make people’s lives easier, new colonies will be established, and new avenues of employment will be created. The relationship between connectivity and development can be properly understood through this metro network.

At present, 280 kilometers long metro line is operational in Delhi. The rapid pace with which it has been expanding, very soonDelhi will be known for having the fifth largest Metro Network after Shanghai, Beijing, London and New York.

Friends, the dream that has been realized in Delhi, the kind of results of unshakable resolvesare being witnessed by the people of Delhi-NCR, the same kind of efforts are made throughout the country.

Earlier the biggest drawback in the Metro related work was that this work was done in every city in a different way. There was no policy for the Metro and the work related to it.And that is why there were no set parameters, no set standards for this thing. Politicians used to decide about the stations as per their liking and the decisions were taken as per the interests of different departments.

Now all these things have been taken into consideration after formulating the first Metro Policy of the country in 2017. Entire transport system of cities has been integrated so that the people don’t have to face problem in going from one station to another or for reaching to their offices or homes. Now, if the Metro is being developed anywhere in the country, it will be developed on the same set of standards.

Friends, it is the commitment of this government to provide a smart, easy, affordable and clean public transport system in the cities as per the requirements of the 21st century.

Today, the Metro Network has been expanded into the 12 cities of the country. State governments have been encouraged to connect different cities of the country. In addition to this metro coaches are also being manufactured in the country.

Modern plants have been set up in Vadodara in Gujarat and Chennai in Tamil Nadu. The government has amended the procurement policy to encourage the Make in India scheme in metro projects and now it has been made compulsory to use nearly 75% of the items that have been produced in India.

Friends,

Metro Network has been an excellent example of our international relations and cooperation. Earlier several countries of the world helped us in the development of metro network and now India is gearing up to supply metro coaches to several countries of the world.

Not only international relations but it is also an excellent example of this thing that how the cooperative federalism works. Today, ifmetro network is being developed in any state of the country, it is being developed with the active participation of the centre and state governments.

Friends,

If we talk about Delhi-NCR then the speed with which the Metro Network has been developed, it has removed the requirement of 6 lakh vehicles per day.

The metro has saved people’s money and time and it has also done the job of reducing pollution. In addition to the metro, the government has been working to revamp the entire transport system in Delhi-NCR and develop it as per the requirements of the people.

The work on regional rapid transport system is also being done to connect Delhi to Sonipat, Alwar and Meerut through high speed rail.

In addition to this, the work on building a network of expressways around Delhi is also being done at a fast speed. People have been making effort to finish that work.

A few days ago, I have dedicated to the public the first leg of this project - Eastern Peripheral Express way. The work on Western Peripheral Express way in Haryana is also being done. The peripheral expressway has reduced the number of small and large vehicles passing through Delhi by 25-30%.

While it has definitely reduced traffic, it has also brought down a major factor responsible for pollution.   

Brothers and sisters,

A new and smart infrastructure for a New India is a commitment of this government.

The maximum investment in the infrastructure related to roads, railways, waterways has been made in the last four years.  Emphasis has been placed on improving connectivity from Kargil to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamakhya. Whether these are the longest tunnels or the largest bridges, all these things are completed in time one after another. The work forbuilding 35,000 kilometers long modern highways has been started in the country under the Bharat Mala project.

In the near future, while on the one hand more than 100 waterways, bullet trains will bring about a major change in the country’s transport system on the other hand small airports being developed in small cities will help the people’s courage to reach to the skies. This modern infrastructure will help our cities to become the centre of growth in the 21st century. The more infrastructure will be strengthened in different parts of the country, the more convenient the connectivity will become, the more support different modes of transport will provide to each other the more easier the lives of people will become, the more opportunities for employment creation and business will be created. 

Friends,

Active participation of all of you, the common people, is extremely essential in the efforts made by the government. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Please come forward, let us make even more efforts for the development of this infrastructure which is being built for a New India.

Once again many-many congratulations to the people of Haryana and Bahadurgarh, may our citizens take advantage of it and get rid of personal vehicles.

I conclude my speech.

Thank you very much.

                Namaskar. My dear countrymen, I’m fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru. Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan. It was Afghanistan’s first international match and it’s a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India. Both teams performed par excellence. Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year. I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani’s words on Twitter tagging me along “The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan. I’m also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills”. Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan. He is an asset to the world of cricket. Then he quipped “No, we are not giving him to anyone!” This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time. Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason. The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world. What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy? The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs. This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship. Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents & skills of our youth. I felicitate both the teams of India & Afghanistan. I sincerely hope, that in future too, we’ll play with each other with the best sportsman spirit & shine together. 

 My dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights. The whole world appeared as one entity. In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga. Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women. On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison. Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people. Zealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival. If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over? 

 It is a matter of great pride for a hundred & twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea & sky. A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines; some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same. Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth. Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air. Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues. Heartwarming was an instance in Ahmedabad. Around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record.Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries. Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets; yoga has proved them in a concrete manner. I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution. I hope the campaign of wellness through yoga will gain further momentum. More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives. 

My dear countrymen, many of you have urged me on My gov and Narendra Modi app to mention Doctor’s Day, the 1st of July. You are absolutely right. We think of doctors only during times of distress. But this is a day when the nation celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their spirit of service and commitment towards society. We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life. On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth. The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments. Often a doctor plays the role of a family friend, a lifestyle guide. They not only cure but also heal. Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise; they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health. Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills. Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems. Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctor’s Day on the 1st of July. 

My dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India. India has had a rich historical canvas. Every single month, every single day in fact, is a marker of one historical event or the other. Every place in India is replete with signposts of heritage. Every place has been blessed with a saint, a luminary or a great, famous personality who has contributed through his sagacity.

 Thank you very much for your phone call. It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th. I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir. Once again I have been blessed with the opportunity to visit this Samadhi sthal, this shrine. You must be aware that in eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a place called Maghar. It is here that Sant Kabir Das ji attained Samadhi. Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar? In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in one’s pathway to heaven.  On the contrary, breathing one’s last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven. Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view. He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times. That is why he went to Maghar and chose to attain Samadhi there. Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses ‘Saakhis’ and ‘Dohas’ stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood. These were his ideals. We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions. They are relevant & inspiring even in modern times. I quote a doha 

 

कबीरसोईपीरहै, जोजानेपरपीर |

जोपरपीरनजानही , सोकापीरमेंपीर ||

 

          The true saint is the one who recognizes & understands the sufferings of others. Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate. Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion. He was a thinker way ahead of his times. In those days, when the whole world was undergoing strife and degradation of moral values, he spread the message of peace & harmony. He worked towards uniting the populace, bridging their differences. 

“जगमेंबैरीकोईनहीं, जोमनशीतलहोय

यहआपातोडालदे, दयाकरेसबकोय”          

There will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace.

Compassion should be the universal way of life.

In another doha, Kabir has written.

जहांदयातहंधर्म, जहांलोभतहंपाप

जहांक्रोधतहंकालहै, जहांक्षमातहंआप          

Compassion leads to righteousness,

Greed leads to sin.

Anger is sure to devour you,

Forgiveness is a great virtue.

He said

 

जातिनपूछोसाधूकी, पूछलिजियज्ञान

Never ask a saint his caste or creed;

Ask him about his repository of knowledge.          

He appealed to the people to rise above divisions of religion & caste and make knowledge & wisdom the sole basis of recognition. His principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by.Since we are referring to Sant Kabir Das ji, I am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says,

""गुरुगोविन्ददोऊखड़ेकाकेलागूंपांय|

बलिहारीगुरुआपने, गोविन्ददियोबताय""||

  Such is the exalted status accorded to the guru, the teacher. And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev. He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries. Guru Nanak Dev’s teachings endeavoured to eradicate caste based discrimination prevalent in society. He perceived humankind as one & urged everyone to embrace humanity. 

Guru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God. Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society. The establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste, sect, religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019. I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour. To celebrate this festival in the entire Indian society and around the world I also urge you to suggest new ideas, new concepts, and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the Prakash parv as Prerna Parv with great pride .

My dear countrymen! The history of India's struggle for independence is very long, very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices. There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab. In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity. Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty; theguiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon. How can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to, but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is - violence and cruelty can never solve any problem. It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end!

My dear countrymen! Mr. Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on 'Narendra Modi Mobile App' that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this episode of Mann Ki Baat. Thank you very much, Raman ji. It feels great to see your interest in India's history. You know, yesterdayjune 23, was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields, but the areas which were closest to his heart were education, administration and parliamentary affairs, very few people would know that he was the youngest vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta at merely 33 years of age.

Very few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla. This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla. From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for India’s industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform. The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision. Dr. Mukherjee's dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.

He had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry. For the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup- All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi & Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950. There was also a special emphasis by Dr. Mukherjee on indigenization of India's defence production, in the establishment of four most successful mega projects- Chittaranjan locomotive works factory, Hindustan aircraft factory, Sindri fertilizer factory and Damodar Valley Corporation and other river valley projects, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly. He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal. It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.

For Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India - and for this, at the young age of 52, he also sacrificed his life. Come! Let us forever remember Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India.

My dear countrymen! During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call. I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them. People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements. I believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me, but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people's faces lit with happiness, can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone's life? When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.

In far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers. Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream. Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva – Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages. At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur ; And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people. Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school’s tinkering lab. I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasn’t a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me. I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country's power, the power of New India’s dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India – this is what I experienced!

There are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite. In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government's credit. An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people. With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more. There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and you’re left with renewed fervour and inspiration.

I am very grateful to the countrymen. 40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength. I again want to express my gratitude to you all.

My dear countrymen! I always feel that if we look around us, somewhere or something good always happens. Many good people out there are involved in beneficial work. We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness. In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination. On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture. Now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations - what is the relation between these professions? But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless ‘Samridhi trust’ with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust. This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers. The training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional, engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers. The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust. Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.

On one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers' participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right. A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest. Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank. I congratulate these young people for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these young professionals, technocrats and others associated with the world of  engineering, got out of their comfort zone to make a connect with the farmer, the village, fields and barns. 

Friends! Your youth-power is really inspiring for any young person. Many other young people of our country will definitely visit your website and look closely at your work and will also be inspired by how they can be of use in different areas of the social milieu in their area. I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.

My dear countrymen! It’s been an year when GST was implemented. 'One Nation, One Tax' was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today. If I’ve to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of ‘One Nation One Tax reform’, then I credit the states of our nation. GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country. So far, there have been 27 meetings of the GST Council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings. These meetings involve representatives of different states; states which have different priorities, but in spite of all this, all the decisions that have been taken in the GST Council so far have been taken with absolute consensus. Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country. GST is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty. Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.

In the GST scheme,information technology has replaced the inspector. Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology. The check post has become extinct after the arrival of the GST scheme and the movement of goods has become faster, which not only saves time but is also accruing benefits in the areaof logistics. GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world. The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme. It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption. However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement. This is a huge success in itself which 125 crore Indians have earned for themselves.

My dear countrymen! Once again, while concluding this episode, I wait most eagerly for the next chapter of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, of meeting you and talking to you. I wish you many felicitations.

Thank you very much.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the Bahadurgarh-Mundka Metro Line via video conference. 

Congratulating the people of Haryana and Delhi on the commencement of this new section of the Delhi Metro, he said he was happy to see Bahadurgarh connected with the Delhi Metro. 

This is the third place in Haryana, after Gurugram and Faridabad to be connected like this.

The Prime Minister spoke of how the Metro in Delhi has positively impacted the lives of citizens. Noting that Bahadurgarh is witnessing tremendous economic growth, the Prime Minister said that there are several educational centres there, and students from there even travel to Delhi. The Metro will make this more convenient, he added. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that there is a direct link between connectivity and development. He said the Metro will mean more employment opportunities for the people in the area.

The Prime Minister said that the Union Government has brought out a policy relating to Metros, to bring uniformity and standardization in metro rail networks across the country. He said the objective is to build convenient, comfortable and affordable urban transport systems in our cities. He said that the aim is also to boost “Make in India” by making metro rail coaches in India itself. 

The Prime Minister said that the process of making Metro systems is also linked to cooperative federalism. Wherever Metros are being built in India, the Centre and the respective State Governments are working together, he added. 

Noting that New India requires new and smart infrastructure, the Prime Minister said that the Union Government is working on roads, railways, highways, airways, waterways and i-ways. There is focus on connectivity and on ensuring that development projects are completed on time, he added.

                 Greetings to all of you !

My dear brothers and sisters of Rajgarh who are present here in large numbers,

It is a blessing for me and my colleagues that you have gathered here in large numbers even in this scorching heat in the month of June. I appreciate your affection. Your energy and blessings have always encouraged the members of BharatiyaJanata Party to serve you effectively. I am fortunate to have got the opportunity of launching the Mohanpura irrigation project worth Rs.4000 crore along with the three major water supply projects. I salute and congratulate every one associated with these projects, from people carrying the bricks on their heads to the brothers, sisters and mothers who had used the spade for digging and those who had operated small and big machines. Their commitment to this virtuous work of nation building is unparalleled. 

My dear brothers and sisters,

Launching the projects by pressing the button is merely a formality. These were actually launched by your hard work and sweat. Taking decisions of public welfare, the BharatiyaJanata Party government at the centre has successfully completed four years at your service by your blessings and hard work. Your presence in such large numbers is the proof of the fact that you have tremendous faith in the government of BharatiyaJanata Party and its policies. People who are spreading lies, confusion and pessimism are not aware of the ground realities.

 It is a coincidence that the death anniversary of the great personality Dr.Shyama Prasad Mukherjee falls on today, the 23rd June. It is on this day he died in Kashmir under mysterious circumstances. On this occasion, I would like to commemorate, salute and pay tributes to him.

Brothers and sisters,

Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee used to say, ""Any nation can be protected only by its own energy."" He had immense faith in the country's resources and the talent of the people. His vision of pulling the people out of disappointment and desperation that followed after independence still inspires crores of people. As the country's first Industries and Supplies Minister, he had framed the country's first Industrial Policy. He used to say, ""If the government, the educational institutions of the country and the industrial organizations together promote industries, the country will soon become financially independent."" His work, thoughts and ideas related to thefields of education, women empowerment and atomic energy were way ahead of his time. The paths shown by him keeping in mind the importance of public participation in the country's development still holds relevance.

Friends,

Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee used to say, ""the foremost duty of the government is to serve the poor, the homeless and to uplift their standard of living."" This is the reason why he had done a significant work on land reforms while he was the Finance Minister of Bengal, before he took over as the Industry minister. He used to believe that governance should be for fulfilling the dreams of the citizens and not for ruling like the British. 

Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had emphasized upon education, health and security. He used to say, "" government should provide adequate facilities from early education to higher education and to create an environment to bring out the hidden talent in the youth so that they canactively serve their villages and towns."" In Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's life  knowledge, wealth and development fused into one.

It is unfortunate for our country that just to glorify a particular family, contributions of several great sons of Mother India were deliberately suppressed and attempts were made to wipe out their contributions from the minds of the people.

Friends,

The vision of the government at the centre and of the BharatiyaJanata Party governments of the states is no different from that of Dr. Mukherjee. You will get a glimpse of Dr. Mukherjee's vision in schemes such as Skill India Mission, Start-up India mission, MUDRA Yojana for providing bank loans without guarantee for promoting self-employment or Make in India.

Your Rajgarh district will no longer be known as a backward district. The government has decided to develop it as one of the aspirational districts. Now work in the areas of health, education, cleanliness, nutrition, water conservation and agriculture will be expedited here. 

Under Rashtriya Gram SwarajAbhiyan, the necessary amenities are being delivered to the villages of theaspirational  districts. The government is now trying to ensure that every village in these districts will have gas connection under UjjwalaYojana, power connection under SaubhagyaYojana, bank accounts under Jan DhanYojana, insurance coverage and vaccination of pregnant women and children under Mission Indradhanush.

Friends,

These things could have been done even before by the previous governments. No one had stopped them. However, the party that had ruled for maximum period of time did not have faith in you and your hard work. It never believed in the country's capability.

Tell me; did this central government ever utter a single word of despondency in the last four years? Did we ever say that something was not possible? We have always taken steps to fulfil our resolutions and have strived for better results.

Therefore, brothers and sisters,

We believe in moving forward with hope and belief.

Friends,

This government is committed and working hard to  take the nation to new heights of development in the 21st century, keeping in mind the requirements of the country and believing in its resources. 

The Central government in the last four years and the BJP government of Madhya Pradesh in the last 13 years have worked for empowering the poor, the backward, the oppressed and the deprived sections of the society and the farmers. In the last 5 years, average annual growth of agriculture in MP has remained about 18% which is the highest in the country. Madhya Pradesh tops in the production of pulses, oilseeds, gram, soybean, tomatoes and garlic in the country. Madhya Pradesh ranks 2 in the production of wheat, arhar, mustard, amla and coriander and are about to make its way to the top.

Madhya Pradesh has written a new saga of development under the rule of Shivrajji. The launch of Mohanpura irrigation project and the commencement of the work on the three water supply schemes, is an important part of this episode. This is one of the greatest projects of not only Rajgarh but also of Madhya Pradesh.

Friends,

Farmer brothers and sisters of about 725 villages will benefit from this project. 1.25 lakh hectares of land of these villages will not only have Irrigation facilities but 400 villages will also get rid of the problem of drinking water scarcity. This means we will be showered with the blessings of lakhs of mothers and sisters. No one can understand the problem of water scarcity better than mothers and sisters. In a way, this is the highest level of service to mothers and sisters.

This project is not only an example of rapid pace of development but also an evidence of the government's way of accomplishing tasks. This project has been completed almost within 4 years. Micro-irrigation has been the focus of this project. This means instead of an open canal, the emphasis was on laying down pipelines.

Brothers and sisters,

There is a saying in Malwa - 'मालवधरतीगगनगंभीर, डग-डगरोटी, पग-पगनीर।' This is an old saying. It means that there was a time when there was no shortage of grains or water on the land of Malwa. Water was available at every step. However, due to the negligence of the previous governments, water became scarce here. However, in the past few years under BJP government led by Shivrajji, serious efforts were made to revive the old identity of Malwa and Madhya Pradesh.

Friends,

In 2007, barely an area of 7.5 lakh hectares used to be irrigated by the irrigation projects in Madhya Pradesh. Under Shivrajji's governance, it has increased to 40 lakh hectares. I would also like to tell the viewers on television that now the state government is planning to double it by 2024. The government is spending 70,000 crore rupees to extend the micro-irrigation system.

I want to reassure you that efforts will be made to achieve more than the set target and the Central government will move hand-in-hand with you.

Madhya Pradesh is also benefitting from the Pradhan MantriKrishiSinchaiyojana. Under this scheme, work is underway on 14 projects in the state. Madhya Pradesh has been allotted Rs.1400 crores under this project. The mission of 'per drop more crop' is being carried forward with the help of this scheme. As a result of this hard work over the past 4 years, the area under micro-irrigation has increased to 25 lakh hectares across the country out of which 1.5 lakh hectares of land belongs to Madhya Pradesh.

Friends,

You must have observed that I am talking to different people about government schemes with the help of video technology and NAMO app. Just three days back I had talked to the country's farmers. I got the opportunity to talk to the farmer brothers and sisters of Jhabua in this programme. One of the farmer sisters from Jhabua told me about her increased tomato production with the help of drip irrigation.

Friends,

The villages and farmers of the country play a vital role in the dream of building a New India. Therefore, efforts are being made to double the income of the farmers with the emergence of a New India. Steps have been taken in the direction of every aspect of agriculture ranging from the seeds to the market.

Friends,

Almost 14 crore soil Health cards were distributed across the country in the last four year of which onecrore 25 lakhs were given to my farmer brothers and sisters of Madhya Pradesh. With the help of these cards, farmer brothers are now able to know the apt quantity of fertilizers that is required for their soil. Similarly, more than 35 lakh farmers of Madhya Pradesh are availing the benefits of Pradhan MantriFasalBimaYojana. 

All the Mandis across the country are now being linked to an online market i.e. the e-NAM platform to provide fair price to the farmers for their crops. Till date almost 600 mandis have been linked to the e-NAM platform. Today 58 mandis of Madhya Pradesh have also been linked to it. That day is not far when the farmers will be able to sell their produce directly through their villages' Common Service centres or mobile phones.

Brothers and sisters,

The government has been taking steps to uplift the standard of living of the villages and the poor. Relentless efforts are being made especially for the mothers and sisters belonging to the Dalit, tribal and backward communities to help them get rid of the poisonous fumes.

More than fourcrore mothers and sisters have received free LPG cylinders for their kitchens till date. Even in Madhya Pradesh, almost 40 lakh women have been given free gas connections.

Friends,

This government has great respect for hard work. Today, the government of India is concerned about encouraging the entrepreneurs capable of producing maximum jobs. Although some people may have negative attitude towards labour, the success of this government's efforts is for everyone to see.

Today under the MUDRA Yojana, the small entrepreneurs are able to get bank loans without guarantee. More than 85 lakh people of Madhya Pradesh have been benefited by  this scheme.

Brothers and sisters,

These double engines of development in Delhi and Bhopal are carrying Madhya Pradesh ahead.

I clearly remember that once a highly derogatory word was associated with Madhya Pradesh because of its ailing situation. The word was 'BIMARU', which no one liked to hear. Madhya Pradesh was included among the 'diseased' states of the country. Congress, that had been ruling for a long time, had never realized that it was an insult that was being afflicted on Madhya Pradesh.

They used to consider the general public as their subjects and made them sing their praises. They had never paid any attention to the future of Madhya Pradesh.

However, the BharatiyaJanata Party government has pulled the state out of that condition and made it a partner in the country's development. You have elected Shivrajji to this post but he has been working for this region and its people like a servant.

I congratulate the people of Madhya Pradesh and its government for marching ahead on the path of success.

Once again my best wishes to you all. Thank you very much for coming here in such large numbers.

Close your fists and say with me loudly-

Victory to Mother India!

Victory to Mother India!

Victory to Mother India!

 

Thanks a lot!

He said a similar exercise is now underway in seven cities of Madhya Pradesh. He spoke in detail about the progress being made in various urban development initiatives in Madhya Pradesh. He said that through the housing projects inaugurated today, more than one lakh homeless people in Madhya Pradesh have got their own house. 

He said the Government of India is working towards the vision of providing housing for all by 2022. He said that in the last four years, approximately 1.15 crore houses have been constructed, and nearly 2 crore more houses are to be constructed, to achieve the goal by 2022. He said that the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana is also becoming a means for generating employment and women empowerment. 

The Prime Minister also spoke of progress made in other spheres of development.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today dedicated the Mohanpura Project to the Nation. This project will facilitate irrigation of agricultural land in Rajgarh district. It will also provide drinking water to villages in the area. The Prime Minister also laid the foundation stone of various drinking water schemes.

Addressing a large public gathering at Mohanpura, the Prime Minister paid homage to Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee on his death anniversary. He recalled Dr. Mukherjee’s message that a Nation can be secured only through its own energy and efforts. He recalled Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee’s contributions in various fields such as industrial policy, education, and women empowerment. He said Dr. Mukherjee placed the highest emphasis on education, health and security. He said the schemes of the Union Government such as Skill India Mission, Start Up India, Mudra Yojana, and Make in India, all have elements of Dr. Mukherjee’s vision. 

The Prime Minister said that Rajgarh district is among the Aspirational Districts identified by the Government, and development work will now be speeded up here. He said the Union Government, keeping in mind the needs of the country, placing faith in its capabilities, is working towards taking India to new heights in the 21st century. He appreciated the Government of Madhya Pradesh, for the work done by it in the agriculture sector, and for its development initiatives. He praised the State Government for the increase in irrigated area in the State.

                       My colleague in the council of ministers, Commerce and Industries Minister Shri Suresh Prabhu Ji, Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Shri Hardeep Singh Puri Ji, Minister of State for Commerce and Industries Shri  C. R. Chaudhary Ji, officials of the Ministry of Commerce and other relevant Ministries and the dignitaries present here. 

     First of all I congratulate all of you for the foundation stone laying for the Vanijya Bhawan. The work on it has started today and as I have been told on the dais that the work will be completed by December next year. I believe that Vanijya Bhawan will be constructed within the stipulated time and very soon people are going to start getting its benefits. 

      Friends, why I am talking about the time before anything else because of all the buildings, for which I have got the opportunity to either lay the foundation stone or the opportunity to inaugurate them during the tenure of this government, had one common thing. The common thing was that these buildings also reflect the style of working of respective governments. And the difference between a country moving towards a New India and the old system can also be gauged from these things. 

      Friends, I would like to give you some examples. I remember that Pravasi Bhartiya Kendra was dedicated to the people in 2016 but the  announcement for it was made at the time of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It took 12 years to construct that building. The decision to build Dr. Ambedkar International Centre which was dedicated to public last year was taken in 1992. However, its foundation was laid in 2015. It was dedicated to the public in 2017. It means it took 23-24 years to construct.  

Friends, 

     I have dedicated the new building of Central Information Commission to the nation in March this year. The demand for a new building for CIC was made 12 years back. But the construction was started by this NDA government and it was finished within the stipulated time. 

      There is another example of Ambedkar National Memorial built on the Alipur Road. This building too was dedicated to the public two months ago. The discussion for this memorial went on for years, it was fast tracked during the period of Atal Ji, however, after that all  work was stopped for the next 10-12 years. 

      The story of these four symbols, the  buildings in Delhi is that when the government doesn’t function in silos, when all the departments, all the Ministries work together by coming out of their silos then work is done fast. The country has moved ahead of the tendency of putting hurdles, creating confusions and delaying things. 

I am happy that today a beginning has been made to add the fifth symbol to Delhi.  

     This is my desire that the work of breaking the silos in every field of commerce sector will be done in an even better manner from under one roof.  And I am confident that it will be materialized. 

      Friends, today India is at a very critical juncture. Our demographic dividend can be a matter of envy for any country. Our youths provide a new energy to our democracy. These young people are the foundation of the 21st century India. Fulfillment of their hopes and aspirations is not the responsibility of just a few Ministries but it is a collective responsibility of all of us. 

     India has lost the opportunity to take advantage of industrial revolution in the last century. There were several reasons behind that at that time. However, now there are equal number of reasons because of which India can become one of the countries leading the industrial revolution of this century. The fourth industrial revolution, digital technology is the basis for this revolution, which is also called the fourth industrial revolution, and India is certainly ahead of many countries in this field. 

     Today, you will find that digital technology is the main thing in realizing all the goals, among all the things done by the Ministry of Commerce. Take the example of this Vanijya Bhawan. The land on which this building will be constructed, it was earlier under the control of the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals. Now this more than 100 years old organisation has been closed and it has been replaced by a body based on the digital technology - Government-e-Marketplace- GeM. GeM has completely revolutionised the way the government procures the goods required by it. 

      Today, more than 1.17 lakh companies, small and large sellers, have joined this platform. More than five lakh orders have been placed to these sellers through GeM. Goods worth more than Rs. 8,700 crore have been procured through GeM in a very short span of time. 

      The Ministry of Commerce deserves to be praised for the way it has provided the opportunity to small entrepreneurs located in far-flung areas of the country to directly sell their products to the government. However, I think that it’s the beginning of a long journey for you people. 

     How GeM can be further expanded, how it can take the country’s MSME sector and small entrepreneurs towards international commerce, a lot still needs to be done in this regard.  Today, the presence of more than 40 crore smart phones, the growing number of internet users and cheap data, all these things are making your work even easier. 

     Friends, there is a saying in our country that: Bharah Samarthanam Kim Door Vyavasayinam, it means that nothing is heavy for a powerful person. Similarly, no place is far away for businessmen. Today, the technology has made business so easy that distances are becoming smaller day by day. The more this technology will be used in the country’s business culture the more it will be beneficial. 

       We have seen that how in less than a year the GST has changed the way business is done in India. Whether it would have been possible if the technology was not there? No. Today, the number of people joining the indirect tax regime has been expanding at a very fast pace because of GST. 

      While only 60 lakh people were linked to our country’s indirect tax system since independence, more than 54 lakh people have applied to join GST within 11 months of its implementation and out of this number more than 47 lakh people have already got registered with GST. So the total number of registered entities have already crossed one crore. 

      This also shows that there will be good results once things are simplified, once the path of Minimum Government, Maximum Governance is being followed. More and more people now come forward to join the mainstream of development. 

       Friends, you are well aware that in the last four years the government has constantly worked to develop a people friendly, development friendly and investment friendly environment. India’s macro economic indicators remain stable despite a lot of global challenges - be it inflation or fiscal deficit or be it current account balance - all these indicators have recorded improvement in comparison with the numbers during the previous government. 

Today, India is playing an important role in the world economic growth. The economic growth of the country has touched the level of 7.7% in the last quarter. The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and the growth in Foreign Exchange Reserve of the country during the last four years is a record in itself. 

     Today, India is among the top two emerging market performers in the FDI Confidence Index. Getting to the 100th spot from 142nd spot in the ease of doing business ranking, improvement of 19 points in Logistics Performance Index, getting to the 39th position in Global Competitiveness Index from the 71st position, and 21 point jump in Global Innovation Index, all these are the results of the same vision. 

       You must be aware that recently India has secured a place among the top five Fin Tech Countries. However, along with these positive indicators there is a bigger question – what next.

 Friends, we need to work on our target to get double digit growth rate by going beyond the growth rate of 7-8%. Today the world is looking at India with the expectation that how many years India will take to join the economies of the size of $5 trillion. 

    I believe that all officers in the Ministry of Commerce should take these goals as a challenge. This progress in the economic front is directly related to the life of the common man of the country. 

      That is why you would have noticed that whenever I raise the issue of Ease of Trading, Ease of Doing Business I also always raise the issue of Ease of Living. Everything is connected with each other in this interconnected world. 

     When it is easier to take an electricity connection, when construction permits are granted soon, when industries, companies don’t have to grapple with the processes then these things also benefit common man. That is why it is also a challenge for you people that whatever bottlenecks are remaining in the different sectors, wherever work is being performed in silos, all these should be corrected as soon as possible. Particularly, the problems that are being faced in the infrastructure sector, wherever the transaction cost is high, those things that act as an impediment in boosting the manufacturing, the things those lead to inadequate diversification of services, it’s extremely necessary to end them, to improve upon them. 

     I am glad that recently the Department of Commerce has taken upon itself the responsibility for the integrated development of logistics sector. This initiative is going to play an important role in improving the trade environment in the country. 

     Friends, having an integrated logistics action plan is the need of the hour and it’s also necessary for a New India. This goal can be achieved by amending the policies and existing procedures and by increasing the use of modern tools. 

      I have been told that the Department of Commerce has also been working on the direction of an Online Portal. It’s extremely essential for all the ministries, for all the states to work collectively to further strengthen India’s position in global trade and to take it to a new height. This is what we call the ‘Whole of Government Approach’. It needs to be adopted. 

     It is also a good step that the Council for Trade Development and Promotion has been working to create an environment in the States and union territories for encouraging international trade. If we want to boost India’s exports then we must move forward by making the states active partners in this thing. 

      I believe that the faster we move in this direction by formulating a State level export strategy, by harmonizing it with the national trade policy, by providing economic assistance and also by taking along all the stakeholders, the more it will be beneficial for the country. 

      Friends, in order to increase India’s presence in the international market it’s extremely important to focus on new products and new markets while maintaining our traditional products and markets. We will have to make ourselves stronger to face the conditions outside the country in addition to facing the conditions inside the country. 

     The results will be visible when we will move forward while maintaining balance between short-term developmental gains and long-term sustainability. I consider the midterm review related to foreign trade policy which was conducted the last year, an extremely positive initiative. Every change which was made by increasing the incentives and by holding the hand of MSME sector to boost the export is commendable. It is also directly related to the country’s employment related needs. 

      There is another important issue and that is the quality of the product. And this was the reason that I had made an appeal for Zero Defect-Zero Effect on the 15th of August in 2014 from the Red Fort. Whether it is a small factory or a large factory, every manufacturer should be encouraged for this thing that it should manufacture such kind of products which are zero defect and nobody should send back our exported goods. In addition to this, I had also discussed the issue of Zero Effect, it means that our products should not have any negative impact on environment. 

      This awareness about the quality of product will work to bring glory to Make in India and to further strengthen the identity of a New India. You would also be feeling proud when you would have noticed that today the number of mobile manufacturing units in our country has gone up to 120, which was just 2 in 2014, and they have been manufacturing world class quality products in the country. 

      Friends, this is the time for making solemn pledges, it’s the time for accepting the challenges.  The Department of Commerce should try to ensure that it will double India’s share in the total global trade, that it will take to at least 3.4% from the present 1.6%.   It’s contribution to the world economy will be equal to  India’s GDP. This will create new avenues for employment in our country and our per capita income will also go up. Every department of the government and all the people of Export Promotion Councils present here will have to make a collective effort in order to achieve this. 

    One more resolve has to be taken regarding imports. Can we reduce our dependence on imports in certain sectors? Whether it is import of energy or import of electronic goods or weapons and gadgets needed in defence sector or medical devices? Whether it is possible to do this through Make in India?  Ten per cent reduction in the imports through domestic manufacturing can boost the country’s income by up to Rs. 3.5 lakh crore. It can become an effective tool for taking India’s GDP growth in to double digits.  

     I would like to give you an example of manufacturing of electronic goods. Whether it is not a challenge for all of you that we are still required to purchase 65% of our total requirement of electronic goods from abroad? Can you make the country self reliant in the manufacturing of electronic goods as it has been done in the field of mobile phone manufacturing by accepting this challenge? 

      Friends, you are also familiar with that an extremely important step in the direction of reducing the dependence on imports was taken last year. Emphasis has been placed on procuring all the goods and services that are procured by all the departments and institutions from domestic suppliers through an order of Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India). Every effort should be made to earnestly implement this order. 

     All of you, all the units of government will have to further strengthen your monitoring system to implement this order. The government has taken several other important decisions to boost the domestic production. Whether it is regulatory framework or be it making the regulatory framework even easier or be it the investor friendly policy or be it the stress upon infrastructure and logistics, all these things are being done so that India can be made self-reliant; so that it does not lag behind a bit in the industrial revolution of the 21st century. 

     My only expectation is that this pride that has been increasing alongside Make in India, may it bring repute to the new Vanijya Bhawan which is going to be constructed. 

      Friends, you also got one auspicious thing done by my hands before I came here. I got the good opportunity to plant a Bakul or Maulshri sapling in this premise. Maulshri has been respected since mythological period, it is full of numerous medicinal properties and Maulshri tree provides shade for years. I have been told that there is a plan to plant nearly one thousand more trees here in addition to this.  

     I conclude my speech with this expectation that may you people give your best, that all of you make your best effort for making a New India in this environment friendly atmosphere which is equipped with modern technology.  

Once again many-many congratulations to all of you on the beginning of the construction of Vanijya Bhawan. 

Thank you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today laid the foundation stone for Vanijya Bhawan, a new office complex for the Union Government’s Department of Commerce, at New Delhi. 


The Prime Minister expressed confidence that the building will be completed well within the stipulated time. He emphasized that this would be in keeping with the spirit of New India, and moving away from old practices, under which important building projects, even in the Capital, had been inordinately delayed. In this context, he mentioned the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre, the Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial, the Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra and the new office building for the Central Information Commission. 


He said that this is also the result of breaking silos within the working of the Government. He hoped that the new office building – Vanijya Bhawan – would further facilitate elimination of silos in India’s commerce sector. Speaking about the country’s demographic dividend, the Prime Minister said that it is our collective responsibility to fulfil the aspirations of our youth.


Talking of adoption of digital technology, the Prime Minister remarked that the land on which the new building is being constructed, was earlier occupied by the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposal. This has now been replaced by the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), which has seen transactions worth Rs. 8700 crore in a short time, he added. He urged the Department of Commerce to work towards further expansion of GeM, and leverage it for the benefit of the country’s MSME sector. He also spoke of the benefits of GST, and said the Union Government is making constant efforts to create a people-friendly, development-friendly and investment-friendly environment. 


The Prime Minister mentioned various macro-economic parameters, and other indicators to explain how the India is now playing an important role in the global economy. He said India is now among the top five fin-tech countries, globally. He said subjects such as “Ease of Trading,” and “Ease of Doing Business,” are all related to “Ease of Living” in an interconnected world. 


The Prime Minister emphasized the need for an increase in exports, and said that States must be made active partners in this effort. He said the Department of Commerce must resolve to raise India’s share in total global exports to at least 3.4 percent, from the current 1.6 percent. Similarly he said, efforts must be made to raise domestic manufacturing output, to reduce imports. In this context, he gave the example of electronics manufacturing. He said the Union Government has taken a number of steps to boost domestic manufacturing.

                Namashkar, Dignitaries  and invitees assembled in New York State for the inauguration of the Nature Cure Centre, viewers watching this event online and on television. Ladies and Gentlemen,  Greetings on the occasion of International Yoga Day!

This morning,  I was delighted to join thousands of people from different walks of life, to celebrate this occasion, in the beautiful city of Dehradun, in the foot-hills of the Himalayas. For the last few days, I have been seeing pictures of people participating in the celebrations, across the world. Indeed, in just three years, this event has grown into a world-wide public movement. It has become an integral part of public life in many countries. Its impact has expanded far beyond its day of observance. In India, I perceive three different themes in the observation of International Day of Yoga. I am sure, this is the case in many other countries as well.

First, it has become an occasion of initiation for millions. Inspired by the spirit of Yoga, they commit themselves to its pursuit.

Second, it is an occasion when those, who are already introduced to Yoga, re-dedicate themselves to its pursuit.

The third theme is to spread the good word. Thousands of individuals and institutions, who have already gained from Yoga, reach out to those that still have not. In the process, International Day of Yoga, has even come to be celebrated as a festival, by many across the world. The word Yoga, means 'to unite'.  Therefore, this surge of interest in Yoga, fills me with hope. I hope that Yoga can become a binding force for the world.

I am happy that you have chosen the International Day of Yoga, for the inauguration of this Nature Cure Centre. I  hope that this Centre shall strive to strongly integrate elements of Yoga, in all its programmes and initiatives.

Friends,

Traditional Indian knowledge systems, such as Yoga and Ayurveda, help us stay healthy. They guide us to overcome inherent weaknesses of both body and mind. These are systems, which treat individuals with care and respect. Their approach is neither intrusive nor abrupt. It often comes as a refreshing change to those used to conventional treatment therapies. Modern lifestyle takes a toll  on the body as well as the mind. The focus of conventional systems of healthcare, unfortunately, is more on cure, rather than on prevention. There is no denying that we need conventional medicine to address the huge health challenges of today. But it is also a fact that there are gap areas that remain un-addressed. Healthcare specialists all over the world now appreciate the fact that systems like Yoga and Ayurveda can complement the conventional medicine system extremely well. These holistic systems focus on wellness and disease prevention.  Adoption of these holistic practices leads to increased health and wellness in individuals and in communities. Contrary to the perception of some people, Yoga is not limited to exercises and postures . It involves a deep search into mind, body and spirit. It leads to a greater understanding of one-self. This leads further to social discipline, and in turn to ethics and enduring values of life. Yoga is a deep philosophy that can help us to walk on the path of salvation or freedom from worries.

Friends,

I have always believed that Yoga has no religion. It contains practical steps which can benefit everyone, even those who do not consider themselves religious. Modern Yoga practices often include various elements of ancient wisdom. These include moral and ethical principles, postures designed to keep the body fit, spiritual philosophy, instruction by a guru, chanting of mantras, quieting  the breath and stilling  the mind through meditation. Yoga focuses on changing the lifestyle of the individual, so that lifestyle related disorders are easily prevented and managed. Experts of Yoga see its daily practice as beneficial in itself, leading to improved health, emotional well-being, mental clarity  and joy in living. The belief that certain yogic postures and Pranayama help to control many diseases has been widely held in India for centuries. Now, modern science has stepped in to generate supporting evidence for this. Science has also demonstrated that through Yoga, it is possible to exercise control over the functions of many organs in the body including heart, brain, and endocrine glands.

Today, interest in Yoga is growing rapidly in Western countries. It would be no exaggeration to say that Yoga has been appreciated a lot by the Western world. I am told that in USA alone, more than 20 million people are practicing Yoga and that this number is increasing at an average of five percent every year. Several modern medical institutes of USA and Europe have adopted Yoga as an alternative or adjunct treatment for many disorders. Of late, a lot of research has been undertaken in Yoga. The Government of India is committed to implement evidence based traditional systems of healthcare in public health. Our National Health Policy, announced last year, strongly focuses on the prevention of diseases. We have also launched nation-wide programmes for the prevention and control of non communicable diseases. India is a big country with the world's second largest population. The initiatives taken today may take some years to show results, but  I  am confident that tangible results will soon become visible.

In conclusion, I would like to say again that your Nature Cure Facility will work to bring the benefit of Yoga, to all those who come there to seek comfort and relief.I am happy to note that the path-ways to wellness projected by your Centre aim to address the personal concerns of the individuals. It is also significant that their objective is life-long wellness. I assume that respect for authenticity  and faith in scientific approach are inherent to these objectives. With such an approach, the Centre can contribute significantly to the wellness movement, and take the benefits of Yoga to a large number of people in the USA. It also gives me happiness to learn that your Centre will create five hundred direct and fifteen hundred indirect jobs in the area. It will thus be a responsible member of the community. I wish you all the very best for this venture.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

He said that Yoga is beautiful because it is ancient and yet modern, it is constant and yet evolving; it has the best of our past and present and provides a ray of hope for our future. 

 
Talking about the potential of Yoga, Prime Minister said that Yoga has a solution to most of the problems faced by people, as individuals as well as a society. He said that Yoga could lead to a calm, creative and content life, removing tensions and needless anxiety. “Instead of dividing, Yoga unites. Instead of further animosity, Yoga assimilates. Instead of increasing suffering, Yoga heals”, he added.

                All the dignitaries present here on the dais and all my friends present in this beautiful ground, I convey my best wishes on the fourth International Day for Yoga to Yoga lovers all over the world from this holy land of Devbhumi Uttarakhand.

It’s no less than our good fortune that all of us have gathered here in this manner on the occasion of Yoga day on this land of mother Ganges where four holy shrines are located, the land which was visited by AdiShankaracharya and where Swami Vivekanand also came several times. 

Even otherwise, Uttarakhand has been the main centre for Yoga for several decades. These mountains of Uttarakhand spontaneously inspire us for Yoga and Ayurveda. 

Even a common man gets a unique diving feeling when he visits this place. There is an incredible spirit, vibrations and magnetic power in this holy land. 

Friends,

It’s a matter of pride for all Indians that today as the rising sun will progress on its journey, as the sunrays will reach the earth and light is spread, in all those places people will welcome the sun with Yoga. 

From Dehradun to Dublin, from Shanghai to Chicago, from Jakarta to Johannesburg, everywhere, there is Yoga all around. 

Whether it is thousands of feet high mountains of Himalaya or be it desert area singed by sunlight, Yoga is flourishing the life in every situation. 

When divisive powers gain prominence then it leads to disintegration. It leads to division among the people, division among the societies and division among the countries. When there is a division in the society then it leads todiscord within the family and the person breaks down from inside and tension in life continuesto grow.  

Yoga helps to maintain balance amidst this disintegration. It does the job of uniting us. 

Yoga brings about peace in this modern fast paced life by combining the body, mind, spirit and soul. 

It brings about peace in the family by uniting the person with the family.

It brings about a harmony in the society by making the family sensitive towards society. 

Societies become the links for national integration. 

And this kind of countries bring about peace and harmony in the world. And humanity flourishes and gainstrength from this feeling of brotherhood. 

It means Yoga unites individuals, families, societies, countries and the world and it unites the entire humanity. 

When the proposal for Yoga Day was moved in the United Nations then it is a record in the United Nations that this was the first such motion that was co-sponsored by the maximum number of countries in the world. And this was the first such proposal in the history of United Nations which was approved in the least time. And today every citizen of the world, every country of the world considers Yoga as its own and it is an important message for the people of India that we are the inheritors of that great legacy, that we have preserved the legacy of that great tradition. 

If we start taking pride in our legacy and if we abandon those things which are out of sync with the time, and that kind of thing doesn’t last either. However, what is appropriate as per the time and which is useful in making of the future, if we take pride in our great legacy of this kind then the world too will never hesitate in taking pride in that. But if we don’t have any trust in our own strength and capabilities then no one will accept it. If a family itself continues to demoralise a child in the family and if that family expects that the kid will be respected in the locality then it is not possible. When parents, when family, when brothers and sisters, all of them accept a child as it is only then the neighbours also start accepting the child. 

Today, Yoga has proved this thing that as India has once again attached itself to the power of Yoga, similarly, the world too has started attaching itself with the Yoga. 

Today, Yoga has become one of the most powerful unifying forces in the world. 

I can say it with full sense of confidence that today if we gather the number of people doing Yoga in the entire world then incredible facts will be revealed to the world. 

People gathering for Yoga, people like you gathering for Yoga in different countries, in parks, in open grounds, on the sides of the roads, in offices and homes, in hospitals, in schools and colleges, in the historic buildings, have been providing further energy to the feeling of this universal brotherhood and global friendship. 

Friends, the world has embraced Yoga and glimpses of this can be seen in the manner in which International Day of Yoga has been marked every year.

Infact, Yoga Day has become one of the biggest mass movements in the quest for good health and well-being.

Friends, from Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, Yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions.

Yoga is beautiful because it is ancient yet modern…it is constant yet evolving.

It has the best of our past and presents and a ray of hope for our future.

In Yoga, we have the perfect solution to the problems we face, either as individuals or in our society.

Ours is a world that never sleeps. At every given point, there is something happening in a different part of the world.

A fast-paced existence brings with it lot of stress. I was shocked to read that every year, almost 18 million people all over the world die due to heart-related diseases. About 1.6 million people lose the fight against diabetes. 

The way to lead a calm, creative and content life is Yoga. It can show the way in defeating tensions and mindless anxiety.

Instead of dividing, Yoga always unites.

Instead of further animosity, Yoga assimilates.

Instead of increasing suffering, Yoga heals.

Practicing Yoga has the ability to herald an era of peace, happiness and brotherhood.

More people practicing Yoga means the world needs more people to teach it. Over the last three years many individuals are teaching Yoga, new institutions are being set up and even technology is connecting people to Yoga. I urge you all to build on this momentum in the times to come.

May this Yoga Day become an opportunity to deepen our connect with Yoga and motivate people around us to practice it. This can be the enduring impact of this day.

Friends, Yoga has shown the path of wellness to the world from the path of illness.

This is the reason because of which the acceptance for Yoga throughout the world has been increasing so rapidly. 

It has revealed in the studies conducted by Coventry University and Radboud University that Yoga not only provides relief to our bodies but it can also reverse those molecular reactions taking place in our DNA that cause illness and depression.

We can protect ourselves from several diseases in addition to having a good heath if we daily practice the poses and breathing exercise of Yoga. Regular practice of Yoga has a direct bearing on the medical expenses of any family. 

It is essential for us to stay healthy to join in the every activity, every process of the nation building and Yoga certainly has a big role in this thing too.

Therefore, today, I urge you people that those who have been practicing Yoga please make it regular, and those who could not start doing Yoga so far they must make an effort once. 

Friends, the increasing spread of Yoga has brought the world to India and India to the world even closer. The position that Yoga has got in the world due to constant efforts made by us that position will be further strengthened with the time. 

It is our responsibility to further develop the understanding about Yoga for a healthy and happy humanity. Please come forward, let us further intensify our efforts by keeping our responsibility in the mind. 

From this holy land, I once again convey my best wishes to the Yoga enthusiast all over the world. 

I convey my sincere regards to the government of Uttarakhand for organising this event. 

Thank you very much.

                Namaste, my farmer brothers and sisters, Greetings. 

Today, it is a matter of great happiness for me that I have got a rare opportunity to directly listen and know the experiences of our farmer brothers and sisters who are connected with us, who are connected with us through 600 Agriculture Science Centres (KVKs) and also through more than 2 lakh Common Service Centers located in different villages across the country.  

You people have taken time out for this thing, you people are sitting there in a joyous atmosphere and here I am able to see smiles on your faces and your enthusiasm and zeal on my TV screen. It’s a matter of great happiness for me today. Farmers feed us, they provide food to people, they provide fodder to livestock and raw material to all the industries, the entire credit for ensuring the food security of the country goes to our farmer brothers and sisters. 

Our farmers worked extremely hard in order to make India self-sufficient in terms of food grains, however, the farmer’s own development continued to shrink with the passage of time. From the beginning, farmers of the country have been left at the mercy of their destiny. A regular effort, a scientific effort was needed to bring about a change in this thinking. However, that thing has been delayed by several years. In the last four years, we have made every effort in a balanced and comprehensive manner to prepare good quality seeds, to provide them to farmers and also to provide everything from electricity to water to access to market to our farmers. And we have decided that we need to move forward with the target of doubling the farmer’s income by 2022; that we need to move forward by amending the old policies of the government; that we need to move forward by overcoming the difficulties and impediments wherever they may be. 

And when we talked about doubling the farmer’s income then there were a lot of people who made fun of this thing. They said: it’s not possible, it’s very difficult, how this thing can be done; and they created an atmosphere of gloom. However, we have resolved this thing. I have faith in farmers of the country that if a target is set for them, if necessary environment is being created then the farmers of my country are ready to take risk. Farmers are ready to work hard and produce results and they have shown this thing in the past by achieving it. 

In order to achieve this, we have set a target and a continuous effort is being made in that direction by taking along all of you - all the farmers. In order to realise this thing the emphasis has been placed on four things. First: how to minimise the cost of cultivation, the cost of raw materials for farmers. Second: how to ensure the fair prices for his produce. Third: prevent the wastage of his produce. And the fourth thing is to provide alternative sources to supplement his income in addition to farm income.  

The government has taken an extremely important decision in this year’s budget to provide fair price for their produce to the farmers of the country. The government has decided that the MSP for the scheduled crops will be declared at least one and a half times of the cost of cultivation. A lot of things have been included in this thing. And I would like to tell you that the cost of cultivation which will be calculated for fixing the MSP will also include the cost of labour by farm labourers, the cost incurred on the machines and livestock will also be included, the cost of seeds and fertilisers will also be included, cost of irrigation will also be included, the revenue paid to the state government will also be included, the interest paid on the working capital will also be included, the lease rent paid on the land will also be included in it; all these things are included in the MSP. Not only this, the labour provided by a farmer and his family members, that labour cost will also be included in the MSP after making an assessment and on the basis of that the MSP will be fixed. 

The government allocates a certain amount of money for agriculture in the budget. During the last five years of the previous government, the allocation for agriculture was Rs. 1.21 lakh crore. We have increased it to nearly Rs. 2.12 lakh crore for these five years between 2014 to 2019. It means that we have nearly doubled the budget allocation for agriculture. It clearly reflects the commitment of our government for the welfare of farmers. 

Today, there is not only record production of food-grains but also of fruits, vegetables and milk. Our farmer brothers have broken all the record of the last 70 years and they have made a new record. There has been an unprecedented progress of agriculture sector in the last four years. Food grain production in the year 2017-18 was at around 280 million tons while the average production during the previous government’s tenure between 2010-14 was around 250 million tones. Similarly, an increase of 10.5% in the average production of pulses and an increase of 15% in the average production of horticulture have been registered. 

An increase of 26% has been registered in the production of fishes under the blue revolution while an increase of nearly 24% has been registered in milk production and animal husbandry. It is our endevour that farmers should get help in every stage of farming, it means before sowing, after sowing and even after harvesting the crop. If we say this thing in a simple manner then the decisions are taken and schemes are formulated in a manner that how the government can be of any help to farmers, how can it ensure justice to them in the entire process of farming – right from growing the crop to its sale in the market – it means from seed to market. 

We have been moving in the direction of maintaining an entire system for the welfare of farmers.  We have started soil health card so that a farmer can come to know which crop should be sown. Once it has been determined that which crop is to be sown then farmers should get good quality seeds, an arrangement for farmer’s loan has been made and the ambit of Kisan Credit Card was expanded so that they don’t have to face the problem of capital. 

Earlier there used to be long queues for getting urea. However, now farmers are easily getting urea and other fertilisers as well; they don’t have to buy it from black market. Today, there is 100% Neem coated urea is available to the farmers of the country. 

After sowing comes the irrigation. Today, nearly 100 irrigation schemes are being completed under the Prime Minister Agriculture Irrigation Scheme.  We have been moving forward so that every field can get water. Farmers should not face any kind of risk for their crops that is why today there is a crop insurance scheme. An online platform E-Nam has been started so that farmers can get appropriate price for his produce when his produce are supplied in the market. And the most important thing is that now middlemen can’t take a cut, can’t misappropriate farmer’s profit. Let’s see what benefits our farmer brothers and sisters have got from these schemes, what kind of changes have been brought into their lives. If we will hear it directly from them, if we will hear their own experience then, perhaps, the other farmers of the country will also get one more opportunity to say like: yes, if a farmer of that region can do it so can I. 

My dear brothers and sisters, today, those people who have been watching this entire conversation, they would be thoroughly proud of our farmers, of their hard work and on the progress made by them and also on the new experiments conducted by them. I believe that when the villages of the country, when the farmers of the country will progress only then the country will progress. When our farmers will become strong only then our country will become strong too. 

My farmer brothers and sisters, 

I have been regularly talking to the different people of our country by using this technology. Even today, lakhs of people, lakhs of farmers have joined me in this conversation. The dialogue with you people is not only being heard by me, it is also being heard by the entire country and by every farmer of the country and they are learning from you people. The government officials are also listening to you, they are making notes of your issues and they will also discuss the experiments conducted by you. And they will try to further implement them. And my this programme will continue further because this programme has become an university for me which teaches me something or something else every week. It teaches me through the citizens of the country. It provides me the opportunity to meet the people located in the far-flung areas of the country, it gives me an opportunity for dialogue. With the help of technology, I have been learning and understanding a lot of things from you people. I get direct information from you people about what is happening in different parts of the country. 

So, I am going to meet again on the next Wednesday. Next Wednesday i.e. on the 27th June. And on 27th June, I will talk to our poor people, to our low-middle income people and middle class people, to our farmer brothers and sisters, to our artisan brothers and sisters and I will talk to them about our insurance schemes for their social security. I will talk to them about those schemes; about the benefits from them, from our social security insurance schemes because we have worked on them in a very comprehensive manner. And I believe that all of you, my farmer brothers and sisters, would have certainly adopted these schemes. You people would have taken advantage of Suraksha Bima Scheme. I am happy that today I got the opportunity to have an audience with the farmers of our country; I got the opportunity to receive their blessings and hear their stories of their hard work. Today, their hard work and their dedication have been taking the country to newer heights. 

Once again I bow down to all my farmer brothers and sisters. You people have taken time out for me and told me about a lot of things. I am extremely grateful to you people. 

Thank you.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will lead the 4th International Yoga Day Celebrations in Dehradun on June 21, 2018.

The Prime Minister will join thousands of volunteers, performing Yoga asanas in the lawns of Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, located in the lap of the Himalayas.

A series of Yoga related events are being organized across the world to mark the occasion.

The Prime Minister had earlier participated in Yoga celebrations at Rajpath in New Delhi in 2015, the Capitol Complex in Chandigarh in 2016, and the Ramabai Ambedkar Sabha Sthal in Lucknow in 2017. 

Greeting Yoga enthusiasts across the world on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that Yoga is one of the most precious gifts given by the ancient Indian sages to humankind.

“Yoga is not just a set of exercises that keeps the body fit. It is a passport to health assurance, a key to fitness and wellness. Nor is Yoga only what you practice in the morning. Doing your day-to-day activities with diligence and complete awareness is a form of Yoga as well,” the Prime Minister said.

“In a world of excess, Yoga promises restraint and balance. In a world suffering from mental stress, Yoga promises calm. In a distracted world, Yoga helps focus. In a world of fear, Yoga promises hope, strength and courage,” the Prime Minister added. 

In the run-up to International Yoga Day, the Prime Minister has also taken to social media to share the intricacies of various Yoga Asanas. He has also shared pictures of people performing Yoga, at various locations across the world.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today delivered closing remarks at the fourth meeting of the Governing Council of  NITI  Aayog. 

Welcoming the constructive discussion and suggestions made by various Chief Ministers, the Prime Minister assured the gathering that these suggestions would be seriously considered in the course of decision-making. He asked NITI Aayog to follow up with the States on the actionable points made by them within three months.  

He said that on the lines of the 115 aspirational districts identified by NITI Aayog, States can define their own parameters to identify 20 percent of the total blocks in the State as aspirational blocks. 

Speaking on the issue of environment, raised by Chief Ministers, the Prime Minister urged all States to use LED bulbs in their government buildings, official residences and streetlights. He suggested that this could be implemented within a definite timeframe.

He appreciated several other suggestions made by various Chief Ministers, on matters such as water conservation, agriculture, MNREGA etc. 

He called upon Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Sikkim, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, to work together to make recommendations on a coordinated policy approach to the two subjects of ""agriculture and MNREGA,"" including both pre-sowing, and post-harvest phases.  

The Prime Minister said that it is vital to identify the ""last people in the line"" so that benefits of governance can reach him. Similarly, he said, social justice is an important governance objective. He said that these noble causes require close coordination and constant monitoring. 

He reiterated the Union Government's commitment to provide universal coverage of seven key schemes to 45,000 additional villages in 115 Aspirational Districts, by August 15th, 2018. 

Elaborating on the Union Government's guiding principle of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, the Prime Minister said the schemes of the Union Government are no longer limited to certain people, or to certain regions, and are reaching everyone without discrimination, in a balanced way. 

The Prime Minister said that all villages of the country are now electrified, and under Saubhagya Yojana, 4 crore houses are now being provided with electricity connections. He said rural sanitation coverage has increased from less than 40 percent to about 85 percent in four years. He said that after the implementation of the Jan Dhan Yojana, the entire population of the country will be connected to the banking system. Similarly, he said the Ujjwala Yojana is providing access to cooking gas, and Mission Indradhanush is working towards universal immunization. He said the Union Government is working towards providing housing for all by 2022. 

He called upon all Chief Ministers to contribute their efforts towards this objective of 100 percent implementation of schemes for the welfare of the poor. 

The Prime Minister said that the implementation of these welfare schemes is also bringing about a behavioural change in lives of people. In this context, he mentioned neem coating of urea, Ujjwala Yojana, Jan Dhan Accounts, and RuPay debit cards. He explained how these schemes are improving the lives of the people. 

The Prime Minister said that Swachh Bharat Mission is being discussed around the world. In the last four years, 7.70 crore toilets have been constructed. He called upon all present, to work towards 100 percent sanitation coverage by October 2, 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of  Mahatma Gandhi. 

The Prime Minister called for efforts towards water conservation and water management on a war footing. 

Speaking on the economy, the Prime Minister said that the world expects India to become a five trillion dollar economy soon. He encouraged States to give fresh ideas to the Finance Commission, for incentivizing outcome-based allocations, and expenditure correction.

He expressed happiness that States are now organising investor summits. He suggested that States should focus on exports. He encouraged States to boost ""Ease of Doing Business."" He said NITI Aayog should call a meeting with all States to provide a further impetus to ease of doing business. He said ""ease of living"" for the common man is also the need of the hour, and States should now take initiatives in this regard. 

On agriculture, the Prime Minister said that corporate investment in this sector is very low in India. He said States should formulate policies that promote corporate investment in areas such as warehousing, transportation, value addition and food processing etc. 

The Prime Minister said that mining blocks which have been successfully auctioned, should start production at the earliest. He urged States to take steps in this regard. He said District Mineral Foundations will help the poor and the tribals in a big way. 

The Prime Minister called for widespread debate and consultations on simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas, keeping in view various aspects such as the resulting financial savings and consequent better utilisation of resources. 

In conclusion, the Prime Minister thanked the Chief Ministers once again for their suggestions.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today delivered the opening remarks at the fourth meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog, in Rashtrapati Bhawan Cultural Centre in New Delhi. 

Welcoming the Chief Ministers and other delegates, the Prime Minister reiterated that the Governing Council is a platform that can bring about ""historic change."" He assured the Chief Ministers from flood-affected States that the Union Government would provide all assistance to them, to deal with the flood situation currently affecting parts of the country.

He said that the Governing Council has approached complex issues of governance as ""Team India"", in the spirit of cooperative, competitive federalism. He described the smooth rollout and implementation of GST as a prime example of this. 

The Prime Minister said that Chief Ministers of States had played a key role in policy formulation, through sub-groups and committees on issues such as Swachh Bharat Mission, Digital Transactions, and Skill Development. The recommendations of these sub-groups have been incorporated by various Ministries of the Union Government, he added. 

The Prime Minister said that the Indian Economy has grown at a healthy rate of 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017-18. He added that the challenge now is to take this growth rate to double digits, for which many more important steps have to be taken. He said that the vision of a New India by 2022, is now a resolve of the people of our country. In this context, he mentioned the issues on the agenda today, including doubling of farmers income, development of aspirational districts, Ayushman Bharat, Mission Indradhanush, Nutrition Mission and celebrations of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. 

The Prime Minister said that 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres are being constructed under Ayushman Bharat. He said about 10 crore families will be provided health assurance worth Rs. 5 lakhs every year. He said a comprehensive approach is being adopted for education, under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.  

The Prime Minister said that schemes such as Mudra Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana and Stand Up India, are helping in greater financial inclusion. He emphasized the need for tackling economic imbalances on priority. 

He said that all aspects and parameters of human development need to be addressed and improved upon in the 115 aspirational districts. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan has emerged as a new model for implementation of schemes. He said that this has so far been extended to 45,000 villages in the Aspirational Districts. He said that the target is universal coverage in seven important welfare schemes: Ujjwala, Saubhagya, Ujala, Jan Dhan, Jeevan Jyoti Yojana, Suraksha Bima Yojana, and Mission Indradhanush. He said this target was recently accomplished in about 17,000 villages. 

The Prime Minister said that India has no shortage of capabilities, capacities and resources. He said that in the current financial year, States are receiving over 11 lakh crore rupees from the Centre, which represents an increase of about 6 lakh crore rupees, from the last year of the previous government. 

The Prime Minister said that this gathering today represents the hopes and aspirations of the people of India. He said it is also the responsibility of this gathering to make all efforts to fulfil them. 

Earlier, the Chief  Ministers and other delegates were welcomed to the meeting by Vice Chairman of the NITI Aayog, Shri Rajiv Kumar. The discussions are being moderated by Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh.

                Over the last few days, I have got the opportunity to interact with various beneficiaries of the different government schemes and to hear them out. This has been a wonderful experience for me. I believe that there is a life beyond files. My soul was satisfied immensely after I heard the changes and the experiences that swept the lives of the beneficiaries of these schemes. You have instilled in me a new energy to carry on my work. Today I have got the opportunity to interact with some of the beneficiaries of Digital India.

I have been told that I will be able to interact with about 3 lakh poor people of our country through the Common Service Centres in today's programme. The VLEs operating these CSCs or Common Service Centres and the citizens who are enjoying their services are all present here. Besides, the beneficiaries of Digital India via NIC have also gathered there. More than 1600 Institutions and their students, researchers, scientists and professors who are associated with NKN i.e. National Knowledge Network are also present. The BPO employees from the BPOs across the country that have been set up by government schemes are also with us. Moreover, workers of mobile manufacturing units will also interact with us and show their units.

Lakhs of MyGov volunteers across the country have also joined us. I believe it will be a unique conversation where more than 50 lakh people will be talking on a single topic. This will be a single wonderful occasion to hear out the people's experiences and interact with them. 

The only aim while launching the Digital India was to empower and connect the country's common man, poor, farmers, youth and the villages with the digital world. In the last four years, we have focused upon this single objective and have worked on every aspect of Digital empowerment ranging from connecting villages with Optical Fibre network, making crores of people digitally literate, taking government services to the doorstep of the people through mobile phones, developing electronic manufacturing in the country, encouraging start-up or innovation to campaigning for opening BPOs in remote areas. There are several initiatives like these. Today, the senior citizens do not have to travel long distances to show their life certificates for obtaining pension. They can easily go to these Common Service Centres of their villages and get their work done. The farmers can not only obtain the required information regarding weather conditions, crops, soil etc. but also sell their produce across the country with the help of a digital market i.e. eNAM with the help of their mobile phones or Common Service Centres (CSCs).

 

Today, the students in the villages are not confined to the books available in their schools or colleges. They now have access to lakhs of online books through digital library. They are no longer dependent on school's planning systems for their scholarships. Scholarships are directly deposited in their bank accounts. Everything was made possible only due to technology and Communication Revolution. Till a few years ago, it was impossible for the people residing in small towns and villages to imagine that railway tickets could be booked without queuing up in the stations for hours or LPG could be obtained without wasting hours in sinuous queues or the electricity bills, water bills and taxes could be paid without being physically present in the government offices. However, today all these things are possible and are just a click away. It's available to everyone and not just to a section of people. The Common Service Centres (CSCs) across the country are being strengthened to ensure that every citizen can avail maximum services close to their houses.

 

Till date about 3 lakh Common Service Centres have been opened across the country. This huge network of Digital Service Delivery Centres is spread across 1 lakh 83 thousand Gram Panchayats. Today lakhs of youngsters are working as Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) and it is heartening to note that out of them 52 thousand entrepreneurs are women.

These centres have provided jobs to more than 10 lakh people. As a whole, the centre is not only a source of empowerment but has also encouraged education, entrepreneurship and employment.

 

Today about 60 lakh volunteers are connected to the MyGov platform. In a way, it has become a citizen-centric government. Apart from providing suggestions and ideas, the youth is participating in volunteering activities at a large scale.

MyGov has emerged as a powerful platform to deliver the different suggestions of the citizens to the various Ministries, working on their possible implementation and connecting with the youth. I would definitely like to put before you the examples of various voluntary contributions made by the people. In every year's budget, the central government compiles the suggestions obtained by the volunteers. The logos and taglines of different schemes like Swachh Bharat Mission, Jan Dhan Yojana and Digital India were chosen from the suggestions given by the citizens through MyGov. The government didn't have to devote time for this. The government has formed this platform of public participation by moving a step ahead from crowd sourcing.

People from every corner of the country also send me their suggestions and inspiring stories every month for the programme 'Mann ki Baat' through this platform of MyGov. Today, the Digital India is changing the lives of crores of people. Digital India is fulfilling the 4Es - Education, Employment, Entrepreneurship and Empowerment. I hope that Digital India will improve the life of the common man. With this expectation I would like to thank you all. However, I have one request to you all. I have high expectations from the staff of Common Service Centres. They are listening to me. I can see them on the screen. Would the employees of Common Service Centres raise their hands? Will you do me a favour? Kindly raise your hands and tell me will you do me a favour? It doesn't mean that I am not asking the BPO employees to do the same.

Let me tell you. I want you all to note the date 20th June and at the same time i.e. 9.30 am, l will be interacting with the farmers. I will be conversing with my farmer brothers and sisters. Can you help me out? Just like 10-20 people are present in the Common Service Centres, can you bring 50-100 farmers to your Common Service Centres on the 20th? I would like to talk to them. Kindly raise your hands whoever is ready to do this task. We will talk to the farmers and the discussion will be related to their topics.

This will make your CSC very strong. The country's Prime Minister will be able to directly share his thoughts with the village through these 3 lakh CSCs. For example, I can say I want to talk to the people before immunization. This is will highly boost the immunization campaign. This method is several times stronger than informing the people through televisions. I would like you all to get 50-100 farmer brothers and sisters to your CSCs on the 20th at 9.30 am. I will talk to them regarding the transformation in the agricultural sector and how even a villager can avail the benefits of those schemes. I would also like to hear their experiences.

Friends,

It was a pleasant experience for me. The transformation that is sweeping the country is because of you and your finger tips.

The government is committed to the development and progress through Reform, Perform and Transform. Once again my best wishes to you all and thank you very much. Namaste!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the beneficiaries of various Digital India Mission schemes from across the country, through video bridge. The video bridge connected over 50 lakh beneficiaries, including those from Common Service Centres, NIC centres, National Knowledge Network, BPOs, Mobile Manufacturing Units and MyGov volunteers. This is the sixth interaction in the series by the Prime Minister through video bridge with various beneficiaries of Government schemes. 

Interacting with the beneficiaries, Prime Minister said that Digital India was launched to ensure that people from all walks of life, especially those from rural areas, are digitally empowered. He added that to make this possible, Government has worked on a holistic policy consisting of connecting villages through fibre optic, digitally educating citizens, providing service delivery through mobiles and promoting electronic manufacturing. 

Talking about technology, Prime Minister said that technology has brought about ease of living and Government’s efforts are to ensure that the advantages of technology was available to all sections of the society. Various provisions like online payment of bills including BHIM APP, online booking of railway tickets, and electronic delivery of scholarships and pensions to bank accounts have greatly reduced the burden on common people, Shri Narendra Modi added. 

Describing the importance of Common Service Centers (CSC), Prime Minister said that CSC’s across India are providing digital services to rural India. CSCs have successfully developed Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLE) in rural areas and created job opportunities for more than 10 Lakh people. There are 2.92 Lakh CSCs in rural India providing opportunities to access various government and other services across 2.15 Lakh Gram Panchayats 

During the interaction, Shri Narendra Modi said that the movement towards more digital payments is resulting in the elimination of intermediaries. Digital payments in India has grown significantly in last four years, making Indian economy digital and transparent. 

Talking about Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA), PM said that the scheme has already provided digital skill and training to 1.25 crore people, out of which 70% of candidates are from SC, ST and OBC communities. The scheme aims to provide digital skills and basic computer training to six crore people through 20 hours of basic computer training. 

Digital India has also transformed the BPO sector immensely. Earlier BPOs were only restricted to big cities, now it is spread to small towns and villages, creating employment opportunities.  The India BPO promotion scheme and the separate BPO promotion scheme for the Northeast, started under Digital India will create new employment opportunities to over two lakh people in North East and in rural areas. Now the youth of nation is getting jobs near their homes due to BPOs units opening all through out India, Prime Minister said. 

Interacting with the employees of various Electronic Manufacturing Units, Prime Minister said that India has gone a long way in Electronics Hardware Manufacturing in the last 4 years. To promote electronic manufacturing in India, Government has started the Electronic Manufacturing Cluster (EMC) scheme, through which 23 EMCs are being opened in 15 states. The scheme is expected to provide employment to close to six lakh people. Prime minister also noted that India has 120 mobile phone manufacturing factories now compared to just two such units in 2014.These units have created directed and indirect employment to more than 4.5 lakh citizens. 

Prime Minister also talked about the importance of National Knowledge Network (NKN) in building a strong Digital India. NKN inter connects about 1700 major Research and Educational Institutes in India, thereby providing a powerful platform to close to five crore students, researchers, academicians and government officers.

There are more than 60 lakh volunteers associated with the platform, giving ideas, suggestions and doing various volunteer activities, playing a huge role in building of a New India, Shri Modi said. Prime Minister also added that through Digital India, ‘4E’s- Education, Employment, Entrepreneurship and Empowerment are being achieved.

                Victory to Mother India!

Bhilai Steel Plant is a precious gem of Kora of Chhattisgarh Mahtari,  the symbol of its prowess. The well knownand popular Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh and my old colleague Dr.Raman Singh ji, my colleague from the Council of Ministers at the centre Chaudhary Birender Singhji, Minister Mr. Manoj Sinha ji, the son of this soil and my colleague at the centreMr.Vishnu Dev Sahayji, the speaker of the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly Mr.Gauri Shankar Agarwalji, the ministers of the state government and my dear brothers and sisters of Chhattisgarh,

I once again got the opportunity to seekyour blessings. Like today that was also the 14th of the month. Exactly two months ago, on the 14th April, I had launched the first phase of Ayushman Bharat Mission from this soil. 

In the history of Chhattisgarh, another golden chapter is being added today to firm up its future.  Sometime back, work of expansion and modernisation of Bhilaithe steel plant ,the second airport at Jagdalpur, the launch of new command centre at Raipur and so many other development projects were started. Besides, the development of IIT campus at Bhilai and phase 2 of the Bharat Net in the state were also launched.

I would like to dedicate these projects worth more than Rs.22 thousand crores to my dear brothers and sisters of Chhattisgarh today. All these projects will open up new opportunities for employment and education. It will link the remote areas of Chhattisgarh with modern communication technology. Earlier for several years, Bastar was associated with guns, pistols and violence. Today Bastar is known for the airport of Jagdalpur.

Friends,

It is a pleasant and an inspiring experience for us to see the rapid progress of a region that was developed by the vision of Atal Bihari Bajpayeeji and the untiring efforts of the people of Chhattisgarh.

My friend, the Chief Minister Raman Singh jihas carried forward the vision of Atal ji. We often meet or talk over phone. Every time he comes up with a new idea or a scheme with a new hope and enthusiasm. He sounds confident of implementing them successfully. 

Friends,

We are well aware of the fact that law, peace and basic necessities of life remain the priority for development. Raman Singh ji, on the one hand stressed upon peace, stability and law and order and on the other , he kept pushing Chhattisgarh forward to scale new heights of development with new ideas and schemes. I congratulate Raman Singh ji and my brothers and sisters of Chhattisgarh for this journey of development.

Brothers and sisters,

This region is not new to me. I used to visit this place on a two-wheeler at a time when Chhattisgarh was not carved out of Madhya Pradesh. I used to come here for organisational work. About 50 of us used to meet. We used to discuss national and societal issues of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and others. From that timeI have a close connection with Chhattisgarh. You have showered so much love upon me. I have always been associated with you. There has not been a single year in the past 20-25 years when I didn't visit Chhattisgarh. There's hardly any district left that I might not have visited. I have got a lot of love from the people here.

Brothers and sisters,

I had been to the Bhilai Steel Plant before coming here. It has been equipped with modern technology and new capacity has been added to itat a cost of more than 18 thousand crore rupees. Fortunately, I got the opportunity to inaugurate this modified modern plant today. Very few people would be aware of the fact that since independence all the tracks that were laid from Kutch to Cuttack and from Kargil to Kanyakumari were the result of hard work of the people mostly from this land. Surely, Bhilai has not only made steel but has also improved the standard of living of the people. The modernised steel plant of Bhilai will strengthen the foundation of New India just like steel. You are well aware that the faces of Bhilai and Durggot a complete face liftbecause of the steel plants. I believe that the steel plant set up at Bastar will also change the lives of the people of that region.

Brothers and sisters,

Mining of iron ore has played a significant role in speeding up the process of development in Chhattisgarh. You, especially my tribal brothers and sisters have the right over it. Therefore, after getting elected we have brought about a key change in the law. We have also decided that a part of the income from the mining will be spent for the development of local people. We have already drafted this law. Therefore, District Mineral Foundation has been set up in every mining district. Subsequently, Chhattisgarh also gained more than Rs. 3000 crore. This amount is now being utilized for setting up hospitals, schools, roads and toilets.

Brothers and sisters,

Skill development is as important as Make in India for development. Bhilai is identified as the country's one of the greatest educational hubs for decades. Despite all these facilities, a need was felt for setting up an IIT. Your Chief Minister Raman Singh had been trying hard to get an IIT established at Bhilai even during the previous government's tenure. However, you know very well about the people who were running the government at that time.  After our party came to power it was immediately decided to set up 5 new IITs. Today the IIT campus at Bhilai that was set up with an expenditure of several crore rupees, is being inaugurated. This campus that was built at a cost of about Rs.1100 crores will prove to be a focal point of technology and technical education for the meritorious students of Chhattisgarh and other parts of the country and it will always inspire them to do something new.

Friends,

A few minutes ago, I had got the opportunity to hand over laptops to some youngsters on this stage. I am glad that the Bharatiya Janata Party government is continuously emphasizing upon computer and technology education through SuchnaKrantiYojana. The more we can link the people with technology, the more we can deliver its benefits to them. For the last four years, Digital India is being carried forward with this very vision. The Chhattisgarh government is also engaged in pushing this mission forward and carrying it to every household.

Friends,

The last time when I came here on the birth anniversary of BabasahebAmbedkar, I got the opportunity to launch the Phase 1 of the internet connection program i.e. Bastar Net. Today the work for Bharat Net Phase 2 has also been started. Efforts will be made to complete this project worth about Rs.2500 crores  by March next year. About 4000 Panchayats in Chhattisgarh have already been linked to internet. The rest 6000 Panchayats will also be linked by next year. 

Friends,

A new foundation for the empowerment of the poor, tribal, oppressed and deprived communities is being laid through Initiatives like Digital India Mission, Bharat Net project, the state government's Sanchar KrantiYojana, distribution of more than 50 lakh smart phones and erection of more than 1200 mobile towers. Digital connectivity is not only linking places but also connecting people.

Brothers and sisters,

Today, a lot of effort is being made to connect the country with water, land and so on. As a result, while the previous governments were hesitant even in construction of roads in certain areas, we have built Airport along with roads. As I already told you that my vision is to ensure that the common man travels by air. Thus, we have started with the UDAN scheme and new airports have been built across the country. A similar airport is being established in your Jagdalpur. Flights have already been started from Jagdalpur to Raipur. Now the distance between Jagdalpur and Raipur can be covered in just 40 minutes rather than 6-7 hours.

Friends,

Today, people prefer to travel more by air than by the AC coaches in  trains due the policies of the government. There was a time when only 6 flights used to land in Raipur in one day. Now, about 50 flights land in Raipur airport per day. These new routes will not only reduce the distance from the capital but also promote tourism, trade and business and employment opportunities.

Friends,

Today Chhattisgarh has achieved a new milestone. New Raipur city has become the country's first greenfield smart city. I have got the opportunity to inaugurate the Integrated Command and Control Centre in this episode. Now water, electricity, street lights, sewage and transport of the entire city will be monitored from this centre. These are being operated on the basis of modern technology and data. New Raipur will now serve as an example for other smart cities of the country.

Chhattisgarh that was earlier known for its backwardness and tribal communities and its forests, has got the new identity of a smart city.  This is a matter of great pride!

Friends,

Our every scheme is aimed at providing a respectful and secure life to the people of the country. This is one of the major reasons why record-breaking youngsters have joined the mainstream and are associated with the country's development in different parts of the country along with Chhattisgarh in the last four years.

I believe that there is just one answer to violence i.e. development, development and development. The trust generated among people by development can eradicate any kind of violence. Both the NDA led government at the centre and the BJP led government of Chhattisgarh have tried to create an environment of trust through development.

Brothers and sisters,

The last time I visited Chhattisgarh, Gram Swaraj Abhiyan was launched across the country. There has been a positive impact of this mission in the last two months. This mission is particularly meant for the 115 Aspirational districts that are lagging behind in terms of development since independence. It also includes 12 districts of Chhattisgarh. The work is being carried out with a new energy keeping in mind the different dimensions of development. It is being ensured that in villages everyone should have bank accounts, gas connection, electricity connection, LED bulbs and everyone should be vaccinated and insured.

Gram Swaraj Abhiyan has become the greatest medium of public participation. This campaign will also set up a new dimension in the development of Chhattisgarh. You cannot even imagine how the poor and the tribal communities are empowered in such an environment of trust and belief.

In Chhattisgarh, under Jan DhanYojana, bank accounts of more than one  crore 30 lakh poor people have been opened.  This is the figure just of Chhattisgarh and not of the whole country. A new saga of development has been writtenon the land of Chhattisgarh due to the construction of more than 37 lakh toilets, providing free gas connections to more than 22 lakh poor families, giving loans without guarantee to more than 26 lakh people under Mudra yojana, insurance to more than 60 lakh people at a premium of 90 paise per day and 1 rupee per month as well as by providing the benefit of Pradhan MantriFasalBimaYojana to more than 13 lakh farmers.

Brothers and Sisters,

There were 7 lakh households in Chhattisgarh that were deprived of electricity connection. Under the Pradhan MantriSaubhagyaYojana, almost half the households of Chhattisgarh i.e. about 3.5 lakh households were provided with electricity connection within a year. Almost 1100 such villages that were hitherto not electrified since independence have now been electrified. This light is brightening up development and trust in every household.

Friends,

Our government is also working towards providing a house to every homeless person. In the last four years, more than one crore 15 lakh houses were built in both rural and urban areas. Under Pradhan MantriAwasYojana, the incomplete houses built by the previous governments are also being completed. In Chhattisgarh, about 6 lakh houses have already been constructed. I want to make an announcement particularly for the middle class of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and other parts of the country as we have made an important decision that is going to benefit the middle class. Earlier, interest rates were relaxed for the houses being constructed for the middle class but the area used to be small. There was a demand for increasing the area. 

Brothers and sisters,

I am proud to announce that the demand of the public has been met. This means that now interest rates will also be relaxed on houses with larger area. This decision of the government is immensely going to benefit the middle class. Today I have got the opportunity to hand over certificates and cheques to the beneficiaries of the central government and state government schemes like Pradhan MantriMatruVandanaYojana, UjjwalaYojana, Mudra yojana, stand-up India scheme and insurance schemes. My best wishes to these beneficiaries and I pray for their future well-being.

Friends,

These are not merely schemes but a resolution to brighten up the present and the future of the poor, the tribals and the deprived section of the society. Our government is specially focussing upon increasing the income of the people residing in the tribal and backward areas.About  two months back I had launched the Van DhanYojana from Bijapur. Van DhanVikaskendras are being opened up for this. It is being ensured that the forest products should get the right price in the market.

The government has also announced in this year's budget that 22 thousand rural markets will be developed. In the initial phase, 5000 markets or haats are being developed. The government is making efforts so that my tribal brothers and farmers can have facilities within 5-6km that will enable them to connect with any of the country's market through technology.

Besides, keeping in mind the welfare of the tribal people, the forest rights act  have been enforced in a more stringent manner. In the last four years, about  one lakh tribal people and tribal groups have been given land titles of more than 20 lakh acres.

The government has amended a law related to Bamboo. You can now easily sell the bamboo grown on your agricultural fields. This law has provided a new avenue for the forest dwellers of increasing their incomes.

Brothers and sisters,

The government is also working keeping in mind the tribal community's education and self-respect. Ekalavya Model Residential schools are being set up across the country to elevate the level of education in tribal children.

Ekalavya Model Residential schools will be set up in every block where the population of tribal brothers and sisters is either greater than 50% of the total population or at least 20 thousand people of this class are residing.

Besides, a new campaign has been started to make the people aware of the contribution made by the tribal people in the country's independence since 1857. Museums are being set up in different states in the memory of the great tribal freedom fighters.

These schemes that will enhance the economic and social infrastructure of Chhattisgarh will also bring uniformity in economic and social development from Bastar to Sarguja and from Raigarh to Rajnand village. The campaign to end regional uneven in the state will also be completed at a fast pace.

Today while I was going to the Bhilai plant, the way I was welcomed and honoured by the people of Chhattisgarh  I became speechless. It looked like the entire country had gathered on the streets of Chhattisgarh. There wouldn't have been any corner of the country that was not showering its blessings on me.It was like a mini India. I am really grateful to the people who have settled here in Bhilai and Durg from across the country for reflecting the country's unity before me and for showering their blessings according to their state's traditions.Whenever I come to Chhattisgarh, some new constructive work is being done. Every time Chhattisgarh sets a new target for itself. Therefore, development takes place at a rapid pace.

Brothers and sisters,

I believe that New Chhattisgarh will pave way for New India in 2022. I believe that with your blessings, the resolution for a New India will definitely be fulfilled. With this hope and expectation, I congratulate you and the Chhattisgarh government. I end my speech here.

Thanks a lot!

Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s departure statement prior to his visit to Qingdao in China.

“I will be visiting Qingdao in China for the annual meeting of the Council of Heads of States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).

I am excited to lead the Indian delegation for our first-ever meeting of the Council as a full member. The SCO has a rich agenda for cooperation, ranging from fighting terrorism, separatism and extremism to promoting cooperation in connectivity, commerce, customs, law, health and agriculture; protecting the environment and mitigating disaster risk; and fostering people-to-people relations. In the last one year since India became a full member of the SCO, our interaction with the Organization and its member States has grown considerably in these areas. I believe that the Qingdao Summit will further enrich the SCO agenda, while heralding a new beginning for India’s engagement with the SCO.

India enjoys deep friendship and multi-dimensional ties with the Member States of the SCO. On the sidelines of the SCO Summit, I will have the opportunity of meeting and sharing views with several other leaders, including the Heads of States of many SCO Member States.”

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojna and other Central Government health care schemes from across the country, through video bridge. This is the fifth interaction in the series by the Prime Minister through video bridge with various beneficiaries of Government schemes.

Explaining the importance of healthcare and wellness, Prime Minister said that health is the basis for all success and prosperity. He added that that India would become great and healthy only when its 125 crore citizens are healthy. 

Interacting with the beneficiaries, Shri Modi said that illness not only creates a huge financial burden on families, especially poor and middle class, but also affects our socio economic sectors.  Hence, it is the endeavour of the government to ensure affordable healthcare to every citizen. Prime Minister added that Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojna was launched with this intention so that poor, lower middle class and middle class get access to affordable medicines and their financial burden is reduced.

Government has opened more than 3600 Jan Aushadhi Kendras all over the country, where more than 700 generic medicines are available at affordable price. The cost of medicines at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are 50-90% less than the market price, Prime Minister said and added that the number of Jan Aushadhi Kendras will reach over 5000 in the near future.

Talking about health stents, Prime Minister Shri Modi said that earlier citizens had to sell or mortgage property to purchase health stents. He added that, the government has reduced the prices of stents substantially to help poor and middle class. The cost of heart stents have reduced from around Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 29000.

During the interaction, Shri Narendra Modi said that the Government has reduced knee transplant prices by 60 - 70%, thereby bringing down the cost from Rs. 2.5 lakh to around Rs.70, 000 – 80,000. It is estimated that around 1 to 1.5 lakh knee operations happen in India every year. On that account, the reduction in knee transplant prices has saved close to Rs.1500 crore for public.

Through Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Dialysis Program, Government has performed more than 22 lakh dialysis sessions for 2.25 lakh patients in more than 500 districts. More than 3.15crore children and 80 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinatedin 528 districts through Mission Indradhanush. In order to ensure more beds, more hospitals and more doctors, Government has opened 92 medical colleges and increased MBBS seats by 15000.

Prime Minister said that to make healthcare affordable and accessible, Government launched the Ayushman Bharat scheme. Under Ayushman Bharat, 10 crore families will be covered with health insurance of Rs. 5 lakh. Talking about ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’, Prime Minister said that the scheme is playing a central role in creating a healthy India. Due to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, there are now 3.5 lakh open defecation free villages in India and the sanitation coverage has increased by 38%.

Interacting with the Prime Minister, beneficiaries explained how Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojna brought down the cost of the medicines and made it affordable. Beneficiaries also talked about how reduced prices of heart stent and knee transplants have changed their life. 

Prime Minister also appealed to the public to take up Yoga, make it part of life style and thereby help in building a healthy nation.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with young innovators and Start-Up entrepreneurs from across the country, through video bridge. This is the fourth interaction by the Prime Minister through video bridge series with various beneficiaries of Government schemes.

 

Delighted at India’s youngsters becoming job creators, Prime Minister said that the Government is committed towards harnessing the demographic dividend. The Prime Minister further said that adequate capital, courage and connecting with people are required for excelling in the start- up sector.

Prime Minister said that things have changed from the time where start-ups meant only digital and technology innovation.  He said that now there are start-up entrepreneurs in many fields. Start-Ups are filed in 28 States, 6 Union Territories and 419 districts. Out of these, 44% of start-ups registered are from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities as Start-Up India is focussing on encouraging local innovations from their areas. In addition, 45% of the start-up are set up by women. 

Shri Narendra Modi also explained how filing patents and trademarks have become easy under the government. Government has brought down the number of forms needed to apply for trademark from seventy-four to eight, resulting in three-fold increase in Trade Marks registration in three years. Number of patents registered has also seen a three-fold increase compared to the previous government.

During the interaction with young entrepreneurs, Prime Minister said that the government has created Rs.10000 Crore ‘Fund of Funds’ to ensure that young entrepreneurs may not face shortage of funds for their start-ups and to facilitate youngsters to innovate.  Through the ‘Fund of Funds’, Rs.1285 Crore funding has been committed, leveraging a total of Rs.6980 Crore in venture funds so far.

 

Explaining the steps taken by the government to make India’s start-up ecosystem robust, Prime Minister said that the Government-e– Market Place (GEM) has been linked to Start-Up India portal so that start-ups can sell their products to government. Start-Ups have been given income tax exemption for three years. Six labour laws and three environmental laws have been changed so that young entrepreneurs need to provide only self-certification. Government has also started a one-stop digital platform called Start-Up India Hub where all information regarding start-ups and its ecosystem is available for entrepreneurs.

Interacting with the participants, Narendra Modi said that in order to foster innovation and competition amongst youngsters, Government has started various competitions like Atal New India Challenge, Smart India Hackathon and Agriculture Grand Challenge. Prime Minister also mentioned his discussion with Prime Minister of Singapore, on holding a Smart India Hackathon like challenge between innovators from Singapore and India. 

Prime Minister also reiterated the Governments’ commitment in encouraging innovation in India. Eight Research Parks and 2500 Atal Tinkering Labs are being established all over the country to encourage youngsters to take up research and innovation.

Addressing the innovators, Narendra Modi invited youngsters to ideate on how to transform agricultural sector. He said that ‘Design in India’ is essential along with ‘Make in India’. Prime Minister also encouraged youngsters to continue innovating and gave the mantra of ‘Innovate or Stagnate’.

Interacting with the Prime Minister, young innovators explained how the various government schemes under Start-Up India initiative have helped set up the new start-ups. Entrepreneurs and innovators also explained their innovations to Prime Minister ranging from agricultural innovations to Block chain technology. Schoolchildren from various Atal Tinkering Labs shared their innovations with the Prime Minister. Prime complemented the schoolchildren for their scientific skills and encouraged them to come up with more such inventions. 

 

Prime Minister gave a clarion call to nation to make ‘Innovate India’, a mass movement. He encouraged the citizens to share their ideas and innovations through the hashtag #InnovateIndia.

Ladies and Gentlemen.

On behalf of the one point three billion people of India, I am delighted to welcome you all to New Delhi. 

On the side-lines of this event, I hope the delegates joining us from abroad, shall have some time to see the history and splendour of Delhi.

We are proud to be the global host for World Environment Day, 2018.  

As we celebrate this important occasion today, we recall our ancient ethos of universal brotherhood.

This has been expressed in the famous Sanskrit phrase– VasudhaivaKutumbakam – the world is one family. 

The same ethos was reflected in the doctrine of trustee-ship, advocated by Mahatma Gandhi. He had said that ‘Earth provides enough to satisfy everyone’s need, but not enough for everyone’s greed.’

Our traditions have for long stressed the importance of living in harmony with nature. 

This is reflected in our reverence of the elements of nature. It is reflected in our festivals, and in our ancient texts. 

Ladies and Gentlemen.

India is the fastest growing economy in the world today. We are committed to raising the standards of living of our people. 

We are also committed to ensure, that we do so, in a way that is sustainable and green. 

In this direction, we have given forty million new cooking gas connections in the last two years. 

This has freed rural women from the misery of poisonous smoke. 

It has also eliminated their dependence on firewood. 

It is the same commitment, which has seen over three hundred million LED bulbs being installed across India. Besides saving electricity, this has also prevented huge additional amounts of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere.

We are engaged in a massive push towards renewable energy generation. We have targeted generation of one hundred and seventy-five GigaWatts of solar and wind energy by 2022. 

We are already the fifth largest producer of solar energy in the world. Not only this, we are also the sixth largest producer of renewable energy.

We aim to provide an electricity connection to every household, which will further reduce dependence on environmentally degrading forms of fuel. 

We are reducing dependence on fossil fuels. We are switching sources of fuel where possible. We are transforming cities and public transportation.

We are a young Nation. To generate employment, we are working towards making India a global manufacturing hub. 

We have launched the Make in India campaign. While doing so, we are laying stress on zero defect and zero effect manufacturing. This means manufacturing that is without defect, and which does not harm the environment.

As part of the Nationally Determined Contributions, India is committed to reducing thirty-three to thirty-five percent of emission intensity of its GDP during 2005 to 2030. We are on track to meet the 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution.

According to the UNEP Gap Report, India is also on track to meet its Copenhagen Pledge. We will reduce the emissions intensity of India's GDP by twenty to twenty-five percent over 2005 levels by 2020. 

We have a robust National Biodiversity Strategy. With only two point four percent of the world’s land area, India supports seven to eight percent of the recorded species diversity. At the same time, India supports nearly eighteen percent of human population. Our tree and forest cover has also increased by one percent in the last two years.  

We have also done well in the field of wildlife conservation. The population of tiger, elephant, lion rhino and other forms of wildlife is on the rise. 

We also recognize the need to tackle the issue of water availability, which is becoming a major challenge in India. We have launched the massive Namami Gange initiative. This programme, which has already started giving results, will soon revive the Ganga, our most precious river.

India is primarily an agrarian country. Continued availability of water for agriculture is of importance. The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana has been launched to ensure that no farm goes without water. Our motto is ‘More crop, per drop.’

We have also launched a massive campaign to ensure that our farmers convert agricultural waste to valuable nutrients instead of burning them.

Ladies and Gentlemen.

While much of the world focuses on Inconvenient Truth, we have moved on to Convenient Action. 

It was this call for Convenient Action that led India, along with France, to form the International Solar Alliance. This is perhaps, the single most important global development, towards the cause of environment, after the Paris Conference. 

About three months ago, leaders from over 45 nations, and Heads of International Organizations, gathered here in New Delhi, for the Founding Conference of the International Solar Alliance. 

Our experience shows that development can be environment friendly. It need not come at the cost of our green assets.   

Friends.

World Environment Day seeks to address a very significant challenge this year. 

Plastic now threatens to become a menace to humanity. A lot of it never makes it to the recycling bin. Worse, a lot of it is non-bio-degradable.

Plastic pollution is already having a deadly impact on our marine ecosystem. Scientists and fishermen alike have pointed to signs of trouble. These include declining fish catches, warming ocean temperatures, and vanishing habitats.

Marine litter especially micro-plastic, is a major trans-boundary problem. India is preparing to join the “Clean Seas Campaign” and make its contribution towards saving our oceans.

Plastic pollution is now entering into our food chain. In fact, micro plastics have now even entered basic food like salt, bottled water and tap water. 

Friends.

The per capita plastic consumption in India is much lower than in many parts of the developed world. 

Our national mission on cleanliness and sanitation - Swachh Bharat Abhiyan - has a special focus on “plastic waste management.”

A short while ago, I visited the Exhibition set up by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. It showcases some of our success stories. Among its participants are United Nations, Union and State Governments, industry, and non-government organizations. I hope they continue to do exemplary work in curbing plastic pollution. 

Ladies and Gentlemen.

Environmental degradation hurts the poor and vulnerable, the most.

It is the duty of each one of us, to ensure that the quest for material prosperity does not compromise our environment. 

As part of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the world had agreed to the theme of “Leave No One Behind.” This is not possible without ensuring that we all come together to protect what Mother Nature has given us.  

 

Friends.

This is the Indian way. And we are happy to share it again with the international community on the auspicious occasion of World Environment Day.          

 

In conclusion, as global host of World Environment Day 2018, I reiterate our commitment to sustainable development. 

Let us all join together to beat plastic pollution and make this planet a better place to live. 

The choices that we make today, will define our collective future. The choices may not be easy. But through awareness, technology, and a genuine global partnership, I am sure we can make the right choices. 

Thank you.

                My dear brothers and sisters, 

Greetings. (Namaskar)

It has always been my endeavor that whatever changes have been brought about in the lives of common man through different schemes then I try to understand them by directly talking to those people and that is why I often try to meet with such beneficiaries directly. Whether it was right or wrong, good or bad, whether they encountered problems or it was convenient for them, it’s very important to know about all these things directly from you people. 

The report that is prepared by officers in the government has its own importance. But having a direct dialogue with the beneficiaries and getting to know about new things from them like about Ujjwala Yojana -the gas connection scheme. I was talking a lot about Ujjwala scheme but when I met with the beneficiaries of Ujjwala scheme then they told me a very interesting thing. They said: it has saved us a lot of water. I asked them: how did it help you save water? Then they replied that earlier when we used to cook meal on wooden stoves then all kitchenware used to become black and it required a lot of water to wash the kitchenware four times in a day. Now we have gas stove so we are not required to do all that. Now I don’t believe that I could understand this thing without talking to them. And there are lots of such things. And when I myself have a dialogue with them, and in that series today I have got the opportunity to talk to the beneficiaries of Prime Minister’s Housing Scheme (PMAY). Or to those people whose houses have been constructed right in front of them or those who have been associated with the construction of their houses, or those who are going to get their houses very soon. 

You know that every individual has this desire that I should have my own house. Even the poorest of poor thinks that I should have my own house, even if it is a small one. And no one knows the joy of having his own house, this joy is known only to those who have got their houses, no one else knows it. And when I see you people through television, through the technology and the kind of joy is visible on your face, the sense of satisfaction that you have, a new enthusiasm for living life is there and I can see all these things. And when I myself see your enthusiasm and your zeal then my own enthusiasm and zeal increase by ten times. Then I also feel like working more. Then I feel like working hard for you people. Because I get to see the joy on your faces and this is the reason for my own happiness. 

A  housing scheme does not mean only  that we have to provide just a roof on people’s head. Housing does not mean only four walls and a roof. House means that place where all the facilities are available; where one can lead a life; which means happiness for the family; which has the dreams of every family member linked with it. 

 

This was the fundamental thought behind PMAY. Having own house is everyone’s dream. The poorest of the poor people has this desire to have a pucca house but this wish of poor people remained unfulfilled even so many years after the independence. This government made a pledge, it decided that when we will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022; there are several occasions when everyone feels like running; see brother, it’s 75 years of our independence, let us do something, let us do more, let us do something good, let us do something for everyone’s good. 

We have also tried that whatever time we have got – four years, five years till 2022 when it will be 75 years of independence – so that we could also have the courage to run, and courage to do some work. And we had a dream that when India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022 then the poorest of the poor person, be he lives in a village or city, be he lives in a slum or on pavement, wherever he may live, that family should have a pucca house of its own. And it should not be just a house, but it should have electricity and a tap, and that tap should have tap water, it should have gas stove, and it should have an electricity connection through Saubhagya scheme, and there should be a toilet, in a way he should feel that now the life has become worth living. And now there should be some way for making progress in life by doing something. Even the poorest of the poor person should not only have a place for taking rest but he should also get the opportunity to earn the dignity and respect for the family. Housing for all, this is our dream and it’s a solemn resolve for us as well. It means your dream is mine dream, it means your dream is the dream of the government of the country. 

It’s not an easy task to realise this dream in a large country of millions and millions of people. This is very difficult and challenging task. And the experience after so many years after the independence tells us that all this is just impossible. However, despite all these things, this is a poor man’s life; it’s the life of those people who lead their lives without houses that has given me the courage to take this decision. I have taken such a big decision because of my love for you people, because of the affection that I have for you people. And now the government machinery is devoted in implementing this thing, there are other people too. The work is taking place but it only happens when….it does not happen just because there is a will power, it also requires a scheme of things, it requires speed. It also requires people’s trust and support. It requires a sense of dedication towards the people. You people know it very well that how the previous government tried to tackle these challenges, how the work was done, how they used to start and where they used to end up. 

I think that today a big change has been brought about in that thing. Today, we started the work; we started to construct the houses in the name of temples, in the name of communities and somewhere in the name of slums. However, it proved insufficient because of rising population. Later the schemes were formulated in the name of individuals and families. Naturally, the interest was to derive political benefits rather than to provide houses to the common man. And it created a big army of middlemen and the contractors used to earn a lot. We worked on this challenge with a different approach. Instead of thinking in a piecemeal manner, we resolved to work in a mission mode. We have decided that by 2022 we will construct three crore houses in rural areas and one crore houses in urban areas. It’s natural that when the target is so huge then it will also require a big budget. There was a time when the targets were set as per the budget allocation. However, now we first decide the target, which is a needy, what the country needs and then on the basis of that we decide the target and then accordingly we decide the budget. And it is the result of this thing…if I talk about the urban areas then the previous government used to play games in the name of poor.

We have sanctioned the construction nearly four times more houses in the last four years than what was sanctioned during the 10 years of UPA government. Construction of total 13.5 lakh houses were sanctioned during the 10 year period of UPA government whereas we have sanctioned the construction of nearly 47 lakh houses in the last four years and in a way the number of houses sanctioned by us is about to cross the mark of 50 lakh. Andseven lakh houses out of the total have been constructed through new technology. 

Now, after laying emphasis on new technology in the housing sector, we have been starting Global Housing TechnologyChallenge so that the latest technology could be used in the low cost housing. Similarly if we talk about rural areas then nearly 25.5 lakh houses were constructed in rural areas in the entire country during the last four years of previous government whereas our government has constructed more than 1 crore houses in the last four years. It means a jump of 325 per cent. Earlier the time frame for constructing a house was set at 18 months, however, given its importance, we have reduced the time by increasing the speed and we have been moving ahead with the resolve to complete the work in 12 months instead of 18 months. 

Now the situation is like this that a house is being constructed in less than a year. Today, the construction of house is being expedited. And let us see how it is done. It’s not like that a house will be constructed if we just lay bricks and stones at a rapid speed. Concrete steps are being taken at every state in a pre-planned manner for this thing. It’s not just the scale, but size has been changed too. Earlier a minimum area of 20 sq meters was fixed for constructing a house in the village but after coming to power we have increased it to 25 sq meters under the Prime Minister AvasYojana. You may be wondering what would be the use of increasing it by just 5 sq meters. The biggest benefit is that a separate and clean kitchen has been added to this. 

Earlier an assistance of Rs. 70 to 75 thousand rupees was given in villages under PMAY. We have increased it to 1.25 lakh rupees. Now, the money for labor expenses under MNREGA for 90-95 days is also being deposited in beneficiary’s account. 

In addition to this, Rs. 12 thousand is being provided separately for constructing a toilet. Earlier it was experienced that the houses of politicians’ middlemen were constructed but a poor person’s house was not. We have made a very solid arrangement so that no one can siphon off the fund meant for the poor people. 

Today, middlemen have been eliminated because of DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer).  And the assistance money is directly being transferred into the beneficiary's accounts. First we opened Jan Dhan Account and now we have started sending money into those accounts. Arrangements for Geo Tagging of those houses have been made that are constructed under PMAY so that transparency can be maintained. These works have also been linked to DISHA portal through which it can be seen, you can monitor it. I can monitor it from my office, how much work is being done, where it is being done, I can check all these details while sitting in my office. 

 

During the UPA’s tenure, selection of beneficiaries was done through the BPL list prepared by old politicians. But, now we have started doing it on the basis of Socio EconomicCaste Census and because of this we have also included those who were earlier left behind. And because of this thing the maximum numbers of people are getting benefitted by associating with this scheme. The people of every region, every section is getting benefit through it. 

A house is not only a necessity, but it’s also linked to honor and self respect. And once you have your own house then the thinking of every member of family also changes. There is a new courage for making progress. 

And our effort is to fulfill this need of every family and to enhance its prestige and that is why under the PMAY we have particularly focused on the weaker sections of the society and women. Be it tribal or dalits or backwards or SC/STs or OBCs or minorities or our differently able brothers and sisters, we are giving priorities to them. 

Today, houses are constructed at a fast pace as a result of the concerted efforts made at a comprehensive level. We are the people rooted in the ground. We very well understand the problem and difficulties of the common man and this is the reason that is why we have been working by taking into the account the requirements of common people. It has been commonplace in the governments that every scheme works in a separate way. Earlier there was no coordination between two ministries, two departments and two schemes. 

Several government schemes have been brought together in Prime Minister’s Housing Scheme. It has been linked with MNREGA for construction and employment. A separate arrangement has been made to ensure that there is a toilet in the house and facilities of water and LPG gas. It has been linked to Clean India Mission so that the house has a toilet. It has been linked with PanditDeenDayalUpadhyay Gram JyotiYojana and Saubhagya Yojana. It has been linked with rural drinking water mission to provide water. It has been linked with Ujjwala scheme to provide LPG. This housing unit is not confined to just one house. But it’s a tool for empowerment. More than 70 per cent beneficiaries in the urban areas are women. 

It is also creating employment avenues when today more houses are constructed than what was the case earlier. 

Business of every construction material from bricks to sand to cement has been flourishing at local level. Local laborers, masons are also getting work. In addition to this thing, the government has started the programme to provide training to one lakh masons for doing the quality work in villages. And you will be happy to know that in some states female masons have also been trained along with male masons. It’s a very important step in the direction of women empowerment. 

Government has been working on four models to include more and more people in this scheme in urban areas. An assistance of Rs. 1.5 lakh per house has been given to beneficiaries in urban areas for either construction or extension of a house under Prime Minister’s Housing Scheme. 

 

Under the link subsidy scheme, a subsidy of 3 to 6% is provided on the interest payment for a home loan. The government is giving an assistance of Rs. 1 lakh per house for redevelopment of area. An assistance of Rs. 1.5 lakh per house is being given to economically backward people for developing affordable housing in partnership with public sector. Earlier this was the situation that though the builders used to take money but not a single brick was being put at the site for years. So in order to provide benefit to poor and middle class people and to protect the interest of home buyers; a middle class family puts in its life time saving for buying a house; we passed RERA – Real Estate Regulation Act – so that no one can cheat them. In addition to bringing transparency, home buyers are getting their rights too. And even builders are also afraid of cheating the buyers. 

Today, there are several such examples in the country where this scheme has given support to their hopes and aspirations. Having a house is everybody’s first priority, having a house ensures prosperity and safety and it also helps you to keep healthy. Having your own house is every person’s top priority, it was the top priority earlier as well. Unfortunately, earlier this was the case that though this was the top priority but it could only be fulfilled in the end. And sometimes it remained unfulfilled. However, now this is not the case. 

We have always heard this saying that: it takes a lifetime to construct your own house. However, it’s a different kind of government. Now the proverbs are changing too, the country is changing and proverbs are changing too. Now the time has come to change the proverbs. Now the time has come when an inner voice will risewithin us that: now our lives are being spent in our own houses. 

I believe that since this is such a massive system so there will still be some people whose old habits would not have changed. And therefore I appeal to you people that if anyone is asking or some other unduebenefit for providing any kind of benefit under this scheme then you please file a complaint without any hesitation. You can file your complaint with your collector or minister in this regard. 

I have also said this thing earlier as well that India’s dreams and aspirations can’t be realised by these things alone. We have prepared a solid ground and now we have a limitless sky before us. Housing for all, electricity for all, banking for all, insurance for all, gas connections for all, this will be the image of completeness of a New India. 

We have been moving forward in the direction of villages and society equipped with modern facilities. And that is why today I have got the opportunity to talk to brothers and sisters in such a big numbers. I would like to show you a small video and thereafter I would like to hear you people.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the concluding session of the Conference of Governors at RashtrapatiBhavan.

The Prime Minister appreciated the various discussions and inputs shared during the Conference. 

The Prime Minister called upon Governors to strengthen the “Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat” initiative, which promotes partnerships, cultural exchanges and people to people linkages among States. He emphasized the need to build new ways to promote harmony and integration among various States of India.

The Prime Minister urged Governors, in their capacity as Chancellors, to call upon Universities to promote excellence in various spheres of academics. He said that Indian Universities must aspire to be among the world’s best, and Governors can play a crucial role in catalysing their transformation. In this context, he mentioned the Union Government’s initiatives to promote autonomy in IIMs, and among top 10 public and top 10 private Universities. 

The Prime Minister said that the Union Government is working towards promoting “ease of living” for the common man. He said that Governors, through their vast experience in public life, can motivate civic agencies and government departments to work with commitment towards this cause.

The Prime Minister also spoke of the Union Government’s ambitious health assurance scheme Ayushman Bharat. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that occasions such as the seventy-fifth anniversary of freedom in 2022, and the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, can serve as inspirational milestones for achieving development goals and targets. He said the upcoming KumbhMela could also serve as an important occasion for promoting nationally relevant causes.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana beneficiaries from across the country, through video bridge. This is the third in the series of video bridge interactions by the Prime Minister with various beneficiaries of Government schemes.

Expressing delight at interacting with Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana beneficiaries, Prime Minister said that such interactions help in understanding various aspects of the scheme, including areas that needs to be improved. Prime Minister further added that Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is not just about brick and mortar but about providing better quality of life and dreams coming true. 

Addressing the beneficiaries, Prime Minister said that the last 4 years, Government has taken a mission mode approach towards providing housing for all. Government is working towards ensuring that every Indian has a home by 2022, when India will celebrate its 75 years of independence, Prime Minister added.

Under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Government plans to build around three crore houses in rural areas and one crore houses in urban areas. The Government has so far given sanctions to build more than 47 lakh houses in urban areas, which is 4 times more than the sanctions given by the previous government in 10 years. Similarly, sanctions have been given to build more than one crore houses in the rural areas compared to 25 lakh sanctions by the previous government in its last 4 years. Government has also been able to reduce the time needed to build a house from 18 months to 12 months, thereby saving about 6 months.

Emphasizing on the changes brought by the present government in PMAY, Prime Minister said that the size of houses built have been increased to 25 square metre from 20 square metres. Also the financial assistance for the scheme has also been enhanced upto Rs. 1,25,000 from the earlier allocation of Rs. 70,000 - 75,000. 

During the interaction, Prime Minister said that Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is linked with the dignity of the citizens and the focus of the Yojana is to ensure more women, Divyang sisters and brothers, SC, ST, OBC, and Minority communities get access to housing. 

 

Engaging with beneficiaries, Prime Minister said that PMAY has created employment opportunities for all. In order to strengthen the scheme, Government is working towards skill development to ensure faster, and quality construction of houses. As part of it, government has started training about one lakh masons. In addition, Government has also started training female masons in many states, thereby resulting in women empowerment.

 

Interacting with the Prime Minister, all the beneficiaries expressed happiness in owning a house, which has always been a dream. They also explained how it has changed their life and improved the quality of life.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the opening session of the 49th Conference of Governors at Rashtrapati Bhawan. 

The Prime Minister spoke at length about how Governors could leverage their experience in different walks of life, so that people derive maximum benefit of various central development schemes and initiatives. He said the institution of Governor has a pivotal role to play within the federal structure and Constitutional framework of our country. 

He said Governors of States with significant tribal population can help in ensuring that the tribal communities benefit from Government initiatives in fields such as education, sports and financial inclusion. He said the tribal communities had played a key role in the freedom struggle, and this should be recognised and recorded for posterity through avenues such as digital museums.  

The Prime Minister noted that Governors are also Chancellors of Universities. He said that International Yoga Day on June 21st can be utilized as an opportunity to generate greater awareness about Yoga among the youth. Similarly, he emphasized that Universities can also become the focal point of the celebrations for the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. 

The Prime Minister mentioned some key themes of development such as the National Nutrition Mission, electrification of villages and development parameters in aspirational districts. He suggested that Governors could also visit a few recently electrified villages to witness  first-hand the benefits of electrification.

He said that during the recent Gram Swaraj Abhiyan from 14th April, seven key schemes of the Government were implemented fully in over 16000 villages. He said that these villages have been freed from seven problems through Jan Bhagidaari. He said Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is now being extended to 65000 more villages, with a target date of 15th August. 

The Prime Minister suggested that planning for the 50th Governors' Conference next year should begin immediately. This effort should focus on making this annual event even more productive.

                Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 

Thank you for your friendship, your leadership of India-Singapore partnership and a better future for the region.

Defence Ministers, 

Mr. John Chipman,

Dignitaries and Excellencies, 

Namaskar and a very good evening to all of you!

 

I am pleased to return to a region, known to India since ancient times as Swarnabhoomi, (the land of gold).

I am also happy to be here in a special year. In a land-mark year of India’s relationship with ASEAN.

In January, we had the unique honour of hosting ten ASEAN leaders on our Republic Day. The ASEAN-India Summit was a testimony of our commitment to ASEAN, and to our Act East policy.

For thousands of years, Indians have turned to the East. Not just to see the Sun rise, but also to pray for its light to spread over the entire world. The human-kind now looks to the Rising East, with the hope to see the promise that this 21st century beholds for the whole world, because the destiny of the world will be deeply influenced by the course of developments in the Indo-Pacific region.

Because, this new age of promise is also caught in shifting plates of global politics and the fault lines of history. I am here to say that the future we seek does not have to be as elusive as Shangri La; that we can shape this region in our collective hopes and aspirations. No where is it more apt to pursue this than in Singapore.This great nation shows us that when the oceans are open, the seas are secure, countries are connected, the rule of law prevails and the region is stable, nations, small and large, prosper as sovereign countries. Free and fearless in their choices.

Singapore also shows that when nations stand on the side of principles, not behind one power or the other, they earn the respect of the world and a voice in international affairs. And, when they embrace diversity at home, they seek an inclusive world outside.

For India, though, Singapore means more. It’s the spirit that unites a lion nation and a lion city.Singapore is our springboard to ASEAN. It has been, for centuries, a gateway for India to the East.For over two thousand years, the winds of monsoons, the currents of seas and the force of human aspirations have built timeless links between India and this region. It was cast in peace and friendship, religion and culture, art and commerce, language and literature. These human links have lasted, even as the tides of politics and trade saw their ebb and flow. 

Over the past three decades, we have re-claimed that heritage to restore our role and relationships in the region. For India, no region now receives as much attention as this. And, for good reasons.

Oceans had an important place in Indian thinking since pre-Vedic times. Thousands of years ago, the Indus Valley Civilisation as well as Indian peninsula had maritime trade. Oceans and Varuna – the Lord of all Waters – find a prominent place in the world’s oldest books- the Vedas. In ancient Puranas, written thousands of years ago, the geographical definition of India is with reference to the seas: Uttaron Yat Samudrasya meaning, the land which lies to the north of the seas.

Lothal, in my home state Gujarat, was among the world's oldest ports. Even today there are remains of a dock. No wonder Gujaratis are enterprising and travel widely even today! The Indian Ocean has shaped much of India’s history. It now holds the key to our future. The ocean carries 90% of India’s trade and our energy sources. It is also the life line of global commerce. The Indian Ocean connects regions of diverse cultures and different levels of peace and prosperity. It also now bears ships of major powers. Both raise concerns of stability and contest. 

To the East, the Malacca Strait and South China Sea connect India to the Pacific and to most of our major partners - ASEAN, Japan, Republic of Korea, China and the Americas. Our trade in the region is growing rapidly. And, a significant part of our overseas investments flow in this direction. ASEAN alone accounts for over 20%. 

Our interests in the region are vast, and our engagement is deep. In the Indian Ocean region, our relationships are becoming stronger. We are also helping build economic capabilities and improve maritime security for our friends and partners. We promote collective security through forums like Indian Ocean Naval Symposium. 

We are advancing a comprehensive agenda of regional co-operation through Indian Ocean Rim Association. And, we also work with partners beyond the Indian Ocean Region to ensure that the global transit routes remain peaceful and free for all.

Three years ago, in Mauritius, I described our vision in one word – Sagar, which means ocean in Hindi. And, Sagar stands for Security and Growth for All in the Region and, that is the creed we follow to our East now even more vigorously through our Act East Policy by seeking to join India, especially her East and North-East, with our land and maritime partners to the east.

South-east Asia is our neighbour by land and sea. With each Southeast Asian country, we have growing political, economic and defence ties. With ASEAN, from dialogue partners, we have become strategic partners over the course of 25 years. We pursue our relations through annual summits and 30 dialogue mechanisms. But even more through a shared vision for the region, and the comfort and familiarity of our old links.

We are active participants in ASEAN-led institutions like East Asia Summit, A.D.M.M. Plus and A.R.F. We are part of BIMSTEC and Mekong-Ganga Economic Corridor - a bridge between South and Southeast Asia.

Our ties with Japan – from economic to strategic – have been completely transformed. It is a partnership of great substance and purpose that is a corner-stone of India’s Act East Policy. There is a strong momentum in our cooperation with Republic of Korea. And, there is a fresh energy in our partnerships with Australia, as also New Zealand.

With several of our partners, we meet in formats of three or more. More than three years ago, I landed at dawn in Fiji to start a successful new phase of engagement with Pacific Island Nations. The meetings of the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation, or FIPIC, have bridged the distance of geography through shared interests and action.

Beyond East and Southeast Asia, our partnerships are strong and growing. It is a measure of our strategic autonomy that India’s Strategic Partnership, with Russia, has matured to be special and privileged.

Ten days ago in an informal summit at Sochi, President Putin and I shared our views on the need for a strong multi-polar world order for dealing with the challenges of our times. At the same time, India’s global strategic partnership with the United States has overcome the hesitations of history and continues to deepen across the extraordinary breadth of our relationship. It has assumed new significance in the changing world. And, an important pillar of this partnership is our shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific Region. No other relationship of India has as many layers as our relations with China. We are the world’s two most populous countries and among the fastest growing major economies. Our cooperation is expanding. Trade is growing. And, we have displayed maturity and wisdom in managing issues and ensuring a peaceful border.

In April, a two-day informal Summit with President Xi helped us cement our understanding that strong and stable relations between our two nations are an important factor for global peace and progress. I firmly believe that, Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.

India has a growing partnership with Africa, propelled through mechanisms such as India-Africa Forum Summits. At its core are cooperation based on Africa’s requirements, and a history of warmth and mutual respect.

Friends, 

Coming back to our region, India’s growing engagement is accompanied by deeper economic and defence cooperation. We have more trade agreements in this part of the world than in any other. We have Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements with Singapore, Japan and South Korea.

We have Free Trade Agreements with ASEAN and Thailand. And, we are now actively participating in concluding the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. I have just paid my first visit to Indonesia, India’s neighbour 90 nautical miles close, and not 90 nautical miles apart. 

My friend President Widodo and I upgraded India-Indonesia relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Among other shared interests, we have a common vision for maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. On way from Indonesia, I stopped over briefly in Malaysia to meet one of ASEAN's most senior leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir. 

Friends,

India Armed Forces, especially our Navy, are building partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region for peace and security, as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. They train, exercise and conduct goodwill missions across the region. For example, with Singapore, we have the longest un-interrupted naval exercise, which is in its twenty fifth year now.

We will start a new tri-lateral exercise with Singapore soon and we hope to extend it to other ASEAN countries. We work with partners like Vietnam to build mutual capabilities. India conducts Malabar Exercise with the United States and Japan. A number of regional partners join in India’s Exercise Milan in the Indian Ocean, and participate in RIMPAC in the Pacific.

We are active in the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia – in this very city. Distinguished members of the audience, Back home, our principal mission is transforming India to a New India by 2022, when Independent India will be 75 years young. 

We will sustain growth of 7.5 to 8% per year. As our economy grows, our global and regional integration will increase. A nation of over 800 million youth knows that their future will be secured not just by the scale of India's economy, but also by the depth of global engagement. More than any where else, our ties will deepen and our presence will grow in the region. But, the future we seek to build needs a stable bedrock of peace. And, this is far from certain.

There are shifts in global power, change in the character of global economy and daily disruption in technology. The foundations of the global order appear shaken. And, the future looks less certain. For all our progress, we live on the edge of uncertainty, of unsettled questions and unresolved disputes; contests and claims; and clashing visions and competing models.

We see growing mutual insecurity and rising military expenditure; internal dislocations turning into external tensions; and new fault lines in trade and competition in the global commons. Above all, we see assertion of power over re-course to international norms. In the midst of all this, there are challenges that touch us all, including the un-ending threat of terrorism and extremism. This is a world of inter-dependent fortunes and failures. And, no nation can shape and secure it on its own.

It is a world that summons us to rise above divisions and competition to work together. Is that possible?

Yes. It is possible. I see ASEAN as an example and inspiration. ASEAN represents the greatest level of diversity of culture, religion, language, governance and prosperity of any grouping in the world.

It was born when Southeast Asia was a frontline of global competition, a theatre of a brutal war and a region of uncertain nations. Yet, today, ASEAN has united ten countries behind a common purpose. ASEAN unity is essential for a stable future for this region.

And, each of us must support it, not weaken it. I have attended four East Asia Summits. I am convinced that ASEAN can integrate the broader region. In many ways, ASEAN is already leading the process. In doing so, it has laid the foundation of the Indo-Pacific Region. The East Asia Summit and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – two important initiatives of ASEAN – embrace this geography.

 

Friends, 

The Indo-Pacific is a natural region. It is also home to a vast array of global opportunities and challenges. I am increasingly convinced with each passing day that the destinies of those of us who live in the region are linked. Today, we are being called to rise above divisions and competition to work together. 

The ten countries of South East Asia connect the two great oceans in both the geographical and civilizational sense. Inclusiveness, openness and ASEAN centrality and unity, therefore, lie at the heart of the new Indo-Pacific. India does not see the Indo-Pacific Region as a strategy or as a club of limited members. 

Nor as a grouping that seeks to dominate. And by no means do we consider it as directed against any country. A geographical definition, as such, cannot be. India's vision for the Indo-Pacific Region is, therefore, a positive one. And, it has many elements.

 

One, 

It stands for a free, open, inclusive region, which embraces us all in a common pursuit of progress and prosperity. It includes all nations in this geography as also others beyond who have a stake in it.

Two,

Southeast Asia is at its centre. And, ASEAN has been and will be central to its future. That is the vision that will always guide India, as we seek to cooperate for an architecture for peace and security in this region.

Three, 

We believe that our common prosperity and security require us to evolve, through dialogue, a common rules-based order for the region. And, it must equally apply to all individually as well as to the global commons. Such an order must believe in sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as equality of all nations, irrespective of size and strength. These rules and norms should be based on the consent of all, not on the power of the few. This must be based on faith in dialogue, and not dependence on force. It also means that when nations make international commitments, they must uphold them. This is the foundation of India's faith in multilateralism and regionalism; and, of our principled commitment to rule of law.

Four, 

We should all have equal access as a right under international law to the use of common spaces on sea and in the air that would require freedom of navigation, unimpeded commerce and peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law. When we all agree to live by that code, our sea lanes will be pathways to prosperity and corridors of peace. We will also be able to come together to prevent maritime crimes, preserve marine ecology, protect against disasters and prosper from blue economy.

Five, 

This region, and all of us, have benefitted from globalisation. Indian food is among the best examples of these benefits! But, there is growing protectionism – in goods and in services. Solutions cannot be found behind walls of protection, but in embracing change. What we seek is a level playing field for all. India stands for open and stable international trade regime. We will also support rule-based, open, balanced and stable trade environment in the Indo-Pacific Region, which lifts up all nations on the tide of trade and investment. That is what we expect from Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. RCEP must be comprehensive, as the name suggests, and the principles declared. It must have a balance among trade, investment and services.

Six, 

Connectivity is vital. It does more than enhance trade and prosperity. It unites a region. India has been at the crossroads for centuries. We understand the benefits of connectivity. There are many connectivity initiatives in the region. If these have to succeed, we must not only build infrastructure, we must also build bridges of trust. And for that, these initiatives must be based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, consultation, good governance, transparency, viability and sustainability. They must empower nations, not place them under impossible debt burden. They must promote trade, not strategic competition. On these principles, we are prepared to work with everyone. India is doing its part, by itself and in partnership with others like Japan – in South Asia and Southeast Asia, in the Indian Ocean, Africa, West Asia and beyond. And, we are important stake-holders in New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

Finally, 

All of this is possible, if we do not return to the age of great power rivalries I have said this before: Asia of rivalry will hold us all back. Asia of cooperation will shape this century. So, each nation must ask itself: Are its choices building a more united world, or forcing new divisions? It is a responsibility that both existing and rising powers have. Competition is normal. But, contests must not turn into conflict; differences must not be allowed to become disputes. Distinguished members of the audience, It is normal to have partnerships on the basis of shared values and interests. India, too, has many in the region and beyond.

We will work with them, individually or in formats of three or more, for a stable and peaceful region. But, our friendships are not alliances of containment. We choose the side of principles and values, of peace and progress, not one side of a divide or the other. Our relationships across the world speak for our position. 

And, when we can work together, we will be able to meet the real challenges of our times. We will be able to protect our planet. We will be able to ensure non-proliferation We will be able to secure our people from terrorism and cyber threats.

In conclusion, let me say this again: India’s own engagement in the Indo-Pacific Region – from the shores of Africa to that of the Americas - will be inclusive. We are in-heritors of Vedanta philosophy that believes in essential oneness of all, and celebrates unity in diversity Ekam Satyam, Viprah Bahudavadanti (Truth is one, the learned speak of it in many ways). That is the foundation of our civilizational ethos – of pluralism, co-existence, open-ness and dialogue. The ideals of democracy that define us as a nation also shape the way we engage the world. 

So, it translates into five S in Hindi: Samman (respect); Samvad (dialogue); Sahayog (cooperation), Shanti (peace), and Samriddhi (prosperity). It’s easy to learn these words! So, we will engage with the world in peace, with respect, through dialogue and absolute commitment to international law. 

We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order, in which all nations, small and large, thrive as equal and sovereign We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open; our nations secure from terrorism; and our cyber space free from disruption and conflict. We will keep our economy open and our engagement transparent. We will share our resources, markets and prosperity with our friends and partners. We will seek a sustainable future for our planet, as through the new International Solar Alliance together with France and other partners. 

This is how we wish ourselves and our partners to proceed in this vast region and beyond. The ancient wisdom of the region is our common heritage. Lord Buddha’s message of peace and compassion has connected us all. Together, we have contributed much to human civilisation. And, we have been through the devastation of war and the hope of peace. We have seen the limits of power. And, we have seen the fruits of cooperation.

This world is at a crossroad there are temptations of the worst lessons of history. But, there is also a path of wisdom. It summons us to a higher purpose: to rise above a narrow view of our interests and recognise that each of us can serve our interests better when we work together as equals in the larger good of all nations. I am here to urge all to take that path.

 

Thank you. 

Thank you very much.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today visited Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

He responded to questions during an interaction with students.

On a question on the challenges facing Asia in the 21st century, the Prime Minister noted that it is often said that the 21st century will be Asia's century. It is essential to believe in ourselves and know that this is our turn, he added. We must rise to the occasion and take that leadership, the Prime Minister said.

The Prime Minister referred to his recent meeting with President Xi Jinping in China. He said that he gave a document to President Xi, which shows that out of the last 2000 years, India and China's combined share of global GDP has exceeded 50 percent for 1600 years. Further, this was largely achieved without conflict, he said. The Prime Minister said that we must focus on boosting connectivity without conflict.

The Prime Minister said that space technology has a key role to play in good governance. It can vastly improve the life of the common man, he said. Space technology helps us in properly mapping our development infrastructure - be it in terms of where do we need more schools, better roads, added hospitals, the Prime Minister said.

Responding to a question on the balance between tradition and globalization, the  Prime Minister said that mankind has progressed through the ages due to innovation and due to ethics as well as humanitarian values. He said technology is aiding human creativity. Various social media platforms have given voice to millions, he said.

Talking about ensuring inclusive growth in the age of the fourth industrial revolution, the Prime Minister said that disruption does not mean destruction. He said technology empowers people, and a technology driven society breaks social barriers. Technology has to be affordable and user-friendly, he added. He recalled that people were once apprehensive about computers, but computers helped transform our lives.

                His Excellency,
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
Distinguished Delegates,
Member of Media, 

First of all, I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Lee for his hospitality and harmony, for his persistent efforts towards strengthening relations with India and also for our personal friendship.

India-Singapore relations fulfill the criterion of strategic partnership in the true sense. There is no uneasiness in our relationships, rather it has only warmth, harmony and faith. In our discussions today, Prime Minister Lee and I together reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed the roadmap for the future.

I am especially happy about the completion of the second review of our Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. But both of us agree that second review is not our destination, it is just a halt. Our executives will soon start discussions to upgrade and improve this agreement.

Singapore is an important source of foreign direct investment for India. And it is the top destination for India to make investments abroad. I am happy that Indian companies use Singapore as a spring-board for the ASEAN region and other countries. Investment by companies in Singapore to India is growing. India's progress provides unmatched opportunities to Singapore in its key areas. In the last evening’s round table with CEO’s of prominent Singapore companies, I was glad to see their faith in India.

Air traffic between India and Singapore is growing rapidly. Both sides will soon review the bilateral air services agreement.

We both are very pleased with the start of our digital partnership. It is an area of natural partnership with unlimited possibilities. International launch of a remittance app based on UPI, RuPay and BHIM in Singapore last evening reflects Digital India and our spirit of freshness in this partnership. Under Digital India, we will create a data center policy in India.

Today I will see many agreements being signed at theNanyang Technological University, which will further enhance our cooperation in higher education, science, technology and innovation. There has been good progress in our cooperation in the areas of Skill Development, Planning and Urban Development.

We have seen the introduction of new initiatives for water in 115 aspirational districts of India. The agreements that we have signed yesterday and today will take this cooperation to a new level. These will eventually benefit the youth of India including rural areas.

We have emphasized the importance of defence and security in our strategic partnership. We welcome the continuous increase in these relations. I congratulate the navies of India and Singapore on 25th anniversary of SIMBEX. Soon we will start the tripartite naval exercises too. Considering regular exercises and naval cooperation, I welcome the completion of a logistics agreement between the navies.

Combating cyber security, extremism and terrorism will be an important area of our cooperation in the coming days. We consider them to be among the biggest threats to our countries.

Prime Minister Lee and I shared our concerns on global and regional challenges. We both have reaffirmed our principled views on maritime security and highlighted our commitment to a Rules Based Order.

We have also agreed on the need to maintain open, stable and fair international trade regime.

I have also emphasized the importance of ASEAN unity, its centrality and regional sustainability, through the institutions led by ASEAN. I also conveyed India's firm commitment to an early conclusion of the RCEP Agreement and hoped for a fair, balanced and comprehensive agreement.

In the Shangri La Dialogue of today evening, I want to express India's perspective on peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. I would like to thank Prime Minister Lee for inviting me to the Shangri-La Dialogue. 



I conveyed my best wishes to Prime Minister Lee and his whole team for successful transition of the leadership. I know that the new leaders of Singapore will continue with their glorious legacy. And will take this great country forward with the same spirit and tradition of serving the people.

Thank You. 

Many many thanks.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Strengthening of teaching, patient / clinical care and public health programme implementation - Shifting of more experienced doctors belonging to Central Government and Central government entities to teaching/ clinical / Public Health Programme implementation activities.

 

The approval seeks to ensure that the doctors belonging to Central Health Service (CHS) and of other Ministries / Departments / entities of the Central Government, after attaining the age of 62 years, work exclusively in their respective fields of clinical expertise. This would be done by amending the decision of the Union Cabinet taken in its meeting held on 15.06.2016 for removal of difficulties experienced in effective implementation of this decision.

 

Major Impact:

 

This will result in capacity building and leadership development of more Central Government doctors besides availability of more experienced doctors for medical education, clinical / patient care services and for implementation of national health programmes.

 

Beneficiaries:

 

            The decision will make available more experienced doctors for patient / clinical care, medical teaching activities and implementation of National Health Programmes etc., which is likely to benefit society at large.

 

The benefits of this proposal will percolate down the line throughout the country.

Background: 

 

In order to tackle the problem of shortage of doctors, low joining and high attrition rate in Central Health Service, Union Cabinet in its meeting held on 15.06.2016, approved increase in age of superannuation of doctors of the Central Health Service to 65 years. Subsequently, in its meeting held on 27.09.2017, the Union Cabinet increased age of superannuation of doctors working in various other Ministries/Departments including those of Indian Railways, AYUSH, Central Universities and NTs, etc. to 65 years. It is, however, felt that there is a need to make available the services of senior doctors above the age of 62 years for core medical profession, such as, clinical / patient care/ teaching in medical colleges / implementation of health programmes, Public Health programmes & functions, etc.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approvedestablishment of additional 6.5 Million Metric Tonne (MMT) Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) facilities at two locations, i.e. Chandikhol in Odisha and Padur in Karnataka, including construction of dedicated SPMs (Single Point Mooring) for the two SPRs. The SPR facilities at Chandikhol and Padur will be underground rockcaverns and will have capacities of 4 MMT and 2.5 MMT respectively. Government had announced setting up of two additional SPRs during the budgetannouncement for 2017-18.

 

The in principle approval is to take up the project under PPP model to reduce budgetary support of Government of India. The terms and conditions of such participation, would be determined by M/oP&NG in consultation with Ministry of Finance after conducting road shows to elicit requirements of market, including prospective investors.

 

 ISPRL has already constructed underground rock caverns for storage of 5.33MMT of crude oil at three locations, viz. Vishakhapatnam (1.33 MMT), Mangalore (1.5 MMT) and Padur (2.5 MMT). The total 5.33 MMT capacity under Phase-I of the SPR programme is currently estimated to supply approximately 10 days of India’s crude requirement according to the consumption data for FY2016-17. Cabinet’s approval for establishing additional 6.5 MMT Strategic Petroleum Reserve facilities will provide an additional supply of about 12 days and is expected to augment India’s energy security.

 

The construction phase of the SPRs at Chandikhol and Padur is likely to generate significant direct & indirect employment opportunities in the states of Odisha and Karnataka.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal of Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) for the nomination of the Union Home Minister as ex-officio Chairman of North Eastern Council (NEC) - a statutory body with Governors and Chief Ministers of all the eight North Eastern States as its Member. The Cabinet also approved that Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of DoNER would serve as Vice Chairman of the Council.

 

Impact:

          NEC implements various projects through the State and Central agencies. Under the new arrangement with Home Minister as Chairman and Minister of DoNER as Vice Chairman, NEC and all the Governors and Chief Ministers of North Eastern States as Member would provide a forum for discussing inter-state matters more comprehensively and also consider common approaches to be taken in future.

 

          NEC can now also perform the tasks undertaken by the various Zonal Councils to discuss such inter-State issues as drug trafficking, smuggling of arms and ammunition, boundary disputes etc.

 

          This repositioning of NEC will help it to become a more effective body for the North Eastern Region.

 

          The Council shall, from time to time, review the implementation of the projects/schemes included in the project; recommend effective measures for coordination among the state Governments for these projects etc. The Council shall have such powers as may be delegated to it by the Central Government.

 

Background:

          NEC was established under the North Eastern Council Act, 1971 as an apex level body for securing balanced and coordinated development and facilitating coordination with the States. Subsequent to the Amendment of 2002, NEC has been mandated to function as a regional planning body for the North Eastern Area and while formulating a regional plan for this area, shall give priority to the schemes and projects benefiting two or more states provided that in the case of Sikkim, the Council shall formulate specific projects and schemes for that State.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for introduction of Dam Safety Bill, 2018 in the Parliament.

Benefits:

          It will help all the States and Union Territories of India to adopt uniform dam safety procedures which shall ensure safety of dams and safeguard benefits from such dams. This shall also help in safeguarding human life, livestock and property.

The draft Bill has been finalised after wide consultation with leading Indian experts and international experts.

Details:


	The Bill provides for proper surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of all specified dams in the country to ensure their safe functioning. 
	The Bill provides for constitution of a National Committee on Dam Safety which shall evolve dam safety policies and recommend necessary regulations as may be required for the purpose. 
	The Bill provides for establishment of National Dam Safety Authority as a regulatory body which shall discharge functions to implement the policy, guidelines and standards for dam safety in the country.
	The Bill provides for constitution of a State Committee on Dam Safety by State Government.


 

National Dam Safety Authority


	It shall maintain liaison with the State Dam Safety Organisations and the owners of dams for standardisation of dam safety related data and practices;
	It shall provide the technical and managerial assistance to the States and State Dam Safety Organisations; 
	It shall maintain a national level data-base of all dams in the country and the records of major dam failures; 
	It shall examine the cause of any major dam failure; 
	It shall publish and update the standard guidelines and check-lists for the routine inspection and detailed investigations of dams and appurtenances;
	It shall accord recognition or accreditations to the organisations that can be entrusted with the works of investigation, design or construction of new dams; 
	It will also look into unresolved points of issue between the State Dam Safety Organisation of two states, or between the State Dam Safety Organisation of a State and the owner of a dam in that State, for proper solution; 
	Further, in certain cases, such as dams of one State falling under the territory of another State, the National Authority shall also perform the role of State Dam Safety Organization thereby eliminating potential causes for inter-state conflicts.


 

State Committee on Dam Safety

It will ensure proper surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of all specified dams in that State and ensure their safe functioning. It further provides that every State shall establish a ""State Dam Safety Organisation"", which will be manned by officers from the field dam safety preferably from the areas of dam-designs, hydro-mechanical engineering, hydrology, geo-technical investigation, instrumentation and dam-rehabilitation.

Background:

There are over 5200 large dams in India and about 450 are under construction. Plus there are thousands of medium and small dams. Due to lack of legal and institutional architecture for dam safety in India, dam safety is an issue of concern. Unsafe dams are a hazard and dam break may cause disasters, leading to huge loss of life and property.

The Dam Safety Bill, 2018 address all issues concerning dam safety including regular inspection of dams, Emergency Action Plan, comprehensive dam safety review, adequate repair and maintenance funds for dam safety, Instrumentation and Safety Manuals. It lays onus of dam safety on the dam owner and provides for penal provisions for commission and omission of certain acts.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the monetization of 3.70 acres of land at PragatiMaidan by India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITJPO) on long-term leasehold basis for 99 years for construction and running of a Hotel by a third party including private sector through a transparent competitive bidding process.

This measure is part of the Phase - I of redevelopment project of PragatiMaidan i.e. Integrated Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre (IECC) Project. It was was approved by the CCEA in January 2017 at an estimated cost of Rs. 2254 crore. IECC project envisages construction of a world class state-of-the-art Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre with a seating capacity for 7,000 pax, exhibition, space of over 1,00,000sq.mtr. and a basement parking for 4,800 vehicles. Traffic decongestion measures in and around the PragatiMaidan will also lead to decongestion of the area.

Funds raised through monetization of land will be one of the means of financing the IECC project which is essential for Central Government and State Governments to hold Summit Level Meetings and Exhibitions/Events for tradepromotion.

 

The work for IECC project as well as the traffic decongestion solutions is in full swing. ITPO has stated that the entire project is expected to be completedby September 2019. IECC project will benefit Indian trade and industry, and help increase India’s foreign trade.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for withdrawal of Nalanda University (Amendment) Bill, 2013 pending in the Rajya Sabha.

The Nalanda University was established on the basis of a Joint Press Statement at the 4th East Asia Summit held in Thailand in October, 2009, which supported its establishment as a non-state, non-profit, secular and self-governing international institution. Subsequently, the Nalanda University Act, 2010 was passed by the Parliament and came into effect from 25thNovember 2010.

The present proposal is for moving a motion in Rajya Sabha withdrawing the Nalanda University (Amendment) Bill, 2013 introduced in Rajya Sabha on August 26, 2013 to amend certain existing provisions of the Nalanda University Act, 2010 and add some new provisions.

The Governing Board of Nalanda University has since been constituted as per section 7 of Nalanda University Act, 2010 with effect from 21.11.2016 with, the approval of Hon'ble President of India. The Amendment Bill will need to be discussed with the current Governing Board of Nalanda University before a final decision could be taken on going ahead with the proposed amendments. Further, the current Governing Board may also look into the entire Nalanda University Act, 2010 afresh and suggest amendments/additions wherever necessary.

Teaching in the University was inaugurated by Smt.SushmaSwaraj, External Affairs Minister in September 2014. Hon'ble President of India is the Visitor of the University, Dr. Vijay Bhatkar, the Chancellor and Professor Sunaina Singh, is the Vice Chancellor. At present, the University has 116 students in three schools of studies namely School of Historical Studies, School of Ecology and Environment Studies and School of Buddhist Studies. This includes 35 international students from 21 foreign countries.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) Continuation Programme (Phase 6)  and funding of thirty PSLV operational flights under the Programme.

The Programme will also meet the launch requirement of satellites for Earth observation, Navigation and Space Sciences. This will also ensure the continuity of production in Indian industry.  

The total fund requirement is Rs. 6131.00 Crores and includes the cost of thirty PSLV vehicles, essential facility augmentation, Programme Management and Launch Campaign.

Major Impact:

          The operationalisation of PSLV has made the country self-reliant in the launching capability of satellites for earth observation, disaster management, navigation and space sciences. The PSLV Continuation programme will sustain this capability and self-reliance in the launching of similar satellites for national requirements.

The PSLV Continuation Programme – Phase 6 will meet the demand for the launch of satellites at a frequency up to eight launches per year, with maximal participation by the Indian industry. All the operational flights would be completed during the period 2019-2024.

The Programme will also meet the launch requirement of satellites for Earth observation, Navigation and Space Sciences. This will also ensure the continuity of production in Indian industry.  

PSLV Continuation Programme was initially sanctioned in 2008, and four phases have been completed and the fifth phase is expected to be completed by Q2 of 2019-20. The Phase 6 approval will cater to the launch of satellite missions during the period Q3 of 2019-20 to Q1 of 2023-24.

 

Background:

PSLV has emerged as a versatile launch vehicle to carry out Sun-Synchronous Polar Orbit (SSPO), Geo-synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) and low inclination Low Earth Orbit (LEO) missions. With the recent successful launch of PSLV-C41 on 12th April, 2018, PSLV has completed three developmental and forty three operational flights and the last forty one flights have been successful. PSLV has established itself as a workhorse vehicle for national satellites with a production capacity that would enable responding fast to commercial launch opportunities also.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has approved the revision in the wage structure and allowances of Gramin Dak Sevaks (GDS) of the Department of Posts.

The revision in the wage structure would entail an estimated expenditure of Rs 1257.75 crore (Non-recurring expenditure - Rs 860.95 crore and Recurring expenditure of Rs.396.80 crore) during 2018-19.

3.07 lakh Gramin Dak Sevaks will be benefitted by this wage revision.

Details:


	Time Related Continuity allowance (TRCA) structure and slabs have been rationalised.  The total GDSs have been brought under two categories viz. Branch Postmasters (BPMs) and other than Branch Postmasters namely Assistant Branch Postmaster (ABPMs).
	The present 11 TRCA slabs will be merged into only three TRCA Slabs with two levels each for BPMs and other than BPMs.
	Introduction of new Time Related Continuity Allowance (TRCA) will be as below:


 


	
		
			
			Minimum TRCA of two types of proposed categories of GDSs as per working hours / levels
			
		
		
			
			S.No.

			 
			
			
			Category

			 
			
			
			Minimum TRCA for 4 Hours / Level 1

			 
			
			
			Minimum TRCA for 5 Hours / Level 2

			 
			
		
		
			
			1

			 
			
			
			BPM

			 
			
			
			Rs. 12000/-

			 
			
			
			Rs. 14500/-

			 
			
		
		
			
			2

			 
			
			
			ABPM/Dak Sevaks

			 
			
			
			Rs. 10000/-

			 
			
			
			Rs. 12000/-

			 
			
		
	


 


	Dearness Allowance will continue to be paid as a separate component, and also revised from time to time whenever it is revised for Central Government Servants.
	It is decided to continue the calculation of the ex-gratia bonus by applying the calculation ceiling of Rs.7000 as basic TRCA + DA till such time a new scheme is devised.
	Arrears for the period 1.1.2016 to the date of implementation will be paid by increasing the basic TRCA drawn during the period by a factor of 2.57. The arrears will be paid in one instalment.



	vii. Annual increase at the rate of 3% and the same may be given on 1st January or 1st July of every year as the case may be based on the one time written request of GDSs.



	A new Risk and hardship Allowance has been introduced. Other allowances Viz. Office maintenance allowance, Combined duty allowance, Cash conveyance charges, Cycle maintenance allowance, Boat allowance and Fixed Stationery Charges have been revised.


 

Implementation strategy and targets:

The revision would result in improving the wages, allowances and discharge benefits of Gramin Dak Sevaks resulting in providing efficient & cost-effective basic postal facilities in the rural area. The proposed increased emoluments will enable him to improve his socio-economic standing.

 

Impact:

The Branch Post Offices are the fulcrum for provision of Communications and financial services in the village and are located in remote areas. The Post Master has to deal with large sums while making payments to customers; hence accountability is already built into his work. The enhanced remuneration will increase the sense of responsibility. Moreover, with the roll out of the India Post Payment Bank (IPPB), the CDS network is expected to play a key role in the process of financial inclusion of the rural population.

 

Background:

The Extra Departmental system in the Department of Posts was established more than150 years ago to provide basic, economical and efficient postal services in the rural areas where there was no justification for engaging full time regular employees. One Lakh Twenty-Nine Thousand Three Hundred forty-six (1,29,346) Extra-departmental Branch post offices are primarily manned by Gramin Dak Sevak Branch Postmasters. In addition, Gramin Dak Sevaks other than Branch Postmasters are also working in Branch, Sub and Head Post offices. The main features of the engagement of Gramin Dak Sevaks are that they work for part time ranging from 3 to 5 hours per day and supplement their income from other vocations so as to have adequate means of livelihood for themselves and their families. They remain in service up to the age of 65 years.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has approved the revised guidelines of the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) on time bound closure of sick/ loss making Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and disposal of movable and immovable assets. The revised guidelines would reduce delays in implementation of closure plans of sick/loss making CPSEs.  These guidelines will replace the guidelines issued by DPE in September, 2016. 

 

These guidelines provide a broad framework for expeditious completion of various processes and procedures for closure of CPSEs by laying down important milestones in the closure process along with timelines, outlining the responsibilities of the concerned Ministries/ Departments/ CPSE, etc., in the process. The guidelines provide for advance preparatory action to be taken by administrative Ministry/ Department and CPSEs, preparation of closure proposal, settlement of statutory and other liabilities of the CPSE under closure and modalities for disposal of movable and immovable assets of such CPSEs in a time bound manner. 

 

The guidelines give first priority for utilization of land of CPSEs under closure for Affordable Housing as per the relevant guidelines of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). Since there are employees working in these CPSEs, Government decided that closure should not cause hardship to them and has now laid down a uniform policy to give workers VRS at 2007 notional pay scale irrespective of the pay scale in which they are working.

 

These guidelines shall apply to all sick/ loss making CPSEs, where – 


	Approval/ in principle approval for closure has been obtained by administrative Ministry/ Department from the CCEA/ Cabinet; or 
	the process for obtaining the approval of the competent authority is underway after the administrative Ministry/ Department has decided for the closure of the CPSE.


 

By assigning priority to Affordable Housing it would make available land parcels of sick/loss making CPSEs under closure for the Government flagship programme of Affordable Housing being managed by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Mechanism for procurement of ethanol by Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to carry out the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme- Revision of ethanol price for supply to Public Sector OMCs.

Now, CCEA has approved  the following for the forthcoming sugar season 2018-19 during ethanol supply period from 1st December 2018 to 30th November 2019:


	To fix the ex-mill price of ethanol derived out of C heavy molasses to Rs.43.70 per litre (from prevailing price of Rs.40.85 per litre). Additionally, GST and transportation charges will also be payable.
	To fix ex-mill price of ethanol derived from B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice at Rs.47.49 per litre.  Additionally, GST and transportation charges will also be payable.
	As the price of ethanol is based on estimated FRP for sugar season 2018-19, it will be modified by MoP&NG as per actual Fair & Remunerative Price (FRP) declared by the Government.
	For ethanol supply year 2019-20, ethanol prices will be modified by MoP&NG as per normative cost of molasses and sugar derived from FRP of sugarcane.


All distilleries will be able to take benefit of the scheme and large number of them are expected to supply ethanol for the EBP programme. Remunerative price to ethanol suppliers will help in reduction of cane farmer's arrears, in the process contributing to minimizing difficulty of sugarcane farmers.

Ethanol availability for EBP Programme is expected to increase significantly due to higher price for C heavy molasses based ethanol and enabling procurement of ethanol from B heavy molasses and sugarcane juice for first time. Increased ethanol blending in petrol has many benefits including reduction in import dependency, support to agricultural sector, more environmental friendly fuel, lesser pollution and additional income to farmers.

Government has  notified administered  price of ethanol since 2014. This

decision has significantly improved the supply of ethanol during the past four years. The ethanol procured by Public Sector OMCs has increased from 38 crore litre in ethanol supply year 2013-14 to estimated 140 crore litre in 2017-18.

The sugarcane and sugar production in this sugar season is very high leading to   dampening   of sugar prices.   Consequently, sugarcane farmers’ dues have increased due to lower capability of sugar industry to pay the farmers. Government has taken many decisions for reduction of farmer's dues.          

As realization from ethanol is also one of the components in revenue of sugar mills/distilleries, Government has decided to review the price of ethanol derived out of C heavy molasses.

Government is also deciding the price of B heavy molasses and Sugarcane juice for the first time which is likely to positively impact the capability of sugar industry to pay farmers dues and increase availability of ethanol for EBP Programme. This is also in line with the National Policy on Biofuels -- 2018 announced by the Government during May, 2018 which has widened the scope of raw material for ethanol production.

Background:

Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme was launched by the Government in 2003 on pilot basis which has been subsequently extended to the Notified 21 States and 4 Union Territories to promote the use of alternative and environmental friendly fuels. This intervention also seeks to reduce import dependency for energy requirements and give boost to agriculture sector.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the capital infusion of Rs.2000 crore for strengthening of  Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC).  The amount would be infused in the three financial years i.e. Rs.50 crore in 2017-18, Rs.1450 crore in the year 2018-19 and Rs.500 crore for 2019-20.

The infusion would enhance insurance coverage to MSME exports and strengthen India’s exports to emerging and challenging markets like Africa, CIS and Latin American countries.  With enhanced capital, ECGC’s underwriting capacity and risk to capital ratio will improve considerably.  With a stronger underwriting capacity, ECGC will be in a better position to support Indian exporters to tap new and unexplored markets.  Increased capital infusion will help ECGC to diversify its product portfolio and provide cost effective credit insurance helping exporters to gain a stronger foothold in the difficult markets.  Covers from ECGC will help in improving competitive positon of India exporters in International markets.  More than 85% of customers benefitted by ECGC’s covers are MSMEs.  ECGC covers exports to around 200 countries in the world.

Background:

ECGC is a premier export credit agency of the Government of India to provide Export Credit Insurance Services to facilitate exports from the country.  The ECGC offers credit insurance schemes to exporters to protect them against losses due to non-payment of export dues by overseas buyers due to political and / or commercial risks.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for implementation of Phase-Ill of Off-grid and Decentralised Solar PV (Photo Voltaic) Application Programme to achieve additional 118 MWp(Mega Watt peak) off-grid solar PV capacity by 2020.

Phase-Ill of Off-grid and Decentralised Solar PV Application Programme covers following components:

i)   Solar Street Lights: 3,00,000 numbers of solar street lights will be installed throughout the country with special emphasis on areas where there is no facility for street lighting systems through grid power, North Eastern States and Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts.

ii) Stand-alone Solar Power Plants: Solar power plants of individual size up to 25 kWp(kilo Watt peak) will be promoted in areas where grid power has not reached or is not reliable. This component is mainly aimed at providing electricity to schools, hostels, panchayats, police stations and other public service institutions. The aggregated capacity of solar power plants would be 100 MWp.

iii) Solar Study Lamps: 25,00,000 numbers of solar study lamps will be provided in North Eastern States and LWE affected districts.

For solar street lights and solar power plants, financial support up to 30% of the benchmark cost of the system will be provided except for NE States, Hill States and Island UTs where up to 90% of the benchmark cost will be provided. For solar study lamps only 15% of the lamp cost to be borne by beneficiary student and balance will be provided as financial support as such systems will be provided to school going children in backward and remote areas. 

The total project of the three components included under the phase-Ill is Rs. 1895 crore of which Rs. 637 crore will be provided as central financial assistance.

The off-grid solar systems will also open better livelihood opportunities for beneficiaries in rural and remote areas thereby increasing self-employment in such areas. It is estimated that, besides increasing self-employment, the implementation of Phase-Ill is likely to generate employment opportunity equivalent to 8.67 lakh man-days for skilled and unskilled workers.

Off-grid and Decentralized Solar PV Applications Programme has high impact in the rural and remote areas of the country where grid power has either not reached or is not reliable. During the Phase-Ill, the programme is likely to benefit 40 lakh rural households. In addition, the off-grid solar power plants proposed in the programme to provide electricity to schools, hostels, panchayats, police stations and other public service institutions will help communities at large and also help in increasing participation of women in education, social and livelihood activities.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, approved the project for construction of 9.9 km long new 6 - lane bridge across river Ganga on NH - 96 at Phaphamau in Allahabad with total capital cost of Rs. 1948.25 crore. 

The construction period for the project is three years and likely to be completed by December, 2021. The new bridge will resolve the traffic congestion on existing old 2 - lane Phaphamau bridge on NH-96 at Allahabad.

The new bridge will also facilitate to the large congregation of people at Holy City Allahabad during Kumbh, Ardh-Kumbh and other yearly ritual baths at SANGAM in Prayag. This will give a boost to pilgrimage tourism and local economy of Holy city of Prayag.

This new 6 - lane bridge will also be beneficial for the Lucknow / Faizabad bound traffic coming from Madhya Pradesh via National Highway - 27 and National Highway - 76 through Naini Bridge.

In addition, this project of new bridge will generate direct employment during construction for about 9.20 lakh mandays.

At present all the Allahabad bound traffic coming from National Highway - 96, National Highway - 24 B, Asian Highway -1 and other local highways are using the existing old 2 - lane bridge at Phaphamau for crossing the River Ganga. There is no entry for goods vehicles on this bridge from 06 am to 11 pm. The present traffic on the old bridge is about 40,000 PCUs (Passenger Car Units) which is manifold greater than its designed capacity of 15,000 PCUs (Passenger Car Units), resulting in severe jam over bridge all around the day and night. This new 6 - lane bridge will decongest the old bridge and will also ensure fast and safe movement for traffic.          

Background:

It may be noted that there were only 13 bridges on river Ganges between Allahabad to Farakka before May'2014. After 2014, additional 20 bridges were planned, out of which five have been opened to traffic and seven are under construction on the above stretch, thus bringing the total number of bridges to 33.  Out of balance 8 bridges, which are planned for construction, work on Farakka, Sahebganj and Mokarnah is likely to start very soon. The present Phaphamau bridge would be therefore 29th Bridge on river Ganges between Allahabad and Farakka.

                In order to improve the problem of liquidity of sugar mills resulting in accumulation of huge cane price arrears of farmers, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the following measures involving total amount of about Rs. 7000 crore:


	Creation of buffer stock of 30 LMT of sugar for one year and to incur estimated expenditure of Rs.1175 crore for this purpose. However, based on the market price and availability of sugar, this may be reviewed by Department of Food & Public Distribution(DFPD) any time. The reimbursement under the scheme would be made on quarterly basis which would be directly credited into farmers’ account on behalf of mills against their cane price dues.
	To notify Sugar Price (Control) Order, 2018 under Essential Commodities Act, 1955 to fix minimum selling price of white/refined sugar at the mill gate below which no white/refined sugar can be sold and delivered by a sugar mill in the domestic market. Fixation of minimum selling price of white sugar would be based on Fair Remunerative Price (FRP) of cane and minimum conversion cost of white/refined sugar. The minimum selling price of white/refined sugar shall be initially fixed at Rs.29/kg which can be revised by DFPD subsequently based on revision of FRP etc. This will not affect availability of sugar to consumers at reasonable price and Government will put in place a mechanism to ensure that the retail prices of sugar are kept fully under control. At present, this would be done along with imposition of stock holding limits on sugar mills. The stock limit on mills will be initially imposed for the current sugar season (up to September 2018), which may be reviewed by DFPD at any time.
	To augment capacity through up-gradation of existing distilleries attached to sugar mills by installing incineration boilers and setting up new distilleries in sugar mills; government will bear interest subvention of maximum Rs.1332 crore over a period of five years including moratorium period of one year on estimated bank loan amounting to Rs.4440 crore to be sanctioned to the sugar mills by the banks over a period of three years for which DFPD would formulate a detailed scheme in this regard. This would help diversion of sugar during surplus phase to reduce excess inventories. 


Background:

Excess production during the current Sugar Season and indication of higher production in the ensuing Sugar Season has been continuously depressing the market price of sugar. Due to the depressed market sentiments and crash in sugar prices, the liquidity position of the sugar mills has been adversely affected leading to accumulation of cane price dues which has already reached to an alarming level of more than Rs.22000 crore.

In order to stabilize sugar production at reasonable level with a view to improve the liquidity position of the mills thereby enabling them to clear the cane price arrears of farmers, Central Government has taken the following steps in past four months:

(i)    Increased custom duty on import of sugar from 50% to 100% to check any import to the country.

(ii)    Imposed stock holding limits on producers of sugar for the months of February and March, 2018 to stabilise the domestic sugar price.

 

(iii)   Withdrawn custom duty on export of sugar to encourage sugar industry to start exploring possibility of export of sugar. 

(iv)   Allocated mill-wise Minimum Indicative Export Quotas (MIEQ) of 20 LMT of sugar for export during Sugar Season 2017-18.

(v)   Re-introduced Duty Free Import Authorization (DFIA) Scheme in respect of sugar to facilitate and incentivize export of surplus sugar by sugar mills.

(vi)   Extended financial assistance to sugar mills @ Rs.5.50/qtl of cane crushed during 2017-18 Sugar Season to offset the cost of cane.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has stated that the way to lead a calm, creative & content life is Yoga. “It can show the way in defeating tensions and mindless anxiety. Instead of dividing, Yoga unites.” He was addressing the main event of the 4th International day of Yoga, which was celebrated at the Forest Research Institute(FRI) in Dehradun here today.

 During his address the Prime Minister further said that, “Instead of increasing suffering, Yoga heals. Yoga is beautiful because it is ancient yet modern, it is constant yet evolving. It has the best of our past and presents and a ray of hope for our future. In Yoga, we have the perfect solution to the problems we face, either as individuals or in our society. The world has embraced Yoga and glimpses of this can be seen in the manner in which International Day of Yoga has been marked every year. In fact, Yoga Day has become one of the biggest mass movements in the quest for good health and well-being.”.

 

More than 50000 people performed yoga on the sprawling FRI lawns in the event. Yoga enthusiasts across India and from several countries took their places to demonstrate the ancient practice. This was just one of the numerous places across the world marking the 4th International Day of Yoga. In his opening remarks Uttarakhand Chief minister stated that Yoga is not only a movement towards wellness but holistic happiness.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been appraised of the Implementing Arrangement (IA) for Pre-formulation Studies of a Maritime Domain Awareness Mission signed between India and France on 10th March 2018.

    The proposed joint mission will be devoted to maritime domain awareness, with the objective to provide relevant data and services to both nations. The objective is to monitor the maritime traffic and to identify the non-compliant ships at the maximum possible revisit frequency. The monitoring system would provide an end to end solution for detection, identification, monitoring of vessels in the regions of interest for India and France.

    As per the IA, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and Centre Nationale Dètudes     Spatiales (CNES), France will jointly undertake various activities during these pre-formulation studies and present the pre-formulation concept study results to the respective senior management for review within one year of its signing.

                A Team of scientists and engineers led by Prof. Abhijit Chakraborty of Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, discovered a sub-Saturn or super-neputune size planet (mass of about 27 Earth Mass and size of 6 Earth Radii) around a Sun-like star. The planet will be known as EPIC 211945201b or K2-236b.

The Research work has appeared online in Astronomical Journal of the American Astronomical Society and published by IOP publishing (the DOI of the article is 10.3847/1538-3881 /aac436).

The discovery was made by measuring the mass of the planet using the indigenously designed “PRL Advance Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search” (PARAS) spectrograph integrated with 1.2m Telescope at PRL's Gurushikhar Observatory in Mount Abu, India. Only 23 such planetary systems (including this discovery) are known to this date with masses between 10 and 70 Earth mass and size of 4 to 8 Earth radii with such precise measurement of mass This discovery is very important for understanding the formation mechanism of such super-Neptune or sub-Saturn kind of planets, that are too close to the host star and as well as planet formations around Sun-like stars.

With this discovery, India has joined a handful of countries, which have discovered planets around stars beyond our solar system. Further, PARAS is the first of its kind spectrograph in Asia, which can measure the mass of a planet going around a star. Very few spectrographs exist around the world that can do such precise measurements.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) Continuation Programme (Phase 6)  and funding of thirty PSLV operational flights under the Programme.

The Programme will also meet the launch requirement of satellites for Earth observation, Navigation and Space Sciences. This will also ensure the continuity of production in Indian industry.  

The total fund requirement is Rs. 6131.00 Crores and includes the cost of thirty PSLV vehicles, essential facility augmentation, Programme Management and Launch Campaign.

Major Impact:

          The operationalisation of PSLV has made the country self-reliant in the launching capability of satellites for earth observation, disaster management, navigation and space sciences. The PSLV Continuation programme will sustain this capability and self-reliance in the launching of similar satellites for national requirements.

The PSLV Continuation Programme – Phase 6 will meet the demand for the launch of satellites at a frequency up to eight launches per year, with maximal participation by the Indian industry. All the operational flights would be completed during the period 2019-2024.

The Programme will also meet the launch requirement of satellites for Earth observation, Navigation and Space Sciences. This will also ensure the continuity of production in Indian industry.  

PSLV Continuation Programme was initially sanctioned in 2008, and four phases have been completed and the fifth phase is expected to be completed by Q2 of 2019-20. The Phase 6 approval will cater to the launch of satellite missions during the period Q3 of 2019-20 to Q1 of 2023-24.

 

Background:

PSLV has emerged as a versatile launch vehicle to carry out Sun-Synchronous Polar Orbit (SSPO), Geo-synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) and low inclination Low Earth Orbit (LEO) missions. With the recent successful launch of PSLV-C41 on 12th April, 2018, PSLV has completed three developmental and forty three operational flights and the last forty one flights have been successful. PSLV has established itself as a workhorse vehicle for national satellites with a production capacity that would enable responding fast to commercial launch opportunities also.

                During the bye-election to 2-Kairana and 11-Bhandara-Gondiya Parliamentary Constituencies on 28th May 2018, malfunctioning of a few VVPAT machines was reported during the mock poll and actual poll. To ascertain the causes of failure, the Commission deputed two Special Teams. The preliminary fact finding reports submitted to the Commission, have indicated two major technical reasons for the malfunctioning, namely: -


	Failure of Contrast Sensor (error 2.2)
	Failure of length sensor (error 2.4)


The above errors are mainly caused by excessive exposure to illumination in the Polling Station.

The Commission has asked the manufacturers and the Technical Expert Committee to suggest additional design improvements as well as suggestions on any layout changes in the polling stations to prevent any excessive exposure to illumination in future. Manufacturers have also been asked to do a detailed technical analysis once the VVPATs are free from Election Petition (as these cannot be currently accessed in Strong Rooms till 45 days Election Petition period is over). 

The Commission has decided to reiterate its SOPs regarding Do’s and Don’t’s and have also formed a Committee to examine further strengthening of the SOPs. The Commission has also decided to make the First Level Checking process stricter. The Commission has also adopted the hardware improvement recommended by TEC to prevent auto shutdown of VVPATs due to excessive light. The Commission has directed that the training of the polling officials be further strengthened and streamlined, so that failures due to human errors are minimized.

                The Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh met Mr. Suhrob Kholmuradov, Deputy Prime Minister, Uzbekistan and Chairman of the State Investment Committee in Krishi Bhawan, New Delhi today and sought to strengthen bilateral cooperation in agriculture and allied sectors. 

Union Agriculture Minister reiterated India’s tremendous progress in the agriculture sector and its commitment to double farmers’ income by 2022 through a series of reforms, namely Soil Health Card, Organic Farming, Crop insurance, irrigation, eNAM etc.  He said India has become one of the most preferred investment destinations of the world.

Shri Singh said, “We are ready to partner with Uzbekistan in providing training and sharing expertise in skill development, effective and optimum use of water for dry lands, integrated farming systems, mechanization and farm machinery,” adding India can provide training to Uzbekistan for the development of Green House with the help of Centre of Excellence (CoE).

India is currently importing moong, natural gum, walnut, chickpeas, and juices from Uzbekistan. The Union Minister urged Mr. Suhrob to also consider importing mango, potato, wheat, meslin, sugar etc. from India.

Shri Singh stressed on the importance of constitution of agricultural clusters for small and marginal farmers and fragmented land holdings and offered to share India’s experience in the formation of FPOs and cooperatives in order to ensure better returns to farmers. He also assured the Deputy Prime Minister that the revised draft agreement on cooperation in the field of Plant Quarantine as proposed by Uzbekistan is under active consideration.

The Minister also called for the need to promote interaction among government agricultural institutions, experts, scientists and agro business. He further expressed interest to work together in the area of animal husbandry and was willing to assist in setting up food processing industries in Uzbekistan.

In the inaugural Ministerial meeting of India-Nepal “New Partnership in Agriculture”, the two Ministers discussed ways to strengthen cooperation in the agriculture sector such as agricultural research and education, arrangement for supply of fertilizers, mutual recognition of inspection, testing and certification system, trade facilitation measures, strengthening livestock services, veterinary research and development facilities, and promoting exchanges between the India Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC). 

The Agriculture Minister also expressed happiness that a pilot project on organic farming and soil health for implementation by India in Nepal has also been finalized. 

Shri Singh further added that India will be happy to share with Nepal its experiences in implementing new initiatives for enhancing agricultural productivity and welfare of farmers. Initiatives like Soil Health Card, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna, eNAM, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna etc. have been yielding positive results, he said, expressing hope that the visiting delegation gained fruitful knowledge that will help improve the respective areas of agriculture and allied sectors in Nepal. 

Mr. Chakra Pani Khanal, Minister for Agriculture, Land Management and Cooperatives, Nepal, who is on a five day visit from June 19-23, 2018, will visit Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa and National Centre of Organic Farming, Ghaziabad. 

On Mr. Khanal’s invitation, Union Agriculture Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh will visit Nepal for the next “New Partnership in Agriculture” meeting. 

The Minister reaffirmed his commitment to making the partnership a success. 

The Prime Ministers of India and Nepal had launched the “New Partnership in Agriculture” on April 7, 2018 to increase bilateral cooperation in agricultural sector for the benefit of farmers of both the nations.

                The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED), which procures pulses, oilseeds and onion from farmers, procured 31.91 lakh metric tonnes of pulses and oilseeds in 2017-18 thereby benefitting over 20 lakh farmers. Money was directly transferred to farmers’ accounts. NAFED registered record numbers on other financial parameters and in 2018-19, it is expected to earn record profit.

It is worth mentioning that Nafed was financially drained during the previous government. Irregularities had pushed it into a financial crisis and the institution was on the verge of closure with lawsuits piling up. The federation had procured only 8 lakh metric tonnes of pulses and oilseeds from farmers in the last four years (2011-14) of the UPA government. Owing to the efficient leadership of the NDA government, 64 lakh metric tonnes of pulses and oilseeds were procured at Minimum Support Price (MSP) from farmers in 2014-18, thereby showing a remarkable increase. 

It was imperative for the government to save Nafed and ensure procurement at MSP in order to help farmers. On the advice of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the bank guarantee of Nafed was increased to Rs 42,000 crore with immediate effect. The bank guarantee during the UPA government was only Rs 200-250 crore. 

The result of the reforms has been very positive. In the three crop seasons in the middle of 2011-13, Nafed could not procure anything but is now making record purchases. For this, the government did away with 15 per cent compensation in the MSP norm, which existed in previous government on account of complete loss. With the availability of bank guarantee to Nafed, it was possible to make record purchase from farmers. Reflecting the results of financial discipline and improvement, NAFED paid Rs 220 crore to the banks from its earnings.

 Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh expressed hope that Nafed will continue to make record purchase from farmers and said that the government is committed to improving the condition and working of Nafed.

                National Farmers Commission was constituted in February 2004. After that, the National Policy for Farmers was approved on the basis of the Commission's recommendations in the country, which aimed at improving the economic condition of agricultural sector as well as the net income of the farmers. Most of the recommendations had been left in the cold storage during the UPA government. As soon as Prime Minister Narendra Modi led government came to power, an inter-ministerial committee was set up to examine the increase of income of farmers and to accelerate these initiatives. While studying this, the committee started the task of accelerating this work under the direction of Hon'ble Prime Minister, which is as follows -

(A) Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016 issued to States, which is a very important step in terms of agricultural reforms through which not only the needs of landlords but the needs of the lease holders are also taken care of. Through this act, land holders can legally lease the land with mutual consent for agriculture and allied sectors. It is also noted that under any circumstances, no claim on the agricultural land of the lease holder will be valid.

From the point of view of the lease recipient, it has been taken care that it is provided institutional credit, insurance and disaster relief, so that they can invest more and more agriculture.

(B) In April 2016, a new entrance process for revolutionizing agricultural markets started by introducing transparency and competition, by ensuring better value search under national agricultural market scheme (e-NAM).

(C) Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Simplification) Act, 2017 has been released on April 24, 2017 for adoption by the States/UTs. Which comprises of e-business, the announcement of warehouses, silos, cold storage in the form of sub-yard, rationalization of mandis duty and commission charges and improvements in private sector.

In 2018, an amount of two thousand crores rupees has also been proposed through NABARD for the development of 22,000 rural agricultural markets in the country. It is clear here that in relation to the National Agricultural Market, the implementation of the suggestion given after the year 2004 was also done within these 4 years.

(D) Government has revised them after a detailed study of old schemes and has started the world's largest farmer friendly crop insurance scheme i.e. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme. By 2019-20, 50 percent of the gross cropped area is to be covered.

(E) Enhanced substantial increase in the adoption of micro irrigation has been recorded. Compound annual growth rate of micro irrigation (MI) coverage is 15 percent. During the year 2017-18, about 9.26 lakh hectare area has been brought under MI, which is the maximum coverage so far received in a calendar year. The target is to cover 1.5 to 2 million hectare per year by year 2022-23. In addition to the increase in budgetary allocation, a corpus fund of 5,000 crore has also been set up.

(F) National Agro-Forestry Policy has been prepared for increasing the income of farmers and for achieving climate support. During the year 2016-17, a special scheme ""Agriculture Forestry Sub-mission"" was started and operated with the aim of ""Har Medh Par Pedh"". Exemption in transit regulations for assistance under the Agriculture Forestry Sub-Mission is a pre-requisite. 21 states (8 states in year 2016-17 and 12 states in the year 2017-18) have given exemption to this regulation and all the states are being motivated in this direction.

(G) The reconstituted National Bamboo Mission- National Bamboo Mission (NBM) was initially started as a centrally sponsored scheme in the year 2006-07 and brought it under the Integrated Horticulture Development Mission (MIDH) during the year 2014-15. And was continued till the year 2015-16.

This scheme is mainly limited to the cultivation and promotion of bamboo due to limited weather and purification units and bamboo market. The main drawbacks of this scheme were lack of contact between producers (farmers) and industries.

The Indian Forest Act, 1927 was amended last year, from which the bamboo sown outside the forest area has been removed from the definition of 'trees' and the implementation of National Bamboo Mission reorganized with the outlay of Rs.1290 crore is also being done.

(H) Government has started the largest Universal Soil Health Card scheme in the world to provide information on the fertility of the land to the farmers on the basis of tested soil samples according to 12 parameters.

A study shows that due to the recommendations of the Soil Health Card, due to the application of fertilizer and micro nutrients, a decrease of chemical fertilizer application has been found ranging from 8 to 10 percent and the total crop production has increased by 5-6 percent. 

(I) Traditional Agricultural Development Scheme (PKVY) - PKVY is being implemented with the objective of encouraging organic farming in the country. It will improve soil health and biological content and increase the net income of farmers so that premium values can be identified. The progress of targeted 50 acres (2015-16 to 2017-18) is remarkable. Now it has been started on cluster base (about 1000 hectares).

It is worth noting that on the recommendation of National Farmers Commission to promote sustainable agriculture, it was also institutionally and systematically implemented at the time of the Modi Government.

(J) Central Regional Scheme has been introduced by identifying the potential of organic farming in the North Eastern Region of the country. Biological Value Chain Development Mission (MOVCDNER) for the North East Region. The Northeast is being developed as the biological center of India.

(K) The present government has released Model Contract Farming and Services Act, 2018 in 2018, which for the first time has been added to the country's food additives farmers and agro-based industries. Through this act, where a young farmer can get good prices for the farmers, the losses will also be reduced after harvesting. Besides, employment opportunities will also be created in rural areas. Through this, FPA / FPC will be promoted.

(L) In the year 2003-2005, the scientists of this country had said that 100% neem coated to coated urea was also lying in cold storage which was completed in two years after the arrival of the Narendra Modi led NDA government.

There is also a provision of providing Nakul Swasthaya Patra to the animals under the scheme. So far one Crore animals have already been identified till date.  

Under advanced reproductive techniques, 20 Embryo Transfer centres are being established against which proposals for 18 centres have been approved.  10 semen centres have been identified for production of Sex Sorted Semen.

                Union Minister of State for Chemicals & Fertilizers, Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya, launched the ‘JANAUSHADHI SUVIDHA’, the Oxo-biodegradable Sanitary Napkin, under the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP), here today. The affordable sanitary napkins will now become available at over 3600 Janaushadhi Kendras functional in 33 States/UTs across India, as promised by Union Minister, Chemical & Fertilizers and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Ananthkumar on March 8, 2018 (World Women’s day).

Shri Mandaviya said that this is a special gift for all Women on the eve of World Environment day, as this unique product would ensure Affordability, Hygiene as well as Ease of use and disposal for them. Jan Aushadhi Suvidha comes with a special additive, which makes it biodegradable when it comes in contact with oxygen after being discarded. This would ensure ‘Swachhta, Swasthya and Suvidha’ for the underprivileged Women of India and go a long way in the achievement of Prime Minster Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of Affordable and Quality Healthcare for All, the Minister added.

Emphasizing upon the affordability aspect of SUVIDHA, Shri Mandaviya said that the average price of sanitary napkins available in the market today is around Rs. 8 per pad, whereas now with the launch of the SUVIDHA napkins at Rs. 2.50 per pad, this will go a long way in making the basic hygiene requirement aid for Women affordable for the underprivileged sections.

Shri Mandaviya noted that this is one of the most important requirement in ensuring the Health Security to that section of Women in India who still use unhygienic aids during menstrual period due to non-affordability of some of the popular brands of sanitary napkins available in the market today. Such unhygienic aids cause fungal infections, Reproductive Tract Infection, Urinary Tract Infection, Cervical cancer and also make women vulnerable to infertility. 

According to the National Family Health Survey 2015-16, about 58 percent of women aged between 15 to 24 years use locally prepared napkins, sanitary napkins and tampons. Further, about 78 percent women in urban areas use hygienic methods of protection during menstrual period; only 48 percent women in rural areas have access to clean sanitary napkins.

Other dignitaries present on the occasion included Shri Navdeep Rinwa, Joint Secretary, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Shri Sachin Singh, CEO, Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (BPPI), along with other senior officers of the Ministry.

                Increased coal production will help in realising Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of 24x7 Affordable ‘Power for All’, which is a part of the New India vision by 2022

 

105 MT increase in coal production in 4 years (2014-18) took almost 7 years to achieve before 2013-14

 

Specific coal consumption (amount of coal required per unit of electricity) has reduced by 8% in the last 4 years

 

The reforms in the country’s coal sector have contributed to enhancing energy capacity, efficiency, and security showcasing Government’s philosophy of Saaf Niyat, Sahi Vikas

 

89 Coal Mines have been transparently auctioned and allotted with 100% revenues to coal bearing States, which will help these States to ensure economic development especially for the socio-economically backward and aspirational districts

 

Under SHAKTI - 16 Fuel Supply Agreements have been signed. 45.18 MTPA has been transparently auctioned to non-regulated sector.

 

Commercial Coal Mining, most ambitious coal sector reform ever, will help in creating direct and indirect employment through higher investment and better technology

 

Government has also focused on better transportation through synergies between Coal and Railways Ministries. Coal loading of Coal India has increased from 195 rakes per day in 2014-15 to 230 rakes per day in 2017-18. Timelines for time-bound execution have been set for 14 critical projects for evacuating coal

 

Union Minister for Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal addressed the media on achievements in the last four years of Ministries under his charge, today in the presence of Shri Manoj Sinha, Union Minister of State of Communications (Independent Charge) and Minister of State of Railways.

The Minister also talked about how the Ministry has worked for ensuring superior coal quality. Third party sampling procedure have been put in a place. UTTAM App has been launched for ensuring transparency and efficiency in coal quality monitoring process. Re-gradation of all the mines of Coal India Ltd and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) has been done by Coal Controller’s Organization (CCO). Focus has been on the cost of electricity through lower cost and higher quality, and the Specific Coal Consumption (amount of coal required per unit of electricity) has reduced by 8% in the last 4 years.

 

The reforms in the country’s coal sector have contributed to enhancing energy capacity, efficiency, and security showcasing Government’s philosophy of “Saaf Niyat, Sahi Vikas”. Commercial Coal Mining the most ambitious reform in Coal sector, has been approved by the Government, and will help in creating direct and indirect employment through higher investment and better technology. 89 Coal Mines have been transparently auctioned and allotted with 100% revenues to coal bearing States. The additional revenue generated will help these States to ensure economic development especially for the socio-economically backward and aspirational districts.

 

Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala Transparently in India (SHAKTI), for auction and allotment of coal linkages, will lead to affordable power and transparency in allocation of coal. 16 Fuel Supply Agreements have been signed under this scheme. 45.18 MTPA has been transparently auctioned to non-regulated sector.

 

Government has also focused on better transportation through synergies between Coal and Railways Ministries. Coal linkage rationalization in power sector resulted in total coal movement rationalization of 55.66 MT with annual potential savings of Rs. 3,359 Crore. 

 

Coal loading of Coal India has increased from 195 rakes per day in 2014-15 to 230 rakes per day in 2017-18.

Speaking at Renewable Energy Dialogue in New Delhi today, Suresh Prabhu said that India has set a target of achieving 40% of its total electricity generation non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. He said that International Solar Alliance is sending positive market signals therefore all countries want to invest in renewables encouraging new technologies to be made available thereby promoting financial investments in renewables. 

He further said that the Government of India’s target of installing 20 GW of solar power by 2022 was achieved four years of ahead of schedule in January, 2018 through solar parks and India has set a fresh target of achieving 100 GW of solar power by 2022.

The Dialogue brought together several national and international stakeholders from the renewable energy community to deliberate on the drivers and challenges facing the sector, both in India and globally. Independent studies on scaling up rooftop solar panels, clean energy investment trends, addressing renewable energy curtailment, and risks in renewable energy markets in emerging economies were released at the Dialogue.

The Renewable Energy Dialogue was organised by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) in collaboration with Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), International Solar Alliance (ISA), International Energy Agency (IEA), Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation (SSEF), and REN21. This edition of the Dialogue had a special focus on market creation and market trends.

Suresh Prabhulaunching mobile application ReUnite to track and trace missing children

 

Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu today launched a mobile application called ReUnite which helps to trackandtrace missing and abandoned children in India. Speaking on this occasion the Minister appreciated the work being done by the NGO,BachpanBachaoAndolan&Capgemini for developing this app.

The Minister said that this effort to reunite parents whose children have gone missing is a wonderful use of technology to address real life social challenges.

The app is multiuser where parents and citizens can upload pictures of children, and provide detailed description like name, birth mark, address, report to the police station, search and identify missing kids. The photographs will not be saved in the mobile phone’s physical memory. AmazonRekognition, web facialrecognition service, is being used to identify missing kids. The app is available for both Android and iOS.

BachpanBachaoAndolan, (BBA) is India’s largest movement for the protection of children and works along with law enforcement agencies and policymakers. BBA has played a very important role in formulation of several lawsfor protection of child’s rights. It began from the Nithari case in 2006 which finally culminated with the Supreme Court passing the landmark judgement in 2013 ordering that FIR has to be lodged in all cases of missing children. 

Nobel Laureate and founder of BachpanBachaoAndolan, Kailash Satyarthi, was alsopresent on this occasion.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the capital infusion of Rs.2000 crore for strengthening of  Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC).  The amount would be infused in the three financial years i.e. Rs.50 crore in 2017-18, Rs.1450 crore in the year 2018-19 and Rs.500 crore for 2019-20.

The infusion would enhance insurance coverage to MSME exports and strengthen India’s exports to emerging and challenging markets like Africa, CIS and Latin American countries.  With enhanced capital, ECGC’s underwriting capacity and risk to capital ratio will improve considerably.  With a stronger underwriting capacity, ECGC will be in a better position to support Indian exporters to tap new and unexplored markets.  Increased capital infusion will help ECGC to diversify its product portfolio and provide cost effective credit insurance helping exporters to gain a stronger foothold in the difficult markets.  Covers from ECGC will help in improving competitive positon of India exporters in International markets.  More than 85% of customers benefitted by ECGC’s covers are MSMEs.  ECGC covers exports to around 200 countries in the world.

Background:

ECGC is a premier export credit agency of the Government of India to provide Export Credit Insurance Services to facilitate exports from the country.  The ECGC offers credit insurance schemes to exporters to protect them against losses due to non-payment of export dues by overseas buyers due to political and / or commercial risks.

                On June 30, 2018, livestock of sheep and goat will be exported for the first time to Sharjah from Nagpur airport. Around 1 lakh sheep and goat will be exported over a period of three months from the Nagpur airport. This project is taking off due to the joint efforts of Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN), Air India, Agriculture Ministry and Commerce Ministry. The export of livestock will benefit farmers of the Vidarbha region which is witnessing farmer’s suicides and in order to explore new avenues to improve farmer’s income this project has been undertaken. 

Shepherd's and farmers of the region will greatly benefit from this and may consider Sheep and Goat rearing as a side business along with farming. When there is drought or when the farmer is in need of money he will be able to sell the sheep and goat. Women too can take this up as a business and make it a source of earning.

On 30th June 2018, Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis, Union Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Nitin Gadkari and Union Minister of Industry & Commerce, Suresh Prabhu will be present when the first batch of livestock for export leaves from Nagpur.

Proposed Vanijya Bhawan building in New Delhi

 

Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of Vanijya Bhawan, a new office complex for the Commerce Department of the Government of India, on Friday, 22 June 2018.  Locatednear India Gate, it is being built on a plot of 4.33 acres, belonging to erstwhile Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS&D), at the junction of Akbar and Man Singh Roads. 

Strictly conforming to Central Vista norms, the building has an area of 19233.745 sq. meters.  It will accommodate about 1000 officers and staff.  While retaining the Central Vista architecture, the Vanijya Bhawan will have all modern technology driven features. It will be a completely paperless office with state of the art facilities such as smart access control, central air-conditioning, video conferencing, and completely networked systems.The building is also significantly a green building with all required certifications. 

The layout of the building has been planned so as to minimise the number of trees that would have to be cut. More than 56% of the 214 trees on the plot are either being left untouched or are being replanted on the same plot. About 70% of the big trees have been saved. 230 new trees are also being planted on the same plot, thereby ensuring that tree cover on the site would increase after construction of the new building. 

The new building will be a symbol of not only India’s growing economic might but also the adoption and use of technology in governance in India. The manner in which public procurement in India has been transformed by Government e-Marketplace (GeM), is an exemplary use of information technology by the Department of Commerce. 

With the addition of new responsibilities like Integrated Logistics Sector Development to its already wide portfolio including the formulation, implementation, monitoring and review of the country’s foreign trade policy, work relating to multilateral and bilateral commercial relations, Special Economic Zones, state trading and export promotion and trade facilitation, the role of the Department of Commerce will become even more important for the economic growth of the country.

The Department of Commerce is currently housed in UdyogBhawan which also houses a large number of other Government of India departments leading to constraint of space. A few of its attached and subordinate offices like the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) and Government e-Marketplace (GeM) are operating from rented premises.

India’s quest for providing best quality begins with identifying standards, stated Suresh Prabhu, Minister of Commerce and Industry.

INSS is the result of the combined efforts of Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Consumer Affairs and industry stakeholders. It provides a vision for the country to achieve the highest quality standards in production and distribution of goods and services in an attempt to reclaim Brand India. The INSS report addresses four broad pillars of Quality Ecosystem: (i) Standards Development (ii) Conformity Assessment and Accreditation (iii) Technical Regulations and SPS Measures (iv) Awareness and Education.

          To take forward the robust commercial ties with the United States and to resolve outstanding bilateral trade issues, a delegation led by Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation Suresh Prabhu visited USA on 10-12 June 2018 for meetings with his US interlocutors. 

          During the visit, he held series of discussions with key officials including the US Trade Representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Wilbur L. Ross and Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Sonny Perdue. The Minister also had a joint meeting with the India Caucus Co-chairs Senator Mark Robert Warner and Senator John Cornyn. The meetings were held in a friendly and cordial atmosphere, with appreciation for each other's points of view. Discussions centered around bilateral trade and commercial relations between the two countries and focused on finding the way forward to address concerns of both sides so as to result in a win-win situation. Both the sides agreed for high level official talks at an early date to discuss various issues of interest to both sides and carry forward the discussions in a positive, constructive and result oriented manner. 

During the visit, Commerce Minister also interacted with the business community and addressed industry leaders in meetings organized by US-India Business Council (USIBC) and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF). The Minister informed the industry leaders about the aggressive economic reforms undertaken by India such as GST, Make-in-India, Startup India and ‘Fund of Funds for Startups’ (FFS), Digital India programme, e-commerce, promoting innovation and entrepreneurship and how they have made the business climate much easier in India. Minister, Suresh Prabhu, noted the encouraging growth in trade volumes through purchases of US-made civilian aircrafts by Indian companies and enhanced cooperation in the area of energy, including procurement of petroleum and LNG by India from the US. He also pointed out that India’s rapid economic growth will create significant new market opportunities in these and other areas and added that these purchases have already led to reduction in bilateral trade deficit in 2017. Future sales will sustain this trend and create a balanced trade relationship between the two countries.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the monetization of 3.70 acres of land at PragatiMaidan by India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITJPO) on long-term leasehold basis for 99 years for construction and running of a Hotel by a third party including private sector through a transparent competitive bidding process.

This measure is part of the Phase - I of redevelopment project of PragatiMaidan i.e. Integrated Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre (IECC) Project. It was was approved by the CCEA in January 2017 at an estimated cost of Rs. 2254 crore. IECC project envisages construction of a world class state-of-the-art Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre with a seating capacity for 7,000 pax, exhibition, space of over 1,00,000sq.mtr. and a basement parking for 4,800 vehicles. Traffic decongestion measures in and around the PragatiMaidan will also lead to decongestion of the area.

Funds raised through monetization of land will be one of the means of financing the IECC project which is essential for Central Government and State Governments to hold Summit Level Meetings and Exhibitions/Events for tradepromotion.

The work for IECC project as well as the traffic decongestion solutions is in full swing. ITPO has stated that the entire project is expected to be completedby September 2019. IECC project will benefit Indian trade and industry, and help increase India’s foreign trade.

Suresh Prabhu at a roundtable with industry representatives during his US visit

 

Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu visited USA on 10-12 June 2018. During his visit he held discussions with the US Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. He also had a joint meeting with the India Caucus Co-chairs Senator Mark Robert Warner and Senator John Cornyn. The meetings were held in a friendly and cordial atmosphere, with appreciation for each other's points of view. Discussions centered around bilateral trade and commercial relations between the two countries and focused on finding the way forward to address concerns of both sides.

 

In this context, it was agreed that Indian and US officials would meet at a senior level at an early date to discuss various issues of interest to both sides and carry forward the discussions in a positive, constructive and result oriented manner. 

 

During the visit, Suresh Prabhu also addressed business and industry leaders in meetings organized by US-India Business Council (USIBC) and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) and held meetings with other stakeholders. In these meetings, the Minister noted the encouraging growth in trade volumes through purchases of US-made civilian aircrafts by Indian companies and enhanced cooperation in the area of energy, including procurement of petroleum and LNG by India from the US. He also pointed out that India’s rapid economic growth will create significant new market opportunities in these and other areas and added that these purchases have already led to reduction in bilateral trade deficit in 2017. Future sales will sustain this trend and create a balanced trade relationship between the two countries.

Ministers at the end of the Informal gathering of WTO in Paris on 31st May 2018

 

Commerce and Industry Minister, Suresh Prabhu, attended anInformal Gathering of World Trade Organisation (WTO) Ministers in Paris on 31 May 2018.Twenty-Eight (28) member countries of the WTO and the Director General of the WTO attended the informal meeting. 

In his intervention, the Minister observed that there were already a number of Ministerial mandates to guide work at the WTO andnegotiators have been working for years on many issues.  He said that work should be resumed based on existing mandates, Declarations and decisions, expressing the belief that it would be counterproductive and harmful to the system to ignore the Ministerial mandates and all the work done so far and re-set the negotiations. 

He emphasised that political engagement in the process was critical for moving forward and drew attention to the informal gathering hosted in New Delhi in March this year. He mentioned that almost all the participants at the New Delhi meeting were of the view that greater engagement was the only way forward.

The Minister cautioned that while some countries viewed plurilateral discussions as a stepping stone to multilateral agreements, such initiatives could, on the contrary, weaken the multilateral trading system and undermine the inclusive institutional structure of the WTO. 

Suresh Prabhu pointed out that there is a Work Programme for E-commerce which provides a forum for discussion within the WTO. He said that India has been actively engaging in this even though it is premature to discuss binding multilateral rules for E-commerce. 

Observing that the WTO already has a full agenda, he said that India has reservations about the introduction of new issues such as Investment Facilitation in the WTO lest fundamental issues in agriculture and development get neglected.

Mr. Prabhu stressed the need to work together quickly to address the challenges which the WTO is facing at present. This would mean maintaining and strengthening the basic principles of inclusiveness, decision-making based on consensus and the centrality of development in the negotiations and processes. 

Stating that trade must contribute to development, he said that governments in India and many other developing countries have to accord priority to addressing the challenges in the journey towards greater trade liberalisation and global integration. He cautioned that any endeavour at the WTO for reciprocal trade rules, which ignored this reality, would further deepen the divide and aggravate the disenchantment with globalisation.    

He said that special and differential treatment provisions for all developing countries, without exception, and LDCs are an integral part of the WTO Agreement and this principle must be protected in future agreements as well.  

Observing that the dispute settlement arm of the WTO was the central pillar in providing security and predictability to the system, he urged members to commence the selection process to fill the vacancies in the Appellate Body. 

On the recent cycle of unilateral trade measures and proposed counter measures,the Minster said that actions and counter actions such as this could stop the fragile global economic recovery in its tracks, with consequences for jobs, GDP growth and development that would harm everyone and could also irrevocably damage the rules-based multilateral system built up with hard work over many years. Instead of using such actions to deal with any inadequacy or unfairness in the WTO provisions, the best course of action would be deal with such issues within the WTO, he said. 

In conclusion, Suresh Prabhu expressed the view thatsuch informal engagementat the political level could go a long way in deepening a mutual understanding of issues and concerns and finding ways of moving forward. 

During his visit to Paris, the Commerce Minister also had meetings with the Australian Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and the EU Trade Commissioner, during which various bilateral issues and ongoing trade negotiations were discussed. He also met the DG WTO and discussed the current international situation arising from various unilateral trade actions and counter actions and the challenges facing the WTO.

In a major gain for India, Singapore agreed to expand coverage of Indian nursing institutions by recognising seven nursing institutions in the MRA.  This has paved way for our healthcare service providers to institutionally access markets abroad.  It will further open up doors for India to enter into similar mutual recognition arrangements with other countries.

India and Singapore concluded the 2nd Review of India Singapore CECA which was officially announced by both sides today during Prime Minister, Narendra Modi’s State visit to Singapore. 

Both countries could reach a common understanding on various unresolved issues in the 2nd Review which were pending since 2010.  In the review, India and Singapore agreed to expand the coverage of tariff concessions, liberalize the rules of origin and incorporate new Product Specific Rules (PSRs) to further enhance the trade between the two countries.

The Minister of State of Commerce &Industry, C.R. Chaudhary and Commerce Secretary,Ms. Rita A. Teaotiaat the presentation of the EEPC India National Awards, in New Delhi.

 

Assuring exporters of Government support, Minister of State of Commerce & Industry, C R Chaudhary asked the exporting community to further build on the exports of over USD 76 billion in 2017-18. 

Giving away EEPC India National Awards in New Delhi last evening to 110 engineering exporters, Chaudhary said thatit is significant that these entrepreneurs made this possible in 2016-17 when the going was tough and there were lot of headwinds in the global economy. However, things improved in the following 2017-18 and the prospects seem equally encouraging this year.

In her address, Commerce Secretary Ms. Rita Teaotia said the government is working on creating an integrated logistics division within the Commerce Ministry to bring down the total cost of movement of shipments. 

She asked the engineering exporters to work on a strategic plan to completely wipe out the trade deficit of USD 16 billion of the engineering sector in the next few years, with a focus on newer markets. 

Ms. Teaotia said while the engineering sector with record shipments of USD 76 billion is among the best performing in the basket of merchandise exports, accounting for one-fourth of the country's total exports, but exporters must strive to become dominant playersin 5-6 sub sectors. 

The Indian engineering exports, though rising at a fairly steady rate, account for just 1.2 per cent of the total global engineering exports, against 12.3 per cent of China. 

On this occasion the EEPC India Chairman, Ravi Sehgal spoke about some of the issues faced by exporters likeGST refunds, OFAC sanctions, rising raw material prices and the potential threat of the export refund schemes becoming WTO non-compliant. The EEPC India has submitted several suggestions to the government for dealing with these problems.

                “The Ministry of Communications has established itself as a core enabling unit of the Government of India, driving the country’s socio-economic development during the last four years by providing strong digital connectivity support and delivering citizen-centric services – in the true spirit of “Saaf Neeyat, Sahi Vikas””, said Shri Manoj Sinha, Minister of State for Communications (Independent Charge). 

The Minister was addressing members of the press and media at a press conference today, held to mark the completion of 4 years of the present Government at the Centre. Smt. Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary, Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and Shri Ananta Narayan Nanda, Secretary, Department of Posts (DoP) joined the Minister on the dais, as he summarised the highlights and achievements of the Ministry of Communications over the last 4 years.

“Our biggest achievements in the area of Telecommunications have been – overcoming the pervasive trust deficit through transparent auctions of spectrum, and bridging the digital divide in the country by undertaking digital infrastructure projects such as BharatNet on an unprecedented scale”, said Shri Sinha. “And in the Department of Posts, we have successfully managed to re-imagine the business of the department – with focus on financial inclusion, provision of citizen-centric services using our unmatched reach, and restructuring our operations to meet evolving customer needs”, he added.

The Telecom sector has witnessed revolutionary changes over the last 4 years:


	Six-fold increase in Government spending on telecommunications infrastructure and services in the country – from Rs. 9,900 crores between 2009-14, to Rs. 60,000 crores (actual + planned) between 2014-19
	Increase in overall tele-density from 75% to 93%
	Over 75% increase in internet coverage – from 251 million users to 446 million
	Number of mobile Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) more than doubled – from 7.9 lakh to nearly 18 lakh
	Country-wide Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) coverage doubled – from 7 lakh km to 14 lakh km
	Steep tariff reductions benefiting consumers across the country – Average voice tariff declined by 67%, and  Average data tariff declined by 93%
	Seven times growth in broadband access – from 61 million to 412 million subscribers
	Five-fold jump in FDI inflows in the Telecom Sector – from USD 1.3 Billion in  2015-16, to USD 6.1 Billion in 2017-18 (upto December 2017)


The Prime Minister’s motto of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas” finds reflection in the Department of Telecom’s efforts to Connect the Unconnected – through rural digital infrastructure projects such as BharatNet, as well as through projects for the North-East Region, Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) Affected Areas, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep. 

The Department has also taken proactive steps to move the country to the forefront on the global stage in this technology-driven sector. “We missed the 3G and 4G buses”, said the Minister; “but 5G is a bus we cannot afford to miss”. Proactive engagement, planning, and investment have been initiated to leverage new technologies for the welfare of citizens. A High-Level Forum (HLF) for 5G India has been set up; a 5G test bed is being established through budgetary support; and a progressive and forward-looking Draft National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP) 2018 is already in the public domain, setting aspirational targets to guide the department over the next few years.

In these 4 years, the Department of Posts has initiated transformative changes which aim to radically alter the face of Post Offices in the country. From a ‘stagnating business growth’ situation, the Department has now moved to successfully launch citizen-centric services which leverage its’ unique strengths – unmatched country-wide reach, and strong trust of the people, especially in non-metro areas.

A summary of the key highlights and achievements of the DoP in the last 4 years:


	Average annual Speed Post revenue more than doubled – from Rs. 788 crores between 2006-14 to Rs. 1682 crores between 2014-18
	Revenue of Rs. 415 crores from the eCommerce business in 2017-18, with a growth of more than 20% over the previous financial year
	Established a separate Parcel Directorate, in order to focus on this growing business segment
	Geared up to launch the India Post Payments Bank (IPPB), with 650 branches co-located in District HQ Post Offices, offering a 360-degree financial services suite across multiple channels – to benefit the unbanked and under-banked
	995 DoP ATMs are now inter-operable with other Banks; since December 2016, 1.85 crore transactions have been carried out on these ATMs
	More than 1.18 crore Sukanya Samriddhi accounts opened in Post Offices across the country, of a total of 1.30 crore accounts across  all banks
	Aadhar Enrolment & Updation Centres have been made functional in 13,150+ Post Offices across the country in just 7 months; more than 7 lakh enrolments and updates have already been completed in these centres
	213 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs) started across the country in collaboration with the Ministry of External Affairs – to provide passport services to citizens within 50 KMs of their place of residence; more than ten lakh passport appointments have already been processed in these POPSKs
	Postal Life Insurance (PLI) and Rural Postal Life Insurance (RPLI) – insurance products from the DoP, with the unique feature of ‘low premium, high bonus’; renewed drive to extend the benefits of these products to promote financial inclusion in the country
	Benefits of Postal Life Insurance (PLI) are no longer limited to Government and Semi-Government employees; this facility is now also available to professionals (teachers, lawyers, engineers, doctors, CAs) and employees of listed companies of NSE and BSE
	Under Sampoorna Bima Gram Yojana, at least one person insured from each household in 1,244 villages nation-wide; 10,000 villages targeted by March 2019
	The PLI and RPLI business is now being carved into an independent SBU within DoP, to leverage the potential of insuring the uninsured
	A philately scholarship scheme called Deen Dayal SPARSH (Scholarship for Promotion of Aptitude & Research in Stamps as a Hobby) Yojana was introduced in November, 2017 to promote Philately among children; under the scheme, 920 scholarships will be given every year to school-children who demonstrate interest in philately
	An average 56% increase in the wages and allowances of GDSs, benefitting more than 2.60 lakh GDSs and their families
	Technology investments in the Department more than doubled – from Rs. 434 crores between 2010-14 to more than Rs. 1,000 crores between 2014-18
	More than 62,000 SIM based handheld devices are in use by Gramin Dak Sewaks in Branch Post Offices, to ensure financial inclusion of the unbanked rural population by making available financial and postal services on a digital platform; target to extend this coverage to all 1.30 lakh Branch Post Offices in the country by end-2018
	More than 3 crore transactions have been carried out through these devices so far, amounting to Rs. 3,800 crores
	Postman mobile application has been introduced to update the delivery information of accountable mail, including cash on delivery, on a real time basis


 

“Both the Departments continue to be focused on acting as catalysts – to take the benefits of a rapidly developing India to the remotest corners of our country, championing the cause of the Government’s flagship programs such as Digital India and Financial Inclusion. In these endeavours, we will continue to be guided and inspired by the face of the last person in the queue of development, and strive to make a difference to his/her life, in line with Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s philosophy of Antyoday”, concluded Shri Sinha.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has approved the revision in the wage structure and allowances of Gramin Dak Sevaks (GDS) of the Department of Posts.

The revision in the wage structure would entail an estimated expenditure of Rs 1257.75 crore (Non-recurring expenditure - Rs 860.95 crore and Recurring expenditure of Rs.396.80 crore) during 2018-19.

3.07 lakh Gramin Dak Sevaks will be benefitted by this wage revision.

Details:

 


	Time Related Continuity allowance (TRCA) structure and slabs have been rationalised.  The total GDSs have been brought under two categories viz. Branch Postmasters (BPMs) and other than Branch Postmasters namely Assistant Branch Postmaster (ABPMs).
	The present 11 TRCA slabs will be merged into only three TRCA Slabs with two levels each for BPMs and other than BPMs.
	Introduction of new Time Related Continuity Allowance (TRCA) will be as below:


 


	
		
			
			Minimum TRCA of two types of proposed categories of GDSs as per working hours / levels
			
		
		
			
			S.No.

			 
			
			
			Category

			 
			
			
			Minimum TRCA for 4 Hours / Level 1

			 
			
			
			Minimum TRCA for 5 Hours / Level 2

			 
			
		
		
			
			1

			 
			
			
			BPM

			 
			
			
			Rs. 12000/-

			 
			
			
			Rs. 14500/-

			 
			
		
		
			
			2

			 
			
			
			ABPM/Dak Sevaks

			 
			
			
			Rs. 10000/-

			 
			
			
			Rs. 12000/-

			 
			
		
	


 


	Dearness Allowance will continue to be paid as a separate component, and also revised from time to time whenever it is revised for Central Government Servants.
	It is decided to continue the calculation of the ex-gratia bonus by applying the calculation ceiling of Rs.7000 as basic TRCA + DA till such time a new scheme is devised.
	Arrears for the period 1.1.2016 to the date of implementation will be paid by increasing the basic TRCA drawn during the period by a factor of 2.57. The arrears will be paid in one instalment.



	vii. Annual increase at the rate of 3% and the same may be given on 1st January or 1st July of every year as the case may be based on the one time written request of GDSs.



	A new Risk and hardship Allowance has been introduced. Other allowances Viz. Office maintenance allowance, Combined duty allowance, Cash conveyance charges, Cycle maintenance allowance, Boat allowance and Fixed Stationery Charges have been revised.


 

Implementation strategy and targets:

The revision would result in improving the wages, allowances and discharge benefits of Gramin Dak Sevaks resulting in providing efficient & cost-effective basic postal facilities in the rural area. The proposed increased emoluments will enable him to improve his socio-economic standing.

 

Impact:

The Branch Post Offices are the fulcrum for provision of Communications and financial services in the village and are located in remote areas. The Post Master has to deal with large sums while making payments to customers; hence accountability is already built into his work. The enhanced remuneration will increase the sense of responsibility. Moreover, with the roll out of the India Post Payment Bank (IPPB), the CDS network is expected to play a key role in the process of financial inclusion of the rural population.

 

Background:

The Extra Departmental system in the Department of Posts was established more than150 years ago to provide basic, economical and efficient postal services in the rural areas where there was no justification for engaging full time regular employees. One Lakh Twenty-Nine Thousand Three Hundred forty-six (1,29,346) Extra-departmental Branch post offices are primarily manned by Gramin Dak Sevak Branch Postmasters. In addition, Gramin Dak Sevaks other than Branch Postmasters are also working in Branch, Sub and Head Post offices. The main features of the engagement of Gramin Dak Sevaks are that they work for part time ranging from 3 to 5 hours per day and supplement their income from other vocations so as to have adequate means of livelihood for themselves and their families. They remain in service up to the age of 65 years.

                The need of promoting innovation and harnessing the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) is imperative for solving practical problems in India, said Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan.  All initiatives in IoT should translate into business models which can be replicated across sectors, she added.  

 

Ms Sundararajan was inaugurating a seminar on IoT organised by Deprtment of Telecommunications in collaboration with GSMA, New Delhi. 

 

Ms Sundararajan also underlined the need to work across silos in technology, policy, regulation, licenses, and use cases.  There should be a drive to spread awareness and initiate capacity building across several key ministries like health, agriculture, transport, urban development and energy as use cases will be initiated from these ministries.  

 

The seminar is the first among series of capacity building programmes planned with the support of GSMA as per the bilateral agreement between DoT and GSMA during Mobile World Congress 2018 at Barcelona. Technology considerations for IoT, including the spectrum allocation, business models for IoT, and policy considerations were discussed during the seminar.  

 

IoT deployment has been included as one of the important focus technology area in the draft National Digital Communication Policy 2018 released recently. Evolving IoT ecosystem in India is likely to accelerate the IoT deployment leading to socio economic development.

 

As per recent estimates, IoT market in India stands at $5.6 million with 200 million connected units in 2016. This is expected to grow to $15 billion with 2.7 billion units by 2020.  Globally, the number of IoT devices is estimated to have increased 31% year-over-year to 8.4 billion in 2017.  It is projected that there will be 30 billion devices by 2020.  The global market value of IoT is projected to reach $7.1 trillion by 2020. 

 

Mr Prabhash Singh, Member (Services/Technology), DoT, Ms EmanuelaLecchi, Head Public Policy – APAC, Govt and Regulatory Affairs, GSMA, Mr Rajiv Sinha DDG NT, DoT, Mr VikramRawal, Senior Policy Director, Govt and Regulatory Affairs, GSMA, and Dr Rajesh Sharma, DDG(Trg), DoT led the sessions.

                Shri Ram Vilas Paswan has urged States/UTs to work together with the Centre to make appropriate intervention to ensure the prices of essential commodities remain stable and inflation is contained. The Union Minister hoped that end to end computerisation ofTargeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) will be completed by year 2018. Shri Paswan stated this while speaking at the Fourth National Consultation Meeting of Ministers of States/UTs to deliberate on the issues concerning consumer empowerment, protection and welfare as well as on more effective, efficient and targeted delivery of food under National Food Security Act.The meeting was organized by Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi today. 

Shri Ram Vilas Paswan emphasised the need for adhaar seeding of beneficiaries and installation of e-PoS machine for ensuring targeted delivery. This would enable States to increase the number of beneficiaries covered under scheme as the allocation to State is not reduced. He also observed that concerted efforts need to be undertaken by Centre and State Governments as well as concerned agencies and institutions for ensuring consumer protection and welfare.

Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Commerce &Industry Shri C.R Chaudhary observed that due to various policy initiatives, promotional measures and effective monitoring undertaken by the Government, prices of essential commodities have remained at reasonable levels barring a few exceptions over small duration. He also noted that Government has taken steps to improve quality and quantity assurance of products and made significant progress towards end-to-end computerisation of targeted public distribution system (TPDS).

The National Consultation Meeting noted that 


	The coordinated efforts by Central and State Governments, appropriate and timely policy interventions including judicious use of trade and fiscal policy have ensuredthat inflationremains contained at reasonable levels.  Prices of essential commodities have generally remained relatively stable, barring seasonal / short-term increase in few.   However, there is a need for regular surveillance as the prices of perishable commodities and edibles as they tend to rise between July to November. 



	State/UT Governments may undertake market intervention operations, if needed, by setting up State-level Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) scheme, for which contribution is also provided by Centre as per the Guideline of the Scheme.
	Implementation of Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) (Amendment) Rules, 2017 w.e.f. 1st January, 2018making declarations under the LM Ruleson e-commerce platform mandatory, increasing font size of letters and numerals on declaration, mandating that no person shall declare different MRPs (dual MRP) on identical pre-packaged commodity etc. would improve quantity assurance and empower consumer.
	Quality Assurance of the product has got a major fillip with the new Bureau of Indian standards (BIS) Act 2016 with effect from 12th October, 2017. This new BIS Act will facilitate promotion, monitoring and management of the quality of goods by carrying out market survey, creating awareness, promotion of safety and promoting the use of Indian Standards. The new Act has enabling provisions for making hallmarking of precious metal articles mandatory. The new BIS Act also has provisions for recall of non-conforming products. 
	Various Acts, programmes, schemes aimed at welfare and protection of the consumers are handled by multiple Government agencies in States. Setting up of a well-coordinated and integrated administrative department with adequate enforcement machinery would help protect the rights of the consumers.  Recognizing this, the 3rd National Consultation meeting decided on creation ofa separate department of Consumer Affairs in States. States which have not yet set up such a Department mayexpedite action.
	To empower the consumer and also create a more conducive business to consumer (B2C) interactions, the Department has taken various digital initiatives like setting up of National Consumer Helpline, Grievance Against Misleading Advertisement (GAMA) portal, etc. that would facilitate grievance redressal and offer greater convenience to all stakeholders.
	A three-tier quasi-judicial mechanism consisting of NCDRC, SCDRC & District Fora, has been set-up to adjudicate complaints filed before them and provide speedy redress to consumers.  SCDRC & District Fora need to be suitably strengthened and empowered through provision of requisite manpower and infrastructure to improve their effectiveness.
	Reform of PDS has made the distribution more transparent and targeted. Digitisation of ration cards has been completed in all States/UTs and the number of States/UTs with online food grains allocations has increased from 5 in June 2014 to 25.  Online grievance redress has now been introduced by all States/UTs. 
	Having ensured implementation of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in all the States/UTs, the focus of discussion in the meeting was on reforms in the Public Distribution System. The Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution (CA, F&PD) in his address informed that though NFSA provided for revision in issue prices after three years, this Govt. has kept the prices unchanged at Rs. 1/2/3 per kg for Coarse grains/Wheat/Rice upto June, 2019. He also highlighted the achievements in end-to-end computerisation of TPDS operations which inter alia included digitization of the entire NFSA beneficiary database and facility for online grievance redressal/toll free helplines in all the States/UTs. He further said that in about 60% of the Fair Price Shops e-Pos devices have been installed for authentication of beneficiaries and electronic capturing of transactions. He urged the States/UTs where performance is slow in this area to ensure time-bound completion. The Minister for CA, F&PD also stressed on the need for  States/UTs availing benefit of the scheme for allocation of foodgrains for Welfare institutions and hostels, which has been recently revamped with a view to improve its reach and to bring transparency. 
	The Minister for CA, F&PD also said that taking into account requests received from State Governments, revision in the norms of Central assistance to States/UTs for intra-state transportation and fair price shops/dealers margin is being considered. 
	During discussion with States/UTs other aspects of essential reforms in TPDS such as delivery of foodgrains upto door-step of fair price shops and setting up of effective grievance redressal and monitoring mechanism, as per provisions of NFSA was stressed. States/UTs were also requested to ensure timely lifting of foodgrains form the FCI godowns so that there is no delay in monthly distribution of food grains. 
	In the area of procurement and release of food subsidy following achievements were noted: 



	In this marketing year RMS 2018-19, the procurement of wheat has been 355 LMT which is much more than the estimated procurement of 320 LMT, which is a record in past three years. 
	There is procurement of 46 LMT of Rabi paddy against target of 55 LMT in KMS 2017-18 so far. 
	During 2017-18, Rs. 38,000 crores were released as food subsidy to DCP states and Rs. 1,01,982 Crore (including Rs. 40,000 Crore of NSSF loan) was released to FCI as food subsidy. It has also been ensured that all the states come on PFMS platform so that there is complete transparency in financial transactions at various levels for procurement and distribution operations.


The National Conference further noted that empowering consumer and ensuring their welfare is the joint responsibility of Government of India and the State Governments.The achievement of this objective entails coordinated action by all.  Accordingly, the National Consultation agreed to adopt the following Action Plan to be implemented over next year:


	All price reporting centres in the State to provide prices data on all seven days of the week and as per the laid down methodology for data collection.States with relatively lower number of centres may setup additional centres for price reporting. States may send their proposal for strengthening their centres as per the revised guidelines which additionally allows engaging services of one data entry operator per centre and a hand-held device.

The fourth National Consultation Meeting of Ministers of States & UTs, in-charge of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs is being held on 29th June 2018 in New Delhi. The meeting will be chaired by Shri Ram Vilas Paswan, Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, and Food & Public Distribution. Besides States, Union Ministries dealing with essential commodities viz., Agriculture, Chemicals & Fertilizers, Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Food Processing Industry, Health & Family Welfare, Petroleum & Natural Gas and Textiles will also be participating in the daylong event.  The consultation will be on measures needed for further improving various facets of consumer protection and welfare including availability of essential food items at stable prices, Public Distribution System etc., and chart a future course of action.

 

High on the agenda of this meeting will be a discussion on measures required to maintain and manage prices of essential food items at reasonable level through appropriate policy intervention.  Availability of robust and regular price information is pre-requisite for such policy decision and interventions.  Therefore, improving the spread and coverage of price reporting centres, which report the prices of 22 essential food items daily, measures to strengthening these centres so as to improve the robustness of the data reported would be considered.   In this context, Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) as an instrument to tackle inflationary trends in important agri-horticultural commodities and the need for setting up of State Level PSF for addressing the state-specific concerns would also be discussed.

 

Issues like enforcement of the provisions of Essential Commodities Act and Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act; modernization and reform of the Legal Metrology Departments in the States for effective implementation of Legal Metrology Act & Rules; redressal of the concerns raised by the 3 Member Committee of Supreme Court for facilitating the functioning of State Commissions and Consumer Fora; integration of National Building Code brought out by BIS in building  by-laws of State/UTs and local-bodies would also come up for discussion. 

National Food Security is now being implemented in all the States/UTs. For timely and satisfactory redressal of grievance of beneficiaries, functioning of grievance redressal and monitoring mechanism, as per provisions of the Act, will be reviewed in the meeting. Progress in the scheme of end-to-end computerisation of TPDS operations of State/UT level, including Aadhar seeding and installation of e-PoS devices at Fair Price Shops for authentication of beneficiaries and electronic capturing of transactions, will also be reviewed in the meeting, with a view to ensuring time bound completion of all the activities.

Status of implementation of the revamped scheme for SC/ST hostels and welfare institutions will also be discussed in the meeting, in order to understand the issues and challenges faced by States/UTs in its implementation, and the way forward, so that all the States/UTs avail benefit of the schemes targeted at the most vulnerable sections of society.

                In order to improve the problem of liquidity of sugar mills resulting in accumulation of huge cane price arrears of farmers, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the following measures involving total amount of about Rs. 7000 crore:


	Creation of buffer stock of 30 LMT of sugar for one year and to incur estimated expenditure of Rs.1175 crore for this purpose. However, based on the market price and availability of sugar, this may be reviewed by Department of Food & Public Distribution(DFPD) any time. The reimbursement under the scheme would be made on quarterly basis which would be directly credited into farmers’ account on behalf of mills against their cane price dues.
	To notify Sugar Price (Control) Order, 2018 under Essential Commodities Act, 1955 to fix minimum selling price of white/refined sugar at the mill gate below which no white/refined sugar can be sold and delivered by a sugar mill in the domestic market. Fixation of minimum selling price of white sugar would be based on Fair Remunerative Price (FRP) of cane and minimum conversion cost of white/refined sugar. The minimum selling price of white/refined sugar shall be initially fixed at Rs.29/kg which can be revised by DFPD subsequently based on revision of FRP etc. This will not affect availability of sugar to consumers at reasonable price and Government will put in place a mechanism to ensure that the retail prices of sugar are kept fully under control. At present, this would be done along with imposition of stock holding limits on sugar mills. The stock limit on mills will be initially imposed for the current sugar season (up to September 2018), which may be reviewed by DFPD at any time.
	To augment capacity through up-gradation of existing distilleries attached to sugar mills by installing incineration boilers and setting up new distilleries in sugar mills; government will bear interest subvention of maximum Rs.1332 crore over a period of five years including moratorium period of one year on estimated bank loan amounting to Rs.4440 crore to be sanctioned to the sugar mills by the banks over a period of three years for which DFPD would formulate a detailed scheme in this regard. This would help diversion of sugar during surplus phase to reduce excess inventories. 


Background:

Excess production during the current Sugar Season and indication of higher production in the ensuing Sugar Season has been continuously depressing the market price of sugar. Due to the depressed market sentiments and crash in sugar prices, the liquidity position of the sugar mills has been adversely affected leading to accumulation of cane price dues which has already reached to an alarming level of more than Rs.22000 crore.

In order to stabilize sugar production at reasonable level with a view to improve the liquidity position of the mills thereby enabling them to clear the cane price arrears of farmers, Central Government has taken the following steps in past four months:

(i)    Increased custom duty on import of sugar from 50% to 100% to check any import to the country.

(ii)    Imposed stock holding limits on producers of sugar for the months of February and March, 2018 to stabilise the domestic sugar price.

 

(iii)   Withdrawn custom duty on export of sugar to encourage sugar industry to start exploring possibility of export of sugar. 

(iv)   Allocated mill-wise Minimum Indicative Export Quotas (MIEQ) of 20 LMT of sugar for export during Sugar Season 2017-18.

(v)   Re-introduced Duty Free Import Authorization (DFIA) Scheme in respect of sugar to facilitate and incentivize export of surplus sugar by sugar mills.

(vi)   Extended financial assistance to sugar mills @ Rs.5.50/qtl of cane crushed during 2017-18 Sugar Season to offset the cost of cane.

Implementation of NFSA: NFSA has been implemented in all States/UTs benefitting around 80.72 crore population. Government has decided to keep the Central Issue Price under NFSA Scheme unchanged at Rs. 1/2/3 per kg of coarse grain/wheat/rice. As a result food subsidy is now Rs. 1.43 lakh crore which is 26% higher to Rs. 1.13 lakh crore in 2014-15. 

Deletion of ration cards: As an outcome of digitization of Ration Cards/beneficiary records, de-duplication due to Aadhaar seeding, transfer/migration/deaths, change in economic status of beneficiaries and during the run-up to and implementation of NFSA a total of 2.75 crore ration cards have been deleted/cancelled. Based on this the Government has been able to achieve Rightful Targeting of Food Subsidies of about Rs 17,000 Crore per annum. 

Releasing of Central Assistance: In 2016-17, Rs. 2500 crore and in 2017-18, Rs. 4500 crore were released to State Governments as Central assistance to meet the expenditure incurred on intra-State movement of foodgrains and fair price shop dealers’ margins.

Digital/Cashless/Less-cash Payments in PDS: To promote the use of less-cash/digital payment mechanisms, the Department has issued detailed guidelines for use of AePS, UPI, USSD, Debit/Rupay Cards and e-Wallets on 7th December 2016. At present in 10 States/UTs a total of 51,479 FPSs are enabled for digital payments.

Apart from the above, 100% digitization of Ration Card data has been done, all States have transparency portal, 30 States have online allocation of foodgrains and 21 States/UTs have computerised supply chain management system.

                Union Minister for Railways, Coal, Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Piyush Goyal said that India's growing clout in the international economies and geopolitics is clearly visible from the fact that India hosted Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank summit this week in Mumbai and now we are hosting SAFA International Conference. He said this in his address at the South Asian federation of Accountants (SAFA) International Conference 2018, organised by the Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICAI), here today. He said that in the brave new world, Asian countries need to work as a team to tackle the challenges of tomorrow. The world is becoming smaller in terms of cost accounting. Cost accounting is totally global in nature.

Underlining the importance of Cost Accounting, Shri Goyal said it can significantly improve foundations of companies and also governance as competition requires cost cutting without compromising on quality. It requires planning and delivering the goods with consistency. Any organisation that does not have a cost analysis can't succeed in today's challenging world. This is made even more challenging by the cost scenarios changing daily. Consistency is the key to growth. And consistency can only be achieved by factoring in cost. Besides, costing ensures fair competition, Shri Goyal added.

While mentioning the challenges of implementing GST in a nation size and scale of India, Shri Goyal said that the Government could have not done all of this without understanding costing. Costing is an important part of all reforms.

Earlier in the morning, Union Minister of State for Law & Justice and Corporate Affairs Shri P.P. Chaudhary inaugurated the conference and in his inaugural address called for synchronising accounting standards and practices are in public interest as it makes us stronger and propels us towards broad development. He said that since all our SAFA countries are developing economies and we must try to increase our GDP and provide relief to the millions of poor. This is only possible when businesses have competent and robust accountants as businesses can flourish fast only when the foundation is strong. The scope of accountants has not remained limited to just that of an accountant, auditor or a taxation expert rather it has widened into other critical areas such as corporate finance, investment banking, fund management, credit analysis, capital markets, arbitration, risk management, valuation of businesses and insolvency, he said.

The theme of the Conference ‘Professionals of the Future: Thoughts on 2018 & Beyond’ emphasized the areas of professional challenges and the opportunities that come along as avenues for future growth. Digitalisation has challenged professional service sector to rethink internal structures and thereby better deliver services and maximize profits in an increasingly digitalized age. But at the same time, it also will require considering how automation will impact jobs. To complicate this even further, overall the workforce composition is changing. Transforming into a truly digital business is much more than just implementing new technology to meet the demands of a digital age. It’s more than keeping up with the deluge of transformation happening all around us. Digital transformation is about understanding how to harness these changes and incorporate them into your apt business strategy. The Conference provided a wonderful forum for refreshing knowledge base and offered plenty of networking opportunities, providing the delegates with the opportunity to meet and interact with the domain experts, corporate, professional and academicians across the world.

                The Ministry of Corporate Affairs had constituted a two-member expert committee to update the National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business (NVGs). A draft of which has now been placed on its website, www.mca.gov.in for public comment till 20.07.2018. The updated version will be finalised after an assessment and review of suggestions and inputs received from stakeholders and wide consultations with the relevant Ministries, Business and Stakeholders at large.

There have been several notable national and international developments in the wider sustainability and business responsibility domains since the release of NVGs requiring their updating.  The adoption of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), debates on Climate Change and enhanced role of Business in engendering Human Rights in their functioning are to mention a few.

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs first issued the National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business (NVGs) in July 2011 with a view to make business socially responsible and partake in the development of the nation through its expertise and efficiency and be internationally relevant. The NVGs comprise nine interrelated and interconnected Principles and their attendant Core elements and represent a holistic approach to business responsibility.

The Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) in 2012 on the basis of these guidelines mandated the top 100 companies (presently top 500) to furnish Annual Business Responsibility Report (ABRR) providing an impetus to the uptake of NVGs by business.

                The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, invites comments and views from stakeholders on introductory note and draft on Cross-Border Insolvency. The MCA is keen to introduce a globally accepted and well-recognised cross-border insolvency framework, fine-tuned to suit the needs of aspirational Indian economy. The Government has taken initiative for Cross-Border Insolvency within the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (the Code) to provide a comprehensive legal framework.

As the size of the Indian economy grows, business and trade have adopted an increasingly international character. Creditors and corporates frequently transact business in more than one jurisdiction. Foreign banks and creditors finance Indian companies and Indian banks have foreign exposure. Moreover, as part of its Ease of Doing Business and Make in India policies, India seeks to attract foreign companies to set up manufacturing facilities in India. Global experience demonstrates that cross-border investment decisions and their outcomes, are considerably affected by the insolvency laws in force in a country. Towards this end, even though the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code) has resulted in significant improvement in Indias insolvency regime, there is a need to include cross-border insolvency in the Code to provide a comprehensive insolvency framework.

Inclusion of cross-border insolvency framework will further enhance ease of doing business, provide a mechanism of cooperation between India and other countries in the area of insolvency resolution, and protect creditors in the global scenario. Furthermore, it will make India an attractive investment destination for foreign creditors given the increased predictability and certainty of the insolvency framework.

On the global scale, the UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, 1997 (Model Law) has emerged as the most widely accepted legal framework to deal with cross-border insolvency issues while ensuring the least intrusion into the countrys domestic insolvency law. Due to the growing prevalence of multinational insolvencies, the Model Law has been adopted by 44 States till date, including Singapore, UK and US.

Introductory note and draft on Cross-Border Insolvency have been uploaded on MCA website mca.gov.in. Suggestions on the draft on Cross-Border Insolvency are invited from the stakeholders to further enhance the same and ensure views after wider consultation are incorporated. Suggestions in the format prescribed in public notice on MCA website may be mailed to the email id: crossborder@mca.gov.in till 30.06.2018.

                The President today gave assent to promulgate the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018.

The Ordinance provides significant relief to home buyers by recognizing their status as financial creditors.  This would give them due representation in the Committee of Creditors and make them an integral part of the decision making process.  It will also enable home buyers to invoke Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 against errant developers.   Another major beneficiary would be Micro, Small and Medium Sector Enterprises (MSME), which form the backbone of the Indian economy as the biggest employer, next only to the agriculture sector.  Recognizing the importance of MSME Sector in terms of employment generation and economic growth, the Ordinance empowers the Government to provide them with a special dispensation under the Code.  The immediate benefit it provides is that, it does not disqualify the promoter to bid for his enterprise undergoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) provided he is not a willful defaulter and does not attract other disqualifications not related to default.  It also empowers the Central Government to allow further exemptions or modifications with respect to the MSME Sector, if required, in public interest.

In order to protect the sanctity of the CIRP, the Ordinance lays down a strict procedure if an applicant wants to withdraw a case after its admission under IBC 2016.  Henceforth, such withdrawal would be permissible only with the approval of the Committee of Creditors with 90 percent of the voting share.  Furthermore, such withdrawal will only be permissible before publication of notice inviting Expressions of Interest (EoI).  In other words, there can be no withdrawal once the commercial process of EoIs and bids commences. Separately, the Regulations will bring in further clarity by laying down mandatory timelines, processes and procedures for corporate insolvency resolution process.  Some of the specific issues that would be addressed include non-entertainment of late bids, no negotiation with the late bidders and a well laid down procedure for maximizing value  of assets. 

With a view to encouraging resolution as opposed to liquidation, the voting threshold has been brought down to 66 percent from 75 percent for all major decisions such as approval of resolution plan, extension of CIRP period, etc.  Further, in order to facilitate the corporate debtor to continue as a going concern during the CIRP, the voting threshold for routine decisions has been reduced to 51%.

The Ordinance also provides for a mechanism to allow participation of security holders, deposit holders and all other classes of financial creditors that exceed a certain number, in meetings of the Committee of Creditors, through the authorized representation. 

The existing Section 29(A) of the IBC, 2016 has also been fine-tuned to exempt pure play financial entities from being disqualified on account of NPA.  Similarly, a resolution application holding an NPA by virtue of acquiring  it  in the past under the IBC, 2016, has been provided with a three-year cooling-off period, from the date of such acquisition.  In other words, such NPA shall not disqualify the resolution application during the currency of the three-year grace period.

Taking into account the wide range of disqualifications contained in Section 29(A) of the Code, the Ordinance provides that the Resolution Applicant shall submit an affidavit certifying its eligibility to bid.  This places the primary onus on the resolution applicant to certify its eligibility. 

The Ordinance provides for a minimum one-year grace period for the successful resolution applicant to fulfill various statutory obligations required under different laws.  This would go a long way in enabling the new management to successfully implement the resolution plan.

The other changes brought about by the Ordinance include non-applicability of moratorium period to enforcement of guarantee; introducing the requirement of special resolution for corporate debtors  to themselves trigger insolvency resolution under the Code; liberalizing terms and conditions of interim finance to facilitate financing of corporate debtor during CIRP period; and giving the IBBI a specific development role along with  powers to levy fee in respect of services rendered.

The above mentioned changes are expected to further strengthen the Insolvency Resolution Framework in the country and produce better outcomes in terms ofresolution as opposed to liquidation, time taken, cost incurred and recovery rate.

                Minister of State for Corporate Affairs and Law & Justice, Shri P.P. Chaudhary felicitated and gave away awards to toppers and international rank holders from class IV to XII for the six Olympiad exams conducted by Science Olympiad Foundation (SOF). The function was held here today to recognise international winning students, teachers and principals of Olympiad exams held during the Academic year 2017-18 in the presence of distinguished guests.

While speaking with the audience, Shri Choudhary lauded students and schools for achieving excellence in academics and said that excellence is its own goal. He referred to the book Exam Warriors written by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for children. Picking up a few wisdoms from the book, Shri Chaudhary told students to celebrate exams like festivals and told students that exams are not a test of your personality, but a test of your preparations. He spoke of science and the will to perform better with the help of imagination. He said imagination is the sole characteristic of humans across the living world as we know it – no machine or animal possesses it, and is critical to develop broader thinking.

He said there is no field which is not touched by imagination, be it science or arts or public policy and government administration. Each individual requires imagination if one wants to build a new thing. And it is more important to be imaginative than be original. He said routine life is incapable of providing solutions. Solutions are found when one spends time observing, daydreaming and imagining. These are not negative traits per se. Positive employment of mind in observation, daydreaming and imagination help to create new and efficient solutions to problems. Re-interpretation of ideas, old and new, leads to innovation.

Shri Chaudhary said that observing, daydreaming and imagination should not induce inactivity. He said active life is very important for a fulfilling life and Yoga helps us to achieve it. June 21, being celebrated as World Yoga Day, is a good opportunity for those still to be initiated in Yoga. He said any new activity helps in making us more imaginative. Pick up anything that interests you; it could be photography, cooking, writing, dancing, digital art, magic, sculpting or even stand-up comedy.

Speaking at the event, Shri Mahabir Singh, the founder & Director of SOF, shared that over 45,000 schools from 1,400 cities across 30 countries participated in the six SOF Olympiad exams during 2017-18 and millions of students appeared in them. About 55,000 students from 5,850 schools have been awarded for achieving top state level ranks. In addition, over 8,00,000 students have been awarded “Medals of Excellence” for achieving top rank in their respective schools. 1,500 principals & teachers were also honoured for their commitment to academics and single minded pursuit in improving the students’ academic knowledge and successfully preparing them for competitive exams.

                In yet another landmark achievement, India’s nomination of the ""Victorian and Art Deco Ensembles of Mumbai "" has been inscribed on  UNESCO's World Heritage list. The decision was taken at the 42nd session of the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO at Manama in Bahrain today. As recommended by the World Heritage Committee, India accepted the renaming of the ensemble as “Victorian Gothic and Art Deco Ensembles of Mumbai”.

 India has been successful in securing the inscription of the ""Victorian Gothic and Art Deco Ensembles of Mumbai” on UNESCO's World Heritage List under Criteria (ii) and (iv) as defined in the UNESCO's Operational Guidelines.    

This makes Mumbai city the second city in India after Ahmedabad to be inscribed on the World Heritage List. In the past 5 years alone, India has managed to get inscribed seven of its properties/sites on the World Heritage List of UNESCO. India now has overall 37 World Heritage Inscriptions with 29 Cultural, 07 Natural and 01 Mixed sites. While India stands second largest in number after China in terms of number of World Heritage properties in ASPAC (Asia and Pacific) region, it is overall sixth in the world.

On this historic moment, the Union Minister of State for Culture (I/c) Dr. Mahesh Sharma has congratulated the residents of Mumbai and the entire country for this landmark achievement. In his statement, the Minister said that the international recognition to the heritage precinct of the city of Mumbai is a matter of great pride to the nation and it will boost the local economy in a number of ways. He also added that this achievement is expected to give a tremendous fillip to domestic and international tourism leading to increased employment generation, creation of world-class infrastructure and augmentation of sale of local handicrafts, handlooms and heritage memorabilia.

 The Ensemble comprises of two architectural styles, the 19th century collection of Victorian structures and the 20th century Art Deco buildings along the sea, conjoined by means of the historical open space of the Oval Maidan. Together, this architectural ensemble represents the most remarkable collection of Victorian and Art Deco buildings in the world which forms the unique character of this urban setting, unparalleled in the world.

 

                 

The Ensemble consists of 94 buildings primarily of 19th century Victorian Gothic revival and early 20th century Art Deco style of architecture with the Oval Maidan in the centre. The 19th century Victorian buildings form part of the larger Fort precinct situated to the east of the Oval Maidan. These public buildings include the Old Secretariat (1857-74), University Library and Convention Hall (1874-78), the Bombay High Court (1878), the Public Works Department Office (1872), Watson’s Hotel (1869), David Sasoon Library (1870), the Elphinstone College(1888), etc. The Art Deco styled buildings to the west of the Oval Maidan were raised in early 20th century on the newly reclaimed lands at Marine Drive and symbolised the shift in expression to represent contemporary aspirations.

 



The inscription has been done under Criteria (ii) and (iv) as defined in the UNESCO's Operational Guidelines. Criterion (ii) refers to the important interchange of human values, over a span of time on development of architecture, monumental arts, town planning and landscape while Criterion (iv) refers to being an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant stage (s) in human history. This achievement is especially remarkable in the view of the successive inscription of another Indian city after Ahmedabad last year. 

In addition, 42 sites from the country figures in the Tentative List of World Heritage and the Ministry of Culture would be recommending one property every year for nomination to UNESCO.

                In response to certain reports appearing recently in the media regarding ‘Adopt a Heritage’ Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) pertaining to Red Fort being ‘put on hold’, the Ministry of Culture has clarified that ‘Adopt a Heritage’ Scheme of the Government of India is making good progress. The scheme is being implemented by the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India. Secretary, Ministry of Culture, Shri Raghvendra Singh today said that under ‘Adopt a Heritage’ Scheme, three MoUs have already been signed and six are at an advanced stage and 31 more Adarsh Monuments are enlisted for coverage under the scheme. The Project aims to develop synergy among all partners to effectively promote “responsible tourism”, he added.

The schemes aims to involve public sector companies, private sector companies and corporate citizens/individuals to take up the responsibility for making our heritage and tourism more sustainable through development, operation and maintenance of world-class tourist infrastructure and amenities at ASI/ State heritage sites and other important tourist sites in India.

The Government has carried out Critical Gap Analysis in respect of the heritage monuments of importance and identified public conveniences and civic amenities which can be provided in these monuments with the involvement of corporate sector, PSUs etc. under the CSR activities to enhance visitor experience.

The project primarily focuses on providing basic amenities that includes cleanliness, public conveniences, drinking water, ease of access for differently abled and senior citizens, standardized signage, illumination and advanced amenities such as surveillance system, night viewing facilities, tourism facilitation center and an enhanced tourism experience that will result in more tourist footfalls, both domestic and foreign.

The response to the project has been very encouraging as the agencies who have come forward for adoption includes not only public and private industry/individuals but also schools and law firms.

Addressing mediapersons, Dr Mahesh Sharma said that India as well as the whole world is today facing the problem of pollution caused by excess plastic use. It is an historic moment that the message of Beat Plastic Pollution is being given from the iconic monument Taj Mahal not only to the people of Agra and the country but to the whole world. Dr Mahesh Sharma added that it is the dream of the Prime Minister , Shri Narendra Modi to achieve a Swachch Bharat . It is an appropriate occasion to spread Prime Minister’s  message from the Taj Mahal to reduce plastic use, re-use it, recycle plastic, re-collect, re-design and re-manufacture it and to demonstrate our commitment to reduction of pollution caused by plastic, Dr Mahesh Sharma elaborated. He further added that the Government is committed to wholistic development of Agra  in which the Centre, the state, local administration and all agencies will work under single umbrella and will also take along the common public of Agra in the process.

The coming together of the Centre, the state, local administration and all other stakeholders is heartening and hoped that Agra will soon take the shape of a smart , green city with commitment of all. 

Ms Diya Mirza also expressed happiness that all agencies together are taking forward the message of pollution free Taj Mahal which will also send a strong message to the world  about harmful effects of plastic pollution. To bring down the negative impact of pollution, it is responsibility of each individual to reduce plastic use in our everyday life, she added.

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to have transformative impact on national security. It is also seen that AI is essentially a dual use technology. While it can fuel technology driven economic growth, it also has potential to provide military superiority. India has strong IT industry and huge talent pool of engineers which are advantages which need to be leveraged. Ministry of Defence has already initiated the process of preparing Indian defence forces in their use of AI and how these capabilities can be increasingly developed within the country. 

 

To study the whole gamut of issues surrounding strategic implications of AI in national security perspective, in global context, a multi-stakeholder Task Force represented by members from the Government, Services, Academia, Industry Professionals and Start-ups was constituted in February 2018, under the Chairmanship of Shri N Chandrasekharan, Chairman, Tata Sons. The Task Force, on June 30, 2018 has handed over its Final Report with recommendations. The Task Force in its report has, inter alia,  


	
	
		Studied the level of AI/ML development in India in general and specific in the context of defence needs.
		Made recommendations of making India a significant power of AI in defence specifically in the area of aviation, naval, land systems, cyber, nuclear, and biological warfare; 
		Made recommendations for policy and institutional interventions that are required to regulate and encourage a robust AI based technologies for defence sector in the country.  
		Considering that most AI work is happening in private sector, made recommendations to work with start-ups/commercial industry in the field of use of AI for defence purposes.
	
	


 

As part of its deliberations, the Task Force had an intensive deliberations with all stakeholder representatives, including officers from Army, Navy, Airforce, Coast Guard, representatives of all Defence PSUs, namely BEL, HAL, BEML, BDL, MIDHANI, MDL, GRSE, GSL and HSL and OFB. Senior representatives from these organizations participated in the day long workshop to deliberate in-depth the various use-cases which are relevant from their respective needs. These discussions had led the Task Force to understand the potential military and civilian applications in AI domain. 

 

Raksha Mantri is the main promoter and patron of the AI Task Force of the Ministry of Defence. The Task Force handed over the Final Report to Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, today, for the Government to accept it and to implement its recommendations.

                Cdr Abhilash Tomy is ready for his second solo circumnavigation of the globe in a non-motorised sailboat. He sailed into Les Sables d'Olonne in France a few days ago, in time for the July 1 flag-off of the 30,000-mile Golden Globe Race. There are 18 skippers at the start line and Cdr Tomy of the Indian Navy is a special invitee at the race.

The race is being held to commemorate 50 years since it was held for the first and last time, which saw Sir Robin Knox-Johnston's successfully completing the voyage in 312 days, to become the first human to finish solo, unassisted and non stop circumnavigation of the world.

The biggest challenge at the GGR is to have equipment, tools and boat which resembles the one used by Sir Johntson,despite the change in technology. Navigation will have to be done looking at celestial objects using physical maps. Communication with the outside world will also be limited as the lone satellite phone is for use in medical emergency alone. Cdr Tomy had first circumnavigated the globe in 2012-13, becoming the first Indian to achieve the feat by sailing for 151 days in INS Mhadei. 

Starting from Les Sables d'Olonne, skippers will go south till Cape of Good Hope, continue sailing eastward in the southern hemisphere to pass the international dateline, and pass Cape of Horn to start sailing north in the Atlantic Ocean for the final leg. Cdr Tomy is aiming to complete the race in 311 days, one day less than Sir Johntson's timing.

He will be sailing in the 10-metre 'Thuriya', whose design is similar to Sir Johntson's boat 'Suhaili',which was incidentally manufactured in Colaba, Mumbai. ""Thuriya"" has been built at Goa at Ratnakar Dandekar's Aquarius Shipyard. Cdr Tomy has supplies consisting of specially-prepared food items, and fresh water in the limited space on board. 

Before sailing out for Les Sables d'Olonne, there were a series of events held in UK's Flymouth, from where the first race was flagged, where Sir Johntson was also present. In the two weeks to July 1, mandatory checks, including ones on safety, are being carried out and the sailors are getting the boat ready for the long-haul voyage. 

Cdr Tomy is being supported by the Indian Navy and Aquaris Shipyard for the race, while Cdr (Retd) Dilip Donde, the first Indian to circumnavigate the world with stops, will be overseeing as the base manager. 

Explaining the journey that awaits him, Cdr Abhilash said, ""At the Sagarparikrama (the first circumnavigation), I had used GPS-based maps and other satellite-based technologies. But at GGR, I have to make do with a compass, printed maps, and star and planetary movements. There is a solitary HF radio set for contact. The size of the boat limits the possibility to carry water. Sir Robin had used rain water and used it, I will have to do the same. There is no help from the outside world throughout the race.""

Here is a quick QnA with Cdr Abhilash:

 

1. Where are you now? Plan / schedule for next 8 days?

I was in a place called Medemblik in the Netherlands preparing the boat for the circumnavigation. I sailed out from there on the 5th of June alone and made it to Falmouth in the UK by the 10th of Jun. I was there as part of the Golden Globe Race (GGR) race activities such as race briefing etc. I left from there on the 14th morning and reached Les Sables d’Olonne, France on 17th June. The sail to Les Sables was with all the other entrants. There was a friendly race called the SITRAN cup.

The GGR race will start from Les Sables on 01 Jul. During our stay in Les Sables for next 10 days, we will have safety briefings, safety inspections, media, introductions, events etc. and of course boat preparations. 

 

2. About Boat & other preparation, what is done, what is pending

Most of the work is over. We had the first safety check yesterday and a few things need to be looked into as per the race organisers. Buying food is pending. And also buying some stuff such as stationary, toiletries etc. 

 

3. What are you carrying with you for this expedition

Lot of things are to be carried! It is an endless list.

- Almost 1000 meals, including MTR, freeze dry and tinned food

- A suit of 13 sails

- Two sextants

- Two taffrail logs

- Two automatic watches

- Three trackers

- Two satellite phones

- Lot of charts

- Lot of books

- An MF direction finder

- Two Short wave radio sets

- Lot of communication equipment

- Four 10 kg gas cylinders

- Lot of spares for the engine etc

- About 300 litres of water

- About 140 litres of fuel

 

There is also a major emphasis on safety due to which we are taking a lot of safety equipment with us. This is almost four times more than what i carried in my last round the world. There is also a lot of emphasis through regular briefings, safety checks etc from the organisers. MSOS will be providing the medical support while we are at sea.

 

4. About Sponsors

My entry is mainly sponsored by the Indian Navy. Aquarius Shipyard Ltd and Goa Shipyard Ltd are important supporter and sponsor. Equipment sponsors include Elcome (communications), Windpilot (autopilot), Decathlon (clothing and Jellyfish Water Sports (water maker)

 

5. How can people track your status

There are various ways to tract my status

- There will be 3 hourly position updates on GGR website

- There will be weekly sound bites on GGR website

- There will be one way text messages from me being posted on GGR website

- Updates will also be posted on my facebook page through a media team

6. Since when you are preparing for GGR - since 2016!

                To enhance efficiency and effectiveness of Defence Research establishments, Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman has decided to delegate greater financial powers to various authorities. This wind of change in Defence Research and Development (R&D) is intended to neutralise the ill-effects of over-centralisation and facilitate quicker decision making. This is in line with similar financial delegations made to Armed Forces in the last one year. The delegated powers now stands enhanced as under:-


	Powers of Secretary, Defence R&D to sanction projects and for procurements enhanced from Rs. 75 Crore to Rs. 150 Crore and for the Directors General (DG) enhanced from Rs. 50 Crore to Rs. 75 Crore
	Enhancement of powers for Proprietary Article Certificate (PAC) cases 
	
		From Rs. 50 Crore. to Rs. 150 Crore for Secretary Defence (R&D);
		From Rs. 25 Crore to Rs. 75 Crore to DGs;
		From Rs. 2 Crore to Rs. 5 Crore for Lab Directors.
	
	
	Enhancement of powers for Single Tender cases
	
		From Rs. 50 Crore to Rs. 75 Crore for Secretary Defence (R&D); 
		From Rs. 25 Crore to Rs. 37.5 Crore for DGs;
		From Rs. 1 Crore to Rs. 2.5 Crore for Lab Directors.
	
	
	All Competent Financial Authority empowered to reallocate funds, reduce and enhance costs of projects/programmes within their delegated powers.
	The powers of Director General (DG) have been enhanced from Rs. 3 Crore to Rs. 5 Crore for sanctioning Research projects to Universities, Technological Institutions and to Indigenous Defence Industry under the Technology Development Fund Scheme of DRDO.
	Powers of post-contract management and maintenance support in respect of contracts for which CFA is the Ministry of Defence, have been delegated to Directors General of DRDO in line with the delegations already made to the Armed Forces. 
	Delegations for Hygiene and Maintenance Contracts, training expenses, miscellaneous and contingent activities have been rationalized and enhanced to ensure that sanctions are given at the Director and DG levels with minimal flow of files to DRDO HQ. 


Consequently, the powers for sanctioning of projects and for procurements that were hitherto with the Secretary Defence R&D have now been delegated to the Directors General of DRDO and the delegation to the Secretary, Defence R&D has been doubled, A number of powers relating to day-to-day functioning that were centralized at DRDO HQ have now been delegated to the DGs and Lab Directors. The delegations also bring flexibility in Universities and by indigenous defence industry. All the  delegations that had been made in respect of the services have also been extended to the DRDO.

The Director Generals of DRDO has expressed their satisfaction at this major initiative by the Government and have opined that these forward-looking measures would ensure that majority of the decisions relating to  implementation and functioning would largely be taken within the technology clusters whereas policy issues would primarily come to the Government. Given the geographically dispersed Clusters and Laboratories, this will be greatly reduce file movements to and from the DRDO HQ at New Delhi and facilitate faster decision-making.

                To commemorate the 'Year of  Disabled Soldier in  Line of Duty', Indian Army  today honoured the soldiers who have been disabled while serving the nation in a seminar on 'Physical & Mental Issues of Disabled Soldiers' organised at Manekshaw Centre. The event was attended by disabled soldiers and veterans, along with serving soldiers, officers and ladies. This event was used as an opportunity to connect with injured Indian Army bravehearts and acknowledge their service to the Nation.

DGAFMS, Lt Gen Bipin Puri delivered the welcome address for the event which was presided over by Chief of Army Staff, Gen Bipin Rawat. The COAS emphasized on the need to recognize both the physical and mental aspects of the disability and providing comprehensive care to the disabled soldiers to help them reintegrate into the society. He also highlighted various disabled-friendly initiatives that have been taken in Armed Forces Hospitals.

On the occasion, Maj DP Singh (Retd), a Kargil war veteran and celebrity blade runner also shared his experiences with the audience. Other speakers included Col Sachin Saxena, Psychiatrist from Base Hospital Delhi and Col AS Kalra, Prosthetic Surgeon from Artificial Limb Centre, Pune. They spoke about the challenges faced by disabled soldiers and discussed the very pertinent issue of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD) that afflicts a large proportion of disabled soldiers.      

The aim of the Seminar was to provide an educative experience about the various stresses faced by the soldiers and their families, especially when a family member suffers from an injury leading to a devastating disability. A detailed account of various problems with special emphasis on effective solutions to combat them, was deliberated upon. This Seminar is one of the events which focuses to establish 'feel good' connect between disabled soldiers and the organisation and also aims to galvanise support for them.

                          For three months, starting 18 Jun 2018, the Indian Air Force would create an airbridge between Pithoragarh and Gunji, in an effort to airlift 1080 registered passengers to Gunji to enable them to continue their journey for the coveted annual Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.

          The requirement for the IAF to pitch in arose, when the MEA approached the MoD for air effort between the places where the connectivity was envisaged to be poor. “The IAF is ever ready to take over any task assigned by the Govt and thereafter ensures that it is executed in a most professional manner” said Air Cmde Pendse of Western Air Command, who is overlooking the operations.

          The command had been chosen by Air HQ for this task, especially due to the experience its heptr pilots have in flying in mountainous terrain and landing at high altitudes, given the fact that Gunji is at an altitude of 3100 mts above the sea level.

          “We have deployed three MLH class of heptrs at Pithoragarh which would be carrying approximately 60-80 passengers per day” said the task force commander positioned at Pithoragarh. The heptrs, from the Kirpan and Nubra Warrior units of the IAF, would be deployed for about three months catering for the return journey as well and would fly about 300 hrs in the duration of the operations.

Indian Army recognizes the inherent stress and strain on such soldiers & their dependents and has well established rehabilitation programmes and beneficiary schemes but these require to be reinforced. The Government is considering proposal of major grant to establish a separate fund which can be further enhanced by contributions from individuals, establishments and corporate sector thus facilitating meaningful initiatives for disabled soldiers.  

Indian Army plans to create awareness on organizational support available to soldiers and their dependents with respect to medical, rehabilitation, various beneficiary schemes of Central and State Governments, vocational opportunities and assistance for their placement. Indian Army also plans to showcase talent of disabled soldiers by organizing sports and physical activities, cultural events and their art exhibitions. These disabled soldiers have inspiring deeds behind them, hence, it is planned to felicitate them along with selected organizations which dedicate in their rehabilitation.

Management of disabled soldiers is an onerous responsibility. Indian Army plans to galvanise due support for the unemployable disabled soldier, his wife and his family with initial financial support to ensure a life of dignity through partially-funded entrepreneurship venture.

                The blue skies of Air Force Academy turned vibrant with a colourful march-past by the passing out Cadets on the ground and amazing aerobatics in the air by various aircraft of Indian Air Force on Saturday, which marked the momentous occasion of the graduation of 113 Flight Cadets as Flying Officers of the Indian Air Force which included 13 women officers. The ceremony also marked commissioning of another woman fighter pilot, Flying Officer Meghana Shanbough, in the IAF. Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa, the Chief of Air Staff (CAS) graced the solemn ceremony as the Chief Guest and reviewed the Combined Graduation Parade.  The Chief Guest was received by Air Marshal SRK Nair, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Training Command and Air Marshal Amit Tiwari, Commandant  Air Force Academy.

 

A total number of 113 Flight Cadets including 13 women cadets were commissioned as Flying Officers, at their alma-mater, the Air Force Academy, the ‘Cradle of IAF Leadership’ that has moulded generations of prodigious aviation leaders.  It was also indeed a proud moment for 80 young pilots, 06 navigators and 27 ground duty officers who earned their coveted ‘Wings and Brevets’, along with 06 officers of Indian Navy and 05 officers of Indian Coast Guard on successful completion of their flying training.  The CAS gave away various awards to the Flying Officers who had excelled in their training.  Flying Officer Tarun Nair from the Flying branch was awarded President’s Plaque and the Chief of the Air Staff ‘Sword of Honour’ for standing first in Overall Merit in Pilot Course. Flying Officer Abhishek Bajpai and Flying Officer Banti were awarded President’s Plaque for being first in overall merit in Navigation and Ground Duty branches respectively.

 

The grand event was witnessed by esteemed guests who included proud parents of the graduating trainees, various military and civilian dignitaries and few foreign Defence Attaches. The ceremony began with the sky diving by the ‘Akash Ganga’ Team, enthralling the spectators by dotting the skies of Dundigal with tri- colours and precise landing right in front of them in the parade square. Spectators were held spellbound by the spectacular movements of the Air Warriors Drill Team, the ‘Nishan Toli’ marching-past with the ‘President’s Colours’ of the Academy and impressive Parade by the graduating trainees. The spectators were awestruck by the breath-taking aerobatics of highly experienced and skilled pilots of Suryakiran Aerobatic team, ‘Sarang’ the Helicopter Aerobatics Team, and PC 7 MK-II of the IAF.

 

The Reviewing Officer was accorded ceremonial salute by the Cadets followed by an impressive march past.  The highpoint of the parade was the ‘Pipping Ceremony’. The Flight Cadets were awarded their ‘Stripes’ (Air Force rank) by the Chief Guest, the AOC-in-C Training Command and Commandant, Air Force Academy.  They were then administered the ‘Oath of Service’ (the Pledge) by the Commandant of the Academy in the presence of the Chief Guest, Parents and other dignitaries.

 

Later, addressing the Parade, the Chief of Air Staff complimented the newly Commissioned ‘Flying Officers’ for an exceptional standard of parade.  Congratulating the passing-out Cadets the Air Chief said, “It is a matter of pride and honour to review the Combined Graduation Parade and welcome the fine men and women into the Indian Air Force as Military Aviation leaders”. Keeping in view the changing geo-political and strategic environment and varied security challenges faced by India, he urged the young officers to remain in heightened state of preparedness by dynamically adapting to the continuously changing environment. While bringing out that our country is going through a transformational shift to continuously modernise its forces, he told them to widen their horizon and keep pace with the swiftly advancing technology to exploit the true potential of the Aerospace Power. He advised the Cadets to focus on the core values of the IAF- Mission, Integrity and Excellence and to be an inspiration for today’s young generation through selfless service and devotion to duty.He also reminded the Cadets that the task cut out for the Defence forces is painstakingly challenging one and the task of IAF is to defend our aerospace in addition to supporting the people by providing them succor in times of natural calamities. He told the newly commissioned officers that they must serve as role models to the men under their command and hence they must keep themselves mentally agile, physically fit and professionally updated. In conclusion, he exhorted the newly Commissioned Officers to constantly strive to improve their professional qualifications and expand skill levels failing which they will become outdated.

 

All the Flight Cadets were imparted their initial basic training at AFA for six months (known as Stage–I) and subsequently undergo professional and advanced training at various Air Force Stations namely  Hakimpet, Begumpet and Yelahanka  besides AFA itself, based on their area of specialization, for another six months (known as Stage–II). After completion of both the stages of training, they re-assemble at Air Force Academy, Dundigal for the ‘Combined Graduation Parade’ from the portals of the majestic “Sekhon Block”, a landmark building named after Flying Officer Nirmaljit Singh Sekhon, Param Vir Chakra. 

 

The glittering ceremony  culminated with the newly Commissioned Officers marching-out  in two columns in slow march to the traditional notes of ‘Auld Lang Syne’, the poignant farewell tune played by Armed Forces of the world when bidding adieu to colleagues and comrades, proudly  acknowledging the first salute given to them by their immediate juniors. They marched in absolute synchrony and with purposeful strides as they saluted the Reviewing Officer and crossed through the portals of their alma mater to take-on their future assignments and challenges unstintingly to “Touch the Sky with Glory”.

                In a daring and  complex operation, a  Seaking 42 C helicopter from the   Eastern Naval Command  winched down  one MARCO officer on the ill-fated  merchant vessel SSL KOLKATA which had been on fire since the last two days and abandoned by the 22 crew members on 14 Jun18 off the Sagar Island at the mouth of the Ganges Delta. 

The Marine Commando Officer  ascertained the conditions in the forward part of the ship and later called in the helicopter to lower onbord three crew members of the ship.   The team managed to drop the starboard anchor from the ship to prevent her from drifting any further. 

Thereafter the team prepared the seamanship gear for the ship to be towed if required. 

The LIVE nature of the threat was evident from the explosion onboard in the forenoon which restarted the fire. 

The helo skillfully recovered all four members of the team and is returning base for turnaround.

Earlier, VAdm Karambir Singh , Flag Officer Commanding- in-Chief Eastern Naval Command had directed that the ship drift towards the Sundarbans delta had to be stopped at all costs notwithstanding the high temperatures onboard to avoid an ecological disaster should the ship capsize on the sandbanks causing pollution from oil on board. 

Accordingly, a Seaking 42C helicopter and a Dornier aircraft were despatched from Visakhapanam  with a core  team comprising divers, Marcos, shipwrights and seamanship specialists to stage through the IAF airbase at Kalaikonda.

 Simultaneously, the Naval Officer-in-charge West Bengal  laised with the officials of the DG Shipping, ICG, KOPT, the ship owners, Agents and Salvage specialists at Kolkata and kept them informed of the plans.

 INS Kadmat which was exercising in the Bay of Bengal on 15 Jun 18 was   directed to proceed at best speed and arrived on site at first light this morning ie 16 Jun 18 to augment the on site support wherein the ICG ships were also standing by.

The operation this morning has successfully managed to arrest further drift of the ship to enable salvage operations by the company.

Besides promoting understanding and inter-operability between the two armies, it further helped in cementing ties between both the nations.

                Project Kashmir Super 50, a joint initiative by Indian Army, Center for Social Responsibility and Leadership (CSRL) and PETRONET LNG Limited (PLL) was launched on 22 March 2013 to transform the educational status of children from economically weaker sections in the Kashmir region.  As part of the 11-month program, selected students are provided with complete free residential coaching for IIT-JEE, JKCET and other premier Engineering Institutes.

The outgoing batch is the fifth batch of Kashmir Super 50 which had 45 boys based in Srinagar and five girl students based in Noida.  Out of which this year, 32 students (30 boys and 02 girls) have cleared IIT-JEE Mains and seven students have cleared IIT-JEE Advance. 

 Kashmir Super 50 has been one of the most successful projects undertaken by the Indian Army in the valley and has directly impacted the lives of number of youths in J&K by providing them the right guidance and opportunity to make a career for themselves. The project has equally helped the families of these youths in their growth and prosperity. It is a major initiative towards bringing normalcy in the valley.

A group of 30 students, part of Kashmir Super 50 visited New Delhi and interacted with General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Army Staff on 12 Jun 18. The General shared his experiences while serving in these areas, with the students and motivated them to work hard & contribute actively in the nation building process.

On similar lines of Kashmir Super 50 for engineering aspirants, Indian Army has recently signed a MoU for medical aspirants with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) & National Integrity Educational Development Organisation (NIEDO), under which selected students will be provided with complete free residential coaching for National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).

                            Indian Naval Ships Sahyadri, Shakti and Kamorta of the Eastern Fleet under the command of Rear Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, NM, Flag Officer Commanding, Eastern Fleet currently on an overseas deployment to South East Asia and the Western Pacific, arrived at Guam on 07 June 18 to participate in the 22nd edition of Exercise Malabar, off Guam, USA from 07 to 16 June 2018. 

 

            Exercise Malabar, which started as a bilateral exercise between the US Navy and the Indian Navy in 1992, has evolved over the years with the participation of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) from 2007. Over the last 26 years, this Maritime Exercise has grown in scope and complexity and aims at increasing the level of mutual understanding, inter-operability and sharing of the best practices between the three navies. Malabar 17 was held in July last year on the Eastern Sea Board of India, off Chennai and Visakhapatnam. It is for the first time that the exercise is being conducted off Guam, a major US Naval Base in the Western Pacific. It would be of interest to note that the US has recently named their Hawaii-based Pacific Command as the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.

 

            The scope of the MALABAR-18 includes professional interactions during the Harbour Phase in Guam from 07 to 10 June 18. The Sea Phase from 11 to 16 June 2018 includes a diverse range of activities at sea including Aircraft Carrier operations, Air Defence, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Surface Warfare, Visit Board Search and Seizure (VBSS), joint manoeuvres and tactical procedures.

 

            The Indian Navy will be represented by the two indigenously designed and built ships, the multi-purpose stealth frigate INS Sahyadri and Anti-Submarine Warfare corvette, INS Kamorta as also by Fleet Tanker INS Shakti and Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft P8I. The US Navy forces will include the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, USS Ronald Reagan with its air wing; two Ticonderoga class cruisers, USS Antietam and USS Chancellorsville; two Arleigh Burke class destroyers, USS Benfold and USS Mustin; a Los Angeles-class attack submarine and one Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft P8A. The JMSDF would be represented by a Hyuga class helicopter carrier JS Ise with integral helicopters; Takanami class destroyer JS Suzunami; Akizuki class destroyer JS Fuyuzuki. Japanese Maritime Patrol Aircraft, P1 and a submarine.

                The Seventh Pay Commission has awarded monetary compensation to jawans for allowing purchase of personal clothing items of uniform to be purchased under arrangement to be made by the Army. An annual remuneration of Rs 10,000/- has been paid to all jawans in lieu of selected items of personal clothing. Accordingly, Army has made arrangements for purchase of quality cloth to be made available through CSD outlets and stitching to be carried out under unit arrangements or any other means that the individual jawans may wish to get their clothing stitched as per authorized specifications. This provision is applicable to Central Armed Police Forces as well. It is, therefore, incorrect and inappropriate to single out Army on this issue through inadequately researched articles in the media.

                             The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, met here today and accorded approval for the procurement of equipment for the Defence Forces valued at over Rs 5500 crore.

            Pursuing the goal of indigenisation and self-reliance in the field of Defence Procurements, the DAC approved procurement of 12 High Power Radars for the Indian Air Force under ‘Buy (Indian) IDDM’ category. The radars will provide long range medium and high altitude radar cover with the capability to detect and track high speed targets following parabolic trajectories. Technologically superior, the radars will have the capability to scan 360o without mechanical rotation of Antenna and will operate on 24 x 7 basis with minimal maintenance requirement. Their procurement will enhance the overall efficacy of the Air Defence network in the country.

            The DAC also accorded approval for procurement of Air Cushion Vehicles (ACVs) for the Indian Coast Guard and Indian Army from Indian Shipyard. These vessels would offer great advantage over conventional boats/crafts with their ability to travel at very high speeds over shallow water, sand banks, mud flats and swamps which are non-navigable by boats/small crafts due to draught restrictions/uncharted depths. These craft offer capability enhancement for the Services, and would prove useful for amphibious/ riverine operations, especially where there is a requirement to move men and material from one island to another island, across riverine terrain, creeks etc.

                Indian Naval Ship Sunayana entered Porbandar harbour at 0900 hrs today on 07 Jun 2018 after successfully evacuating 38 Indian Nationals at/ off Socotra Islands during a swift Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Operation (HADR), code named Operation NISTAR.

The Indian Nationals were stranded for nearly ten days after severe Cyclonic Storm – Mekunu devastated the area around Socotra Island. INS Sunayna was diverted from Gulf of Aden deployment to Socotra Island for search and rescue operations after Indian Navy received a distress call from Directorate General of Shipping and Indian Sailing Vessels Association. The 38 Indian nationals were successfully rescued/ evacuated in the early morning of 03 Jun 2018. All evacuees were safely embarked onboard the ship and were immediately provided with medical care, food, water and telephone facilities. Thereafter, the ship also undertook intensive surface search and aerial reconnaissance of the area to look for any more survivors.

Upon entering harbour INS Sunayna was received by Rear Admiral Sanjay Roye, Flag Officer Commanding Gujarat, Daman & Diu Naval Area. After initial briefing about the scheduled disembarkation formalities, all 38 Indian nationals were put through mandatory customs clearance and immigration checks. They were served light refreshments. Post completion of all the administrative formalities, they were handed over to the civil police to facilitate their return to native places.

                 INS Kulish, a Kora class Missile Corvette commanded by Commander Deepak Bali and one Dornier Maritime Patrol Aircraft of the Andaman and Nicobar Command arrived at Belawan, Indonesia for the closing ceremony of the 31st edition of the India – Indonesia Coordinated Patrol (IND-INDO CORPAT) from 06 to 09 Jun 18. The opening ceremony of IND-INDO CORPAT was earlier conducted from 24 - 25 May 18 at Port Blair followed by co-ordinated patrol (CORPAT) from 26 May to 02 Jun 18.

 

The visit of the Indian Naval Ship seeks to underscore India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain and to strengthen existing bonds between India and Indonesia. During the stay in harbour, various activities such as official calls, formal reception on board ship, sporting fixture, ship open to visitors and professional interaction between naval personnel of both the nations have been planned.

 

Indian Naval assets have been increasingly deployed in recent times to address the main maritime concerns of the region. In addition, as part of the Indian Government’s vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with EEZ surveillance, Search and Rescue, HADR and other capacity-building and capability-enhancement activities. The current deployment will contribute towards the Indian Navy’s efforts to consolidate inter-operability and forge strong bonds of friendship across the seas.

 

The delegation is led by senior officer from Indian Navy, Commodore Ashutosh Ridhorkar, Naval Component Commander, Andaman and Nicobar Command embarked onboard INS Kulish.

                The Indian Naval Ships Sahyadri, Shakti and Kamorta of the Eastern Fleet under the command of Rear Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, NM, Flag Officer Commanding, Eastern Fleet, currently on an overseas deployment to South East Asia and the Western Pacific, would be participating in the 22nd edition of Exercise Malabar, off Guam, USA from 07 to 16 June 2018. The three Indian Naval Ships are scheduled to reach Guam on 07 June 18 for the Harbour Phase of the exercise. It is for the first time the Malabar Exercise is being conducted at/ off Guam, a US Territory. Malabar 2017 was held in July last year on the Eastern Sea Board of India, off Chennai and Visakhapatnam. Malabar 2018 will have the participation of navies from India, the US and Japan.

            Over the last 26 years, this Maritime Exercise has grown in scope and complexity and aims to address the variety of shared threats and challenges to maritime security in the Indo-Pacific. Further, the exercise contributes towards increasing the level of mutual understanding, inter-operability and sharing of the best practices between the three navies.

            The scope of the MALABAR-18 includes professional interactions during the Harbour Phase in Guam from 07 to 10 June 18. The Sea Phase from 11 to 16 June 2018 includes a diverse range of activities at sea including Aircraft Carrier operations, Air Defence, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Surface Warfare, Visit Board Search and Seizure (VBSS), Joint Manoeuvres and Tactical procedures.

            The Indian Navy will be represented by the two indigenously designed and built ships, the multi-purpose stealth frigate INS Sahyadri and Anti-Submarine Warfare corvette, INS Kamorta, Fleet Tanker INS Shakti and Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft P8I. The US Navy forces will include the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, USS Ronald Reagan with its air wing; two Ticonderoga class cruisers, USS Antietam and USS Chancellorsville; two Arleigh Burke class destroyers, USS Benfold and USS Mustin; a Los Angeles-class attack submarine and one Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft P8A. The JMSDF would be represented by a Hyuga class helicopter carrier JS Ise with integral helicopters; Takanami class destroyer JS Suzunami; Akizuki class destroyer JS Fuyuzuki. Japanese Maritime Patrol Aircraft, P1 and a submarine.

            It would be of interest to note that US has recently named their Hawaii-based Pacific Command as the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.

                            Indian Navy has completed four years of its Green Initiatives Program on World Environment Day. The adoption of a comprehensive ‘Indian Navy Environment Conservation Roadmap’ has put Indian Navy on an ambitious path of synergising ‘Blue Water capability with a Green footprint’. The Navy’s concerted efforts of formulation and implementation of numerous policies aimed towards energy efficiency and environmental protection have yielded good results which are evident in all naval establishments.

            With an aim to achieve zero carbon foot print, ‘Energy Efficiency’ concept of sustainable green technologies/norms based on GRIHA, LEEDS, Green Fuels, MARPOL compliance and alternative energy resources are being adopted in all future plans for augmentation and acquisition of assets/ infrastructure. In an endeavour towards fulfilment of ‘Paperless Office’, initiatives undertaken in the field of IT through digital work processes have ensured gross reduction in paper consumption.  Towards continuous afforestation, 16000 saplings have been planted over the course of the preceding year eventually to mitigate an estimated 324 tonnes of CO2.

            As maritime efficiency initiative, the feasibility of inclusion of an ‘Intelligent Energy cum Performance assessment’ system onboard Naval vessels is underway. The intelligent system will provide real time awareness of the onboard energy demand for optimising the overall performance. Guidelines for MARPOL compliance, onboard effluents discharge, waste disposal, sewage treatment plants etc have been adopted to minimise the environmental impact both at sea and ashore.

            Regular energy audits for ships and shore establishments are being conducted for improving the energy efficiency. One of the premier Naval Yards has achieved a decrease of 11% in energy consumption compared to the last financial year. 95 percent of conventional street lights of the repair yards have been replaced with LED lights and over 1000 have been changed over with Smart timer based street light. 21 MW Solar PV projects have been undertaken with meticulous planning by Indian Navy towards achieving the GOI target of 100 GW by 2022 under Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM). 

            The progressive adoption of Battery Operated Vehicles for transportation of men and material has marked the reduction of dependence on fossils fuels thus reducing carbon emissions. Oil Manufacturing Companies have also been approached for consistent supply of B5 blend HSD at all naval establishments for pan Navy usage on MT vehicles.

            It is indeed a proud moment for all Indians that this year we have been chosen to host the ‘World Environment Day- 2018’ with the theme as ‘Beat Plastic Pollution’. The production of plastic in the last decade has already surpassed the total plastic production of the entire last century. Every year, the world uses 500 billion plastic bags which contribute to 10 % of all the waste being generated. Towards the same, continuous and focused efforts are being put in place to ensure that the Naval establishments remains devoid of non-biodegradable material at all times.  Awareness drives and programme by means of plantation drives, beach clean-up, anti-plastic drives, lectures etc are being organised regularly for integration of the philosophy of environmental consciousness amongst all echelons of the Service.

            As a part of ‘Swacchh Bharat Abhiyaan’ Segregated Waste Collection Centre (SWCC) was inaugurated with the support from Defence Wives Welfare Association (DWWA) at Port Blair, which incorporated modern methods of waste collection and management system. Segregated wet garbage at an average of 400 kg is received per day for processing at SWCC. Mrs Seema Verma, President DWWA was awarded National Award for ‘Swatchtha Hi Sewa’  for implementation of the SWCC effectively.

            As a developing nation and growing defence force of the modern world, it is imperative to take cognizance of our surroundings and invaluable natural resources.  With a view to reduce the overall carbon footprint and to bring down the effects of global warming, Indian Navy is ‘Geared Up and Committed’ to march towards pursuance of Green Initiatives, realising the national aim, to ensure a ‘Greener and Cleaner future for our next generations’.

                In response to a distress call received from the DG shipping and the Indian Sailing Vessels Association, Indian Naval Ship Sunayna, currently deployed for a mission based deployment in the Gulf of Aden, was directed to evacuate 38 Indian nationals stranded on the Yemeni island of Socotra in the aftermath of cyclone Mekenu.

A very Severe Cyclonic Strom Mekenu crossed the Yemeni Island of Socotra on 24 May 18, leaving the 38 Indians stranded on the island with limited food and water. Also, three Indian dhows at Socotra suffered damages/ sank alongside in the harbour and another Dhow, MSV Safina Al Khijar with 12 Indians onboard is reported to be missing.

Based on this information, the Indian Navy undertook two aerial sorties on 27 and 28 May 18 to search for the missing 18 Indians. INS Sunayna, deployed on a mission based deployment in the Gulf of Aden was pressed into action to evacuate the 38 Indian nationals from Socotra. The operation, code name 'NISTAR', was carried out on the morning of 03 Jun 18 off the coast of Socotra. The evacuated Indians were embarked onboard and immediately provided with medical care, food, water and telephone facilities to call and reassure their families at home. All 38 have been reported to be safe. Post evacuation, the ship would be proceeding towards Porbandar to disembark the Indians ashore

                Sikkim tribals, represented by Sikkim Limboo-Tamang Apex
Committee, today approached Union Minister for Development of Northeast (DoNER), Dr Jitendra Singh,requesting him to take up with the Government of India, the issue of reservation of seats for them in the State Assembly.
 
In a meeting, the delegation led by Shri C B Subba, former Speaker Sikkim Legislative Assembly and Chairman of the Committee, it was submitted before the Minister that the Government of India may take necessary steps for the reservation of seats in the Sikkim Legislative Assembly for Limboo and Tamang Scheduled Tribes of the State under Article 332 read with Article 371 F(f) of the Constitution of India. They also requested that the appropriate decision may be taken at the earliest so that the provision of reserved seats may be available before the upcoming Assembly elections in the State next year.
 
The members of the delegation also handed over to the DoNER Minister, a copy of the letter written by Chief Minister of Sikkim, Shri Pawan Chamling, recommending the provision to provide seats to the Limboo and Tamang tribes of the State under Article 332 of the Constitution.
 
In a separate memorandum submitted to Dr Jitendra Singh, the members of the delegation argued that the said tribal community in the State of Sikkim nurses a sense of deprivation of their political and fundamental rights, ever since they had been declared as Scheduled Tribes in 2003 under article 342 of the Constitution. They requested that the issue be taken up early so that they do not have to suffer further injustice or sense of discrimination.
 
The memorandum asked for  suitable Parliament legislation or Ordinance to provide a minimum of five reserved seats in the Sikkim Legislative Assembly for the Limboo Scheduled Tribes. This, according to them, would promote peace, harmony in the border State.
 
Dr Jitendra Singh gave a patient hearing to the points raised by the delegation. He said, since the matter pertains primarily to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs and to the other concerned Ministries, he would forward this memorandum accordingly and also take up the issue with the concerned Ministries.

This amount includes Rs.239.40 crore by way of the first installment of central share of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and Rs.101 crore as the contribution from the Ministry of Northeast (DoNER).

Dr Jitendra Singh was presiding over a high-level meeting between the Union Ministry of Northeast (DoNER) and the State Government of Assam to assess the current situation of flood in Assam and the relief measures undertaken so far. Among others, the meeting was attended by Assam Minister for Water Resources Shri Keshab Mahanta, Assam Minister for Revenue Shri Bhabesh Kalita, Secretary DoNER Shri Naveen Verma, Chief Secretary of Assam Ms T.Y. Das and other senior officers from the Ministry of DoNER and the State Government of Assam.

Speaking after the presentation made by the State Government, Dr Jitendra Singh said, heavy rainfall and flood has virtually become a regular annual feature in Assam, but, this year, we are faced with early rains and early flood. Nevertheless, he complimented the State Government for their prompt response in timely undertaking all the required measures which helped in containing further loss to life and property.

Dr Jitendra Singh expressed his condolence to the bereaved families of 26 persons who were reported dead till last evening, as a result of the flood situation. He said, even though there could not be any compensation for the loss of life, everything would be done to help the State Government to meet the natural calamity.

The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi always has a special concern for Northeast, said Dr Jitendra Singh and added that the Prime Minister accords high priority to all the issues related to the region. He recalled that on 1st of August last year, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi personally traveled to Guwahati where he convened separate meetings with the State Administration of the flood-affected States and announced flood-relief of Rs. 2,000 crore. On his personal behalf as well as on behalf of the Ministry of DoNER and Government of India, Dr Jitendra Singh assured full assistance to the State Government. He said that the Union Government is monitoring the flood situation in the affected States of Northeast on a day-to-day basis.

Striking a note of caution, Dr Jitendra Singh forewarned about the possibility of epidemic diseases in the aftermath of flood and suggested that appropriate preemptive measures can be initiated in advance. Like in earlier years, he suggested that the government can involve the Health Ministry also to arrange for measures like chlorination of water, maintenance of hygiene and availability of appropriate medicinal drugs.

The agenda of the discussion included Border Area Development Programme (BADP) and Chakma Council’s demand that it should be involved in the planning and implementation of various schemes under BADP of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Chakma Autonomous Development Council is situated on the International Border with Bangladesh in the West and Myanmar in the South, which makes it strategically important area, calling for special attention.

 

Shri Shanti Jiban also brought to the notice of Dr Jitendra Singh, their listed demand for setting up a Chakma House in the national capital of New Delhi. He requested that the Government of India may kindly allot a government building for use as Chakma House

 

Chakma Council Chief also handed over a memorandum to the DoNER Minister, which, among other things, called for amendment of the 6th Schedule of the Constitution, in order to provide more administrative power and financial support to the Council. Another issue related to a number of teachers recruited from time to time on fixed pay basis and a request was made for the revision of their salaries.

 

Shri Shanti Jiban Chakma also handed over to Dr Jitendra Singh, relevant papers relating to the allocation of funds as the financial grant for the modernisation of Kamalanagar.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh listened to the issues raised by the Chakma Council Chief and his team. He said, since most of the issues were not being directly dealt by the Ministry of DoNER, he would try to take up the issues with the relevant Departments in the Ministry of Home Affairs, NITI Aayog and the Mizoram State Government.

To various issues raised by the members of the Consultative Committee regarding the need for expanding markets, Dr Jitendra Singh remarked that the Ministry of DoNER was also exploring areas of collaboration with other Ministries so as to tap domestic and international market.

He also extended his support for investment by private sector through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in health sector. 

Later, addressing the media persons, Dr Jitendra Singh said that Government was committed to ensure that the ‘east’ grows at the same pace as the ’west’ for which efforts are being taken to improve the physical and social infrastructure in all the states of NE. He said that it was first time in the history of North-East that two states, - Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, were connected by rail. Referring to various progressive steps taken by the Ministry with regard to StartUp and StandUp India, the Minister said that youth not only from the region but also from outside the state were getting attracted towards opportunities of entrepreneurship in the region.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal of Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) for the nomination of the Union Home Minister as ex-officio Chairman of North Eastern Council (NEC) - a statutory body with Governors and Chief Ministers of all the eight North Eastern States as its Member. The Cabinet also approved that Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of DoNER would serve as Vice Chairman of the Council.

 

Impact:

          NEC implements various projects through the State and Central agencies. Under the new arrangement with Home Minister as Chairman and Minister of DoNER as Vice Chairman, NEC and all the Governors and Chief Ministers of North Eastern States as Member would provide a forum for discussing inter-state matters more comprehensively and also consider common approaches to be taken in future.

 

          NEC can now also perform the tasks undertaken by the various Zonal Councils to discuss such inter-State issues as drug trafficking, smuggling of arms and ammunition, boundary disputes etc.

 

          This repositioning of NEC will help it to become a more effective body for the North Eastern Region.

 

          The Council shall, from time to time, review the implementation of the projects/schemes included in the project; recommend effective measures for coordination among the state Governments for these projects etc. The Council shall have such powers as may be delegated to it by the Central Government.

 

Background:

          NEC was established under the North Eastern Council Act, 1971 as an apex level body for securing balanced and coordinated development and facilitating coordination with the States. Subsequent to the Amendment of 2002, NEC has been mandated to function as a regional planning body for the North Eastern Area and while formulating a regional plan for this area, shall give priority to the schemes and projects benefiting two or more states provided that in the case of Sikkim, the Council shall formulate specific projects and schemes for that State.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh​ has mooted ""Make in Northeast"" initiative, as a follow-up to the ""Make in India"" initiative inspired by Prime Minister Sh Narendra Modi. He also offered to collaborate with all the stakeholders to give each of the eight States of the region an exclusive identity of its own, based on the unique product identified with each of these States. 

Associated Chambers of Commerce of India (ASSOCHAM) Secretary General, Sh D.S. Rawat called on Dr Jitendra Singh  here today. He offered to contribute by coordinating between the government and the various business houses and trade organizations for the success of this initiative.

During the meeting, Dr Jitendra Singh said that he has always felt that, instead of the various States of the region being casually referred as North Eastern States, each of the eight States, can be developed as an identity on its own, to be known by its own name. For example, he said, Sikkim can be developed as the ""Organic State of India"", Mizoram as the ""Bamboo State of India"", Manipur as the ""Textiles State of India"" and so on.

In the last four years, with the personal indulgence of Prime Minister Sh Narendra Modi, Dr Jitendra Singh said, there has been a fast-track progress in providing the connectivity and transport infrastructure in the region. This, he said, has prompted traders and investors from the rest of the country and even abroad to come forward and explore the unexplored entrepreneurship potential in the region. What is now required, he said, is to evolve an institutionalized mechanism to ensure a streamlined approach to achieve this objective optimally.

Dr Jitendra Singh said, the ""Make in Northeast"" approach will not only generate the revenue and livelihood opportunities in the region, but it would also reinforce the Government of India's ""Act East"" policy. For example, he said, only a produce grown in Arunachal Pradesh or Nagaland can find customers and consumers in countries across eastern borders like Myanmar, because of the common lifestyle, common food habits and common culture. He referred to the new ""Fruit Court"" started in Mizoram from March this year with the Israel collaboration. He said, further scope of ""Public-Private Participation"" (PPP) ventures will also be worked out by the Ministry of Northeast (DoNER) in a manner that it proves to be mutually beneficial to all.

The role of institutions like the North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Ltd (NEDFi), North East Small Finance Bank Ltd (NESFB) or the recently introduced ""North-East Venture Fund"" can also be improvised and made more inclusive to attract investors and manufacturers who have the know-how to contribute in supplementing the exclusive identity of each State and the region, thus enriching the brand of ""Make in Northeast"".

                Ten new heritage sites of the country today firmed up action plans for raising their sanitation standards to exemplary levels. These Places are Sri Raghavendra Swami Mutt Mantralayam (Andhra Pradesh), Hazarduari Palace (West Bengal), Shri Brahma Sarovar Temple (Haryana), Vidur Kuti Temple (Uttar Pradesh), Mana village (Uttarakhand), Pangong Tso (Jammu and Kashmir), Shri Nag Vasuki Temple (Uttar Pradesh), Nupi Keithel (Manipur), Sree Dharma Sastha Temple (Kerala) and Kanvashram (Uttarakhand), which constitute Phase-III of the Swachh Iconic Places (SIP) initiative of the Swachh Bharat Mission, coordinated by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. 

The plans were formulated at a two-day consultation in Hyderabad held between Central and State Government agencies, local administrations and the Trusts/ Boards of the iconic places. In all, over 100 delegates from across the country attended the consultation. All the thirty Swachh Iconic Places selected so far under the initiative resolved to make their sites completely free of plastic at the event.

Simultaneously a review was done of the work already taken up at the 20 Phase-I and Phase-II Swachh Iconic Places. Work under Phase-I started in 2016 at Meenakshi Temple (Tamil Nadu), Ajmer Sharif Dargah (Rajasthan), Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus (Maharashtra), Shree Jagannath Temple (Odisha), Manikarnika Ghat (Uttar Pradesh), Golden Temple (Punjab), Kamakhya Devi Shrine (Assam), Taj Mahal (Uttar Pradesh), Shri Mata Vaisho Devi Temple (Jammu and Kashmir) and Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (Andhra Pradesh). 

Another ten sites, Shree Mahakaleshwar Temple (Madhya Pradesh), Charminar (Telangana), Convent & Church of St. Francis of Asisi (Goa), Somnath Temple (Gujarat), Gomateshwara Statue (Karnataka), Kalady (Kerala), Gangotri Temple (Uttarakhand), Yamunotri Temple (Uttarakhand), Gaya Teerth (Bihar) and Baidyanath Temple (Jharkhand) were taken up in 2017 under Phase-II. 

The Swachh Iconic Places initiative aims to achieve a distinctly higher level of sanitation at these places, especially in the peripheries and approach areas. Following the clarion call by the Prime Minister to make Swachhata everybody’s business, the Centre and selected States have taken up joint efforts for making the country’s iconic places Swachh. The special Swachhata initiatives at these places have received CSR support from public and private companies.

Presiding over the consultation and review, Secretary of Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, expressed satisfaction over the progress made by this unique inter-sectoral initiative. He called for more coordinated work among all stakeholders and an escalation of IEC activities for involving local people and visitors at the iconic sites. The SIP participants from across the country, along with Shri Iyer, visited the sanitation works being planned around Charminar in Hyderabad under the SIP project. 

Director General, Special Projects, Swachh Bharat Mission, Shri Akshay Rout, made a presentation on the progress of work at various iconic sites over last two years. A film and a brochure covering the 30 iconic sites were launched on the occasion. The extensive Swachhata related efforts at these iconic places were exhibited at the consultation.

                A National Consultation on the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) and Swajal was held in the Capital today to discuss the reforms needed in NRDWP and to outline a road map for the Swajal scheme. The consultation was chaired by the Union Minister of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Sushri Uma Bharti. The Minister of State for Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Ramesh Jigajinagi, was also present. Ministers-in-charge of Drinking Water from 13 States, including Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, attended the consultation and gave their views on the reforms needed in the ongoing Centrally-sponsored drinking water schemes being implemented in the respective states.

Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation announced that Swajal schemes in 115 aspirational districts of the country will involve an outlay of Rs 700 crores through flexi-funds under the existing NRDWP budget. These schemes will aim to provide villages with piped water supply powered by solar energy. The scheme will train hundreds of rural technicians for operation and maintenance of Swajal units. The Minister spoke about the relevance of Swajal in remote rural areas in the aspirational districts of the country.

The Minister also announced the modernisation of 2000 water quality testing laboratories spread across the country. She urged the State Ministers to closely monitor the functioning of the water laboratories so as to ensure safe drinking water for rural Indians. She further said that Rs.1000 crores will be earmarked for addressing the drinking water needs of 27,544 arsenic and fluoride affected habitations of the country in this financial year under the National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM). She also highlighted the importance of rain water harvesting and water conservation, announcing that a special communication campaign will be taken up in the country to create awareness on the same. Further, she called upon the States to ensure that the Sustainable Development Goal ‘safe drinking water for all’ is achieved in India by 2030. 

Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, in the keynote address, outlined the reforms undertaken in NRDWP to make it outcome-based, sustainable and put a significant part of the programme on challenge mode to encourage healthy competition between States. Joint Secretary (Water), Smt. Radha V, gave a presentation on proposals to further strengthen the NRDWP and special features of Swajal scheme and its implementation plan.

                Ten new iconic sites, namely, RaghavendraSwamy Temple (Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh); Hazardwari Palace (Murshidabad, West Bengal); Brahma Sarovar Temple (Kurukshetra, Haryana); VidurKuti (Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh); Mana village (Chamoli, Uttarakhand); Pangong Lake (Leh-Ladakh, J&K); Nagvasuki Temple (Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh); ImaKeithal/market (Imphal, Manipur); Sabarimala Temple (Kerala); and Kanvashram (Uttarakhand) have been taken up under Phase III of the flagship project Swachh Iconic Places (SIP) of the Swachh Bharat Mission.

The project envisioned by the Prime Minister is being coordinated by Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation with the support of State governments and local administration. The consultation is in process for finalising the PSUs/corporates for extending support to new sites as CSR partners. These new sites have joined the 20 iconic places under Phase I & II where special Sanitation work is already underway.

Launched in 2016, the Phase I iconic places are: Ajmer Sharif Dargah, CST Mumbai ,Golden Temple, Kamakhya Temple, MaikarnikaGhat, Meenakshi Temple, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi, Shree Jagannath Temple, The Taj Mahal and Tirupati Temple.

Phase II of Swachh Iconic Places was launched in Nov 2017, and included Gangotri, Yamunotri, Mahakaleshwar Temple, Charminar, Convent and Church of St. Francis of Assissi, Kalady, Gommateswara, BaidyanathDham, Gaya Tirth and Somnath temple.

SIP is a collaborative project with three other central Ministries: Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, M/o Culture, and M/o Tourism. It also involves local administrations in the concerned States and Public Sector and Private Companies as sponsoring partners.

The third phase of SIP was today launched at Mana village which is situated close to the Badrinath temple in Uttarakhand. The village, which now becomes a Swachh Iconic Place, is visited by tourists and pilgrims as it houses places of mythological interest. 

Speaking at the launch, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri ParameswaranIyer, said that Phase I iconic sites have seen notable initiatives taken up, like improved sewage infrastructure, drainage facilities, installation of Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), improved sanitation facilities, water vending machines (Water ATMs), Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) set-up, structure restoration, roads maintenance, lighting arrangements, beautification of parks, better transport facilities in approach and access areas besides at the main sites. The annual review of Phase I & II iconic sites for assessing the progress is scheduled at iconic site, Charminar, Hyderabad later this month, he said. 

He also launched four major SLWM activities in Mana village, including community soak pits, compost pits, separation centre for organic and inorganic waste, and naalis for liquid waste with a sanctioned amount of Rs. 26.87 lakhs.

                Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the largest behavior change programme in the world, the rural sanitation coverage of India has now risen to 85%. Through mobilization of rural communities, 7.4 crore toilets have been built across rural India, and as an outcome, over 3.8 lakh villages and 391 districts have been declared Open Defecation Free (ODF).

This is significant because, under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), sanitation coverage has increased to more than double the coverage at the time of the launch of the Mission. 

A recent survey conducted by an Independent Verification Agency across 90,000 households in over 6000 villages has found the usage of toilets in rural India to be 93.4%. Two independent surveys conducted in the past by the Quality Council of India in 2017, and National Sample Survey Organization in 2016, have pegged the usage of these toilets at 91% and 95% respectively. This success has been achieved due to the difference in approach to sanitation adopted by the Swachh Bharat Mission in comparison to previous sanitation programmes in the country. 

The Swachh Bharat Mission is the first sanitation programme in the country to measure outcomes (ODF) instead of output (toilets) alone. The SBM's emphasis on behavior change in rural sanitation at the grassroots also leads to rigorous verification and sustainability of the benefits accrued to rural communities under the progress made. The SBM is a people's movement, a true jan andolan, and it is this people's participation that has led to the success being witnessed under the Mission. The Mission is on track to achieve an ODF India by October 2019.

                UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reviewed the progress of the Swachh Bharat Mission Gramin (SBM-G) in Lucknow with all District Magistrates of the State through Video Conferencing last evening. Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India was also in attendance, along with Chief Secretary Uttar Pradesh and other senior officials of the state. 

The Chief Minister reiterated the state’s commitment to achieve open defecation free (ODF) status for UP by 2nd October 2018, one year ahead of the national deadline of 2nd October 2019. He highlighted the importance of making the SBM-G a Jan Andolan, and not just a government program. He said that the districts that have done well are the ones who have successfully gotten all sections of society involved. He also appealed to all DMs to take accountability and involve all sections of society in the mission, and spend at least one hour every day to personally monitor progress. 

The Chief Minister also asked the DMs to leverage social media for better monitoring of implementation of the program in the field. He focused on the quality of the process being followed for behavior change triggering, and instructed the DMs to ensure timely payment of incentives to Swachhagrahis and masons. 

UP has made significant progress in the last six months, with the sanitation coverage for the state going past 70%. Seven districts and over 28,000 villages have been declared ODF in the state. Nationally, the sanitation coverage has increased from 39% in 2014 to nearly 85%, with over 3.75 lakh villages, 389 districts, 13 States and 4 UTs already declared ODF.

                In a landmark decision, a Higher Education Commission of India (Repeal of University Grants Commission Act) Bill 2018 which seeks to repeal  UGC Act and provides for setting up of Higher Education Commission of India has been prepared by the Ministry of HRD and placed in public domain for comments and suggestions. The focus of Higher Education Commission of India will be on improving academic standards and the quality of Higher Education.

 

The Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Prakash Javadekar has appealed to all educationists, stakeholders and general public to furnish comments and suggestions by 7th July 2018 till 5 p.m. on the draft Bill. The comments may be mailed to reformofugc[at]gmail[dot]com.

 

The Central Government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has embarked on a process of reform of the regulatory agencies for better administration of the higher education sector. In fulfilment of the above, several reform measures have already been launched viz, reform of NAAC, Regulation for grant of Graded Autonomy to Universities, granting of Autonomous status to colleges, the Regulation for Open Distance Learning, Regulation for Online degrees etc. 

 

The draft Act is in accordance with the commitment of Government for reforming the regulatory systems that provide for more autonomy and facilitate holistic growth of the education system which provides greater opportunities to the Indian students at more affordable cost. The transformation of the regulatory set up is guided by the following principles: 

 


	Less Government and more Governance: 


Downsizing the scope of the Regulator. No more interference in the management issues of the educational institutions. 

 


	Separation of grant functions: 


The grant functions would be carried out by the HRD Ministry, and the HECI would focus only on academic matters. 


	End of Inspection Raj:


Regulation is done through transparent public disclosures, merit-based decision making on matters regarding standards and quality in higher education. 

 


	Focus on academic quality: 


HECI is tasked with the mandate of improving academic standards with specific focus on learning outcomes, evaluation of academic performance by institutions, mentoring of institutions, training of teachers, promote use of educational technology etc. It will develop norms for setting standards for opening and closure of institutions, provide for greater flexibility and autonomy to institutions, lay standards for appointments to critical leadership positions at the institutional level irrespective of University started under any Law (including State Law).


	Powers to enforce :


The Regulator will have powers to enforce compliance to the academic quality standards and will have the power to order closure of sub-standard and bogus institutions. Non-compliance could result in fines or jail sentence.

                Three day National Yoga Olympiad  concluded at All India Council for Technical Education, VasantKunj in New Delhi today. Prizes to the children of winner states were distributed by the Chief Guest on the occasion Mr. Eric Falt, Director and UNESCO Representative to India, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka. 

Speaking on this occasion, Mr. Eric Falt lauded the efforts of the children in performing Yoga.  He said that Yoga reaches beyond gender, culture and language. If understood correctly, it even reaches beyond age and ability and socially, it is also a great equalizer. He said that the International Yoga Day is a great initiative of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and UNESCO is proud to support it. He informed that Yoga is also inscribed since 2016 on UNESCO’s Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. He also shared his concern around the world on education systems which are becoming overly competitive, stress-fuelled and exam-oriented. He shared anxiety on rising trends of intolerance and violent extremism on one hand and increasing levels of angst and depression among the youth on the other hand and felt that this is where Yoga comes into being. 

The awards were given in four categories –


	Upper Primary (Girls) – The Gold medal was bagged by the Sikkim team, the Silver medal by the Gujrat team and Bronze medal by the Delhi a team.
	Upper Primary (Boys) – The Gold medal was bagged by the Gujrat team, the Silver medal by the Delhi team and Bronze medal by the Tamil Nadu team.

Yoga is a part of our culture and we should transmit our forefather’s culture to our next generation. 

He further stated that, it is only possible to stay healthy in mind and body, if the body is active and the mind is peaceful. To create a balance between these two is called Yoga.  

He congratulated the children who won the medals and suggested that this Olympiad should not be considered as a competition but should be adopted as a part of a daily routine. He added with the efforts and initiative of Prime Minister, the entire world has agreed to celebrate 21st June in the form of International Yoga Day,

The Dean Academic of NCERT Professor SarojYadav encouraged the children, saying that every participant is a winner as they participated at different levels in their Blocks, Regions and States – the very reason that they were at the National level. She said that Yoga is a journey of the self, for the self and to the self. She further informed that the awareness about yoga is increasing as 26 states and union territories have participated in National Yoga Olympiad – 2018 as against 25 in 2017. Hopefully all the states/UTs will be able to participate in the coming year. She emphasised, that good health is fundamental right of children and yoga can provide them a good health.

                Union Human Resource Minister, Shri Prakash Javadekar has urged the  District Education Officers to play a key role in transforming Aspirational districts in to developed districts. He was addressing the workshop with District Education Officers, DIETs, SCERTs, State Nodal Officers and Central Ministries on Transformation of Aspirational districts in New Delhi today. He said that unless we develop education properly, districts will not develop. No nation will develop without education; similarly no district will develop without education, Shri Javadekar added. He said to District Education Officers that the real challenge is to make government schools better. He further said that under the Samagra Siksha funds will not be a problem for the development of education in the inspirational districts. 

HRD Minister said that Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has launched the “Transformation of Aspirational Districts- programme in January 2018 to transform over 100 districts in 28 States. These districts have been ranked on 49 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across five sectors by NEETI Aayog. Education is one of the sectors with 30% weight attached.

Shri Javadekar said that key performance indicators in education sectors are transition from Primary to Upper Primary and Upper Primary to Secondary. This include Schools with Functional Girls’ Toilets, availability of Functional Drinking Water Facility in the schools, availability of Textbooks within 1 month of the Academic Session, availability of Functional Electricity Facility at Secondary School Level, Elementary Schools Complying with RTE specified Pupil Teacher Ratio, Learning Outcomes of Classes 3, 5 and 8 in Language, Mathematics and Female Literacy.

He said that Gram Swaraj Abhiyan was initiated to attain saturation coverage of 7 flagship programmes. It is now extended to include all the five sectors under the Transformation of Aspirational Districts Programme and coverage has also been extended to all the Aspirational Districts. District Education Officers need to upload data on all the Key performance Indicators at village level except the KPI on Transition which will be at district level in the portal being developed by the Ministry of Rural Development.

The government, during the last four years, has been working on building an end-to-end, holistic scientific ecosystem. This includes enhancing the quality and quantity of impactful basic research to translation research to technology development, to technology transfer, to innovation and startups to enabling commercialization of indigenous technology. 

Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences today briefed media about achievements of Ministry of Science & Technology and Ministry of Earth Sciences in last 4 years in New Delhi. The minister said, our science is now working to solve important challenges in the areas of water, energy, health, environment, climate, agriculture, food. At the same time, India is getting future-ready in launching ambitious missions in cyber physical system, Artificial Intelligence, Super Computing, Deep Ocean, biopharmaceuticals, and others, which will make us globally competitive in a rapidly changing world order, said Dr harsh Vardhan.

The government has also connected our science to our national needs, opportunities and priorities, such as those reflected in the national missions like Make in India, Start-up India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat. Government emphasizes on new and strong connections with industry, education, with the line ministries and with other nations. 

S&T collaborations with the best in the world benefit immensely our scientific community and R&D institutions. Some noteworthy international collaboration during the last four years are: India becoming a partner in the LIGO project for gravitational wave detection with agreement to set-up the detector station in India and India becoming an Associate Member State of CERN; Establishment of India-Israel Industrial R&D and Technological Innovation Fund, etc. 

The investment in Science, Technology and related areas has gone up during the last four years starting 2014-15 to 2018-19, as against five years earlier, i.e., 2009-10 to 2013-14. The budget allocation to Department of Science & Technology was Rs. 19,764 crores, which is a whopping 90% increase. Similarly, there was an increase of 65% for the Department of Biotechnology; almost 43% increase for CSIR and 26% increase for Ministry of Earth Sciences. 

The notable achievements during the last four years have been development of new technologies and transfer of over 800 technologies to the industry. A new synergy has been established between intra-ministry laboratories and inter-ministry institutions. Scientific laboratories have increasingly become problem-resolution hubs for many government agencies like Railways, Heavy Industry, Urban Development, Defence, Drinking Water and Sanitation, Power, Coal and New and Renewable Energy. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to name a few. 

The approach has been realigned to have a mix of fundamental science and application science. This year’s budget announcement on Mission for Cyber-Physical Systems is one such example of application science. Mission-based projects on Supercomputing, Aroma, Sickle Cell Anemia and Biopharma are some illustrative examples of application and solution science initiatives. 

S&T intervention in Agriculture sector to improve crop productivity makes a huge impact on rural economy. Ministry of Earth Sciences provides agro-meteorological advisories to 24 million farmers currently, which will be scaled up to 40 million by July 2018. The timely weather information has helped in farming activities, which had resulted in a positive economic impact of Rs. 50,000 crores to national GDP. During the last four years, the quality of weather and ocean forecast services has improved substantially. On 1st June, 2018 Ministry of Earth Sciences has commissioned the Ensemble Weather Prediction system, one of the best in the world, for generating probabilistic block level weather forecasts. This was possible due to the procurement of new Super computers Pratyush and Mihir with a combined capacity of 6.8 Peta Flops by the Ministry.

A similar kind of information is provided to fishermen in the country on potential fishing zones, on fish availability. These advisories reach more than four lakh users every day, a four-fold increase during the last four years.

A joint research by CSIR DBT and ICAR has developed blight resistant improved Samba Mahsuri Rice, which is now being cultivated in an area of 120,000 hectares in seven states. This variety of rice is amongst the low glycemic index, which is amongst the lowest value for several rice varieties tested and thus, is considered highly suitable for diabetic patients. 

CSIR has launched a project in Mission-mode for development of Chemical Intermediaries and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), which would significantly reduce India’s dependence on imports, especially from China. 

With India pledging to reduce fossil fuel, the new energy mix includes higher percentage of clean energy. Several technologies have been developed indigenously by CSIR, such as coal dust collecting and briquetting system, Solar Power Tree, Novel Hydro-Electric Cell, etc. India’s first Second-Generation (2G) Ethanol plant has been formally unveiled and transferred to Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) to build commercial scale biomass ethanol plants.

In the area of Clean Energy India today occupies a leadership role in the 23 country Mission Innovation network. In less than 3 years, the investment in R&D has been doubled. India has announced the first International Clean Energy Incubator. 

 



As several areas in the country are facing acute shortage of water or poor quality of drinking water, the Ministry has launched several initiatives during the last four years to augment safe drinking water at affordable cost through appropriate S&T interventions developed indigenously. 

In order to boost the start-up ecosystem, government have increased the allocation by five times in DST alone. The Ministry has supported more than 5,000 Start-ups and 200 incubators. Apart from this, the ministry has also launched a programme called MANAK (Million Minds Augmenting National Aspiration and Knowledge), to trigger innovation among school children from 6th to 10th standard. 

S&T manpower is the foundation of R&D. During the last four years, ministry has enhanced capacity building of scientists, teachers, young researchers and attracting students to science streams. Ministry supported around 11 lakh persons – right from school level to post-doctoral research. The Department of Science & Technology has launched several new schemes to attract young scientists.  The Ministry has successfully attracted more than 600 eminent scientists of Indian origin from overseas to return to the country.

	Characteristics of Cyclonic Storm (CS) Sagar and Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm (ESCS) Mekunu
	
		During May, 2018, Cyclonic Storm (CS) “Sagar” (16-20 May) & Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm (ESCS) ‘Mekunu” (21-27 May) developed over the Arabian Sea.
		The CS, Sagar crossed Somalia coast near latitude 10.650N and longitude 44.0 0E with wind speed of 40 knots gusting to 50 knots (70-80 gusting to 95 kmph) between 1330 and 1430 IST of 19th May.
		It was the first cyclone to cross coast to the west of longitude 450E during satellite era (since 1965).
		Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm (ESCS) Mekunu crossed south Oman and adjoining southeast Yemen coasts near 16.850N/53.750E around early hours (between 0000-0100 hrs IST) of 26th May with wind speed of 95 knots gusting to 105 knots (170-180 gusting to 200 kmph).
		The ESCS Mekunu was the most intense landfalling cyclone over Oman during satellite era (1965 onwards), as it crossed coast with wind speed of 95 knots.
		Kindly visit RSMC New Delhi website (www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in) for detailed report on CS “Sagar” and ESCS “Mekunu”.
	
	
	Damage due to CS, Sagar and ESCS, Mekunu
	
		The loss of human lives has been significantly less compared to similar cyclones in the past, though the wind speed at the time of landfall was significantly higher (95 knots).
		While there were 52 deaths in Oman due to cyclone Gonu, which crossed Oman coast near Muscat with a wind speed of 77 knots and 24 deaths due to VSCS, Phet, which crossed Oman with wind speed of  65 knots, there were 6 deaths in Oman, 4 over Yemen and 20 over Socotra due to ESCS Mekunu, which crossed Oman coast with wind speed of 95 knots.
	
	
	Monitoring and Prediction
	
		IMD maintained round the clock watch over the north Indian Ocean and both the cyclones were monitored since formation of low pressure area over the AS with INSAT 3D, 3DR, SCAT Sat and other polar orbiting satellites, and available ships & buoy observations in the region.
		Various national and international numerical weather prediction models and dynamical-statistical models were utilized to predict the genesis, track and intensity of the cyclones.
	
	
	Forecast performance of RSMC, New Delhi for CS, Sagar
	
		First information regarding landfall of cyclone, Sagar near northwest Somalia (near 11.30N/43.10E) between 1330-1430 IST of 19th was issued at 1930 IST of 17th May (42 hours in advance of actual landfall).
		The landfall point forecast errors for 12, 24, and 36 hrs lead period were 6.6, 40.4, and 100.5 km respectively.
		The track forecast errors for 12, 24, and 48 hrs lead period were 42.7, 49.6, and 117.2 km respectively, which is significantly less than the average track forecast errors of 57, 93, and 144 km during 2013-17.
		The absolute errors (AE) of intensity (wind) forecast for 12, 24 and 48 hrs lead period were 2.2, 7.0 and
	
	


10.8 knots against 6.3, 10.4 & 15.5 knots respectively during 2013-17.


	Forecast Performance of RSMC, New Delhi for ESCS, Mekunu



	First bulletin issued around noon of 20th May indicated the system to move towards south Oman- southeast Yemen coasts (about 138 hours in advance of actual landfall).
	First information regarding landfall of cyclone near south Oman-southeast Yemen coast close to Salalah as a VSCS with wind speed of 150-160 kmph gusting to 170 kmph around morning of 26th May was issued at 0830 IST of 22nd May (88 hours in advance of actual landfall).
	Landfall point forecast errors for 24, 48 & 72 hrs lead period were 17.2, 12.5 & 29.0 km respectively.
	Track forecast errors for 24, 48, and 72 hrs lead period were 48.8, 63.3, and 79.4 km respectively, against 93, 144 and 201 km during 2013-17.
	The absolute errors (AE) of intensity (wind) forecast for 24, 48 and 72 hrs lead period were 5.5, 14.1  and 14.7 knots against LPA of 10.4, 15.5 and 15.4 knots respectively.



	Comparative analysis of errors for cyclone Gonu, Phet and Mekunu


The comparison of errors of ESCS Mekunu with that of cyclone Gonu and Phet is presented in Table below. It clearly indicates that the improvement in forecast and early warning helped to minimise loss of life.

                The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has commissioned two very high resolution (12 km grid scale) state-of-the-art global Ensemble Prediction Systems (EPS) for generating operational 10-days probabilistic forecasts of weather. The EPS involves the generation of multiple forecasts using slightly varying initial conditions.

 

This critical service level augmentation became possible due to the consistent efforts made by the scientists at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), Noida and India Meteorological Department (IMD). The frameworks of the new EPSs are among the best weather prediction systems in the world at present. Very few forecasting centres in the world use this high resolution for short-medium range probabilistic weather forecasts.

 

The EPS will enhance the weather information being provided by the current models by quantifying the uncertainties in the weather forecasts and generate probabilistic forecasts.

 

The probabilistic forecasts of severe weather events at 12 km grid scale across India will greatly help the disaster management authorities and other users in making better emergency response decisions by explicitly accounting for the uncertainty in weather forecasts.

 

The probabilistic forecasts will also be very useful for various sectors of the economy including agriculture, water resources, tourism and renewable energy.

 

The forecast products from these two prediction systems are available at the following links (http://nwp.imd.gov.in/gefspro.php) and (http://www.ncmrwf.gov.in/product_main.php). IMD will work further to bring out more useful service level products using these prediction systems.

 

 

The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) provides Weather and Climate Services to various users round the year and on 24/7 basis. Both operational and research aspects for these services are implemented through its constituent units like IMD, NCMRWF, IITM and Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS).

 

Over the past few years, the quality of weather and climate services provided by this Ministry has improved significantly due to systematic efforts in augmenting atmospheric and ocean observing systems in the region, improving the high performance computational capability to 8.0 petaflops, implementing high-resolution global models and advanced data assimilation techniques for ingesting data from Indian and International satellites, conducting cutting edge research and investing in human resources development. The successes in predicting the Tropical Cyclones Phailin/Hudhud, heavy rainfall events and heat waves are the best examples of the improvement in prediction capability during the recent years.

 

MoES is also working to implement more effective mechanism for dissemination of weather and climate forecasts to different stake holders using different communication channels. MoES is committed to transform India into a “Weather Ready” Nation.

                Union Minister for Electronics & IT and Law Justice, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad today launched major services in a conference organized by CSC SPV showcasing the impact and progress made by the Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) in promoting rural Wi-Fi network infrastructure. 

 

The services that were launched are:- 


	5000 Digital Villages in India: Through Wi-Fi facility, people in 5,000 villages can now enjoy Internet connectivity. Wi-Fi Choupal aims to connect 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats in the country through highly scalable network infrastructure i.e. optical fiber cable.
	MoU between CSC and IRCTC: CSC SPV has entered into an agreement with IRCTC for delivery of services through CSC centres. Now, CSC centres will be able to work as IRCTC agents. They would also be able to book general tickets.
	CSR Support by IndusInd Bank: IndusInd Bank is supporting CSC SPV for the digital literacy of 3 lakh candidates through CSR fund. The candidates are also certified under PMGDISHA.


 

 

 

Addressing around 3,000 VLEs from across the country the IT Minister said, “All Wi-Fi choupals will become knowledge centers in India. In the age of technology, Information is power. Now, no villager should be able to go to cities for the services, as the same can be availed through CSCs.” He mentioned that recently, Hon’ Prime Minister appreciated CSCs efforts in Singapore which is a great recognition for all the CSC VLES. Shri Prasad announced that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to address CSV VLE’s on 15th of June. 

 

Hon’ Minister of Finance, Railways & Coal Shri Piyush Goyal also present at the conference announced that now, 2.90 lakh CSCs will be able to work as Business Correspondents (BCs). Shri Goyal said that “The expansion of Digital Technology in our country will add 5 % more growth in our GDP. CSC has the potential to change the social fabric of our country.” 

 

Ms. Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary-DoT said, “CSC SPV will become Public Data Office Aggregator. It will develop a powerful content delivery network. Rural India will get benefit of technology advancement and BharatNet will facilitate direct and indirect employment opportunities for many, and can contribute to the inclusive growth of India. The infrastructure created under Wi-Fi Choupal will be a national asset, accessible on a non-discriminatory basis to the service providers. CSC will also be used for first line maintenance of BharatNet in the country.” 

 

On the occasion, a special publication highlighting initiatives undertaken by CSC VLEs in Wi-Fi Choupal was also launched by the Hon’ Minister. Four VLEs from Haridwar, Gondia, and Seohar shared the success stories of CSC Wi-Fi Choupal which had given employment to several people including people from SC/ST communities.

                Recently there are media reports claiming that Facebook has agreements which are allowing phone and other device manufacturers’ access to its users’ personal information, including that of their friends without taking their explicit consent. The Government of India is deeply concerned about reports of such lapses / violations.

In response to earlier notices about breaches of personal data relating to the Cambridge Analytica episode, Facebook had apologised and given strong assurances to the Government of India that they would take sincere efforts to protect the privacy of users’ data on the platform. However, such reports raise uncomfortable questions about the assurances made by Facebook. Therefore, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology has sought an explanation from Facebook seeking a detailed factual report on the issue. Facebook has been asked to respond by 20th June.

                Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that the permission to fell trees is not granted by the Union Ministry.

In a statement issued today, he said thatthe Government of NCT of Delhi has neither taken any permission, nor does it need to take any such permission from the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan emphasised that all such tree felling is carried out with the approval of concerned authorities of Delhi Government and permissions have been given as per Delhi Preservation of Tree Act, 1994, which is a State Act.   

The Minister pointed out that the Environmental Clearance (EC) conveyed to the NCT of Delhi categorically states that if any tree needs to be cut, 10 trees must be planted against this felling. Normally, the requirement is that against every one tree felled, 3 trees need to be planted. He also said that the campus in question is perhaps one of the greenest campuses among all such colonies. The Minister further emphasised that the said Environmental Clearance is also subject to various statutory approvals of the State Government including the permission under the Delhi Preservation of Tree Act, 1994.

Dr Vardhan also stated that it has been stressed in the environmental clearance process that more than 40% of total area of the project site is to be developed as a green belt. He said that the New Moti Bagh colony in South Delhi is a good example where ample plantations have been made after completion of construction activities.  

Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that the Ministry has been taking all mitigative measures to minimise any negative impact on environment and forests. “We are committed to increasing the green cover. “Despite huge developmental work taking place, the green cover has been steadily increasing in Delhi and also in the whole of India”, the Minister said. “This is evident from the fact that there has been an increase of 7,84,300 ha of green cover in the country in the last two years as per the India State of Forest Report, 2017. During the same period, the green cover of NCT of Delhi has also increased by 563 ha. Now the green cover of Delhi is 20.59% of its total geographical area”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan added.

The Union Environment Minister’s statement comes in the wake of recent reports by some people transferring blame to the Ministry for permitting the large-scale tree cutting for redevelopment of government colonies in Delhi.

                A meeting with expert institutions was held in the Environment Ministry to discuss application of advanced technologies to deal with air pollution incidents and improve the overall air quality management framework, here today.   The expert institutions included Satellite Application Centre (SAC) of ISRO, Department of Science &Technology (DST), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL), IIT Delhi, IIT Mumbai, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).   

The issues taken up for discussion included - use of satellite-based Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data for estimating groundbased PM2.5 levels, establishing early warning system and dissemination protocol to inform public and enforcing agencies about episodic high pollution events in advance. The meeting also discussed the issue of assessment of air pollution mitigation technologies and implementing solutions found technically feasible on a pilot basis, before the onset of winter. It also discussed the setting up of a system for certification of air quality emission monitoring instruments. This will provide a boost to local manufacturing of air quality monitoring instruments, since calibration and certification could be done domestically.

 

The following decisions were taken:

 


	DST will take the lead on technology interventions for possible use before the onset of winter. They should provide the results of their assessments in 2 weeks, so that pilots could be quickly rolled out.
	An expert group will be constituted, which will provide its recommendation in a month’s time on early warning system, including dissemination protocol and application of satellite based measurement for improving air quality information and management. 
	National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL) will be the certification agency for air quality measurement instruments. Certification of PM2.5 and PM10 volume samplers will commence from September, 2018.


 

These steps will enable a better management framework for air quality management in the next 3 months.

 

The meeting was chaired by the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Mr. C.K Mishra.

                The Animal Welfare Board (AWBI) was established in 1962 under Section 4 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The Board ensures implementation of the animal welfare laws in the country in a very diligent manner and provides grants to Animal Welfare Organizations and advice the Centre, States and UTs on animal welfare issues. As per the Act, the Board comprises of of 28 Members including 6 MPs (4 from Lok Sabhas and 2 from Rajya Sabha). “The Board mandate is to prevent cruelty, suffering and pain to all creatures except human beings that is why our slogan is to protect ‘ants to elephants’”, said Shri S.P. Gupta, Chairman, Animal Welfare Board of India. He was addressing media on major initiatives of AWBI in New Delhi. 

AWBI MAJOR INITIATIVES

GOCHAR / GRAZING LAND: The most important concern before the Board is the depletion of Gochar / grazing lands for want of which animal sufferings are maximum as they have neither feed , nor fodder including basic necessities. It is pertinent to mention here that due to depletion and encroachment of Gochar land, the animals are facing extreme hardships and suffering. Keeping this in regard, Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has directed that the Gochar lands should be protected and preserved and must be used only for the purpose of animal welfare. To implement the directions of Hon’ble Supreme Court, the Board has issued the strict advisories to all the States / UTs that Gochar Land shall be used only for animal welfare and encroached gochar land got vacated.

STATE ANIMAL WELFARE BOARD (SAWB) / DISTRICT SOCIETY FOR PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO

ANIMALS (DSPCA) : AWBI has its no network up to the grass root level to prevent cruelty and protection and welfare of Animals. The matter came before Hon’ble Supreme Court and the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 2008 were pleased to issue directions for constitution of State Animal Welfare Board at State level, District Animal Welfare Board / District Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at District Level and the Board at National level, thus, a three tier system was to be set-up. Unfortunately, in-spite of Board’s repeated advisories the State and UTs have failed to set-up the said system in its letter and spirit. The Board has recently issued a strict advisory to all the States / UTs to make the three tier system functional at the earliest to enforce the animal welfare laws effectively.

At the same time, the Board is going to launch a massive programme for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Under this programme, the Board has decided to develop a network from State to District level for the purpose. The Animal Cruelty Control Network will be controlled by AWBI with the support of State Governments. It is, therefore, the Board has is nominating animals lovers and activists having good credentials as Honorary District Animal Welfare Officer / Honorary State Animal Welfare Officer and Honorary State Legal Animal Welfare Officer to implement and enforce Animals Laws in the country to minimize the pain and distress of abandoned animals. Further, to prevent misuse of HAWO ID Card, all the existing valid Cards will be expired by July 10th, 2018 and new IDs are being issued to the newly nominated Honorary Animal Welfare Officers.

STRAY ANIMALS : The problem of stray animals especially cows, dogs, cats and monkeys have become rampant in all parts of the country whether it is rural, urban or semi-urban. Therefore, priority would be given to such  helpless animals with adequate shelter, feed and water. Accordingly, the advisory has been issued to all the States/ UTs that this being the mandate of local authorities, they should take care of stray animals otherwise it will be treated as cruelty. In addition to prevent cruelty, these authorities have been asked to prevent nuisance like dog / monkey biting etc. by effectively implementing sterilization and immunization program to control their populations.

ADVISORY FOR BETTER COORDINATION:

The AWBI has issued an advisory to all the State Govt. and UT for revival of Cattle Pounds and Kanji Houses which includes that shelters are not to be used beyond their capacity. Further, the Board decided to issue authorisation for inspection and visit the AWOs, system to be followed for tagging of animals, action for appointment of nodal officer, implementation of rules and regulation for licencing of animals and making the officer responsible for implementation of such rules in case of their failure.

IMPLEMENTATION OF CASE PROPERTY ANIMALS RULES, 2017:

The Central Government has notified the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Care and Maintenance of Case Property) Animals Rules, 2017 for the maintenance of animal seized in violation of the Act, and Rules made thereunder along with corrigendum G. S. R. 185 (E) on 23.02.2018 as the State Government has not implemented these rules. Therefore, in the interest of animal welfare, the Board has an advisory to all the State Governments / UTs to take necessary action for implementation of such Rules and meanwhile suggested the minimum rates so that animals may not suffer.

SETTING OF ANIMAL SHELTERS / ANIMALS HOSTELS IN SMART / METRO CITIES

The Board has taken decision to sensitize all the states governments and UTs to implement the vision and directions of Prime Minister for modernizing and developing the cities environment friendly in which special provision with respect to particularly care and concern of the animals should be taken care of. The Ministry of  Urban Development, Government of India has to play a vital role by making Modal Bye-Laws having the provision of Animals Shelters / Animals Shelters in their Smart City and other Metro City Development Plan to make this programme successful on the line of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The Board has taken this matter along with the Ministry of Urban Development, Govt. of India and State and UTs Government by making provision of animals shelter / hostel in their city development plan in order to prevent cruelty to animals as well as to protect / save environment. The Board is very particular to take legal action including contempt against those departments and agencies which are violating the directions of Supreme Court. (AWBI Vs A. Nagraja, 2014) as well as advisories of the Board.

To effectively implementation of the above programs and enforcement of supreme court guidelines, the Board has launched a programme to meet the Chief Ministers of every States / UTs along with concerned ministers and officers. The Chairman along with other members of the Board has already met the Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Uttarakhand and the results of these meetings are very fruitful and these States have already starting taking adequate steps for prevention of cruelty to animals.

                The high pollution levels during this time of the year in Delhi are unusual and primarily due to dust storms from Rajasthan. Rajasthan is facing extremely dry weather conditions, with high temperatures and wind speeds.

The wind direction in Delhi since June 10 has changed to West and North West and then since June 12 to West and South West, due to which hot air, along with dust from Rajasthan has started moving into Delhi. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the current surface winds in Delhi are in the range of 5-6 m/sec and wind direction is West to South West, which is likely to continue over the next three days. Therefore, it is expected that dusty conditions will prevail in Delhi over the next three days. 

Major construction agencies, municipal corporations and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) have been alerted to ensure water sprinkling, as required. 

Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has requested Chief Secretary, Delhi to issue appropriate instructions in the matter to the concerned agencies. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) convened an urgent meeting of the Task Force regarding implementation of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) today and issued necessary directions to contain local dust sources. The Task Force has also recommended that public should avoid prolonged exposure.

                Reiterating India’s commitment to sustainable development, the Prime Minister, Mr.NarendraModi, has said that Indian experience shows that development can be environment-friendly and need not come at the cost of our green assets. In his address at the Plenary Session of the global celebrations of World Environment Day 2018 here today, the Prime Minister emphasised that plastic threatens to become a menace to humanity and is already having a deadly impact on our marine ecosystem and a lot of it is non-bio-degradable. “Marine litter especially micro-plastic, is a major trans-boundary problem”, the Prime Minister said. Mr.Modi underlined that the choices that we make today will define our collective future. He added that the choices may not be easy, but through awareness, technology and a genuine global partnership, we can make the right choices.

 

The Prime Minister said that India is privileged to be the global host for the World Environment Day, 2018.  “We believe that the entire world is but one family – “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”,   Mr. Modi said, adding that it is in this spirit of universal brotherhood that we are hosting this day this year. “For us in India, respect for nature is an integral part of our value system. We treat nature and natural resources as sacred”, he affirmed.   The Prime Minister observed that environmental degradation hurts the poor and vulnerable more than the other sections of the society and it is our duty to ensure that in our quest for material prosperity of some, the ecosystem services that environment provides to us is not compromised with.  “Let us all join together to beat plastic pollution and make this planet a better place to live, as we have only one planet,” Mr. Modi said.

 

In his address, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan reaffirmed India’s commitment to defeat plastic pollution.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that for long-term sustainable living, the global community needs to rethink its energy and resource consumption patterns.  The Environment Minister stressed that to beat plastic pollution, we need to completely rethink our approach towards designing, manufacturing and disposal of plastic products. He informed that plastic packaging accounts for around 50% of global plastic waste, with much of it being single-use plastic.  Dr. Vardhan appealed to Governments, private sector, civil society organizations and individuals to partner and play a major role in weaning the society away from dependence on single-use plastic. Advocating an out-of-the-box approach through solutions that lead to Green Good Behaviour, he said that Indian philosophy and lifestyle has long been rooted in the concept of living in harmony with nature.  He urged every citizen to become a Green Ambassador.  “If each and every one of us does at least one Green Good Deed daily towards our Green Social Responsibility, there will be billion of Green Good Deeds daily on the planet. We can conserve the environment only when it becomes a People’s Movement”, Dr. Vardhan averred.

 

Welcoming the participants, Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma said, the United Nations approached the Government of India to be the global host of WED 2018, with a focus on plastic waste and pollution and we were happy to play the leadership role. Dr. Sharma said, “It is important to note that India’s annual per capita plastic consumption is almost 1/3rd of the global average. Plastic waste is still a concern for us like any other country and we have plenty of grassroots initiatives showcasing a possible way ahead by involving participation of various stakeholders”. He added that the World Environment Day provides an opportunity to commit ourselves to build a healthy environment and rededicate our efforts in this direction.  

                      

Executive Director, UN Environment, Mr. Erik Solheim, expressed his gratitude to the people and Government of India for such an elaborate organization of the World Environment Day 2018, which is unprecedented. He shared his experience of rich valuable interactions with people during his visit to various parts of the country in last few days especially Taj Mahal, Agra. ‟In India, there are many initiatives against plastic waste and pollution going on like the one led by grassroot communities, government and local population, corporate sector and enthusiastic environmentalists amongst others, which are both a source inspiration and encouragement for the international community”, Mr. Solheim said. 

 

            The Prime Minister released a commemorative stamp, first-day cover and brochure on the theme of World Environment Day 2018 - “Beat Plastic Pollution”. Five publications were also released titled - “Plant Discoveries 2017” published by Botanical Survey of India, three publications by MoEFCC on “Compendium of Traded Indian Medicinal Plants”, “Plastics in Life and Environment ‟Animal Discoveries 2017” published by Zoological Survey of India, and,” and “Beat Plastic Pollution: Good News from India”.

 

            CEOs of six corporate houses shared their efforts to partner with Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and pledged their support to reduce single-use plastics as part of their operations. The pledges were made by Chairman and MD, ONGC, Mr. Shashi Shankar, President, Cement Manufacturers’ Association (CMA), Dr. Shailendra Chouksey, Executive Director, ITC Limited Shri Nakul Anand, Chairman-cum-Managing Director, NBCC, Mr. A K Mittal, CEO, Procter and Gamble (P&G), Mr. Madhusudan Gopalan and MD & CEO, Hindustan Unilever, Mr. Sanjeev Mehta.

                The following is the text of the speech of Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, at the World Environment Day 2018 celebrations:

“Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi ji,

My colleagues, Shri Manoj Sinha and Dr. Mahesh Sharma,

My colleague Ministers from various States of India, 

Shri Erik Solheim, Executive Director, UN Environment Programme,

  Shri C K Mishra 

Distinguished members of this esteemed audience present here today.

I feel honoured and delighted to welcome our dynamic and visionary Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji to inaugurate the global celebrations of the World Environment Day 2018. I extend a warm welcome to all the dignitaries and participants gracing this occasion today at Vigyan Bhawan, as well as to all those, who are watching this programme ‘Live’.

Indian civilization evolved with love and reverence for environment, forests and rivers, against all sorts of exploitation of nature right from its inception. Indian philosophy and lifestyle have long been rooted in the concept of co-existence with nature. Conservation is ingrained in the Indian ethos, not just in tradition-bound villages, but even in urban areas. 

As an environmentally conscious and responsible country, we are extremely pleased to be the global host of the World Environment Day this year. Ever since our government took over, the theme ‘Beat Plastic Pollution’ has been passionately spearheaded by our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji, through the revolutionary Clean India movement called ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’.

Friends and colleagues, today,   plastic is not the real problem. It is what we do with it and how we use it. Plastic is a unique and miracle material with crucial applications in the health sector, in generation of clean energy from wind turbines to solar panels, as well as safe food storage. Plastic packaging accounts for around 50% of all plastic waste generated globally, much of which is single use. 

The global plastic production is projected to nearly double within a short period of time. Eliminating single-use plastic, both from design chains to our consumer habits, is a critical first step to beat plastic pollution. Once in the environment, plastics don’t degrade easily, and eventually find their way into our food chain. 

On this occasion of World Environment Day, we join the United Nations in appealing to the governments, industry, communities and individuals globally to come together and explore sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics. These single use plastics are polluting our land and oceans, endangering marine life and impacting human health adversely. 

Dear audience, to beat plastic pollution, we need an out-of-the-box approach to designing, producing, using and managing plastic products through solutions that lead to Green Good Behaviour. In India, we have framed comprehensive Plastic and Solid Waste Management Rules, which address all the concerns related to plastics. Also, taking cognizance of the environmental degradation arising from the use of plastics, our government has initiated action to ensure that all public buildings and public universities become free of single-use plastics.

However, for long-term sustainable living, the global community needs to rethink its energy and resource consumption patterns. Our Hon’ble Prime Minister has provided the global leadership to address both these challenges. In March 2018, India hosted the Founding Conference of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) as a common platform for cooperation among solar resource-rich nations. ISA has now transformed into a global inter-governmental organization headquartered in India that is helping us to harness solar energy at prices, which were unimaginable 3 years ago. Also, through the Swachh Bharat Campaign, the waste to wealth movement has gained strength. Today, for a vast and developing country like India he has given a mantra – ‘Swachh, Swastha and Sampann Bharat’, a clean, healthy and prosperous India - and that is a goal which we all shall pursue relentlessly.’

I am pleased to inform you all that to motivate and involve the masses in environmental protection, we prepared a compendium of Green Good Deeds, which has now been internationally acknowledged. The BRICS Environment Ministers’ meeting in Durban, last month, agreed to include Green Good Deeds in its agenda for the next meeting.

On this historic occasion today, we make a solemn pledge that by 2022 we shall eliminate all single use plastics from our beautiful country. Our beloved Prime Minister Shri Modi ji has envisioned a New India by 2022 - an India of our dreams which shall be clean, poverty-free, corruption-free, terrorism-free, casteism-free … and most of all … which will be a global superpower. This India of our dreams shall also be single-use plastic free. And, on the personal front, I pledge to henceforth completely do away with single use plastic in my life.

I am convinced that every Indian is interested and anxious to contribute towards protecting our environment. Every citizen has the potential to become a Green Ambassador. It is the Green Social Responsibility of every citizen to preserve the environment. If each and every one of us does at least one Green Good Deed daily as part of our Green Social Responsibility, there will be more than a billion green good deeds accomplished each day across the country. 

Ladies and Gentlemen, by hosting the World Environment Day 2018, India reaffirms its commitment to defeat plastic pollution. Governments, industries, and individuals will all have to play a major role in weaning society from its dependence on single-use plastic that continues to be an adversary to our natural environment. There is a need to raise consciousness about the impact plastics have on society and environment and to inform and educate people about alternate materials. I call upon all citizens and in particular, the civil society groups to be crusaders for realizing this goal. There is also an onus on the industry, as part of their green corporate responsibility to ensure that plastics they make are degradable, recyclable or reusable. I also make a fervent appeal to school and college children to take up the leadership of the Beat Plastic Pollution movement. You as Polio Sainiks for many years got us a polio free India.

 In the interest of our Mother Earth, let’s all strive in spirit and soul to accomplish this pledge to ‘Beat Plastic Pollution’.

Namaskar and Jai Hind!”

                Emphasising the importance of documenting success stories in States that can be disseminated to other States across the country, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has stressed the need to create an adequate funding mechanism for implementing waste regulations, considering that one of the major issues faced by municipal corporations is the lack of financial resources.  Moderating the session on Waste to Wealth at the State Environment Ministers Conference here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan pointed out that Ministries, or State government departments work in silos while addressing the challenge of environmentally sound management of waste in the country.   “The issue is a multi-departmental and multi-disciplinary that can be addressed to a great extent by the effective implementation of the six rules”, he stated.   

The Environment Minister encouraged the Secretaries of State Governments to coordinate with CSIR institutions and explore the use of indigenously developed waste technologies in addressing the challenges of waste management in India. He also urged the State Governments to encourage the citizens to adopt Green Good Deeds to solve the day-to-day waste management problem. It was concluded that a consistent monitoring mechanism needs to be developed in States to address the issue of waste management.  The importance of capacity-building of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) was highlighted with regard to the various provisions of Waste Management Rules, use of technologies and best waste management practices. 

The session on Waste To Wealth was chaired by Minister of Environment & Forest, Rajasthan, Mr. Gajendra Singh.  Mr. Gajendra Singh highlighted that industrialization acts as a catalyst for creation of jobs, growth in per capita income, improvement of happiness index, but development also results in environmental challenges, such as generation of waste. Thus, there is a need to look at waste from a new perspective, which is to see waste as a resource.   Creating wealth out of waste is a win-win situation, as it helps use waste as raw material, which results in reduced dependency on virgin natural resources and relieves land requirement for landfill, and reduces landfill burden.

Joint Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Mr. Ritesh Kumar Singh, made a presentation on waste management, with a brief overview of the six waste management rules namely - Solid Wastes Management Rules, 2016, Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, Bio-medical Wastes Management Rules, 2016, Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movements) Rules, 2016, E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016, and Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016. He explained that rapid urbanization of India has contributed to the problem of growing waste generation and its disposal.   He further elaborated the action points required from the State Governments under each of the rules such as preparation of a state policy and solid waste management strategy for the state or the union territory in consultation with stakeholders; development and setting up of infrastructure for segregation, collection, storage, transportation of plastic waste and channelization of recycled plastic waste fraction to recyclers with valid registration; Allocation of adequate funds to Government health care facilities for bio-medical waste management; Identification of site (s) for Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF) for hazardous waste; undertake regular monitoring for ensuring safety & health of workers involved in dismantling and recycling. He further elucidated the major issues of waste management in India. 

The presentation was followed by an open house discussion and suggestions from a number of representatives from States such as Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh.  The discussion mainly centered around improving financing for waste disposal; delegation of powers to municipal officers for effective implementation of the rules, enforcement issues and promotion of use of plastic waste in road construction; strengthening municipal governance in the country for improved waste management; and developing regulations within Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for improving waste segregation. It was also emphasized that implementation aspects of waste management Rules be integrated with Swachh Bharat Mission. 

As per the Annual Review Report of Central Pollution Control Board for the 2014-15, the generation of municipal solid waste in 4002 urban local bodies is reported to be 1,41,064 Ton per day. Out of this, 90% is reported to be collected and 27% of the collected waste is treated. Approximately 25940 TPD of plastic waste is generated of which 60% is collected and processed/recycled. Biomedical waste, generation in India is approx 484 TPD, of which 90% is processed in various facilities. Further, approx 7.46 Million MTA of hazardous waste and 1.8 MT of E-waste is generated in the country.

The State Environment Ministers’ Conference was held today at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi as part of India’s celebration of the World Environment Day 2018.   Minister of State, MoEF&CC, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, and Environment Ministers and senior officials from various state governments attended the session. 

The Conference was conducted with the objective of providing a platform to policy makers to exchange ideas, share experiences, discuss challenges related to environmental regulation in the country and explore possible solutions.

                Society of Integrated Coastal Management (SICOM) under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has embarked upon a programme for  Blue flag certification of one Blue Flag beach in each of the 13 coastal States /UTs under  the World Bank-assisted Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (ICZMP).   

SICOM conceived an integrated coastal management scheme named BEAMS (Beach Management Services). The main objective of BEAMS programme is to reduce pollutants, promote sustainable development and strive for high standards in the areas of (i) environmental management (ii) environmental education (iii) bathing water quality (iv) safety & security services scientifically.  A “Clean” beach is the primary indicator of coastal environmental quality, management and economic health of beach tourism. However, coastal regions in India are highly susceptible to litter and other pollution.  

A team of SICOM carried out extensive field research work to assess  gaps with regard to Blue Flag requirements, in consultation with local authorities and stakeholders in the 13 nominated pilot beaches.  These 13 beaches include - Shivrajpur (Dwarka) Gujarat, Ghoghla (Diu) Daman & Diu, Bhogve (Sindhudurg) Maharashtra, Miramar (Panjim) Goa, Padubidri (Udupi) Karnataka, Kappad (Kozhikode) Kerala, Emerald (Karaikal) Puducherry, Mahabalipuram Tamil Nadu, Rushikonda (Vishakhapatnam), Andhra Pradesh, Chandrabhaga (Puri) Odissa, Tajpur (Purbi Midnapur)West Bengal, Radhanagar (Havlock) Andaman Nicobar and Bangaram, Lakshdweep. 

With “I AM SAVING MY BEACH” (Intensive Beach Cleaning & Environment Education) campaign, MoEFCC has kickstarted the journey towards certifying these beaches for Eco-label  at par with Blue Flag beaches in the world. This campaign was undertaken by team of SICOM-MoEFCC at these beaches  concurrently for an  extensive cleaning & environment education drive, coinciding with  the World Environment Day celebrations.

Hundreds of volunteers joined these drives, coming from local communities, fishermen society, school children, scouts, and officials from Coast Guard, Navy, officials from tourism, environment & forest departments, offices of District Collectors, Gram Panchayat, as well as municipalities and cleaned their respective beaches with tools, equipment made of environment friendly materials and collected, segregated and recycled tons of littered garbage (majority of which was plastic) in these  beaches. The team of SICOM also conducted sessions on environment education on topics such as (i)  Coasts, their importance in bio- diversity & our responsibilities (ii) Environmental Ecosystems & their importance in our life and (iii) Pollution - how it happens & its ill-effects on bio-diversity.  

I#AM#SAVING#MY#BEACH is a national level campaign that will be undertaken periodically in these nominated pilot beaches for “Blue Flag” certification journey.

 



Logo of “I am Saving My Beach” campaign

 “BLUE FLAG” has very stringent 33 criteria to be complied based on which a beach is certified and permitted to hoist their flag in these beaches. The moment a “BLUE FLAG” is hoisted in a beach, the mention is made in the global headquarters of Foundation for Environment Education (FEE) in Copenhagen, Denmark and thereby on the World Tourism Map.  FEE-nominated representatives will conduct regular monitoring & audits for compliance and thus, concerted efforts are required to qualify for Blue Flag Certification.

                Emphasising that a host of relevant resolutions, laws and bills have been passed on pollution and other environment-related issues, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that it is up to the people to act upon them.    Addressing the inaugural session on the theme – “Natural Capital of India” to mark the World Environment Day celebrations here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan recalled the strong legacy of India of caring for the environment.  He pointed out that land, trees and rivers were all considered to be a part of divine blessings and seen as natural gifts that needed to be protected and nurtured.  The Minister stated that every human being can be inspired to work for the environment and small contributions can add up to a larger good.  

Reiterating the momentum generated by the Green Good Deeds initiative, Dr. Vardhan  expressed the view that the initiative is worth emulating across the world.   “It has been appreciated at global fora including BRICS and international universities. Green Good Deeds, practice and behaviour are the ‘mantra’ for the future”, he affirmed. 

Addressing the gathering, Executive Director, United Nations Environment, Mr. Erik Solheim acknowledged Dr. Harsh Vardhan for his approach of following Green Good Deeds, which indicates bringing environment for discussions on the kitchen tableMr. Solheim opined that environment is a people-centric problem in India.   Sharing the reasons why India was chosen to host the global celebrations of World Environment Day, Mr. Solheim pointed out that this was because India is known to be the most populous country and has still been able to significantly reduce its poverty.   “But the major reason was the shared approach that India follows to deal with its environment problems”, he added.  “We should learn to operate and growth within the threshold limits of nature”, the UNEP chief averred.   

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, MoEF&CC, Mr. C.K Mishra said that 96 Ministries have participated in the World Environment Day  celebrations.   He added that this is not just for the sake of participation, but because of a growing concern about environment these days.    Stating that World Environment Day on June 5 is a journey of 20 years, Mr. Mishra underlined how the years 2015 and 2016 were two important years for environment, which are about SDGs and Paris Agreement and are very critical for analysis.

                Urging all stakeholders at the national and international level to work towards betterment of environment, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that “Beat Plastic Pollution” is not merely a slogan, but India means business about it.  He also added that environment protection is not merely a technical, but a moral issue.  Delivering the inaugural address of the State Environment Ministers Conference in the run-up to World Environment Day here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan pointed out that 25, 000 tonnes of plastic waste is generated every day.  He opined that that the developed world must provide the technology, funds and share their research on environmental issues.  He asserted that there is no waste which cannot be transformed into wealth.  Dr. Vardhan cited the example of Kashipur plant, where 10 tonnes of biomass has been converted into 3000 litres of ethanol. The Environment Minister underlined the need to use Earth’s finite resources judiciously, so that we can move back to our glorious past.  “If every Indian adopts one Green Good Deed per day, a revolutionary change can be brought about in the nation”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan opined.  He urged the State Environment Ministers to inspire people to take up Green Good Deeds and build small, social movements and said that if all work collectively with heart and soul, India can be taken to the top of every parameter in the field of environment.

The Environment Minister underlined that fundamental changes have been brought about in the Environment Ministry and powers have been delegated to the States.  

In his address on the occasion, Minister of State, Dr. Mahesh Sharma expressed concern over the pollution caused due to plastic use in India and how it can create problems for future generations.   Recalling the Gandhian thought of ‘Cleanliness is Godliness, Dr. Sharma said that this is the spirit behind the theme of “Beat Plastic Pollution”.  Advocating the implementation of the Prime Minister’s ‘mantra’ of 6 Rs – Reduce, Recycle, Reuse, Retrieve, Recover, Redesign and remanufacture to eliminate single use plastic, Dr. Mahesh Sharma stressed the criticality of a collaborative role of all the stakeholders from the States in dealing with plastic menace.

Addressing the gathering, Executive Director, United Nations Environment pointed out that in India, Mr. Erik Solheim stated that in India, efforts are needed not only from the Government’s side, but also from the people. “Strongly advocating recycling of all the plastic used, he suggested that plastic used for avoidable purposes such as straws must be refused.  “We need to make environment a citizen’s issue”, Mr. Solheim said.  The senior UN representative felt that universities should form rules and regulations for students to follow environment norms.  He assured that UN’s leadership is here to help take Indian practices to the world. 

Quoting several examples from India, Mr. Solheim said that solar efficiency of Kerala should be adopted everywhere.  He also cited the example of the use of electrical vehicles in Maharashtra and Telangana, stating that they should be used in all other states.   He praised the organisation of various events at this year’s World Environment in India and expressed the view that such conferences are important to delineate ongoing pressing issues pertinent to environment. 

In his address, Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, Mr. Sushil Kumar Modi raised several issues pertaining to environment.   He suggested the adoption of ‘Zigzag technology’ to reduce carbon emissions from burning of bricks in brick kilns.  The CAMPA Fund’s rules should be notified at the earliest, so that the funds can be used by the State governments.

In his welcome remarks, Secretary, MoEF&CC, Mr. C.K. Mishra said that if efforts like this can be sustained forever, fulfil all the commitments can be fulfilled and the nation will be a better place in terms of its environment.   

Director General, Forest & Special Secretary, MoEF&CC, Mr. Siddhanta Das, Additional Secretary, MoEF&CC, Mr. A.K Jain, senior officers and officials of MoEF&CC and other Ministries/Departments, representatives of United Nations Environment, State Environment Ministers, as well as senior officers and officials from State governments were present in the gathering.  

E.K.  JanakiAmmal National awards on taxonomy were also given away during the inaugural ceremony.   The awards consist of Rs. 5 lakh of cash, a scroll and a medallion.  The awards were given to – 

(i) Dr. S.R Yadav for Plant Taxonomy – ( Dr. Yadav is a Scientist, Deptt of Botany, Shivaji University, Kolhapur);

                Highlighting the importance of sustainable smart cities, Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State (Independent Charge), Housing and Urban Affairs, India said that India will succeed in achieving its SDGs. Addressing a multi-stakeholder meet to strategize the roadmap for environmentally sustainable urban development in Indian cities, as part of the ongoing thematic sessions in the run-up to World Environment Day here, Mr. Puri said, “Today, we are witnessing a behavioural paradigmatic shift and we need to support that through skill upgradation. Our workers in the building sector need to be trained so that their choice of raw materials is sustainable.”  To truly build smart cities, we also need to strengthen the city transport that can support the mass traffic”, Mr. Puri added. “Further, ULBs need to be empowered, and we need a dedicated and trained municipal cadre for the same,” the Minister pointed out.

Speaking on the occasion, Director General, TERI, Dr Ajay Mathur, said, “Protection of the environment is the call of the day. With urban growth impacting the environment significantly, there is a need to create a stable policy framework for development of infrastructure and integrated spatial planning at all levels: national, state and city. With support from the government, we continue to create impact in emerging urban areas such as Amravati, the new capital city of Andhra Pradesh. We hope to bring together other stakeholders in our bid to creating more liveable cities”.

Addressing the gathering, Executive Director, United Nations Environment Programme, Mr. Erik Solheim, said, “Today, 50% of humans are living in the cities. More than ever, there is a need to build strong urban infrastructure that can support the rising population. For smart, sustainable cities, it is essential to have a greener architecture, robust city transport, and good waste management policies.”

The session also threw light on translating the global best practices of smart cities to local approaches. This was followed by a panel discussion, where representatives from national and local governments, UN, private sector, NGOs and academia discussed the planning and development of environmentally Smart Cities through partnerships among different stakeholders.

UN’s Goodwill Ambassador for environment, Ms. Dia Mirza was also present on the occasion to support the cause of environment conservation.

Background: 

Today, as a result of continued rural-urban migration and population growth, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban settlements. By 2050, cities are expected to house as much as two-thirds of the global population, making urbanisation one of the twenty-first century’s most transformative trends. 

While cities are centres for economic activity, innovation and growth, urban population impacts the environment significantly through their consumption of food, water and energy. Forty per cent of the Indian population is expected to live in urban settings by 2030. By 2050, India’s population is expected to grow to 1.7 billion, adding further pressure on the country’s urban capacity. With these numbers, it is imperative to devise smart urban solutions that can help achieve the New Urban Agenda (NUA) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

                A thematic session on “Sustainable lifestyle towards Enhancing Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy” was hosted at the ongoing World Environment Day celebrations.  The session was organised jointly by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) on June 2, 2018. The session brought together policy-makers, regulators, international organisations, businesses, civil society and academia for a discussion on the pathways and key elements for shifting consumption patterns and lifestyles towards sustainable alternatives. 

Different policy options for achieving a resource efficient society with low ecological footprint and better governance mechanisms were discussed.  It was highlighted that people’s values, expectations and aspirations for the future must be taken into account for developing strategies for consumer engagements. The role of technology, success stories from Indian experiences and inclusive policy frameworks with alternatives were also highlighted as important for the shift towards a resource efficient, circular and sustainable economy. Awareness generation for all stakeholders was identified as the most critical of all measures. Without an informed appreciation of the challenge and problems associated with high consumption lifestyles and increased plastics waste, the efforts towards achieving a sustainable society would not be effective.   

The sessions attempted to identify policy options for a resource efficient society, good governance, low ecological footprint and highlight pathways for shifting consumption patterns and lifestyles towards more sustainable alternatives and helped in identifying key elements essential for developing approaches and policies on sustainable lifestyles considering people’s perceptions of sustainability, their values and expectations for the future. It also enhanced awareness of sustainable lifestyles, and identified mechanisms for a concerted action which are needed to be taken by relevant stakeholders.

Secretary, Ministry of Steel, Dr. Aruna Sharma, who chaired the session, talked about the idea of waste to wealth, which creates a win-win situation for all and also opined that plastic cannot be banned fully, but its size can be a critical component to maintain and that is why it is important to understand that plastic disposal is a bigger issue.  Delivering the special remarks, Central Pollution Control Board Chairman, Mr. S.P S Parihar pointed out that material consumption in India is growing since 2010 and behavioural change is the toughest part. He also gave examples of Swacch Bharat mission of Madhya Pradesh where students are visiting households to train the adults.  

National Geographic Network representative Ms. Lillygol Sedaghat talked about the best practices in Taiwan, where several steps have been adopted for attaining sustainable livelihood and an efficient waste management policy. She also gave example of civil movement and homemakers united foundation, NEIHU Taiwan, which are motivating people in this direction. She pointed out that a sense of connectivity towards nature as its own family is the key to reach sustainability goals too. Mr. Pravin Mallik from Tetra Pack emphasized on the need to integrate bio-economy and circular economy and talked about formation of March Action Alliance for recycled packaging among Tetra Pack and other 10 companies.

                In the run up to World Environment Day, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) today launched a number of initiatives to support the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) focus on waste management and resource efficiency. The initiatives were unveiled by Secretary, MoEFCC, Shri CK Mishra and Director General, TERI, Dr Ajay Mathur, at an event at Vigyan Bhawan here today.

MoEFCC, TERI sign MoU to set up a Resource Efficiency Cell at the Ministry:

MoEFCC and TERI entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to set up a resource efficiency cell in the Ministry. The main objectives of the Cell are to provide a platform to mainstream resource efficiency in public policy. It aims to achieve this through coordinated thinking among the various relevant Ministries and agencies for promoting resource efficiency in the use of materials in the country. It also aims to ensure a ‘systems’ thinking based on materials, products and processes, apart from enabling the preparation of an overarching resource efficiency policy for India and coordinated sectoral policies and regulatory mechanisms. 

At the event hosted by TERI, the European Union and MoEFCC also signed a Joint Declaration of Intent (JDI) to support the implementation of the EU Resource Efficiency Initiative (EU-REI) Project in India, with a specific objective to foster the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources in India. The JDI seeks to strengthen technological, scientific and management capacities of MoEFCC, the EU and other relevant partners from private and public sector along with the implementing partners in the field of Resource Efficiency.

Secretary, MoEFCC, Shri C K Mishra released a TERI paper on ‘Opportunities and Challenges of Plastics Waste Management’. As per the findings, the paper states that the annual average per capita consumption of plastic in India is about 11 kgs. Further, households generate maximum plastic waste, of which water and soft drink bottles form a large number. In terms of plastic in water bodies, seas near Mumbai, Kerala and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are among the worst polluted in the world. The plastic debris under water affect at least 267 species worldwide, including 86% of all sea turtle species, 44% of all seabird species, and 43% of all marine mammal species.

The paper highlights how effective collection and recycling could lead to an overall reduction of waste, cost, and energy consumption, and also effectively reduce GHG (Green House Gas) emissions. It also focuses upon the need to promote the use of biodegradable plastic, especially in high-end large-scale applications, which can help in pushing bioplastics from labs to markets.

The paper emphasizes the role of Urban Local Bodies to set up decentralized Material Recovery Facilities and corporates to adopt Extended User Responsibility to collect back packaging waste generated from their products.

An industry consortium on ‘Waste-Proofing the Future’ to identify the institutional and policy interventions needed to sustainably manage waste was launched at the event. The consortium has been launched with eight members comprising Aditya Birla Group, RED FM, KidZania India – ImagiNation Edutainment India Pvt Ltd, Dalmia (Bharat) Cement Ltd, Uflex Ltd, and DS Group of Companies.  

It is the first time that stakeholders from diverse sectors have come together for the cause of waste management. The roadmap for the consortium will be to create a supply chain for various types of wastes so that there is a business case for all stakeholders. To begin with waste collection points will also be set up in schools through KidZania, and policy research will be conducted on varied issues for better implementation.

India generates an estimated 32 million metric tons of packaging waste each year, of which plastic constitutes 16 per cent. The unorganised collection of waste leads to cherry-picking of wastes, with only 14% of plastic packaging being collected for recycling.  

Between 2010 and 2020, India’s demand for various materials is estimated to increase from US $1.4 trillion to US $5 trillion. In such a scenario, improving resource-use efficiency will be very important in delinking economic growth and human wellbeing from ever-increasing consumption of natural resources and the resultant environmental impacts. Resource efficiency encompasses a wide variety of technology, process, policy and institutional issues along the various stages (design, manufacturing, refurbishment, and end-of-life) of product life cycles, including the three ‘R’s - reduce, reuse, and recycle.

                The global celebrations of World Environment Day 2018, being hosted by India, kicked off with a total of three thematic sessions being held at Vigyan Bhawan here today.  Reflecting the “Beat Plastic Pollution” theme of this year’s World Environment Day, the inaugural session focussed on the management of plastic pollution.  In his special address on the occasion, Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma pointed out that the need of the hour is to create a social awareness, particularly among the youth, on reducing the single use of plastic and its reuse.    He said that the menace of plastic cannot be tackled till a win-win situation is created for all the stakeholders with regard to the use of plastic.  Emphasising the importance of Extended Producer Responsibility in reducing the use of plastic, the Minister gave a call to rope in the organised sector to retrieve, recycle and reuse plastic.  

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri C.K Mishra, highlighted the need to introspect on what can be done individually, as well as collectively to reduce the use of plastic.  He added that the need of the hour is to launch a strong campaign to say no to the single use of plastic.   

In his special address as Guest of Honour, Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Durga Shankar Mishra said that single use plastics are a concern because they are non-biodegradable.   “Total plastic produced in the last decade is more than that generated in the whole century”, he added.   

Addressing the gathering, European Union (EU) Ambassador to India, Mr. Tomasz Kozlowski praised India’s leadership role on environmental issues.  Highlighting the concept of “Plogging”, (combination of picking up plastic waste and jogging) the EU Ambassador said that this concept is popular in several European nations and can be used to reduce plastic pollution.

Ambassador, Kingdom of Norway, Mr. Nils Ragnar Kamsvag,  Environment, Climate and Energy Counsellor, delegation of European Union to India, Ms. Henriette Faergemann, Additional Secretary, MoEF&CC, Mr. A.K Jain and Convenor, CII Working Group on Plastic Waste Management, Mr. Pradeep Banerjee were among those present on the occasion.  

THEMATIC SESSION ON HIMALAYAN ECOSYSTEM

The thematic session on the Himalayan Ecosystem was presided over by Director General &Special Secretary, MoEF&CC, Mr. Siddhanta Das, while the inaugural address was delivered by former Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), Shri Hem Pande.   Among the themes discussed at the session were -  

Change makers: A waste free vision for the Himalayan States; Sharing experiences - success stories in the Himalayan Region; National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE); National Mission on Himalayan Studies (NMHS) and activities on waste management.

Case studies on waste management in the core zone of Kailash landscape, along with the waste warriors taming waste and more through forest dwellers “Van Rajis” of Kailash landscape were shared.  The challenges of solid waste, including plastic in the Himalayan landscape and some of the innovative practices from the region, which could provide a way forward in Himalayas were also highlighted.  The learning from the Himalayas, as well as the experiences ranging from ecosystem-based adaptations in mountain ecosystems and tools for assessing restoration from both Indian and Nepal Himalayas were discussed, along with landscape level conservation in the Himalayas from the 1990’s till the present day and raising awareness on the evolution of thinking and action towards landscape-based high altitude conservation in India. 

The overview of the National Mission on Himalayan Studies (NMHS) to support the sustenance and enhancement of the ecological, natural, cultural and socio-economic capital assets and values of the Indian Himalaya Region (IHR) were discussed along with the major areas of ongoing projects such as spring revivals, water conservation & management, river bed filtration, climate change, livelihood support, rejuvenation of orchid, utilisation of pine needles, addressing human wildlife conflict, alternative sources of energy, conserving medicinal plants and solid waste management.  In addition, microbial bio-composting was discussed as sustainable solutions of biodegradable waste, if segregated at its source of generation.   Further, the management of plastic waste and its innovative method was shared during the session on synthesis of graphene and graphene oxide from plastics.

The keynote address on the vision for Sustainable Waste Management for the Mountain States was given by Shri Prem Das, Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) Sikkim.  Joint Secretary, Ministry of Skill Development (MoSD) Dr. Jyotsna Sitling, and the representative of FAO, Mr. Shyam Khadka were among those present at the inaugural session on Himalayan ecosystem. 

THEMATIC SESSION ON AIR POLLUTION 

Another session on “Air pollution in Indian cities – present status and future action” was also held.  In his address on the occasion, Secretary, MoEF&CC, Mr. C.K Mishra said that correct and understandable knowledge, based on accurately measured parameters measured by standardised equipment, is helping build a more nuanced perception, influencing thought processes and demystifying the phenomenology behind pollution and its linkage with health.  “This knowledge suggests that there is something not quite sustainable in the way we as a society are conducting ourselves—lifestyle, consumption, and production. The government cannot solve this without a people’s movement”, he said.   Mr. Mishra stressed that issues such as Particulate Matter, vehicular emissions, and industrial pollution need the positive contribution of people to go together with government’s initiatives.  “The success of National Clean Air Programme is critical for our healthy survival”, he said.

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, Department of Agricultural Research & Education (DARE), Mr. Trilochan Mohapatra averred that due to technological evolution over the past few decades, straw redundancy has resulted in an abundance of crop residue, which farmers find cheapest to burn, causing serious air pollution and impacting the health of citizens.  Quoting statistics to support his argument, he said that the Government has spent Rs. 1200 crore over two years to address air pollution from crop residue burning.  “The Government is offering 80 per cent subsidy on combined technological innovation of straw management system and happy seeder”, Mr. Mohapatra pointed out.   He expressed the view that the straw management system, when attached to the combined harvester, helps cut the straw into small pieces and create a 6” thick bed after being separated from the green. “Straw goes back as mulch, increasing its carbon and nutrient content of soil, also leading to retention of moisture and prevention of weeds”, he added.   Mr. Mohapatra suggested that straw may also be used to generate bio-oil, bio-ethanol, compost, or energy in the form of pellets. He underlined that aggregation and supply chain challenges to create these secondary value-chains from waste remain a challenge that needs attention.

Addressing the gathering, Additional Secretary, MoEF&CC, Mr. A.K Mehta pointed out that some bold decisions such as migration to BS VI standards jumping a step, interventions to contain and eventually eliminate stubble burning and an action plan for 61 (of the envisaged 100) cities have been readied. “This plan needs to be rolled out soon”, Mr. Mehta said and added that local action is critical to manage air pollution.   He emphasised that technology has to play a crucial, enabling role in cleaning ambient air.

PayTM founder, Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma pointed out that the government needs to set the tone and push policy in the direction of sustainable energy and electric mobility through incentives, tax breaks, and promoting start-ups.   He opined that the two challenges in addressing air pollution are low awareness and building the collective will of people to take action.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for withdrawal of Nalanda University (Amendment) Bill, 2013 pending in the Rajya Sabha.

The Nalanda University was established on the basis of a Joint Press Statement at the 4th East Asia Summit held in Thailand in October, 2009, which supported its establishment as a non-state, non-profit, secular and self-governing international institution. Subsequently, the Nalanda University Act, 2010 was passed by the Parliament and came into effect from 25thNovember 2010.

The present proposal is for moving a motion in Rajya Sabha withdrawing the Nalanda University (Amendment) Bill, 2013 introduced in Rajya Sabha on August 26, 2013 to amend certain existing provisions of the Nalanda University Act, 2010 and add some new provisions.

The Governing Board of Nalanda University has since been constituted as per section 7 of Nalanda University Act, 2010 with effect from 21.11.2016 with, the approval of Hon'ble President of India. The Amendment Bill will need to be discussed with the current Governing Board of Nalanda University before a final decision could be taken on going ahead with the proposed amendments. Further, the current Governing Board may also look into the entire Nalanda University Act, 2010 afresh and suggest amendments/additions wherever necessary.

Teaching in the University was inaugurated by Smt.SushmaSwaraj, External Affairs Minister in September 2014. Hon'ble President of India is the Visitor of the University, Dr. Vijay Bhatkar, the Chancellor and Professor Sunaina Singh, is the Vice Chancellor. At present, the University has 116 students in three schools of studies namely School of Historical Studies, School of Ecology and Environment Studies and School of Buddhist Studies. This includes 35 international students from 21 foreign countries.

                Government of India is celebrating the 1st Anniversary of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) coming into force, here tomorrow. GST was launched on the 1st July, 2017 in a majestic ceremony held in the Central Hall of Parliament on the midnight of 30th June, 2017. The first year has been remarkable both for the sheer variety of challenges that its implementation has thrown up and for the willingness and ability of policy makers and tax administrators to rise up to these challenges and respond befittingly. 

But more importantly, the first year of GST has been an example to the world of the readiness of the Indian taxpayer to be a partner in this unprecedented reform of Indian taxation. Accordingly, it has been decided that Sunday, the 1st of July, 2018 shall be commemorated as ‘GST Day’. Union Minister for Railways, Coal , Finance & Corporate Affairs  Shri Piyush Goyal will preside over as the Chief Guest of the event and Minister of State for Finance, Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla will be the Guest of Honour.

Before implementation of GST, Indian taxation system was a farrago of central, state and local area levies. In the constitutional scheme, taxation power on goods was with Central Government but it was limited up to the stage of manufacture and production while States had power to tax sale and purchase of goods. Centre had the exclusive power to tax services. This sort of division of taxing powers created a grey zone which led to legal disputes since determination of what constitutes a goods or service became increasingly difficult.   

In the discussions that preceded amendment in the Constitution for GST, there were a number of thorny issues that required resolution and agreement between Central Government and State Governments. Implementing a tax reform as vast as GST in a diverse country like India required the reconciliation of interests of various States with that of the Centre. Some of these issues included origin-based versus destination-based taxation, rate structure and compensation, Dispute Settlement, inclusion of Alcohol and Petroleum products under GST. Resolution of these issues took some time and finally, the Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill, 2014 was introduced in the Parliament on 19th December, 2014 and has been enacted as Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, 2016 w.e.f. 16th September, 2016.

As provided for in Article 279A of the Constitution, the Goods and Services Tax Council (the Council) was notified with effect from 12th September, 2016. The Council is comprised of the Union Finance Minister (who is the Chairman of the Council), the Minister of State (Revenue) and the State Finance/Taxation Ministers as members and is empowered to make recommendations to the Union and the States on all GST related issues. The Council has met for 27 times and no occasion has arisen so far that required voting to decide any matter. All the decisions have been taken by consensus. This is a fitting tribute to the spirit of cooperative federalism which has prevailed throughout all Centre-State interactions in relation to all aspects of GST.

Four Laws namely CGST Act, UTGST Act, IGST Act and GST (Compensation to States) Act were passed by the Parliament and since been notified on 12th April, 2017. All the other States (except Jammu & Kashmir) and Union territories with legislature have passed their respective SGST Acts. The economic integration of India was completed on 8th July, 2017 when the State of J&K also passed the SGST Act and the Central Government also subsequently extended the CGST Act to J&K. On 22nd June, 2017, the first notification was issued for GST and notified certain sections under CGST Act. Since then, one hundred and three notifications under CGST Act have been issued notifying sections, notifying rules, amendment to rules and for waiver of penalty, etc. Thirteen, twenty eight and one notifications have also been issued under IGST Act, UTGST Act and GST (Compensation to States) Act respectively. Further 59, 63, 59 and 8 rate related notifications each have been issued under the CGST Act, IGST Act, UTGST Act and GST (Compensation to States) Act respectively. Similar notifications have been issued by all the States under the respective SGST Act. Apart from the notifications, 53 circulars and 14 orders have also been issued by CBIC on various subjects like proper officers, ease of exports, and extension of last dates for filling up various forms, etc.

India has adopted dual GST model because of its unique federal nature. Under this model, tax is levied concurrently by the Centre as well as the States on a common base, i.e. supply of goods or services or both. GST to be levied by the Centre would be called Central GST (Central tax / CGST) and that to be levied by the States would be called State GST (State Tax / SGST). State GST (State Tax / SGST) would be called UTGST (Union territory tax) in Union Territories without legislature. CGST & SGST / UTGST shall be levied on all taxable intra-State supplies. Inter-State supply of goods or services shall be subjected to Integrated GST (Integrated tax / IGST). The IGST model is a unique contribution of India in the field of VAT. The IGST Model envisages that Centre would levy IGST (Integrated Goods and Service Tax) which would be CGST plus SGST on all inter-State supply of goods or services or both. 

The introduction of e-way (electronic way) bill is a monumental shift from the earlier ‘Departmental Policing Model’ to a ‘Self-Declaration Model’. It envisages one e-way bill for movement of the goods throughout the country, thereby ensuring a hassle free movement of goods throughout the country. The e-way bill system has been introduced nation-wide for all inter-State movement of goods with effect from 1st April, 2018. As regards intra-State movement of gods, all States have notified e-way bill rules for intra-State supplies last being NCT of Delhi where it was introduced w.e.f. 16th June, 2018.

GST will have a multiplier effect on the economy with benefits accruing to various sectors such as exporters, small traders and entrepreneurs, agriculture and industry, common consumers. GST has already promoted ‘Make in India’ and has improved the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in India. By subsuming more than a score of taxes under GST, the road to a harmonized system of indirect tax has been paved making India an economic union.

Any new change is accompanied by difficulties and problems at the outset. A change as comprehensive as GST is bound to pose certain challenges not only for the government but also for business community, tax administration and even common citizens of the country. Some of these challenges relate to the unfamiliarity with the new regime and IT systems, legal challenges, return filing and reconciliations, passing on transition credit. Many of the processes in the GST are new for small and medium enterprises in particular, who were not used to regular and online filing of returns and other formalities. 

Based on the feedback received from businesses, consumers and taxpayers from across the country, attempt has been made to incorporate suggestions and reduce problems through short-term as well as long-term solutions. National Anti-Profiteering Authority has initiated investigation into various complaints of anti-profiteering and has passed orders in some cases to protect consumer interest. To expedite sanction of refund, manual filing and processing of refunds has been enabled. Clarificatory Circulars and notifications have been issued to guide field formations of CBIC and States in this regard. The government has put in place an IT grievance redressal mechanism to address the difficulties faced by taxpayers owing to technical glitches on the GST portal.

The introduction of GST is truly a game changer for Indian economy as it has replaced multi-layered, complex indirect tax structure with a simple, transparent and technology–driven tax regime. It will integrate India into a single, common market by breaking barriers to inter-State trade and commerce. By eliminating cascading of taxes and reducing transaction costs, it will enhance ease of doing business in the country and provide an impetus to ‘Make in India’ campaign. GST will result in ‘ONE NATION, ONE TAX, ONE MARKET’.

                 “The First Sixty-Seven years after Independence from 1947 to 2014 saw a total number of 3.82 crore assesses filing tax returns.  Obviously, in comparison to total population of almost 1.3 billion, this figure appears highly inadequate.  The total direct tax collection (income tax) in 2013-14 was Rs.6.38 lakh crore.

Prime Minister Modi led NDA Government had a multi-pronged strategy to increase the tax base.  A campaign involving various steps to flush out black-money, including black-money outside the country, was initiated.  The demonetisation led to a lot of people in possession of undeclared cash depositing the same in the banking system.  The source of the money was now questioned.  Almost 18 lakh people were identified who had made deposits disproportionate to their returned incomes.  The use of technology helped the tax department significantly.  Most of the functioning of the Income-tax Department is now online, returns are filed online, queries are addressed online, assessment orders are handled online and refunds are also made online.  Technology is also used for reconciliation purposes in order to detect those who should be filing returns but are non-filers.  

The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a single consolidated tax has had a significant impact even on direct taxes.   Those who have disclosed a business turnover for the GST now find it difficult not to disclose their net income for the purposes of income tax.  

What would be the combined impact of all these measures on India’s direct taxation base? We had targeted to optimise the base increase without any increase on the tax liability.  India’s tax to GDP ratio in four years increased by almost 1.5%.  On the contrary, a large number of taxpayers in each of the four Budgets of the present Government has benefitted from relief given.  Today a medium-term assessment of the impact of these steps can be made.  In four years, the number of assesses has increased by 64.6%.  The total number of returns filed was 6.86 crore in FY 2017-18.  The number of new assesses who filed returns in FY 2017-18 were 1.06 crore. I hope that the percentage increase when the Government completes its first five years would be significantly higher.  The total income tax collection for the year 2017-18 is Rs.10.02 lakh crore, a four year increase of 57%.  Last year, despite formidable economic challenges, the income tax collection managed to grow by over 18 percent.  

Last year, the impact of the GST on Direct Tax Collection was not visible.  Since GST had been imposed in the middle of the year, it will be more apparent this year.  The first big news for this year is that the advance tax deposit during the first quarter of this year has seen a gross increase of 44% in the personal income tax category and 17% in the corporate tax category.  After repayment of refunds due to some excess tax paid in earlier years, which are usually paid back in the first quarter, the net amount would be somewhat lesser.  But if the same trend continues in the next three quarters, one expects a significant increase in the direct tax collection this year.  The first indication is that the spending is higher, consumption is higher and corporates are seeing increased sales and a greater prospect of profitability.  But increase in the amount of collections in category of personal income tax is also due to more people coming within the tax net.  There is also the impact of the GST visible this year.  This unprecedented taxation growth is a result of the anti-black money measures, use of technology, demonetisation and the GST.  Most of these measures were severely criticized by the Congress Party.  This is just the medium-term impact of some of these measures.  The long-term impact would be significantly higher.  Higher tax collection would enable us to continue with the developmental programmes in the country, not to impose any extra burden on the taxpayers and yet maintain the targeted fiscal deficit.  

Money in Swiss-Banks

A news item has appeared today indicating an increase of money by ‘Indians’ in the Swiss banking system.  This has led to misinformed reaction in certain circles raising a query whether the Government’s anti-black money steps have yielded results.  

Switzerland in financial disclosures was always a reluctant State.  Of late it was subjected to a lot of international pressures which favoured disclosures and Switzerland ran the risk of being a ‘non-compliant’ State by the FATF.  It has, therefore, entered into several bilateral treaties for making disclosures to requesting States.  It has amended its domestic laws involving all disclosures and entered into a Treaty even with India and real time flow of information with regard to Indians will be made.  The flow of information is starting in January, 2019.  Any illegal depositor knows that it is a matter of months before his name becomes public and he will be subjected to the harsh penal provisions of the Black Money Law in India.  Assuming this information to be correct, what does past experience show?  When disclosures have been made with regard to ‘Indians’, including in the Panama Papers, certainly some of them have held illegal accounts.  ‘Indian’ money outside the country is of various categories.  Past investigation by CBDT have shown that this includes many held by persons of Indian origin who now hold foreign passport, monies belonging to Non-Resident Indians, as also monies belonging to resident Indians who have made legitimate investments abroad, including transfer of money under the liberalised Remittance Schemes.  It is only monies kept by resident Indian outside these categories which become actionable.  The first two categories are within the jurisdiction of those countries where these persons are residents and the third category can easily be checked up in India.  If the deposit does not fall in any of these categories, it is per se illegal for which investigations are undertaken, arrests are made and criminal prosecutions are launched.  Switzerland has taken significant efforts to get-out of the image of being a tax haven and a non-compliant State.  It is on the verge of making disclosures in real time and, therefore, is no longer an ideal destination for tax evaders.  Those who participate in a public discourse must understand these basic facts before expressing an opinion which may be ill-informed.  To assume that all the deposits are per se tax evaded money or that Switzerland in the matter of illegal deposits is what it was decades ago, is to start on a shaky presumption”.

                Acting on specific input that live exotic birds of foreign origin smuggled into India from Bangladesh through Indo-Bangla border at North 24 Parganas are being transported in a vehicle heading towards Kolkata via Chakdaha/Kalyani Expressway, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths immediately swung into action. The DRI sleuths identified and intercepted the car near Muragacha More on Kalyani Expressway with three occupants including the driver.

 

 Three Red and Blue Macaws, three Eclectus parrots, eight Pygmy Falcons, and seven white ducks were found badly crammed up in plastic bags and kept inside the car and also in the dicky of the vehicle. 

 

DRI immediately contacted the office of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, West Bengal and also the Director of Alipore Zoo, Kolkata. Accordingly, the items were taken by DRI to Kolkata Zoo to whom the birds were handed over. 

 

Illegal import of wildlife which is in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act automatically becomes a violation of the Customs Act by virtue of Section 111(d) of the Customs Act.  All the birds have consequently been seized under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 read with the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. Further investigation is in progress.

 

DRI is committed to combating Wild Life Crime including cross border crime such as trafficking in wild life art-crafts.  DRI has been regularly making seizures of Wild Life articles such as Red Sanders wood which is highly valued in the markets of China and East Asia, Star Tortoises and other species of turtles, Deer antlers, Tiger & leopard skins and also ivory from elephant tusks. 

 

In March this year, ​DRI seized 214 numbers of Indian star tortoise at Kolkata. Less than a month back, two Hollock Gibbons (Endangered species under Schedule 1 of the Wild lifeProtection Act, 1972) and two Palm Civets (Endangered species under Schedule II of the Wild life Protection Act, 1972) along with a variety of exotic birds which had all been smuggled through Bangladesh were recovered and seized by DRI. 

 

There is an urgent need to step-up the fight against W​ild ​L​ife crime, which has environmental, social and economic impact and a concerted effort is needed by all the law enforcement agencies in combating the same. 

 

DRI welcomes information from public about any cross border crime including wild life crime.  There are reward schemes as well for informants with complete anonymity assured.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi said “A ‘New India’ is rising. It is an India that stands on the pillars of economic opportunity for all, knowledge economy, holistic development, and futuristic, resilient and digital infrastructure”. The Prime Minister said that we are happy to have this opportunity to deepen our engagement with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and its Members. AIIB started its financing operations in January 2016 and in less than three years, it has in its fold, 87 Members. Shri Modi further said, “With committed capital of 100 billion dollars and huge need for infrastructure in Member Countries, I take this opportunity to call upon AIIB to expand its financing from 4 billion US dollars, to 40 billion US dollars by 2020 and 100 billion US dollars by 2025”

Addressing the Opening Session of the Third Annual Meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) here in Mumbai today, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi said :

·         His Government has taken a number of steps to boost investment. We have simplified rules and regulations for businesses and undertaken bold reforms

·         We have provided investors an environment which is efficient, transparent, reliable and predictable India is one of the most investor-friendly economies in the world. Investors look for growth and macro-economic stability

·         Global confidence in India’s economy is rising. From the point of a foreign investor, India counts as an extremely low risk political economy.

·         Agriculture is the lifeline of the Indian economy. We are promoting investments in warehouses and cold chains, food processing, crop insurance & allied activities among others.

·         Lauding the efforts of AIIB, the Prime Minister, Shri Modi said ‘’India and AIIB are both strongly committed to making economic growth more inclusive and sustainable. In India, we are applying novel Public Private Partnership models, Infrastructure Debt Funds, and Infrastructure Investment Trusts to fund infrastructure.”

Speaking further on the occasion, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi said that India is trying to develop brownfield assets as a separate asset class for infrastructure investment. Such assets, having passed the stages of land acquisition and environment and forest clearances, are relatively de-risked. Hence, for such assets, institutional investment from pension, insurance and sovereign wealth funds are likely to be more forthcoming, the Prime Minister said.

In a short period of just over two years, AIIB has approved 25 projects in a dozen countries with a total financing of over US $4 billion.

Stating that India, being one of the most investor-friendly economies in the world, has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy, the Prime Minister, Shri Modi said, “With a size of 2.8 trillion US Dollars, it is the seventh largest economy in the world. It is the third largest in terms of purchasing power parity. In the fourth quarter of 2017-18, we grew at 7.7 per cent. In 2018-19, we are projected to grow at 7.4 per cent.”

The Prime Minister said, ”Our macro-economic fundamentals are strong with stable prices, a robust external sector and a fiscal situation firmly in control. Despite rising oil prices, inflation is within the mandated range. The Government is firmly committed to the path of fiscal consolidation”. The Government debt as a percentage of GDP is also consistently declining, he added.

Counting India as an extremely low risk political economy from a foreign investor’s perspective, the Prime Minister, Shri Modi said, “The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is one of the most significant systemic reforms that our country has undergone. It works on the One Nation – One Tax principle. It reduces tax cascading, increases transparency, and adds to logistics efficiency. All of this makes it easier for the investor to do business in India.”

The size and growth of the Indian market hold much more potential. India’s per capita income has doubled in the last ten years. We have over 300 million middle class consumers. This number is expected to double in the next ten years. The size and scale of requirement in India gives the added advantage of economies of scale for the investors, said the Prime Minister.

Earlier, welcoming the Prime Minister, the Union Minister for Railways, Coal, Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Piyush Goyal, in his initial remarks said that the newly emerging institutions have the potential to redefine the contours of multilateral financing and set new rules for engagement. He said that multilateralism has helped the world achieve inclusive economic growth across countries at different stages of development. The Finance Minister said that we need to strengthen the multilateral cooperation to help us meet the challenges of climate change, economic slowdown in some parts of the world and rising protectionism.

Holding inclusive growth as the key element, the Finance Minister, Shri Goyal said there is a need to develop faster processes for loan disbursement as India is a leading emerging economy and most favoured investment destination.

Over the five-year period of 2017-22, India will need US$750 billion for energy, transportation and urban development and we have budgeted infrastructure spending at US$90 billion for 2018-19. AIIB will be an important pillar in meeting this requirement, Shri Goyal concluded.

Earlier, in his address, AIIB President, Mr. Jin Liqun said, “Between now and 2030, Asia investment in infrastructure must rise to US$2 trillion a year, or roughly triple of what it has been in the past.”

“Asian developing countries now account for 60% of global growth, while roughly two-thirds of global trade is part of value-chains passing through Asia. Yet still today, 11% of Asia’s population remains in poverty. It is against this backdrop that AIIB was formed. Economic openness and investment in infrastructure drew Asia’s growth in previous stages. Now, much more needs to be done to ensure the future continues to brighten for all of Asia”, Mr. Liqun added.

In conclusion, Mr. Liqun said ,”Solid global growth is crucial for our members to meet their objectives and an Open Trading System is a foundation of that global growth. I look forward to working with all of you towards this end”.

                The Ministry of Finance, Government of India has issued the Quarterly Report on Debt Management for the Fourth (Q4) Quarter i.e. January-March 2018 (Q4 FY 18) for the Financial Year 2017-18.

Since April-June (Q1) 2010-11, Public Debt Management Cell (PDMC) (earlier Middle Office), Budget Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India has been bringing-out a Quarterly Report on Debt Management on a regular basis. 

During Q4 FY18, the Central Government issued Dated Securities worth ₹ 67,000 crore as against issuance of Dated Securities of ₹ 164,000 crore in Q3 of FY 18, thus leading to cumulative issuances of ₹ 5,88,000 crore (98.2% of 2017-18 RE). The Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) and Weighted Average Yield (WAY) of Dated Securities issued during Q4 FY18 was 10.93 years and 7.34 per cent, respectively. The liquidity position in the economy remained in deficit mode during Feb-March 2018. The cash position of the Central Government during Q4 of FY18 was, however, comfortable and the Government, therefore, did not resort to WMA from the RBI. In line with the Cash Management guidelines, the Central Government continued to time its expenditure as per pattern of receipts during the Quarter. Based on an assessment of prevailing and evolving liquidity conditions, the RBI conducted additional variable rate repo operations for longer tenors on a weekly basis aggregating to ₹ 100,000 crore to provide additional liquidity support to the banks during March 2018. 

Total liabilities (including liabilities under the ‘Public Account’) of the Central Government, as per provisional data, increased by 1.7 % to ₹ 76,94,940 crore at end-March 2018 from ₹ 75,66,215 crore at  end-December 2017. At this level, the ratio of Outstanding Liabilities of the Central Government to GDP worked-out to 45.9 % at end-March 2018. Public debt accounted for 88.7 % of the total outstanding liabilities at end-March 2018, while the share of ‘Public Account’ liabilities worked out to 11.3 %. About 26.2% of outstanding stock of G-Secs has a residual maturity of up to 5 years at the end of March 2018. This implies that over the next five years, around 5.2 per cent of Outstanding Stock, on an average, needs to be repaid every year. Thus, the roll-over risk in the Debt Portfolio continues to be low. 

 G-Sec yields generally showed a hardening trend during the quarter ended March 2018. The weighted average yield (cut-off) on primary issuances of dated securities moved up to 7.34 per cent in Q4 of FY 18 from 7.04 per cent in the previous quarter. The up-trend in G-Sec yields in both primary and secondary markets was attributable to persistent rise in crude oil prices, higher CPI-based inflation for December 2017 (and above 5 per cent inflation for January 2018), increase in the US yields and subdued buying interest on the part of banks to avoid valuation losses on the back of expectations of further hardening of yields. Notwithstanding some correction in G-Sec yields towards the close of the FY 18, the yield on 10-year benchmark security (7.17% GS 2028) closed higher at 7.40 per cent at end-March 2018. The total value of outright transactions in Government Securities also recorded a decline (q-o-q) of 19.4 per cent in Q4 of FY 18.  

A copy of the Quarterly Report on Debt Management for the Fourth (Q4) Quarter i.e. January-March 2018 for the Financial Year 2017-18 is also attached here with for ready reference and record.

                The Government of India has recently taken several steps to strengthen India’s federal structure. Many State Governments are pursuing transformative approaches and undertaking robust and futuristic projects in infrastructure, which span across connectivity (road, rail, air and inland waterways development), smart cities, sanitation and logistics hubs.

                As per recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission in para 14.64, the States have the access to additional borrowing limits subject to fulfillment of conditions mentioned therein.Fiscal deficit of all States will be anchored to an annual limit of 3 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product(GSDP). The States will be eligible for flexibility of 0.25 per cent over and above this for any given year for which the borrowing limits are to be fixed if their debt-GSDP ratio is less than or equal to 25 per cent in the preceding year. States will be further eligible for an additional borrowing limit of 0.25 per cent of GSDP in a given year for which the borrowing limits are to be fixed if the interest payments are less than or equal to 10 per cent of the revenue receipts in the preceding year. The flexibility in availing the additional limit under either of the two options or both will be available to a State only if there is no revenue deficit in the year in which borrowing limits are to be fixed and the immediately preceding year.

During the 4th Meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog on 17th June, 2018, some States pointed-out that the permission accorded by the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, to eligible States were sometimes delayed due to bunching of proposals received from different States at different intervals into one consolidated approval.  The Union Government of India, keeping in view its policy for cooperative federalism, has henceforth decided to simplify the process of approval of such additional borrowing limits requested by States. It will process each proposal along with complete information independently as and when it is received in contrast to the earlier process of bunching all proposals into a single proposal. 

This simplification process is in continuation of the Central Governments’ reform through simplified consent mechanism of Aug 16th, 2016 which mandated States to have their borrowing calendar for Apr-Dec (9months) as per their cash flow projections based on Government of India consent conveyed to them.It is expected that this will further enhance transparency and predictability in the borrowing calendar and boost capital expenditure in eligible States.

                With the total project portfolios of US$4.4 Billion, India has been the largest borrower of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) lending since the time the Bank started its operations. 

Unlike most other multilateral development banks set up by advanced economies, AIIB is the first major multilateral development bank where principal contributors are the borrowing members themselves. The third Annual Meeting of the bank focuses on infrastructure, with the theme of innovation and collaboration, said Shri Garg.

The Annual Meeting will see participation from 86 members, and member countries will deliberate upon the strategies to mobilize financing for infrastructure. Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will deliver the inaugural address on Tuesday.

Expressing deep gratitude to Government of India and the State of Maharashtra for hosting the Annual Meeting, Sir Danny Alexander, Vice-President & Corporate Secretary, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, lauded India’s contribution as an active member in structuring and supporting the bank.

Enumerating the priorities and lending norms, Sir Alexander said, ‘Lean, clean and green is the way we work. We invest in sustainability and are guided by those priorities. Our bank is apolitical and all projects have to pass our test on sustainability and environment’.

Furthermore, he said that AIIB will consider investing in projects outside Asia as long as they serve to benefit the Asian regions too. So far, AIIB has only invested in one solar power project in Egypt, Sir Alexander said.

While 75% of the capital is from Asia, several non-Asian regions like Europe, North America, some East African and Latin American countries have also joined the bank as members.

The third Annual Meeting of AIIB is being organized by Government of India, in collaboration with Government of Maharashtra at Mumbai during 25-26 June 2018.

                The fresh release made in the media today under ‘Panama Paper Leaks’ is being promptly looked into by the law enforcement agencies under the aegis of the Multi Agency Group (MAG) already constituted for facilitating coordinated and speedy investigation. As per the standard operating procedures in place for  investigating such cases, examining the information revealed in the media release with the disclosures made by the alleged persons in the annual returns of income filed, particularly in the foreign assets (FA) schedule, foreign remittance details etc. will be undertaken expeditiously, followed by raising of relevant queries. Subsequently, investigations in appropriate cases would be carried out to bring them to a logical conclusion.

The Panama Paper leaks were originally revealed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), on 4thApril 2016. On the same day, the Government constituted the MAG, headed by Chairman, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) as its convener, comprising representatives of the Income Tax Department, Enforcement Directorate (ED), Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The Panama Paper leaks involving 426 persons have been investigated by the Income Tax Department and other member agencies of MAG. Since the database released by ICIJ did not contain any financial details or details of beneficial ownership, these had to be sought from foreign jurisdictions under tax treaties in most cases. After thorough investigation, involving examination of the disclosures made in the ITRs particularly the FA schedule, residential status, responses to questionnaires issued, responses received from foreign jurisdictions and details of foreign remittances made, 352 cases were found to be non-actionable.

In the 74 cases found actionable, invasive actions were taken in 62 cases with searches conducted in 50 cases, and surveys in 12 cases leading to detection of undisclosed foreign investments of about Rs.1140 crore (approx). In 16 cases criminal prosecution complaints have been filed in jurisdictional courts which are at various stages of hearing. In 32 cases notices under section 10 of the Black Money Act have been issued. 

The investigations conducted in Panama Paper cases reflect the Government’s continued focus in dealing with Black Money stashed abroad.  The promptness in action is more than evident as most of the actionable cases have been effectively addressed. Though the investigating agencies faced problems of incomplete data and absence of financial information as well as not very prompt cooperation from other countries, the overall outcome has been very satisfactory. Government would like to assure that the fresh series of Panama Papers information would also be effectively addressed within a reasonable time frame.

                Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), a premier Financial Institution for the Promotion, Financing and Development of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector and TransUnion CIBIL, a Credit Information Company, in a joint endeavor with TransUnion CIBIL brings-out MSME Pulse, a Quarterly Report on MSME Sector, for providing the policy makers, regulators and industry with precise data-driven insights to support policy as well as business decisions. The First Edition was released in the month of March, 2018.

            The 2nd Edition of MSME Pulse by SIDBI-TransUnion CIBIL for June 2018 quarter has now been released. The findings show that the overall commercial credit exposure (Y-o-Y) has shown the highest growth rate in the last five Quarters.

            MSME Pulse Report by SIDBI-TransUnion CIBIL further states that the total on-balance sheet commercial lending exposure in India stood at Rs.54.2 lakh crores, as of March 2018 with Micro and SME segment constituting Rs.12.6 lakh crores, which contributes to ~23% of commercial credit outstanding. While the growth in NPA rate has moderated, it is too early to conclude that the NPA problem is close to bottoming out.

            Data in MSME Pulse report by SIDBI-TransUnion CIBIL shows that the MSME segment has left behind the short-term impact of GST and demonetisation and they are firmly back on growth path with the segment having exposure below INR 25 crore growing at 15%. High growth in new to credit shows positive impact of GST. New-to-credit (NTC) borrowers are expected to be 5 lakh plus from April,18 to September 2018, which is 21% higher than NTC observed from October, 2017 to March, 2018.

            To sum-up, the second edition of MSME Pulse Report by SIDBI-TransUnion CIBIL reveals a broad based recovery in commercial credit growth and also shows that MSME segment continues with strong growth and stable asset quality.

            Highlights of MSME Pulse Second Quarter Edition are as follows:

 

MSME Pulse Second Quarter Edition Highlights


	Broad based recovery in credit growth-Overall credit exposure(Y-o-Y) has shown the highest growth rate in last five quarters. In addition, after the lows of September 2017, even Large (greater than ₹ 100 Crores exposure) segment has shown two consecutive quarters of recovery in credit growth.  Micro (credit exposure less than ₹ 1 Crore) and SME (₹ 1 Crore-25 Crores) segments constitute ₹ 12.6 lakh Crores credit exposure (23% of commercial credit outstanding) with Y-o-Y growth of 22% and 13% respectively .In comparison 7% for Mid (₹ 25 Crore-100 Crores) and 6% for Large (greater than ₹ 100 Crores exposure) from March 2017 to March 2018.


 


	Large segment asset deterioration continues, Mid segment NPA rate restricted- In Large corporate segment, NPA rates have increased from 15.3% (in Mar’17) to 18% (in Mar’18).The directional reduction in NPA rate of Mid segment (16.3% in Mar’17 to 15.9% in Mar’18) may be attributed to bad debt being sold to Asset Reconstruction Companies(ARC) and uptick in loan growth in this segment.  The stock of gross NPA in commercial exposure increased by 1.48 Lakh Crore in Mar’18 over Mar’17. However, quarterly additions to NPA suggest that the steepest rise was between Q2FY’18 to Q3FY18, While the growth in NPA rate has moderated, it is too early to conclude that the NPA problem is close to bottoming out.


 


	Relatively stable asset quality for MSMEs:  MSME NPA rates have remained stable and range bound. In the Micro segment the NPA rate has moved from 8.9 % (in Mar’17) to 8.8 % (in Mar’18) .In SME segment the NPA rate hovered between 11.4% (in Mar’17) to 11.2 % (in Mar’18). Recognized NPA exposure for MSME is ₹ 81,000 Crores as on Mar’18


 


	Growth to ensure asset quality: Future NPA in the segment may be driven by ₹ 11000 Crores exposure, which are currently tagged as ‘standard’ but belongs to entities that have at least one or more exposures tagged as NPA by other bank or credit institution. Additionally, there is a system-side exposure of ₹120,000 Crores belonging to entities with CIBIL MSME Rank (CMR) between CMR 7 and CMR 10. CMR7 to CMR10 are associated with High Risk. These high-risk exposures are expected to add ₹16,000 Crores in NPA by March 2019. However, strong credit demand in this segment among other things driven by formalization of this segment is likely to keep the overall NPA rate in this segment in check.


 


	New Private Banks most successful in tapping MSME opportunity: Private Banks and NBFCs have further increased their market share in Micro and SME lending from 27.5% and 9.1% in March 2017 to 30.3% and 10.9% in March 2018. Share of PSBs has fallen from 57% to 50.4% in the same period. Despite higher growth rate new Private Banks have better quality of acquisition of New to Bank (NTB) borrowers with 46% borrowers lying in high quality CMR 1 to CMR3. In comparison, other category of lenders have around 35% of their incremental borrowers in CMR1 to CMR 3.


New Private Sector Banks have 9% NTB acquisition in CMR-7 to CMR-10 grades compared to 16% in PSBs and 14% in NBFCs. However, New Private Banks and NBFCs lending to these high risk borrowers are largely offering asset backed loans, while PSU banks are offering plain working capital and term loans even to this segment. 


	Formalization may add a million a year New-to-Credit MSME borrowers: Number of new-to-credit (NTC) borrowers in MSME segment continued to accelerate with 5 lakh NTCs estimated in H1-18 compared to 4 lakhs in H2-17. In effect going forward, it may be expected that annually, at least a million plus NTC MSME borrowers would be seeking formal credit. Recent NTC portfolio study suggest that 60% first-time borrowers sustain or increase their credit, in the two-year period following their first formal loan. 


 


	Demonetization and GST Impact are firmly behind the MSMEs: As of Mar’18 based on the credit utilization exposure, the metrics used to gauge the impact in this study, it appears that most MSME’s including the smallest ones have recovered from the impact of demonetization and GST.


 


	Risk Profile study of top 30 locations:  A study of risk profile of top 30 locations by CMR distribution of borrowers shows that locations in North and West regions have a comparatively better risk profile than the locations in South and East.

                In line with the commitment of Government to liquidate all pending GST refunds filed till 30th April, 2018, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has successfully concluded the 2nd Special Refund Fortnight extended from 31st May, 2018 to 16th June, 2018.

By the end of 16th June, 2018, Rs.6,087 crore IGST refund has been sanctioned in the refund fortnight. The interesting facts during the second fortnight are (i) about 1,68,191 shipping bills have been processed (ii) IGST refund claims of about 9,293 exporters have been sanctioned including about 3500 new exporters, whose refunds had been held up, have got their refund sanctioned.

During the period, all field formations of CBIC and States, once again worked hard to provide refund relief to the exporters. Special refund cells manned by experienced staff were put in place throughout the country. Exporter awareness campaigns using both print media and social media were carried out so that the benefit could be extended to maximum exporters. All field formations were tasked to go the extra mile in order to facilitate the sanctioning of refunds. Issues which threw new challenges while sanctioning of refunds were clarified by circulars, advisories etc.

The amount of RFD-01A refund claims received by the Centre as on 30th April, 2018 was Rs. 9,816 crores. The target for the Special Refund Fortnight was to dispose off this amount. During the refund fortnight, an amount of Rs. 1,548 crores was sanctioned by the Centre and Rs. 2,290 crores by the States. This takes the amount of RFD-01A refund claims disposed, as on 16.06.2018, by the Centre to Rs. 10,824 crores and by the States to Rs. 7,287 crores. Thus, the total amount of RFD-01A claims disposed off stands at Rs. 18,111 crores.

In all, Rs 21,142 crore (IGST refunds), Rs. 9,923 crore (RFD-01A refund by CBIC) and Rs 6,997 crore (RFD-01A refund by States) all totaling Rs 38,062 crore has been sanctioned till 16th June, 2018. Considering the amount of rejected claims, the total IGST disposed is Rs 23,437 Crore, RFD-01A (by CBIC) is Rs10,824 crore, RFD-01A (by States) is Rs 7, 287 crore and total GST refund disposed till 16th June, 2018 stands ​at ​Rs 41,548 crore.

The momentum gained during this fortnight would be carried on by all formations where refunds are still pending. The CBIC is dedicated to sanction all the legitimate refund claims of exporters. Efforts are being made to resolve those issues which are still pending. However, the exporters need to ensure that the correct procedure of filing returns, giving accurate information in Shipping Bill and submitting RFD01A application forms to the jurisdictional formations are followed for quick disbursal of their refund claims.

                In order to make the actual allocation of funds consistent with that of the primary adjustment, section 92CE was inserted in the Income-tax Act, 1961 (‘the Act’) vide Finance Act, 2017 with effect from 1st April, 2018, to provide for secondary adjustment by attributing income to the excess money lying in the hands of the associated enterprise (AE).

The time within which the excess money, which is available with the associated enterprise of an assessee as a result of primary adjustment to the transfer price, which leads to an increase in the total income or reduction in the loss of the assessee, shall be repatriated to India, was prescribed in accordance with the provisions of section 92CE(2) by inserting Rule 10CB of the Income-tax Rules, 1962 (‘the Rules’) vide Notification No. GSR 590(E) dated 15th June, 2017.

Under Rule 10CB(1), a uniform time limit of 90 days, starting from different dates, is prescribed for repatriation of excess money. This is done in order to provide for uniform treatment in respect of the different types/situations of primary adjustments specified under sub-section (1) of section 92CE.

Certain difficulties have been noted in implementing the provisions of Rule 10CB(1) in respect of primary adjustment that arises on account of Agreement for Advance Pricing (APA) entered into by the assessee, or on account of an agreement reached under the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP). In order to remove these difficulties, it is proposed to amend Rule 10CB.

In this regard, draft notification providing for said modification has been framed and uploaded on the website of the Income Tax Department www.incometaxindia.gov.in for comments from stakeholders and general public.

Comments and suggestions on the draft rules may be sent by 9th July, 2018 electronically at the email address ustpl3[at]nic[dot]in.

                Historic tax reform, the Goods and Service Tax (GST), has resulted in formalization of economy and consequently information flow would eventually augment not only the Indirect Tax collections but also Direct Tax collections. In the past, the Centre had little data on small manufacturers and consumption because the excise was imposed only at the manufacturing stage while the States had little data on the activities of local firms outside their borders. Under the GST, there will be now seamless flow of availability of common set of data to both the Centre and the States making Direct and Indirect Tax collections more effective.

 

There are early signs of tax base expansion.  Between June and July 2017, 6.6 lakh new agents, previously outside the tax net, sought GST registration. This is expected to rise consistently as the incentives for formalization increase. Entire Textile chain is now brought under tax net. Further, a segment of land and real estate transactions has also been brought into tax net “works contracts”, referring to housing that is being built. This in turn would allow for greater transparency and formalization of cement, steel and other sales which earlier tended to be outside the tax net. The formalization will occur because builder will need documentation of these input purchases to claim tax credit.

 

The introduction of GST, a common Indirect Tax for both the States as well as the Central Government with its end to end digitization of all processes, is the biggest reform measure which is already creating more jobs in formal sector and eliminating transactions which are not recorded earlier in the books of accounts and thus, were outside the tax net so far. GST is designed to bring about better tax compliance and transparency in tax system. It is putting a premium on honesty. It would make increasingly difficult for those (who are liable to pay tax) to remain outside the tax net.

 

 A number of procedural changes have also been made since the roll-out of GST on 1st July, 2017 in order to simplify the processes. An extensive exercise was undertaken for tax payers education and facilitation by way of knowledge sharing, dissemination of information and replies to FAQs among others. Further, steps are also being undertaken for further simplification in order to facilitate the tax payers and to extend benefit to the customers.

                Complaints are being received from taxpayers that the intermediaries who were authorized by them to apply for registration on their behalf had used their own email and mobile number during the process. They are now not sharing the user credentials with the taxpayer on whose behalf they had done the registration in the first place and the taxpayer is at their mercy. 

 

With a view to address this difficulty of the taxpayer, a functionality to update email and mobile number of the authorized signatory is available in the GST System.  The email and mobile number can be updated by the concerned Jurisdictional tax authority of the taxpayer as per the following procedure: 

 

Steps to be followed:-

 


	Taxpayer is required to approach the concerned jurisdictional Tax Officer to get the password for the GSTIN allotted to the business. 
	<Jurisdiction can be checked through Search Taxpayer option available on https://www.gst.gov.in,>. Allotted jurisdiction is displayed in red text>
	Taxpayer would be required to provide valid documents to the tax officer as proof of his/her identity and to validate the business details related to his GSTIN.
	Tax officer will check if the said person is added as a Stakeholder or Authorized Signatory for that GSTIN in the system.
	Tax officer will upload necessary proof on the GST Portal in support to authenticate the activity.
	Tax officer will enter the new email address and mobile phone number provided by the Taxpayer.
	After upload of document, Tax officer will reset the password for the GSTIN in the system.
	Username and Temporary password reset will be communicated to the email address as entered by the Tax Officer. 
	Taxpayer need to login on GST Portal https://www.gst.gov.in/ using the First time login link. 
	After first time login with the Username and Temporary password that was emailed to him, system would prompt the taxpayer to change username and password. The said username and password can now be used by the taxpayer.

                A Conference on Implementation of National Pension System (NPS) by the Central Autonomous Bodies (CABs) was organized by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) today here in the national capital. The prime objective was to provide a forum to all the Central Autonomous Bodies (CABs), where the progress in the implementation of NPS with respect to compliance of timelines in various NPS related activities could be brought to the fore and a way forward could be provided. Officials from most of the Central Autonomous Bodies (CABs) attended the Conference.

Delivering the Key Note Address, the Secretary, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, Govt. of India

​,​

 Shri Ajay Narayan Jha stressed upon all the participants on the need of becoming sensitive and responsible towards employee-subscribers currently covered under NPS in order to protect their interest, while monitoring various NPS related activities. He also called upon the Heads of 

​​

Institutions and Pr AOs of the different CABs to streamline the NPS operations in their respective organisations. Shri Jha appreciated the initiative of PFRDA for holding this Conference exclusively for Central Autonomous Bodies as it provided two-way communications between stakeholders for the ultimate benefit of the subscribers.  

                         Earlier in his Opening Remarks, Dr. Badri Singh Bhandari, Whole Time Member (Economics) mentioned that currently there are 557 CABs which have about 1.73 lacs subscribers and about Rs.11800 crores of Asset Under Management (AUM). He further emphasised the need for discipline in submission of subscriber registration forms and remittance of the subscribers’ contributions. He also highlighted the responsibility of nodal officers handling NPS and advised that they should be aware of the NPS and its related process in detail for addressing the queries/grievances of the subscribers.

 

Chairman, PFRDA, Sh. Hemant Contractor, in his address emphasized the fact that NPS, being a Contributory scheme, was different from the earlier pension system and discussed various determinants of pension such as promptness of the Nodal offices in performing various NPS related activities mainly subscriber registration, upload/remittance of NPS contributions and also period of stay in the scheme, contribution level, returns on investments, annuity schemes chosen, annuity service providers chosen etc. In this regard, he stressed upon the need to work in tandem to ensure that NPS works efficiently and pensions are served effectively. He also highlighted endeavour of PFRDA in educating subscribers in handling their pension accounts, through a dedicated website, Pension Sanchay.

A Presentation was also made on the occasion by the NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure Ltd, the Central Recordkeeping Agency for NPS about the operational issues and new functionalities released for the convenience of the nodal officers-PAOs/DDOs and the subscribers. A presentation was also made by Jamia Millia Islamia University about the best practices they have adopted to administer the subscribers’ interface effectively. While presenting the Vote of Thanks Shri Ashish Kumar, GM mentioned that PFRDA is periodically holding Review meetings/ Video conferences also with the CABs on important parameters having financial implications and expects significant improvement from the present state of affairs.

                Income-tax Rules, 1962 (I.T.Rules) prescribe Form No.36 for filing an appeal to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT). Further, a memorandum of cross-objections to the ITAT can be filed in Form No.36A.

The existing Form No.36 and Form No 36A have not been revised since long.  These Forms are required to be rationalised to make them more informative and also to capture information regarding amount disputed in pending appeals before ITAT, which is vital for formulating the policy of the department for litigation management.

In view of the above, a draft notification proposing amendments in Form No. 36, Form No.36A and Rule 47 of the IT Rules has been uploaded on the website of the Income Tax Department www.incometaxindia.gov.in for comments from stakeholders and general public.

The comments and suggestions on the draft notification may be sent by 2nd July, 2018 electronically at the email address ts.mapwal[at]nic[dot]in

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for grant of permission to M/s. HDFC Bank Ltd. to raise additional share capital of up to a maximum of Rs. 24,000 crore, including premium, over and above the previous approved limit of Rs. 10,000 crore, such that the composite foreign shareholding in the Bank shall not exceed 74% of the enhanced paid-up equity share capital of the bank.

 

The decision would ensure that the composite foreign shareholding in the bank inclusive of all types of foreign investments, both direct and indirect, will not exceed 74% of the enhanced paid-up equity share capital of the bank. It will be subject to Foreign Direct Investment Policy conditionalities and other sectoral regulations / guidelines. 

 

The proposed investment is expected to strengthen the capital adequacy ratio of the bank.

                The Infrastructure Segment is a key propeller for the Indian markets, contributing significantly to the growth of the national economy. Consequently, the Government of India lays special emphasis on this Sector, initiating and establishing several Regulatory, Financial  and Operational Structures to ensure the fast advancement of this sector. With this backdrop, one day thematic Seminar on “Private Sector Participation and Innovation in Resource Mobilisation” was being hosted today in Mumbai by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India in collaboration with Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) as knowledge partner in partnership with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce (FICCI). The main thrust of the Seminar was to address the critical dimensions of Infrastructure Projects Funding and underline the need for financial support, from Private Sector players.

 

During the Inaugural Session, several eminent Speakers, including Mr. Sujoy Bose, CEO, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), Mr. Shailesh Pathak, CEO, L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Limited and Dr. Kumar V. Pratap, Joint Secretary (IPF), Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, Government of India, shared their expert perspectives of the investment landscape in the Infrastructure Sector and also discussed the various initiatives undertaken by the present Government in this regard in last four years.

Speaking, on the occasion, Dr. Kumar V. Pratap says, ‘Developing at an extremely fast pace, India’s Infrastructure Sector has received an investment worth $1 trillion in the period from 2007 to 2017, of which, more than a third of this capital was contributed by the private sector. India aims to raise the investment in this sector to $200 billion every tear from the present level of $110bn per annum. To encourage private participation, the Government of India has launched several initiatives. Schemes such as the Brownfield Asset Mobilization for Infra Investments (BAMII), Credit Enhancement Fund for raising Bond Ratings issued by infra companies and the New Credit Rating scale for infrastructure projects creates opportunities for private investors, thereby promoting a steady flow of financial resources into this sector.

 

Sharing his thoughts on this subject, Mr. Sujoy Bose, CEO, NIIF said that India is a preferred destination for investments especially in infrastructure sector. He said that with an improving and fast growing economy, the Government led infrastructure projects are getting funded and there is an increase in the flow of Foreign Direct Investments. To ensure financial investments in the infrastructure sector, the Government of India has financed various projects under National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF),Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) and Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) to bridge the gap in the funding space, he added.

 

Earlier delivering the Welcome Address, Mr. Jaspal Bindra, Chairman, FICCI - Maharashtra State Council and Executive Chairman, Centrum Group welcomed the panel and spoke about the opportunities in the Infrastructure Sector in the country relating to private financing. He added, “The global population will witness a growth of ~2bn people by 2040. The Global Infrastructure Hub Report states that, investment worth $97trillion is needed in the global infrastructure sector of which 50% is required by Asia.  India needs around $4.5 Trillion investments in the Infrastructure sector by 2040.”   Mr. Subhomoy Bhattacharjee, Consultant, RIS noted the paradigm shift in the definition of Infrastructure in the 21st century and highlights the need for Private Sector Participation and Innovation In Resource Mobilization in Government projects. Further laying the framework for today’s Sessions, he stated the importance of understanding the current infrastructure scenario and the financial, institutional and regulatory operations, when investing in this segment.

 

The Session on ‘Risk Management’ was attended by eminent panelists like Mr. Sajjid Z Chinoy, Chief India Economist, JP Morgan, Mr. Sudip Sural, Senior Director, Infra and Public Finance, CRISIL Infrastructure Advisory, Mr. Praveen Gupta, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Raheja QBE General Insurance, Mr. Suneet Maheshwari, Founder and Managing Partner, Udvik Infrastructure Advisors, Mr. Raghwendra Pande, Head Infrastructure and Real Estate sector, Investment banking, ICICI Securities Limited and Mr. Soumyajit Neogi, Associate Director, India Ratings who deliberated on various risks that one foresees once a project is bagged, right from Regulatory Risks, Political risk, Market risk, Sponsoring risk and Judicial risk among others.  The risks determine the payoffs that private companies will want to negotiate before contracting any projects.  The contracts, therefore, need to be analysed and dealt holistically.

                -      Arun Jaitley 

Please find below the Text of the Article written by the Union Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley on “The IBC (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 and the Homebuyer” :

“Post 1991 economic liberalisation, there has been a phenomenal growth in the creation of new townships, urbanisation and more particularly sub-urbanisation.  This trend is likely to accelerate.  Economic growth gives rise to aspirations.  More purchasing power, migration from rural areas and aspiration to improve the quality of life are increasing.  In and around major townships massive real estate projects have been coming up.  Many of these are by professional real estate developers.  This is also an area where many “fly by night” operators have entered.  Some developers have very little resources of their own.  They use the homebuyer’s money to develop, invest in land banks and then get caught in debt trap.  The homebuyer is the worst sufferer.  He has a triple whammy.  He has invested his savings with the developer. He may be paying EMIs on the loans taken and may continue to pay either rent of his currently occupied property or live in some alternate accommodation under compulsion. 

The new ordinance equates an “allottee” of a “real estate project” to be a person having a commercial effect of borrowing.   He is now treated as financial creditor.  He can initiate a corporate insolvency for a resolution against the errant developer.  He acquires the right to be on the committee of creditors.  He gets voting right.  He can influence the resolution process.  In the unlikely eventuality of liquidation, he stands at par with other financial creditors. 

Given his logistical problems, liquidations are rarely likely to take place in asset owning companies.  Resolution is the natural course.  In a resolution probably some other developer would acquire an interest or some alternative method found of completing the project.  The inevitable consequence of this would be that the market itself will discover solutions.   Just as the film industry, in the last few years, has increasingly formalised itself, the real estate industry would eventually will have to formalise itself.  Sound and structured real estate developers would remain.  The “fly by night” operators would be eliminated.  Projects would be completed in reasonable time and investors would get their share of allotments expeditiously.  Construction is already growing at a double digit growth.  RERA and the new ordinance would only catalyse this process further”.

                The Task Force on Shell Companies has met 8 times since its constitution and has taken pro-active and coordinated steps to check the menace of shell companies. The ‘Task Force’ was set up in February, 2017 by the Prime Minister’s Office under the joint Chairmanship of the Revenue Secretary and Secretary, MCA with a mandate to check in a systematic way, through a coordinated multi-agency approach, the menace of companies indulging in illegal activities including facilitation of tax evasion and commonly referred to as ‘Shell Companies’. Department of Financial Services, CBDT, CBEC, CBI, ED, SFIO, FIU-IND, RBI, SEBI, DG GSTI and DG-CEIB are its Members.

 

The major achievements of the Task Force include the compilation of a database of shell companies by SFIO. This database, as on date, comprises of 3 lists, viz the Confirmed List, Derived List and Suspect List. The Confirmed List has a total of 16,537 confirmed shell companies on the basis of the information received from the various Law Enforcement Agencies of the companies found to be involved in illegal activities. The Derived List has 16,739 companies identified on the basis of 100% common directorships with the confirmed shell companies. The Suspect List has 80,670 suspected shell companies and has been drawn up by SFIO using certain Red Flag Indicators. The Task Force has identified certain Red Flag Indicators, which will be used to identify more shell companies.

 

In a drive carried out under the supervision of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in the Financial Year 2017-18 the Registrars of Companies (ROCs) identified and removed from the register of companies under Section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 the names of 2,26,166 companies, which had not filed their Financial Statements or Annual Returns for a continuous period of two or more financial years. As many as 3,09,619 directors were also disqualified u/s.164(2)(a) read with Section 167(1) of the Companies Act, 2013 for non-filing of Financial Statements or Annual Returns for a continuous period of immediately preceding 3 financial years (2013-14, 2014-15 & 2015-16). 

 

With the concerted efforts of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Department of Financial Services and Indian Banks Association the ex- directors / authorized signatories of the struck-off companies have been restricted from operating the bank accounts of these companies and they cannot withdraw any amount from these bank accounts, other than for specified purposes, till the company is restored u/s 252 of the Companies Act.

 

To help the genuine corporates in regularizing their pending returns, the Condonation of Delay Scheme, 2018 was brought in. It was effective from 1.01.2018 to 1.05.2018. A total of 13,993 companies benefitted from the scheme.

 

For the 2nd drive to be launched during the current Financial Year 2018-19 a total of 2,25,910 companies have been further identified for being struck-off under section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 along with 7191 LLPs for action under section 75 of the LLP Act, 2008 due to non-filing of financial statements for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17. An opportunity of being heard will be given to these identified companies and LLPs by way of notices regarding their default and the proposed action. Appropriate action will be taken after considering their response.

            

The Ministry of Corporate affairs will also be launching a public awareness campaign soon to make the public aware of the need to get the registrations of their defunct companies cancelled themselves.

 

The mechanism for sharing of documents and information amongst all the Law Enforcement Agencies has been put in place. Standard Operating Procedure regarding ‘Sharing of Documents’ has been finalised and circulated amongst all the Law Enforcement Agencies for compliance. The Task Force is the appellate authority for this purpose. The Standard Operating Procedure for sharing of information amongst the various Law Enforcement Agencies has also been finalized and circulated by Central Economic Intelligence Bureau, which is the Nodal Agency for this purpose.

                  

The Task Force has directed all member Law Enforcement Agencies to send to Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the details of action taken against Chartered Accountants by them. Establishment of an independent regulator for the auditing profession, i.e., the National Financial Reporting Authority, one of the key changes brought in by the Companies Act, 2013, was approved by the Union Cabinet on 1st of March 2018 and has been notified on 21.03.2018. Fraud as defined in section 447 of the Companies Act, 2013 has been made a predicate offence under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.  

 

The Government expects that it’s efforts to clean up the registry will create a transparent and compliant corporate ecosystem in India, promote the cause of ‘ease of doing business’ and enhance the trust of the public.

 

Background 

 

The existence of black money creates imbalances in the economy, finances terror and crimes like money laundering etc., puts the honest at a disadvantage, deprives the State of the much needed revenues and ultimately adversely affects the poor of the country.       

 

The Government has launched a sustained campaign in the last 4 years against black money and has taken several bold steps including constitution of the ‘Special Investigation Team on Black Money’, enactment of the ‘The Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015’, Income Declaration Scheme, 2016, Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 and the demonetization scheme. One such measure was the setting up of a ‘Task Force’ in February, 2017 by the Prime Minister’s Office under the joint Chairmanship of the Revenue Secretary and Secretary, MCA with a mandate to check in a systematic way, through a coordinated multi-agency approach, the menace of companies indulging in illegal activities including facilitation of tax evasion and commonly referred to as ‘Shell Companies’. Department of Financial Services, CBDT, CBEC, CBI, ED, SFIO, FIU-IND, RBI, SEBI, DG GSTI and DG-CEIB are its Members.

                News reports have been appearing in some sections of the media alleging that records & documents relating to investigation into the Nirav Modi/Mehul Choksi case have been destroyed in the Scindia House fire in Income Tax Office in Mumbai. It is hereby clarified that the said reports are completely false & misdirected.

It is further clarified that the records/documents of the ongoing investigations into the Nirav Modi/ Mehul Choksi case had already been transferred to the assessment units housed in different buildings, as part of the assessment process.

Apprehensions about any loss/ damage to the records/documents relating to the Nirav Modi/Mehul Choksi case in the said fire at the IT Office, Mumbai are, therefore, misplaced.

                Legendary inventor and founder of the internationally recognised

 ​''​Sulabh International​''​, Shri Bindeshwar Pathak said that new technologies are the need of the hour to deal with the issues of sanitation and solid waste management in India.

 

Shri. Pathak  was  making his remarks as the Lead Speaker at the Valedictory Session of the two-day Thematic Seminar on ‘Water and Sanitation’ which concluded here today in Pune, Maharashtra. Shri Bindeshwar Pathak said, “First we have to decide about technology because 2.3 billion people have no access to water. Today number of Tier 1 cities is 498. They have sewage treatment capacity of 11553.68 MLD which is just 32% of total sewage generation. And the number is even more troubling in tier 2 cities.”

 

Speaking further on the occasion, Shri Pathak dwelt on his invention of the two-pit pour flush toilet system which is now being further developed and promoted by the Government .He explained its various benefits in view of the diverse nature and high density of population in India.

 

This was the 7th Thematic Seminar in the series as a lead-up event to the 3rd Annual Meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)’s which is being hosted by India in last week of June 2018 in Mumbai. The Seminar was being organised by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India in collaboration with Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) as Knowledge Partner in partnership with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA). The AIIB is a new Multilateral Development Bank with more than 80 member countries headquartered in Beijing. India is the second largest shareholder after China and is keen to leverage this platform to provide leadership on future infrastructure for an Asian Century and also leverage the portfolio of the AIIB to finance its selected infrastructure initiatives.

 

Shri S.T. Devare, Chairman, Research Advisory Council, Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) , and Shri Deepak Mukhi , Sabyasachi Saha were present among others at the Valedictory Session on the second day here in Pune today .  

  

During the two-day long Seminar, leading experts and academicians opined that while India was making significant strides in Water and Sanitation sector, what needed was a holistic and integrated approach as well as creating public awareness and change in their mind set to have larger public participation in sustainability of outcomes.

 

Earlier in the Session, Dr. Sabyasachi Saha, Assistant Professor, RIS, gave a detailed Report based on the discussions held during the two day seminar. He said, ""Water and Sanitation is mother of all infrastructure. Government is taking robust measures to provide piped water to households"" 

 

Following are the Key Outcomes and Policy Recommendations of the two day Seminar on “Water and Sanitation”:

 

User Charges for Water and Water Tariff: It has been argued that people are ready to pay for quality services and due to water scarcity and water quality issues people are in any case paying coping charges. Poor do not benefit from low user charges. They end up paying much more to vendors. So, operational cost recovery is a feasible objective. The modalities of this are being worked out. It was suggested that non-revenue water supply in cities have to be significantly reduced.

Institutional Provisions: Water is a State subject in India, which comes in the way of comprehensive national planning and programme in this sector. It was suggested that a fresh look on the subject may be necessary to effectively address issues of watershed management, and regulation.

Watershed Management and Water-intensity of Agriculture: It was pointed out that river-linking initiatives are misnomer, and the correct approach should be linking of water basins and sources of surface water for sustainable water management. It was also highlighted that due to poor understanding and planning several water scarce states end up having water intensive cropping patterns; case in point is Punjab.  On the other hand as an encouraging example it was highlightedthat Chhattisgarh discourages rice production during Rabi season and subsidizes wheat production.

Private Sector Participation: Interventions in these sectors and utilities in most cases are publicly funded. However, given the nature of challenges the private sector can be a source of innovation and solutions. It is generally perceived that it is difficult for the private sector to invest in water and sanitation. The range of issues includes tendering process, revenue/tariff risk and lack of focus on issues of water quality beyond flow and supply. The successful cases of PPP models in water supply from Manila and Nagpur were discussed in detail. In Nagpur sewage water is being recycled for non-potable use in the industry. It was suggested that the DBO contracts have to be effective. Right incentives for recycling and waste segregation have to be provided to tackle the challenges of landfill. Decentralized solutions and use of technology for water supply and sanitation have been strongly advocated.

Other Highlights of the Proceedings

In terms of better management of water – water footprint assessment of the private industry could be adopted. Moreover, significant R&D is required in areas like scenario building software to inform policymakers and citizens of the implications of different patterns of water use. This would improve the response from both.

Urban areas mostly source water from water basins located at a distance. This has significant cost implications. In order to keep these basins recharged and free from contamination, interventions in terms of industrial waste management and reduction of fertilizer use have to be adopted. This has social and political implications.

Conservation of water is equally important for ecological balance and protection of species. Water wastage through modern but perceivably misguided household purification devices and bottled water supply, needs fresh examination and mitigation.

It was highlighted that 498 Class I cities in India had treatment plants with average of only 32 percent of treatment and 225 Class II cities have treatment plants with a further poor average of 8 percent of treatment of the total waste generated. To improve the situation, decentralized waste management may be promoted.

·         There has been a call made to reduce food waste, plastic usage and general reduction of waste through public awareness.

·         Use of bio-toilets by the Indian Railway is a best practice and a success story from India in terms of timelines and coverage. Such decentralized waste management technologies can be adopted by urban housing societies as well.

·         Finally, there is a need to improve spatial data generation by use of technologies for effective planning and monitoring for water and  sanitation.

                            It was found in many cases that black money was invested in properties in the names of others, even though benefits were enjoyed by the investor concealing his beneficial ownership in his tax returns. The Government had earlier amended Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988, by Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 to make the law stronger. With the objective of obtaining people’s participation in the Income Tax Department’s efforts to unearth black money and to reduce tax evasion, a new reward scheme titled “Benami Transactions Informants Reward Scheme, 2018”, has been issued by the Income Tax Department. This reward scheme is aimed at encouraging people to give information about benami transactions and properties as well as income earned on such properties by such hidden investors and beneficial owners.

 

            Under the Benami Transactions Informants Reward Scheme, 2018, a person can get reward up to Rs. One crore for giving specific information in prescribed manner to the Joint or Additional Commissioners of Benami Prohibition Units (BPUs) in Investigation Directorates of Income Tax Department about benami transactions and properties as well as proceeds from such properties which are actionable under Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988, as amended by Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016.

 

Foreigners will also be eligible for such reward. Identity of the persons giving information will not be disclosed   and strict confidentiality shall be maintained. 

 

Details of the reward scheme are available in the Benami Transactions Informants Reward Scheme, 2018, copy of which is available in Income Tax offices and on the official website of Income Tax Department www.incometaxindia.gov.in .

                “NIFTEM is a one of its kind institute and has the potential to become the Harvard of food processing technology and management sector. A university which despite being nascent, has already been ranked 50th out of 3007 universities in India”, said Union Minister of Food Processing Industries Smt Harsimrat Kaur Badal here today. Addressing the 6th Annual Meeting of NIFTEM-Industry Forum Smt Badal said “Like people world over, Indians are also becoming increasingly aware of healthy food habits. I have asked NIFTEM to explore how it can come up with ‘Brand NIFTEM’ which is healthier,fresher and cheaper.

The Minister added “I foresee a lot of potential for the new facilities created at NIFTEM. The food testing lab should become a nodal lab for Food Safety Standards Authority of India and also both domestic and international companies to rely on for testing of their products.” The Minister added thatNIFTEM should become the brand of the healthiest version of the processed food that they have to offer. She added that the Ministry along with NIFTEM has explored how NIFTEM can open up its incubation centres to new entrepreneurs can try out new things while also providing them a market by opening at least 2 outlets- one at NIFTEM and onein the Ministry premises.

The minister invited suggestions from food processing industry on how to best utilize the facilities at NIFTEM and make them beneficial to all stakeholders. The Minister invited the industry gathering to partner with NIFTEM and evolve as a guide to help the Ministry form policies for the food processing sector.

 

 

 

Secretary of Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Sh Jagdish Prasad Meena said that in 4 years the Ministry has been able to bring the sector to forefront not just in the country but also at global level. He highlighted that the ministry receives three to four foreign delegations every month as compared to only a few in a year till a few years ago.

The Secretary also said that the Industry needs to much more and establish itself as creator and not just imitator of foreign products adding that the industry must come out with products that are globally competitive. He added that great attention needs to be paid to research and development(R&D) and quality certifications for this. On that note he invited the industry to integrate itself with the R&D facilities that NIFTEM offers. He said that the Industry needs to pay more attention to quality of its product and proper certification to avoid rejection of exports by foreign countries.

The Secretary also called for development of protocols for storage of food crops in cold storages. He highlighted that even specialized multi product cold storages in the country are being used as common cold storage whereas each food crop requires its own standards of storage.

“Food Processing is all set to become the most robust sector in India to contribute majorly to India's growth and the sector is all set to double farmers' income by 2022 as envisioned by the Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji”, said Union Minister for Food Processing Industries Smt Harsimrat Kaur Badal, while addressing the media on the achievements of the Ministry during the last 4 years here today. 

Smt Badal informed media that four years back when she took over, food processing sector was totally disorganized and the industry was apprehensive of launching new projects or products and committed projects were being delayed and shelved.  After four years she has reversed the business environment and turned it into the most buoyant and happening sector.

Minister informed, ""from a dismal situation four years back today we have investment commitment of nearly Rs.1,00,000 crores which we got in last one year alone and out of which investment worth Rs.73000 crores have started grounding. This is just tip of the iceberg that shall unleash its real potential in years to come.”

""The last government sanctioned 42 Mega Food Parks from year 2008 onwards and 6 years later when I took over, only two (one of them Patanjali) could get operationalized during 2008 to 2014. I can now proudly say that overall 25 Mega Food Parks would be operationalized by 2018 out of them 15 already been completed so far and 15 more shall be operationalized by 2019” said the minister.

“Four years back industry was apprehensive of the Food Regulator FSSAI and today FSSAI has harmonized itself to world standards.  FSSAI has transformed into the most potent and business friendly regulator for those conforming to rules” mentioned the minister.

Government is creating a Cold Chain Grid to link every nook and corner of India by its 42 Mega Food Parks, 234 Cold Chain Projects and around 700 projects under PM Kisan Sampada Yojana.  With the schemes of the Ministry, more than 33 lakh farmers shall be directly benefited every year and their number shall keep increasing.

Informing the gathering about a new financial institution Smt Badal said, “We are in the process to create a new Financial Institution that will exclusively fund food processing projects and create capacity building in the field of risk assessment and lending to food processing sector. Request for proposal for the institution which will be called Agro Processing Financial Institution, will be out by July, 2018. It will be a Non-Banking Financial Institution and will be largely driven by private sector and government will act as a facilitator. There is keen interest in the institution by both national and international companies.”

 



Last four years have witnessed 351% Mega increase in preservation and processing capacity of 15.94 lakh MT per annum created by the Ministry. Big-time increase of 720% in Cold Storage capacity. 180% increase in the value of agro produce processed by the projects handled by the Ministry.

Under the new Scheme Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana, total of 122 projects have been approved under three schemes viz. Agro Processing Clusters, Backward-Forward Linkage and Unit scheme leveraging an investment of Rs 2,300 crore. This is expected to generate direct and indirect employment of around 3.4 lakh persons. 

The Minister also gave a roundup of investments received since World Food India. 

·         First ever global investment summit “World Food India 2017” organized from 3-5 November 2017 successfully created ‘Brand India’ putting the country on the global food map by positioning India as a ‘World Food Factory’ which led to MoUs for investment worth $14 billion. 

·         FDI inflow between April, 2017 & December, 2017 was USD 822 million 

·         Projects worth $11 billion are already being grounded by over 30 companies.

·         Metro Cash & Carry is adding 25 more stores. 

·         SIAM Makro / CP Wholesale is opening three Big Wholesale stores in New Delhi and one store in NOIDA 

·         Amazon has opened a total of 67 warehouses in the country so far with 15 stores being opened over last month.

·         Grofers has invested in setting up of over 10 vegetable processing centers (Collection centers and Warehouses) 

·         Over $1billion has already been invested by Coca-Cola, Britannia, Cargill, Tilda Hain, Emami, Keventer Agro, Rich Gravis etc. since World Food India 2017.

                “In just 23 months, we have achieved 1.3 crore antenatal check-ups at 12,900 healthcare facilities across the country. And we also identified 6.5 lakh high-risk pregnancies.”  This was stated by Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare while giving away the ‘IPledgefor9' Achievers Awards to the individuals and teams of doctors from the private sector and States for their exemplary services, outstanding support of institutions and commitment from support partners in achieving the mission’s objectives of safe motherhood to every woman in the country, here today. Shri J P Nadda also conferred awards to the States that have shown an exemplary decline in MMR as per the recently released SRS data.

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Smt Anupriya Patel, Ministers of State for Health and Family Welfare, Dr. Vinod Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, Health Ministers from various states and Smt Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health) along with Heads of FOGSI (Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists Society) and IMA (Indian Medical Association) were also present at the event.

Speaking at the function, Shri J P Nadda stated that our strength lies in the fact that whatever programme we take up it becomes the largest in the world and we have taken up those programmes which will have far reaching impacts. Shri Nadda further said that India has made substantial progress on several indicators in spite of its huge numbers and challenging topography. The Union Health Minister added that India has shown impressive gains with 22% reduction in Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) since 2013. “We must also appreciate that Uttar Pradesh with 30% decline has topped the chart in the reduction of maternal deaths,” he said.

Shri J P Nadda further said that providing quality services to over 2 crore pregnant women in India required amalgamation of far reaching vision, policy and implementation at the ground level. “One of our biggest achievements is that the program has been successful in reaching out to difficult and some of the remotest areas of the country. Of 1.3 crores medical check-ups conducted as part of the campaign, more than 25 lakh were in the high-priority districts identified by the Health ministry for focused attention,” Shri Nadda added.

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare said: I am happy to tell you that on the appeal of our Hon’ble Prime Minister doctors across the country have voluntarily come forward and supported the programme of saving lives of pregnant women. He further added that States joined this programme with equal vigour and Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and other states have been able to improve their MMR.

Smt Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare said that constant innovations have been the hallmark of PMSMA. “In less than two years we started we have reached out to every pregnant woman and in these two years 1.3 crore ante-natal check-up have been conducted. We are encouraged with the results we have achieved,” she said. Smt Anupriya Patel congratulated all the stakeholders, especially frontline functionaries for their commendable work. 

Shri Vinod Paul, Member, NITI Aayog said that reduction in MMR is remarkable and it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Some states have achieved three-fourth reduction. Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand registered a huge decline. India succeeded in achieving MDG 4 and MDG 5. I congratulate all the stakeholders,” Shri Vinod Paul said. 

Since its launch, over 1.30 crore antenatal checks ups have been conducted by public sector obstetrician- gynecologists and voluntary participation of over 5000 private and in rural, urban and hard to reach government health facilities. This has resulted in identifying more than 650,000 high risk pregnancies, considered to be a major contributor in preventable maternal deaths. Strengthening the mission’s objectives, around 13000 government healthcare facilities like PHCs, CHCs and District Hospitals are providing PMSMA services on 9th of every month. The mission is proving to be a successful scalable effort by government to facilitate positive engagement between public and private health care providers to achieve the SDG targets. 

According to a special bulletin on “Maternal Mortality Ratio in India 2014-16” by Sample Registration System, the maternal mortality ratio has declined to 130 in 2014-16 from 167 in 2011-13. Furthering the gain, the government’s ambitious programme for improving maternal care, Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) launched in 2016 is a mission in advancing India’s course of achieving Sustainable Development Goals for MMR below 70 by 2030. 

Prime Minister of India in the 31st July 2016 episode of “Mann Ki Baat”, urged private sector doctors to dedicate 12 days in a year to safe motherhood and provide voluntary services under PMSMA on the 9th of every month. He envisaged that 9th of every month symbolizing 9 months of pregnancy should be dedicated to addressing gaps in maternal health services particularly in hard to reach and rural areas. The mission ensures that every pregnant woman registered under PMSMA receives free, comprehensive and quality antenatal care services in their second and third trimesters across India.   

India has made impressive progress in reducing maternal deaths and achieving the targets of MDG 5. Nearly 1000 fewer women are now dying of pregnancy related complications each month as compared to 2013. The government's efforts at improving access to maternal health services leading to increase in institutional births has significantly contributed to groundbreaking reduction in Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) by 22 percent from 2013 levels. Emphasis on mitigating the social determinants of maternal health like increase in girl’s education and reduction in child marriages are other enabling factors that contributed to this notable success.

Also present at the function were Dr. S. Venkatesh, DGHS, Health Secretaries of the States, Mission Directors (NHM), Representatives of development partners including UNICEF, USIAD, BMGF and WHO and other senior officers of the Ministry.

                Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare inaugurated the NIMHANS Digital Academy and addressed the first batch of professionals enrolled for undergoing courses in the fields of Psychiatry and Psychiatric Social Work, here today. Shri Nadda also released the training modules and curricula for various training programmes to be undertaken at the NIMHANS Digital Academy. Smt. Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health & Family Welfare also graced the occasion.

Addressing the participants, Shri Nadda said that the passing of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 brings forth a stronger and more robust legal scaffold and humane and patient-centric rights based approach for mental healthcare in our country. “We have to implement it and we must match speed, skill and scale as has been said by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji to get the desired results”. Shri Nadda further said that as far as skill is concerned, NIMHANS has always been in the forefront of capacity building and human resource training in the country. It has been a pioneer in developing the National Mental Health Programme, a community-based mental health programmes. “We have to be ambitious and ensure that the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 increases in scale of operations”, Shri Nadda added.

Shri Nadda further said under Ayushman Bharat, 150,000 sub-centres will be converted into Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) that will deliver comprehensive primary health care. “The HWCs would provide preventive, promotive, and curative care for non-communicable diseases, dental, mental, geriatric care, palliative care, etc. He stated that the Government has initiated universal screening of common NCDs such as diabetes, hypertension and common cancers along with Tuberculosis and Leprosy, which will eventually help in reducing the disease burden of the country. “In the coming times, we have to see if we can detect mental health disorders at these centres and if it can be included in the universal screening along with these diseases. We can think of training our frontline functionaries in detection, so HWCs also takes care of mental health disorders”.

Smt Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare congratulated the team and said that it is much needed initiative that will enhance the skill and potential of healthcare professionals. She further said that shortage of manpower in this area makes it a very important effort for MoHFW and NIMHANS. She added that Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 envisions adequate quality care for the citizens through skilled healthcare professionals so that we can reduce stigma against mental health disorders.

Shri B N Gangadhar, Director, NIMHANS said that this initiative will serve the purpose of mental healthcare needs. He further said that it will increase the capacity of human resources for mental health by training doctors, nurses, psychologists. Shri Gangadhar said that this initiative will lead us ‘from illness to wellness’. He said up to 50 people can be trained in the virtual classroom with only a cell phone/mobile phone with 3G connection required at the receiver’s end. It will augment the existing skills in mental health in the country, he added.

Ministry of Health, through National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bengaluru (Institute of National Importance), is initiating programmes for training of healthcare service providers across the country to deliver quality mental healthcare services. NIMHANS has established infrastructure for starting a Digital Academy to provide large scale training to healthcare service providers like Medical Officer, Psychologists, Social Workers and Nurses to deliver quality mental healthcare services throughout the country with the objective of exponentially increasing skilled capacity in mental health in the country. The courses for different categories of healthcare providers would be of about 30 hours duration each and spread across a period of three months and would be digitally delivered to remotely located healthcare providers across the country. After successful completion of the course and evaluation, the participants will be awarded “Diploma in Community Mental Health” by NIMHANS, Bengaluru.

Similar training programmes would also be started by the Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi, Jharkhand and Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi Regional Institute of Mental Health, Tezpur, Assam and the Institutes supported by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for establishment of Centres of Excellence in the field of mental health. The courses would be open for general physicians, social workers, psychologists and general nurses.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Strengthening of teaching, patient / clinical care and public health programme implementation - Shifting of more experienced doctors belonging to Central Government and Central government entities to teaching/ clinical / Public Health Programme implementation activities.

 

The approval seeks to ensure that the doctors belonging to Central Health Service (CHS) and of other Ministries / Departments / entities of the Central Government, after attaining the age of 62 years, work exclusively in their respective fields of clinical expertise. This would be done by amending the decision of the Union Cabinet taken in its meeting held on 15.06.2016 for removal of difficulties experienced in effective implementation of this decision.

 

Major Impact:

 

This will result in capacity building and leadership development of more Central Government doctors besides availability of more experienced doctors for medical education, clinical / patient care services and for implementation of national health programmes.

 

Beneficiaries:

 

            The decision will make available more experienced doctors for patient / clinical care, medical teaching activities and implementation of National Health Programmes etc., which is likely to benefit society at large.

 

The benefits of this proposal will percolate down the line throughout the country.

Background: 

 

In order to tackle the problem of shortage of doctors, low joining and high attrition rate in Central Health Service, Union Cabinet in its meeting held on 15.06.2016, approved increase in age of superannuation of doctors of the Central Health Service to 65 years. Subsequently, in its meeting held on 27.09.2017, the Union Cabinet increased age of superannuation of doctors working in various other Ministries/Departments including those of Indian Railways, AYUSH, Central Universities and NTs, etc. to 65 years. It is, however, felt that there is a need to make available the services of senior doctors above the age of 62 years for core medical profession, such as, clinical / patient care/ teaching in medical colleges / implementation of health programmes, Public Health programmes & functions, etc.

                Dr. Indu Bhushan, CEO, Ayushman Bharat- National Health Protection Mission and Dr. R. N. Tandon, Hony. Secretary General, Indian Medical Association (IMA) met to discuss the potential collaboration in implementing Ayushman Bharat- National Health Protection Mission (AB-NHPM). IMA representatives agreed to extend their support for better implementation of AB-NHPM especially in field of empanelment of hospitals, spreading awareness and beneficiary identification processes.

 

Dr.Tandon said “IMA is proud to be associated with AB-NHPM and would be keen to provide help in spreading awareness and developing a larger network of quality service providers especially in Tier 2 & Tier 3 cities.” 

 

Dr. Indu Bhushan added that IMA is a critical stakeholder in AB-NHPM as private sector role is key to success of AB-NHPM by enhancing the accessibility to quality and patient centric care. Key issues like timely payments to the hospitals, feedback & grievance mechanism, ease of setting up of IT infrastructure at hospitals for paperless transactions etc. were deliberated on, and constructive suggestions were made during the meeting. 

 

Dr. Dinesh Arora, Dy. CEO stated that NABH accreditation is desirable but not essential for the hospitals, since the quality and patient safety would be one of the key principle of AB-NHPM. He also conveyed that based on costing studies to be steered by NITI Aayog, continual adjustment of benefit packages and their rates is proposed, hence, IMA need to support NHA through their on-ground knowledge and professional expertise.

 

Shri Indu Bhushan emphasized that, “We need to ensure that the targeted beneficiaries under AB-NHPM will get maximum benefits and can expand access to quality health services in both rural and urban areas including Tier-2 and 3 cities. This can be done only when Government, private healthcare providers and associations like IMA and other industry bodies work together as partners for betterment of health status of the society” 

 

AB-NHPM has been designed to provide financial protection and prevent catastrophic health care expenditures to over ten crore poor and vulnerable families and endow a cover for cashless hospitalization services of upto INR Five lakh per family per year.

He cited the examples of initiatives like Free Drugs and Diagnostics and Mission Parivar Vikas that have benefitted from the Health Profiles. Shri Nadda further said that  India has made substantial progress on several indicators in the recent years and stated that its national health indicators like Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), Maternal Maternity Rate (MMR) and Total Fertility Rate (TFR) are declining faster a than the world pace. The Union Health Minister added that India has shown impressive gains with 22% reduction in Maternal Mortality since 2013. “We must also appreciate that Uttar Pradesh with 30% decline has topped the chart in the reduction of Maternal Deaths,” he said.

 

Shri Nadda further said that Ayushman Bharat will provide comprehensive healthcare to the people as 1,50,000 sub-centres will be converted into Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs). “The H&WC would provide preventive, promotive, and curative care for non-communicable diseases, dental, mental, geriatric care, palliative care, etc. He further stated that the Government has initiated universal screening of common NCDs such as diabetes, hypertension and common cancers along with Tuberculosis and Leprosy, which will eventually help in reducing the disease burden of the country. This will again change the Health Profile of the people in future. 

 

The Union Health Minister stated that the data is an important source of navigation. It helps in understanding the goals, our strengths and weaknesses and it is also an important means to strategize. Good compiled data enables the policymakers to make evidence-based policies and aids effective implementation of various schemes, he added. He also advised that NHRR should have inbuilt process for updating the data so that the system is relevant for times to come. Shri J P Nadda congratulated and appreciated the CBHI team for their initiatives regarding use of geo-mapping.

 

Addressing the participants, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare stated that data is not only important for understanding the health indicators of the Country, but it also provides an opportunity to monitor the situation. He further said that the National Health Profile – 2018 indicates that significant progress has been made in the country for various health outcomes, which is an encouraging sign. “While the data help in understanding the gaps and monitor the progress of various health programmes/schemes implemented by the Government, they are essential for the reliable and timely monitoring of the progress in SDG indicators to which we are committed,” Shri Choubey added

 

Speaking at the function, Smt Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare stated that the Health Profile will help future policy making to address the new challenges on our health system such as epidemiological and demographic transitions and health-impacting environmental changes. “I must put on record that the Government is committed to meet these challenges and strive towards achieving Universal Health Coverage and SDG goals,” She added. 

 

The vision of the NHRR Project is to strengthen evidence-based decision making and develop a platform for citizen and provider-centric services by creating a robust, standardized and secured IT-enabled repository of India’s healthcare resources. NHRR will be the ultimate platform for comprehensive information of both, Private and Public healthcare establishments including Railways, ESIC, Defense and Petroleum healthcare establishments. Under the Collection of Statistics Act 2008, over 20 lakh healthcare establishments like hospitals, doctors, clinics, diagnostic labs, pharmacies and nursing homes would be enumerated under this census capturing data on over 1,400 variables. 

 

The Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI) has actively engaged with key stakeholders including leading Associations, Allied Ministries, and several private healthcare service providers. This resource repository shall enable advanced research towards ongoing & forthcoming healthcare challenges arising from other determinants of health like - disease, environment etc. 

 

Approximately 4,000 trained professionals are dedicatedly working to approach every healthcare establishment for information collection. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the project technology partner adhering to paramount Data Security.

 

The key expected outcomes of the NHRR project are to provide comprehensive data on all health resources including private doctors, health facilities, chemists, and diagnostics labs, establish a National Health Resource Repository for evidence based decision making – aligned with Digital India mission. It shall also enhance the coordination between central and state government for optimization of health resources, making ‘live’ and realistic state Project Implementation Plans (PIPs) and improving accessibility of data at all levels, including State Head of Departments, thus, decentralize the decision making at district and state level.

 

Some key benefits of the NHRR Project are to create a reliable, unified registry of Country’s healthcare resources showing the distribution pattern of health facilities and services between cities and rural areas. Additionally, it shall generate real-world intelligence to identify gaps in health and service ratios, and ensure judicious health resource allocation and management. It shall identify key areas of improvement by upgrading existing health facilities or establishing new health facilities keeping in view the population density, geographic nature, health condition, distance, etc. 

 

Also present at the launch function were Dr S. Venkatesh, DGHS, Dr. Madhu Raikwar, Director CBHI and senior officers of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and CBHI.

                Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare exchanged the Memorandum of Understanding with the State Health Ministers of 20 States marking their commitment towards the launch of the Ayushman Bharat – National Health Protection Mission (AB-NHPM) at a Health Ministers conclave, here today. Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Smt. Anupriya Patel, Ministers of State for Health and Family Welfare, Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO NITI Aayog, Dr. Vinod Paul, Member Health, NITI Aayog, Smt Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health) and Shri Indu Bhushan, CEO, AB-NHPM, were also were also present at the function.

Expressing gratitude to the Prime Minister, Shri J P Nadda stated that we are very thankful to the Prime Minister for giving us this huge opportunity to serve people. He further said that the initiative will change the landscape of healthcare in the country and we would be remembered forever for our work. “We shall work together, learn together, so that we work with the spirit of cooperative federalism, to perfect this largest health assurance scheme of the world,” Shri Nadda said.

Shri J.P. Nadda emphasized that the success of the scheme hinges upon the active participation of the States. States need to own the scheme while Centre will design the policy framework with all possible flexibility and support. “Exchanging of Memorandum of Understanding is an important step in formalizing the partnership between Centre and States,” he added.

Shri J P Nadda further stated that AB-NHPM will protect around 50 crore people (from about 10 crore families). “It will be cashless and paperless access to services upto Rs. 5 lakhs per year will be available for the beneficiary families at the point of service in both public and private empanelled hospitals across India,” Shri Nadda added. He further said that the beneficiaries under the scheme can avail services anywhere in India and it is expected to bring a visible relief to the target families by mitigating the financial risk arising out of catastrophic health episodes. 

The Union Health Minister further stated that health is at the centre-stage and the Government is looking at it holistically. He said that AB-NHPM will protect the people and at the same time Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) will deliver comprehensive primary health care. “The H&WC would provide preventive, promotive, and curative care for non-communicable diseases, dental, mental, geriatric care, palliative care, etc. He further stated that the Government has initiated universal screening of common NCDs such as diabetes, hypertension and common cancers along with Tuberculosis and Leprosy, which will eventually help in reducing the disease burden of the country.

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, said that Ayushman Bharat - National Health Protection Mission (AB-NHPM) will have major impact on reduction of Out Of Pocket (OOP) expenditure. Shri Choubey further said that the scheme will give cashless benefits in any public or private hospital across the country, ensuring accessible and equitable quality health care to the marginalized and vulnerable sections.

Smt Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare stated that NHPM is a move towards comprehensive model of health services delivery, from a sectoral, fragmented and segmented approach. She further said that it a big step to improve secondary and tertiary hospitalization and healthcare facilities.

The Health Ministers and Secretaries were appreciative of the support and inclusive approach extended by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and National Health Agency for Ayushman Bharat – National Health Mission (AB-NHPM) with substantial engagement of all the stakeholders while firming up all the aspects of the Mission like operational guidelines, model tender document for selection of insurance companies and implementation support agencies for trusts, etc

CEO AB-NHPM, Shri Indu Bhushan gave a detailed presentation and updated the status of the implementation. He urged the States to seek approval and release RFP for insurance company hiring (in case of insurance mode) or Implementation support agency (ISA) in case of trust mode implementation. 20 states have so far signed MoU and its likely to be 25 States by the end of this month. During the conclave, model tender documents, final operational guidelines for AB-NHPM were released which are focused on beneficiary centric delivery of services while ensuring there is no compromise on the quality of healthcare services and preventing frauds. The participants were appreciative of the inclusive approach taken by National Health Agency during consultations and workshops.

A web portal for initiating the empanelment of hospitals under the mission was also launched. This marks the commencement of the implementation of AB-NHPM and takes the Mission closer to launch. Training / Demo of empanelment software will be conducted in next two weeks and States can operationalize empanelment of hospitals by 1st of July.

                Smt. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW) chaired the 27th Meeting of the Polio India Expert Advisory Group (IEAG) to review the country programme activities and make recommendations, here today. The expert member group concluded that ‘the country is on the right track’. The experts commended the strong leadership of the Government of India, as well as the ownership of the state governments to for maintaining polio-free status for more than seven years andensuring that every child is vaccinated against the disease. The last case of polio in India was reported in January 2011.  The programme has ensured adequate protection of children through both mass polio vaccination campaigns and childhood immunization.  

 

Speaking at the meeting, Smt. Preeti Sudan said that there are two types of polio vaccine - oral polio vaccine and injectable polio vaccine, which are both used in India to provide enhanced protection.  “We need to ensure that every child in India must receive at least three doses of OPV and two doses of IPV during infancy. This in an invaluable investment for child health in India” SmtPreeti Sudan added. She further said that the nationwide polio campaigns should continue along with routine immunization strengthening initiatives such as Mission Indradhanush, Gram SwarajAbhiyan, and Extended-Gram SwarajAbhiyan.

 

Dr. Michel Zaffran – Head of Polio Eradication, WHO stated that globally the world is closer to polio eradication than ever before.  Eleven cases have been registered in 2018 in only two countries – Afghanistan and Pakistan.  “The experts appreciate the example that India sets for the rest of the world. By eliminating polio in India, the country has demonstrated that global polio eradication is feasible and within reach,” he added.

 

The group of experts appreciated the efforts of India in using both oral and injectable polio vaccines and recommends that this be continued so that no child in India gets paralyzed ever again. Community participation remains an integral part of polio vaccination efforts in the country. The expert group noted that more than 23 lakh vaccinators are mobilized to support every polio mass campaign during which 17 crores children get the oral polio drops.

                Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare inaugurated the 10th meeting of Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF), here today. During his inaugural address, Shri Nadda said that India as a Global leader is committed to eliminating Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) transmission and disease burden so that our future generations are free from Lymphatic Filariasis. He further stated that India will always welcome newer initiatives and research to translate into the Filariasis elimination programme. At the event, Shri Nadda also gave away the GAELF awards to 11 countries- Cambodia, Cook Islands, Egypt, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Niue, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Togo, Tonga and Vanuatu, for successfully interrupting the transmission. The Union Health Minister also released the Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) 2018 for India.

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Dr. Karen Cummings, Hon’ble Minister of Guyana, Prof. Balram Bhargava, Secretary DHR & DG-ICMR, Prof. Charles Mackenzie, Chair GAELF, Dr. Promila Gupta, Director General of Health Services and 

Dr. Jonathan King, WHO Head Quarter, also graced the occasion.

Addressing the participants, Shri Nadda said that significant progress towards the filariasis elimination has been made by India. “With the concerted efforts of Government, state governments and development partners, 100 districts out of total 256 endemic districts have achieved elimination target and stopped Mass Drug Administration after successful validation by Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) and are under post MDA surveillance,” Shri Nadda added.

The Union Health Minister further said that the strategy to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis  in India is based on twin pillars of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) once in a year for interruption of transmission i.e no new case and to cater to the patients already afflicted with the disease with morbidity management.  Shri Nadda further said that there is also an urgent need for total integration of different departments for mobilizing the community.  I am sure “Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis 2018” released today will also expedite the last leap for elimination of LF,” Shri Nadda stated.

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated that it is critical to enhance awareness among the affected communities about the disease and its treatment. “I am sure during 3 days deliberations, experts will come out with pragmatic approach towards elimination of LF. There is a need to all stakeholders to work in integrated manner in order to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as public health problem,” Shri Choubey said.

Lymphatic Filariasis  (LF) or commonly known as Elephantiasis is one of the oldest and most debilitating neglected disease, which is currently endemic in 73 countries of the world, including India. LF disease is caused mainly by Wuchereria Bancrofti and spread by Culex mosquito. This mosquito grows in dirty accumulated water. The disease affects the poorest population in society, particularly those living in areas with poor water, sanitation and hygiene. LF does not kill the affected people, but may cause permanent disfigurement, reduced productivity and social stigma. 

GAELF is an alliance of partners from 72 LF endemic national country programmes, NGOs, private sectors, academic and research institutes and international development agencies that assists WHO's Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis and was formed in year. Since then the meeting are held biennially. The second meeting was held in 2002 in Delhi and India is again hosting the 10th meeting which recognizes that India has highest burden of Lymphatic Filariasis and there is need of taking leadership role to Eliminate lymphatic filariasis.  Participation of LF programme managers in this meeting will provide an insight of larger global programme and enable them join discussion and contribute to solutions.

                Ministry of Health and Family Welfare signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Norway to extend the cooperation within health sector through the Norway India Partnership Initiative (NIPI) for a period of three years starting from 2018 to 2020, here today. Smt. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW) and Mr. ilsRagnarKamsvag, Ambassador of Norway signed the Memorandum of Understanding. Smt. VandanaGurnani, JS (RCH) and officials from the Ministry and counterparts from the Norwegian side were also present during the signing ceremony. 

This cooperation between India and Norway is aligned with the development goals of Government of India as outlined in its National Health Policy 2017 for achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The cooperation shall also focus on global health issues of common interest. 

The partnership shall also include areas related to maternal, new-born, child health, and shall build on experiences from NIPI phase I and II. The cooperation will continue to focus on innovative, catalytic and strategic support, and stride in taking the Indian Government’s Intensification Plan for Accelerated Maternal and Child Survival in India. 

NIPI Phase 3 (2018-2020) will be built on the experiences of NIPI I & II, and will scale up to the intensified districts, and also establish an innovation hub. The best practices in maternal and newborn child health carried out under the National Health Mission and NIPI shall be shared for global dissemination and learning and thereby enabling scaling up.  In the recent World Health Assembly, Family Participatory Care, an initiative of NIPI was showcased as a India case study. 

The Governments of Norway and India had agreed in 2006 to collaborate towards achieving MDG 4 to reduce child mortality based on commitments made by the two Prime Ministers. The partnership was based on India's health initiative, the National Health Mission (NHM), and aimed at facilitating rapid scale-up of quality child and maternal health services in four high focus states - Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and also as a RMNCHA+ partner in Jammu & Kashmir. The main activities in Phase I (2006-2012) were home-based new born care (HBNC), Yashoda through State health system, establishing Sick Newborn Care Units (SNCU), techno managerial support, and providing strategic support for immunization and Public Private Partnership (PPP) initiatives. 

Norway India Partnership Initiative (NIPI) through its work in the last ten years (2007-2017) has resulted in newer initiatives. In addition to trying out innovations, NIPI has also supported NHM by providing credible technical support in the five states and at national level. This has resulted in development and release of multiple policies and guidelines for the NHM.

                India registered a significant decline in Maternal Mortality Ratio. According to the just released SRS bulletin (2016), India has shown impressive gains in reduction of Maternal Mortality with 22% reduction in since 2013. Nearly one thousand fewer women now die of pregnancy related complications each month in India. Maternal Mortality Ratio of India has declined from 167 in 2011-2013 to 130 in 2014-2016. The decline has been most significant in EAG States and Assam from 246 to 188. Among the Southern States, the decline has been from 93 to 77 and in the Other States from 115 to 93.

Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare thanked Prime Minister, Narendra Modi for his visionary leadership and continued support that have tremendously helped in achieving this milestone. “The latest SRS figures reveal that we have gone beyond the MDG target of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of 139 by 2015 and have reached 130. I congratulate the Ministry and the States for their joint efforts,” Shri Nadda said.

According to the SRS Bulletin, there were nearly 12,000 fewer maternal deaths in 2016 as compared to 2013, with total number of maternal deaths for the first time reducing to 32,000. This means that every day 30 more pregnant women are now being saved in India as compared to 2013.

Amongst the States, Uttar Pradesh with 30% decline has topped the chart in the reduction of Maternal Deaths. Three states have already met the SDG target for MMR of 70 per 100,000. These are Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, while Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are within striking distance.

The results signify that the strategic approach of the Ministry has started yielding dividends and the efforts of focusing on low performing States is paying off, especially initiatives like Mission Indradhanush and Intensified Mission Indradhanush with their focused approach are significantly turning the tide in favour of India. Other major initiatives under the umbrella of NHM like augmentation of infrastructure and HR, Capacity Building, JSSK which provides for free transport and care for pregnant women have also contributed to the success.

                Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare today inaugurated the two-day National Consultation on Accelerating Implementation of Tobacco Control Measures for achievement of Goals under National Health Policy, 2017 in presence of Smt Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare to commemorate the World No Tobacco Day, 2018.

 

Smt. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health), Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Additional Secretary and Promila Gupta, DGHS, Ms Payden, Acting Deputy WHO representative to India were also present at the occasion.

 

Addressing the participants, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey said that we should have an addiction-free India that includes Tobacco-free India. He made an appeal for “Nasha Mukti Abhiyaan”. He further added that we need community mobilization to encourage people to give up tobacco consumption. “Tobacco destroys families and communities. We need to start a nationwide abhiyaan- people’s movement, to combat tobacco use”, he said.

 

Shri Choubey also made a strong call for accelerating tobacco control measures for achievement of the goals under National Health Policy, 2017. He observed that tobacco use is a leading cause of premature, NCD-associated mortality and morbidity, and a growing public health challenge. He further said that while many people are aware tobacco use increases the risk of cancer, there are alarming gaps in knowledge of the cardiovascular risks of tobacco use. “I look forward to the suggestions that will emerge from the two-day national consultation, to help us move forward in tobacco control measures”, Shri Choubey elaborated.

 

Smt Anupriya Patel said that tobacco epidemic is a major public health challenge in India, and flavored smokeless tobacco usage in India is very high. She stated that concerted strong political commitment and targeted action over the last decade have contributed to commendable achievements in pushing back the tobacco epidemic.

 

Highlighting the initiatives of the Health Ministry, Smt Anupriya Patel said that a toll free Tobacco Cessation Quitline has been set up and m-Cessation services under the Be Healthy Be Mobile Initiative has been launched along with the Helpline for reporting specific violations of tobacco control laws. She stated that the large specified health warnings occupying 85% of the principal display areas on both the sides of the packs have been implemented. “With the inclusion of National tobacco Quitline number in the health warning recently, it has been made more impactful. This will give tobacco users access to counseling services to effect behavior change,” Smt Anupriya Patel added. She noted that we need to be alert to the threat of new and emerging products and to act swiftly and firmly against them. “We can win the battle only through synergy of our efforts, both within and beyond country,” she said.

 

The Ministers of State released the Global Adult Tobacco Survey 2 India Report, 2016-17 and guidelines for establishing tobacco cessation centres in dental colleges at the consultation and felicitated tobacco workers who have transitioned to other livelihood options. Tobacco survivors presented first-hand account of their struggles and their efforts to overcome the challenges.

 

The two-day consultation will focus on capacity-building of the National Tobacco Control Progamme Nodal Officers. Among the key areas of deliberation will be multi-sectoral engagement for implementation of WHO FCTC in India and synergizing tobacco control with new health initiatives. Tobacco is responsible for 4.5 lakh CardioVascularDiseases (CVD) deaths in the country. In 2011, the total economic cost attributable to tobacco use from all diseases in India for persons aged 35-69 years amounted to a staggering Rs. 1,04,500 crores (22.4 billion USD).

                On directions of Union Health Minister Shri J P Nadda, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken a decision to vaccinate all healthcare workers who are at an increased risk of acquiring Hepatitis-B infection such as those involved in conducting deliveries, giving injections and exposed to blood or blood products.Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all healthcare workers with occupational exposure, who have not received a complete primary series.

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. The virus is highly contagious and is transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. It is transmitted when blood, semen or another body fluid from a person infected with the Hepatitis B virus, enters the body of someone who is not infected. This can happen through sexual contact; sharing needles/syringes, needle injuries; or other invasive equipment; or from mother to baby at birth. There is no specific treatment for acute Hepatitis B disease. Clinical management is based on supportive therapy and relief of symptoms.

HBV infection is a well-recognized occupational risk for health-care workers (including trainees), and others (e.g. housekeeping staff, emergency workers) exposed to infected blood and body fluids or blood-contaminated environments. Because of their contact with patients or infective material, health-care workers are at considerably greater risk of HBV infection than the general population. Health-care workers are often unaware of all exposures to potentially infectious blood and body fluids, or contaminated environments. Even when exposures are recognized, health-care workers often do not seek post-exposure prophylactic management. Hepatitis B vaccination safeguards health workers when administered early, ideally before occupational exposure, and provides greater protection for patients from infection through exposure to contaminated environments or infected workers.

In 2015 the global prevalence of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection in the general population was estimated at 3.5% with about 257 million persons living with chronic HBV infection. It is a major global health problem, and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It is estimated that about 780,000 people die each year due to consequences of Hepatitis B, such as liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. 

Prevalence of Hepatitis Bamong general population in India ranges from 2 to 8%, which places India in an intermediate HBV endemicity zone, and India with 50 million cases is also the second largest global pool of chronic HBV infections. Among healthcare workers seroprevalence is two to four times higher than that of the general population. Hepatitis B is preventable with currently available safe and effective vaccines. 

The Health Ministry is already taking many initiatives to prevent Hepatitis B which include the Hepatitis B vaccine that is given at birth and as a part of routine immunization under the Universal Immunization Programme, and the use of auto disposable syringes for vaccination to prevent spread through contaminated syringes and proper disposal of bio-medical waste.

Reports from India indicate that only 16-60% of healthcare workers have received complete HBV immunization. Paramedics have a higher risk of HBV transmission and receive HBV vaccination less often than doctors. Vaccination is effective in protecting 90- 95 %. 

The adult schedule to be followed for the dosage i.e. three doses of Hepatitis Bare to be given within a period of 1-6 months. The States and Union Territories will work out the logistics including number of beneficiaries which requires the vaccination and the quantity of vaccines. The vaccination remains effective for a long period.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has approved the revised guidelines of the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) on time bound closure of sick/ loss making Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and disposal of movable and immovable assets. The revised guidelines would reduce delays in implementation of closure plans of sick/loss making CPSEs.  These guidelines will replace the guidelines issued by DPE in September, 2016. 

 

These guidelines provide a broad framework for expeditious completion of various processes and procedures for closure of CPSEs by laying down important milestones in the closure process along with timelines, outlining the responsibilities of the concerned Ministries/ Departments/ CPSE, etc., in the process. The guidelines provide for advance preparatory action to be taken by administrative Ministry/ Department and CPSEs, preparation of closure proposal, settlement of statutory and other liabilities of the CPSE under closure and modalities for disposal of movable and immovable assets of such CPSEs in a time bound manner. 

 

The guidelines give first priority for utilization of land of CPSEs under closure for Affordable Housing as per the relevant guidelines of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). Since there are employees working in these CPSEs, Government decided that closure should not cause hardship to them and has now laid down a uniform policy to give workers VRS at 2007 notional pay scale irrespective of the pay scale in which they are working.

 

These guidelines shall apply to all sick/ loss making CPSEs, where – 


	Approval/ in principle approval for closure has been obtained by administrative Ministry/ Department from the CCEA/ Cabinet; or 
	the process for obtaining the approval of the competent authority is underway after the administrative Ministry/ Department has decided for the closure of the CPSE.


 

By assigning priority to Affordable Housing it would make available land parcels of sick/loss making CPSEs under closure for the Government flagship programme of Affordable Housing being managed by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

                The Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh, while chairing review meeting of Delhi Police here today, emphasized the need to bring about a perceptional change of the functions and responsibilities of Police personnel, among the citizens of the city.  In order to achieve this objective, he stressed the need for Police to have a hassle free and citizen-friendly inter-face with the public, for senior officers to lead patrolling parties, especially in sensitive areas of the city; and, to employ technology as a force multiplier in achieving policing objectives. 

The Union Home Minister was informed the Delhi Police has commissioned a Crime Victimzation Survey in May through an independent agency, the Quality Council of India (QCI), which will be conducted soon. 

Shri Rajnath Singh lauded the Delhi Police for achieving a very swift Response time to emergencies which compared favourably with the best in the world. With the setting up of state-of-the-art Control Room by March next year under the National Emergency Support System (NESS) project, the response time is set to further improve drastically. The Union Home Minister appreciated that more than 75% of 944 Distress Callers in Delhi have given positive feedback of the Police to an online survey.

Lauding the relentless efforts of the Delhi Police to improve law and order in the national capital, Shri Rajnath Singh expressed satisfaction the heinous crimes in the capital have dropped from a high of 10,266 cases in the year 2014 to 6,527 last year. The Union Home Minister however voiced concern over the low conviction rate as compared to other metros, - Mumbai and Chennai, and called for steps to strengthen the Investigation Wing of the force. MHA has sanctioned 4,227 posts (SI/ASI 1409, HC-1,409 and Ct.-1,409) for the purpose of separation of Crime Investigation and Law & Order functions. Delhi Police Commissioner Shri Amulya Patnaik said the process to create a Cadre of Investigation Officers is underway.

The Union Home Minister directed urgent implementation of the National Emergency Support System (NESS). Shri Rajnath Singh said a scientific assessment and evaluation of the CCTV requirements for the city should be carried out. Delhi Police has undertaken installation of CCTVs at ten Police Stations on a pilot programme basis which will subsequently be implemented in the remaining 184 Police Stations. Also, Delhi Police has plans to install 10,000 CCTVs at public places for Women’s Safety of which nearly 4,000 are in place. Besides, more than 2 lakh CCTVs have been installed by the public under the Nigehban scheme. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said there should be zero tolerance for traffic violations and called for more deployment of women in PCR vans. Commissioner Shri Amulya Patnaik said 33% women are being inducted in all ongoing recruitments while their representation in the force is already much higher than the sanctioned strength. An RFP will be issued soon for implementation of the Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) in the city and should be in place by 2022. Besides, the Delhi Police is the only force in the country which has enabled registration of e-FIR for cases of Mobile Phone and Vehicle theft.

The Union Home Minister called upon the senior officers to fastrack projects to achieve optimum utilization of funds under the capital category. Calling for raising satisfaction among the force personnel, Shri Rajnath Singh directed expeditious implementation of Housing projects which stands at a low of about 15%.

The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba and senior officers of Delhi Police and MHA attended the meeting.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)  conducted mock exercises at Baltal and Pahalgam base camps from June 22 to June 25 to assess the preparedness and response mechanism of all the stakeholders involved in the management of the upcoming Amarnath Yatra. Mock exercises were conducted at critical areas along the Baltal and the Pahalgam-Chandanwari routes covering both natural as well as man-made disasters.

NDMA experts trained the participants on key aspects of disaster management such as the formation of Incident Response Teams, coordination among various participating agencies, evacuation, medical preparedness and trauma counselling. ""This exercise aims at enhancing the preparedness of officials of the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB), district administration and other key Government agencies to deal with any disaster during the Yatra,"" said Lt. Gen. N. C. Marwah (Retd.), Member, NDMA.

Both the mock exercises began with a Co-ordination Conference on Day 1 followed by a Table-top Exercise on Day 2. Senior officials from all the important departments such as the SASB, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), the Rashtriya Rifles, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Army, police, health, Civil Defense, transport, fire and other emergency services attended these preparatory meetings and participated in the mock exercises.

After the drills, post-exercise analyses were carried out by the NDMA experts in which they discussed the entire operation and underlined areas that needed improvement. ""Better coordination among various agencies is of utmost importance and often the key to a successful post-disaster response,"" said Lt. Gen. Marwah (Retd.). 

The annual Amarnath Yatra to the cave shrine in South Kashmir will begin from June 28.

The NDMA regularly conducts such mock exercises throughout the country in its efforts to improve preparedness and response mechanisms for various disasters. Earlier in June, it conducted a mock exercise on flood preparedness across 23 districts in Uttar Pradesh.

                The Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh, paid an official visit to Mongolia from June 21-24, 2018.  During the visit, Home Minister called on the President of Mongolia, Mr. K. Battulga and held talks with Prime Minister, Mr. U. Khurelsukh, Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. U. Enkhtuvshin, and Minister of Justice & Home Affairs, Mr. Ts. Nyamdorj on wide-ranging issues of bilateral interest, including cooperation between India and Mongolia in disaster risk reduction, border management, and capacity building programmes in security domain.

During the visit, Home Minister along with the Prime Minister of Mongolia presided over the ground-breaking ceremony of Mongolia’s first petrochemical refinery project. The refinery will be built with a Line of Credit of US$ 1 billion extended by India, which was announced during Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s visit to Mongolia in 2015. The Mongolian side expressed appreciation for India’s support for this project. Both sides agreed that the refinery project will contribute to Mongolia’s economic development and long-term energy security.

Home Minister also visited the headquarters of the Mongolian General Authority for Border Protection (GABP) and announced GOI’s decision to provide a high capacity server for the GABP’s main control centre in order to assist them in more efficient border management. GABP and India’s Border Security Force have ongoing exchanges and cooperation under an MoU signed in 2015.  

During the bilateral talks Home Minister held with the Mongolian leadership, both sides agreed on the need to step up cooperation in a number of areas such as air connectivity, trade and economic cooperation, energy security, mining, traditional medicine, animal husbandry, capacity building, education, people-to-people contacts, media exchanges and cooperation in films.

India and Mongolia, joined by the common thread of Buddhism, are spiritual neighbours. The relationship was upgraded to a Strategic Partnership in 2015 during the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s visit, which coincided with the 60th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Home Minister’s visit to Mongolia comes as a part of sustained high-level exchanges between the two countries.  Most recently, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi met with the President of Mongolia, Mr. K. Battulga on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit in Qingdao, China, on June 10, 2018. Earlier, the External Affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj paid an official visit to Mongolia on April 25-26, 2018.

                During the Ground Breaking Ceremony for the Oil Refinery at 'Stantsiin Hooloi' in Altanshiree Soum, Mongolia today, the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh observed that this Ceremony was an important milestone in the bilateral ties between India and Mongolia. The Prime Minister of Mongolia, Mr. Ukhnaagin Khurelsukh and other dignitaries were present.

The Home Minister while recalling the statement made by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during his historical visit to Mongolia in 2015 where he had announced Line of Credit of US$ 1 billion for this project, expressed confidence that with the start of this refinery, Mongolia would derive rich benefits. Shri Rajnath Singh was of the opinion that this will further strengthen the relationship between both the countries and averred that it was India which first established Diplomatic relations with Mongolia after it came out of Communist Bloc. 

The Home Minister lauded the efforts made by His Holiness Kushak Bakula, who during his life called upon the youth to lead life with human values. He himself, the Home Minister observed, was a symbol of peace and love. 

Shri Rajnath Singh further stated that both India and Mongolia should work in close coordination not only for progress and development of Asia but to usher peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.

Home Minister is on a 3-day visit to Mongolia to further strengthen India’s relations with Mongolia and security cooperation. Mongolia is seen as an important strategic partner of India and New Delhi wants to realise the huge potential of bilateral relations with Mongolia.

                The Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir has said that there is a need to amend the Identification of Prisoners Act 1920, to provide legal authority for taking of finger impressions, photographs and measurements of persons arrested. Use of technology by criminals is posing a new challenge to the police force in solving crimes, he said.   Inaugurating the 19th All India Conference of Directors of Finger Print Bureaux in Hyderabad today, the Minister said that the data base of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) which has just 11.5 lakh finger print records needs to be expanded.  He said that finger print evidence is considered reliable by investigators and jurists as it is fool proof and an effective forensic tool.  

Shri Ahir stressed on the need to modernise the police force and said smart policing is the need of the hour, at a time when criminals have access to technology and are using it to commit crimes.  If the police force works to bring down the crime rate and ensure criminals are punished, fewer people would resort to committing crimes, he said.

In his welcome address Shri Ish Kumar, Director, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) said that finger prints are used as unique identity in many countries for solving crimes. He said the NCRB, which is a repository of crime records, needs to expand its data base very soon.

Shri Mahender Reddy, DGP, Telangana State said that 868 undetected cases in the state have been solved using the automated finger prints identification system.

Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir gave away Aziz-ul-Haq trophy to finger print experts who excelled in the All India Board Exam. He also released two books titled ‘Compendium of Finger Print equipment – 2018’ and ‘Award of excellence in identification’.

The two-day conference being organised in Hyderabad for the first time will deliberate on finger print identification systems and modernization of state finger print bureaux among other issues.

                Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir will inaugurate the 19th all India Conference of Directors of Finger Prints Bureaux in Hyderabad tomorrow. During the two-day conference, participants will deliberate on latest Automatic Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS), usage experience of AFIS in Maharashtra and Telangana, integration of Finger Prints with CCTNS/ICJS. Sessions are also scheduled for improving training curriculum, modernization of State Finger Print Bureaus and staffing pattern. In the conference issues related to administration, standard operating procedures for uniform functioning of bureaus would also be deliberated.

Other issues related to proper functioning of FP Bureaux, educational qualifications at the entry level, pay scale across India, standardization of FP slips would be deliberated upon and recommended. Directors of Finger Prints Bureaux who would be retiring during 2018 will be sharing their lifetime experience and associations. They would be felicitated in the conference.

University students would be presenting research done by them in the field of Fingerprint science. Vendors would demonstrate the latest advancements in the field of fingerprint development so that the experts are benefitted with the latest knowhow in their technical field. 

Two books entitled ‘Compendium of Fingerprint equipment 2018” & ‘Award of excellence in FP identification / science competition –compilation of cases’ would be released during the Conference.

Candidates who acquired first position in the All India Examination of Finger print experts would be awarded with ‘Aziz ul Haque Trophy’ and cash prize. Other winners would be awarded certificates and cash prize. The competition was conducted by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) based on the solved cases. Awardees will be presenting the techniques used by them in solving the criminal cases reported at various Police Stations.

Among major issues to be discussed during the two-day conference is the imperative need for amendment in the Aadhar Act, - essential for identifying unidentified dead bodies as well as first time offenders. Amendment in Identification of Prisoners Act 1920 is also required to include other biometrics as face, palm and voice etc which are the need of the hour.

NCRB, in cooperation with CMC Ltd., Secunderabad, developed the first indigenous AFIS called FACTS.  Now this technology has improved a lot and within seconds it is possible to match the finger prints of more than a million individuals. 

Last year Telangana FPB procured latest AFIS from Papillion and was able to solve several cases which were unsolved with FACTS. Out of total of 868 undetected cases solved by the new AFIS since installation, 480 cases are old unsolved scene-of-crime cases. In addition, 42 cases of unknown bodies were also identified through fingerprints. A total a/w 7.2 crores property has been recovered through identification of chance prints developed from scene-of-crime.

Telangana Police are also using Mobile devices for verifying criminal antecedents of suspects. More than 7,000 offenders with criminal history were apprehended using these devices.

Incidentally, the world’s first finger print bureau was established in 1897 at Calcutta during British period. Different countries started using Finger Print as unique identity for land registration, authentication, access control and many other ways. Even today although several other biometric like iris, face, DNA are available, mainly used authoritative mechanism is the Finger Print. Rapid technological advancement in information technology has improved finger print usage enormously and today entry of foreigners in the country is through finger Print biometric.

                Union Minister of Women and Child Development (WCD), Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi launched the “Handbook on legal processes for Police in respect of Crime against Children” at a function here today. 

Speaking on the occasion, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi urged all stakeholders to unite in preventing and combating crimes against Children. She highlighted that the Government is committed to create a nation free of violence against Women & Children. The WCD Ministry will work closely with identified stakeholders to ensure that this Handbook is available in every Police Station, preferably in local languages, she added.

The Minister emphasized that the Government has decided to take every step in addressing this issue in the best possible manner. One of the important requirements is to empower and skill the police agencies and other responders in addressing the crimes against children professionally and diligently, she added.

Further, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi elaborated upon the services offered by Child Line and Railway Child Line which have been highly successful in reuniting missing children with their families. She further stated that a short documentary “Komal” has been released to sensitize the children on “good and bad touch”. Amendment in the Juvenile Justice Act has been brought about to treat juveniles 16 years of age as an adult for trial in heinous crimes. She emphasized the importance of Forensic Laboratories in India and informed that five new Forensic Laboratories are being established to cater to the investigation of an average 2,000 rape cases every year. She expressed the need for Rape Investigation Kits in every Police Station to facilitate the investigation on priority basis. The issue has been taken up with HRD Ministry to print POCSO related laws on front and back of all the text books to increase awareness among children. The Minister also mentioned about the e-box Complaint System for the school children to come up against the issues of sexual harassment.

The Minister hoped that the book will definitely prove to be a tool to enhance and fine-tune the skills of the end user in the application of the laws, rules, rulings and related provisions pertaining to Crimes Against Children.

The Handbook is a composite tool which will aid Police personnel to chart a step-by-step procedure to be adopted in cases of crime against children. Legislations and the latest rulings of Courts are also mentioned in the book. A team led by Dr. P.M. Nair of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) has developed this comprehensive, user-friendly, process oriented document published by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) in partnership with TISS. The publication is part of an initiative taken by BPR&D to partner with reputed academic and research institutions across the country in undertaking research and developing quality tools and knowledge products to enhance the professional competence of the Indian Police.

Dr. A.P. Maheshwari, Director General, BPR&D was present during the book launch function.

                Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh today cautioned against the new challenges being posed by crimes in the cyberspace and called for effective measures to improve cyber security. In a review meeting in the Ministry of Home Affairs, he expressed concern over the misuse of social media for illegal activities and directed to strengthen the capabilities of law enforcement agencies to be able to meet the challenges posed by it.

 

Shri Rajnath Singh appreciated the efforts made in expediting security clearance for proposals in sensitive sectors and noted with satisfaction that the average duration for the clearance of a proposal has come down to 53 days compared to 120 days four years ago. He directed to further reduce the clearance time by making use of online systems in coordination with administrative Ministries for processing the proposals. This would further improve efficiency and monitoring.

 

While expressing concern over rising misuse of internet for circulating child pornography and other obscene material, the Home Minister directed to expedite the launch of online cybercrime reporting portal. This will enable affected people in States/Union Territories to lodge complaints which will be investigated by the respective law enforcement agencies and action taken for removal of such content.

 

Shri Rajnath Singh called for greater vigilance against evolving cyber threats and called for regular cyber auditing of IT infrastructure of all organisations under MHA. He directed for upgradation and updation of National Information Security Policy and Guidelines (NISPG) for the government sector. He also expressed concern over financial frauds being committed on gullible public by phone call fraudsters and stressed on increasing public awareness and strengthening of institutional framework for checking such frauds.

 

Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba and senior officials of MHA were present.

                On 17th May, 2018, Government of India took the decision that Security Forces will not conduct offensive operations in Jammu & Kashmir during the holy month of Ramazan. This decision was taken in the interests of the peace loving people of J&K, in order to provide them a conducive atmosphere to observe Ramazan.

Government commends the role of Security Forces for having implemented the decision in letter and spirit in the face of grave provocation, to enable the Muslim brothers and sisters to observe Ramazan in a peaceful manner. This has been widely appreciated by the people all over the country, including J&K, and has brought relief to the common citizens.

It was expected that everyone will cooperate in ensuring the success of this initiative. While the Security Forces have displayed exemplary restraint during this period, the terrorists have continued with their attacks, on civilians and Security Forces, resulting in deaths and injuries.

Security Forces are being directed to take all necessary actions as earlier to prevent terrorists from launching attacks and indulging in violence and killings. Government will continue with its endeavour to create an environment free of terror and violence in Jammu & Kashmir. It is important that all sections of peace loving people come together to isolate the terrorists and motivate those who have been misguided to return to the path of peace.

                In its efforts towards improving flood preparedness ahead of the monsoon season, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)  conducted a mock exercise on flood preparedness in Uttar Pradesh today. The exercise was held in collaboration with State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA).

The simulation exercise was conducted simultaneously in 23 flood-prone districts of the State to assess the preparedness of the State's machinery for the recurring annual floods. The exercise also helped improve the administration’s capacity in mobilising resources and reaching out to the affected communities swiftly in case of an actual flood situation.

Once the simulation was indicated from the field, EOCs at the districts were activated. Depending on the situation report, rescue teams under Incident Commanders were formed and dispatched to the respective locations. Boats and helicopters were used to simulate the evacuation of the affected villages and bring the residents to relief camps. Preliminary first aid, food packets, drinking water and other necessities were made available at these camps for the evacuated people. The exercise also saw the restoration of essential services, viz. water, electricity, sanitation, schools, etc., after the simulated floods receded.

Afterwards, a post-exercise analysis was carried out by NDMA in which participating officials highlighted the challenges faced by them. Independent observers from Army also shared their feedback and suggested ways to further streamline response mechanisms.Today’s exercise was preceded by an orientation-cum-coordination conference on June 5, 2018, followed by a tabletop exercise yesterday through videoconferencing with all participating districts from the State Capital. These preparatory meetings were conducted to ensure the smooth facilitation of the exercise.

Capacity building and improving disaster preparedness is an ongoing exercise. NDMA has so far conducted more than 600 mock exercises for various disaster situations across the country.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)) conducted a table-top exercise at the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC) in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh today. The exercise was held in the run-up to a State-level mock exercise on flood preparedness to be held in 23 flood-prone districts of Uttar Pradesh tomorrow. The exercise is being held in collaboration with State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA).

All the districts confirmed that their Disaster Management Plans (DMPs) had been updated, Response Teams identified and other preparations for the exercise had been put in place. The table-top exercise was conducted based on scenarios created in collaboration with State Department based on flood mapping and other related hazards. Independent observers were also briefed about their role and standard feedback forms were given to them. Sites for the mock exercise and administrative arrangements were finalised. 

Earlier, a Coordination-cum-Orientation Conference was also held on June 5, 2018 wherein a detailed briefing about the conduct of mock exercise was carried out by NDMA coordinator.

These preparatory exercises were attended by senior-level officials of the State Government, Army, Air Force and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) at the State Headquarters in Lucknow. District collectors and their teams participated in these exercises through video conferencing.

                A delegation from the United Kingdom led by the Minister of State for Countering Extremism and Minister for Equalities, Baroness Williams of Trafford, held talks with the Indian delegation led by the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju here today. The discussions covered variety of important issues ranging from cooperation in matters of migration, tackling extremism, extradition, sharing of criminal records etc. During the meeting, Shri Rijiju also called for implementation of the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to check money laundering and terrorist financing.

While underlining the need for cooperation in fighting international terrorism, Shri Rijiju said terrorism cannot be viewed with a prismatic view and urged the UK Minister to check anti-India activities on its soil. Baroness Williams assured cooperation of the highest level on this issue. Raising the issue of fugitive tycoons wanted by New Delhi for frauds and financial misappropriations, Shri Rijiju said Britain should not be viewed as a safe haven for men wanted by the law of the other country for various offences. He said while India respects the courts and will pursue the legal procedures in Britain to bring back wanted men, New Delhi expects the cooperation of the UK Government. Allaying concerns over prison conditions in India, Shri Rijiju said there are absolute safeguards against Human Rights violations in Indian prisons. 

In response to the UK Minister’s request for facilitating repatriation of illegal migrants, Shri Rijiju said that while the issue of timeframes is important, Government would like to reassure itself about the completion of verification before repatriation process begins. Shri Rijiju also lauded the cooperation of the UK Government on various international forums.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has expressed concern that some forces want to mislead the innocent youth of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and they don’t want the situation to change. Expressing his agony, he said while their own children obtain education, others are misled to take up stones and asked what kind of justice was that. Addressing a press conference in Srinagar today, Home Minister said he appeals from the bottom of his heart that the youth of J&K should be considered as their own children and no one should be allowed to play with their future. They are not only children of J&K, but of India, he added. So the decision was taken to withdraw about 10,000 cases against first time offenders of stone pelting, he said.

Shri Rajnath Singh said the Centre appointed a Special Representative who visited J&K eleven times. He appealed to the people to come forward for peace. Talks can happen with any one and they need not be like minded, but they should be right minded, he asserted. Quoting Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Home Minister said, the Government’s approach is “goli se nahi, gale lagaane se”. 

He said Pakistan should stop cross-border terrorism and can take help from neighbours if it was not able to do so alone. He added some want to destabilize India, but they cannot stop India’s economic progress. 

The Home Minister reiterated that, keeping in mind the interests of people of Jammu and Kashmir, the Government took the decision to suspend offensive operations during the holy month of Ramazan. He informed that he reviewed the security situation in the state and arrangements for the Amarnath Yatra. He also reviewed the implementation of PM special package for J&K. He congratulated the State Government for efficient implementation of various projects.

To strengthen J&K police infrastructure, Rs 174 crores and for procurement of security equipment Rs 500 crores were sanctioned. Remuneration for SPOs numbering more than 5,400 was increased to Rs 6,000 from Rs 3,000. The youth of the state were given employment through recruitment in CAPF, Army and IRB and women are getting 33% representation.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh arrived in Srinagar today on a two-day visit to the state. 

In his first program, Shri Rajnath Singh attended the sports conclave in Srinagar. More than 3,000 sportsmen, students and enthusiasts from the three regions of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh participated. The Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Ms. Mehbooba Mufti and Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh and Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba were also present. During the event, Shri Rajnath Singh felicitated prominent sports persons: Parvez Rasool (cricket), Manzoor Ahmad Pandav (cricket), Mehraj Uddin Wadoo (football), Real Kashmir Club (football), Ms Palak Kaur (gymnastics) and Ms Balween Kaur (gymnastics).

In his address, Shri Rajnath Singh said under PMDP program, Rs 200 crores has been sanctioned for development of sports infrastructure in J&K. Under it, Bakshi stadium renovation work has started with allocation of Rs 44 crores and Maulana Azad stadium in Jammu will be developed at a cost of Rs 40 crores. In all 22 districts of J&K, stadiums are under various stages of development at a cost of Rs 88 crores. Water sports infrastructure is being developed in Mansar and Pahalgam at a cost of Rs 6 crores.

Shri Rajnath Singh told the youth that future of not only Jammu and Kashmir, but also the country is in their hands. He said “ummid ka ujala” can happen only with “sports ki karamat” and “taleem ki taqat”. The Home Minister assured that future of J&K youth has always been safeguarded by India and it will remain so in future. Some forces have been trying for many years to mislead the J&K youth. Those forces have no interest in their future. Youth of J&K have same role and contribution in India’s growth and progress just as youth of any other state, he said.

He appealed to them to choose development (taraqi) and not destruction (tabahi). If you choose development, state will develop, he said. Please join this development chain and herald in a new dawn in Jammu and Kashmir, he added.

                Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh today felicitated 15 member team of the 2nd BSF Mt. Everest Expedition here today. This team successfully scaled Mount Everest on 20th & 21st May 2018 in two different groups. Padma Shri Love Raj Singh Dharmshaktu created history by conquering the peak for the seventh time.  The Home Minister presented cheques of Rs. Two lakh to the Expedition Leader, Rs. One and a half  Lakh to the Deputy Leader and Rs. One lakh to each member of the team. He also presented cheques of Rs. 25,000 to each member of the support team.

          Stating on the occasion that the Border Security Force (BSF) not only guards the borders of the country, the Home Minister expressed said, he feels proud that brave men of this frontier Force also successfully conquered the world’s highest peak the Mount Everest.  He said, while it is difficult to achieve this feat even once, the BSF men have done it twice.

          Shri Rajnath Singh appreciated that this team also propagated the message of protection of environment by spreading “Swachchta Mission” at the great Himalayan peaks. He lauded the effort of the team which brought down with them 700 kilograms of waste left over by other mountaineering expedition teams. He said, it is a praiseworthy step by the BSF which put forth before the entire world India’s commitment to safeguarding the environment.          The selected team member of the 2nd BSF Mt. Everest Expedition had undergone 40 days of pre-expedition tough training  during the last  year at the Atal Behari Vajpayee Mountaineering Institute in Manali in Himachal Pradesh where they learnt the skills of mountaineering. Starting from Kathmandu, Nepal on March 20, the team had set up their base camp at the height of 17,800 feet. The expedition then split into two teams and set up their second Camp  at the height of 21,600 feet on April 30 and the third Camp at 23,900 feet on May 02.  During their expedition, the BSF teams scaled the high peaks thrice and under their  “Swachch Glacier Mission” collected and brought back the leftover waste by other mountaineers, to their base camp.

          Director General, BSF, Shri K.K. Sharma and other officials were present on the occasion.

The first group comprising seven members, led by Expedition Leader Shri Love Raj Singh Dharmshaktu, finally conquered the World’s highest peak the Mount Everest at 7.30 in the morning of May 20. The second group led by Deputy Leader Shri Avinash Negi starting from Base Camp on May 18, scaled the Mount Everest at 7.30 in the morning on May 21. The Expedition also included eight member support team. The teams then returned to their Base Camp on May 24. They returned to Delhi on June 1st.

                Govt of India has enhanced the compensation for loss of milch animals due to corss-border firing in Jammu & Kashmir to Rs. 50,000/- per milch animal. Border areas of Jammu and Kashmir are facing losses of livestock, crops, houses etc. due to corss-border firing from across the border. 

It may be recalled that the Govt. of India had announced expenditure for relief camps and compensation for losses of houses, crops, livestock at NDRF rates to the victims of cross-border firing in the month of December, 2017.  It was, however, observed that compensation for loss of milch animals which was Rs. 30,000/- per milch animal, was quite inadequate compared to actual value of milch animals. Considering the problem of border-residents, Govt of India has increased the compensation amount to Rs. 50,000/-. 

These claims will initially be paid to the victims by the State Government of J&K after evaluating the actual loss.  The amount will then be reimbursed by the Ministry of Home Affairs under Security Related Expenditure (Relief & Rehabilitation) Scheme. Orders in this regard have been issued to J&K Govt. on 1st June, 2018.

                Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh here today launched an Online Analytical Tool to facilitate closer monitoring of the flow and utilisation of foreign contributions received by various organisations registered or permitted under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010.  This web-based tool enables decision-makers in various Departments of Government to scrutinise source of foreign funds and their actual use in India.  It gives them capacity to take data-driven and evidence-based decisions regarding the compliance of the provisions of the FCRA, 2010.  It has analytical features to conduct big data mining and data exploration.  Its dashboard will be integrated with the bank accounts of the FCRA-registered entities through the Public Financial Management System for updation of transactional data on a real-time basis.

Shri Rajnath Singh witnessed a presentation on various aspects of the Analytical Tool and appreciated the painstaking work done by all concerned officials.  Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba, Director (IB)  Shri Rajiv Jain, DG (NIC) Smt. Neeta Verma and officials of Ministry of Home Affairs were present.

There are approximately 25,000 active organisations registered under The FCRA, 2010.  Foreign Contributions worth Rs.18,065 crores were received by such organisations from foreign donors for various social, cultural, economic, educational and religious activities during financial year 2016-17.  Each FCRA-NGO conducts multiple financial transactions in receiving and spending the foreign contribution.  Therefore, there are hundreds of thousands of such transactions annually which can be monitored effectively through this tool.  It will, therefore, help the stakeholders in  Government to better regulate acceptance and utilisation of foreign contributions.

                The NBCC/CPWD will re-work the design and plans for the remaining redevelopment of the 7 GPRA colonies to avoid felling/cutting of trees.  NBCC has already floated an Expression of Interest for the acquisition of tree re-location/transplantation equipment and for engaging services of trained professional entities in this respect. Further Citizens groups will be invited to suggest where transplanted trees will be planted. 

 A meeting in this regard was chaired by Shri Hardeep SinghPuri, Minister of State (I/C), Housing and Urban Affairs, here today. The meeting discussed various issues relating to re-development of seven GPRA colonies in the particular context of felling of trees.

            The following were present:

ii)         Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary,MoHUA

iii)        Shri Manoj Kumar, Additional Secretary, MoHUA

iv)        Shri Uday Pratap Singh, Vice Chairman, DDA

v)         Dr Anoop Kumar Mittal, CMD, NBCC

vi)        Shri Abhai Sinha, DG, CPWD

vii)       Shri Prabhakar Singh, Spl DG, CPWD

 

 In pursuance of the presentation made in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on 9 January 2018, a decision was taken to plant more than one million trees in different parts of Delhi as follows: 

NBCC            :           25,000

CPWD            :           50,000

DDA               :           10,00,000

DMRC                        :           20,000

It may be clarified that these will not be saplings but trees of 8-12 feet height. The planting of trees will be completed in the next three months during the monsoon season and the trees will comprise of fruit-bearing, flowering and other green trees.

Environmental and related clearances are given on the recommendations of the Forest Department of the State Government and specific recommendation of the Minister concerned in the Government of NCT of Delhi (Shri Imran Hussain, Minister of Environment and Forest had recommended these cases to the LG).

                Transport infrastructure is one of the most important factors for a country's progress. With rapidIndustrialization, Urbanization, Globalization and concentration of large population in urban centers, the cities and towns of the country are growing at a faster pace.  To keep this faster pace, for moving people, goods and services, metro rail projects are playing a crucial role not only as a transportation solution but as a means to transform cities. 

2.       Today, 490 kms of metro lines are operational in 10 different cities in the country.   More than 600 kms of metro rail projects are under construction in various cities. In the coming years there will be robust growth in metro rail sector.   More than 350 kms of new construction will be started in the next few years as more and more cities are planning for expansion or new constructions of metro rail. In addition to metro rail network, Regional Rapid Transport System (RRTS) is also being introduced to decongest Delhi & NCR. The first phase of RRTS consists of 3 corridors, covering a total length of about 380 kms. This transit system will connect Delhi with Sonepat, Alwar and Meerut.

3.      The Government of India is providing financial support in the implementation of metro rail projects by way of Equity and Subordinate Debt aswell as well as sovereign guarantee for multilateral and bilateral loans. The increasing trend of central government budget outlay provided for metro rail projects in last four years is evidence of the ever growing need for metro rail to decongest and enhance mobility in our cities.The average budget outlay of Govt. of India is likely to increase to about Rs 25,000 cr annually, apart from the investments envisaged by the state governments, private partners and ULBs.

4.      Various other steps have been taken for the systematic and sustainable growth of metro rail projects in the country. The standards for rolling stock and signaling systems or the metro rail in India have been notified in 2017 after concurrence from Railway Board. The standards for rolling stock also fixes the standards of civil structures.  The standards for electrical systems have been concurred by the Railway Board recently and the same will be notified soon.Various new metro systems have already started procurement of the systems as per the notified standards.The detailed specifications for the Automatic Fare Collection System and the complete eco-system based on the Rupay standard has been prepared by NPCI and C-DAC in collaboration with DMRC through a research project sanctioned by MoHUA. BEL has been tasked to manufacture the prototype of the gate trough their ownfunds. Substantial expenditure has already been incurred and the first indigenous gate based on the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) is likely to be launched in October 2018.The specifications of the most advanced signaling system in the world viz. Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) system, which was introduced by Kochi Metro Rail first in the country, is also being formulated jointly by BEL, C-DAC, DMRC, STQC through MoHUA.

5.     However, there are numerous other areas for which indigenous standards need to be formulated.These are layout of metro station,platforms, signage& displays, size of tunnels, fire protection systems, disaster management systems, environment friendly and waste management systems, standards for solar panels at stations etc.

6.     These indigenous standards will ensure that metro rail sub systems for all new metro projects conform to the prescribed standards thus incentivizing manufacturers to plan for long term investments in the country and set up manufacturing units. This will also bring down the cost of the metro rail constructions and operation.

7.     For this purpose, a committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Sh. E. Sreedharan for Standardization and Indigenization in Metro Rail with the following members:


	Chairman Dr. E. Sreedharan
	Sh. H.S. Anand, (for Rolling Stock) Former Director, Rolling Stock, DMRC
	Sh. Sameer Lohani, (for Rolling Stock) Executive Director (Carriage), RDSO, Indian Railways
	Sh. D. K. Sinha, (for signalling) Director, Operations, Kochi Metro Rail
	Sh. Jitendra Tyagi, (for Civil Engineering) MD, Dehradun Metro, Uttrakhand
	Sh. Vipul Kumar, (Track & Civil Structure) Executive Director, Track Modernisation, Railway Board
	Sh. Prashanth Rao (Automatic Fare Collection System) Director Systems, Ahmedabad Metro
	Sh. Anoop Gupta (Traction, Power Supply, Ventilation) Director, Electrical, DMRC
	Sh. Mukund Kumar Sinha, (Member Secretary) OSD (UT) and Ex Officio Joint Secretary, MoHUA


 

8.       The committee is expected to submit its report in 3 months. After 3 months, based on specific task of standardization, Dr. Sreedharan could co-opt the relevant expert members for the task for a specified period of time.

                Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) conducted its 35th Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (CSMC) meeting of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) – Urban on 25.06.2018 where a total of 3,18,900 houses from 6 States/UTs were approved.  With this, the PMAY (U) has approved more than 51 Lakhs dwelling units against the estimated demand of 1 crore. As the scheme is   completing its 3rd year of implementation today, a significant milestone of more than 51 lakh houses approved has been achieved. This is a huge jump in comparison to old housing scheme where 12.4 Lakh houses were approved in around 9 years of its implementation. Such unprecedented performance is due to innovative architecture of the scheme where flexibility has been given to the States/UTs to approve the projects.  Further, rather than a rigid approach, beneficiaries are free to choose from 4 verticals of the Mission as per their preference. The State of Maharashtra has taken a big stride in achieving its target of providing houses to slum dwellers by getting 2.48 lakh houses approved in 35th CSMC, held today. 

 

The total project cost approved under PMAY (U) stands at Rs. 2.81 lakh crore with a Central Assistance of Rs. 77,934 crore. A total of 7.60 lakh houses are already completed and another 28 lakh have been grounded. Massive expansion of housing finance through CLSS is taking place. As on today, more than 2 lakh beneficiaries have been given subsidy under the CLSS vertical of the mission which is substantially higher than 18,166 beneficiaries who benefited from earlier comparable Interest Subsidy Schemes (ISHUP/RRY) – 2008 to 2013. Carpet area expansion upto 200 sq. m. under MIG component of the CLSS is being welcomed by all stakeholders. 

 

In terms of coverage, the Mission is a paradigm shift in the history of housing schemes being implemented in the past. The Government of India is committed to provide “Housing for All” by the end of the Mission period-2022. A National Urban Housing Fund for Rs. 60,000 crores has been set up for raising Extra Budgetary Resources (EBR) in phases, for the rapid implementation of PMAY (U). Keeping the ethos of cooperative federalism, the States/UTs are implementing the scheme with considerable zeal and initiatives.  The States of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh are among the best performing States. The Hon’ble Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi had earlier this month had one-to-one interactions with the beneficiaries of PMAY. This has been a huge morale boost to beneficiaries and other stakeholders.  

 

Use of innovative and fast-track construction technology has been adopted in a big way under the scheme. More than 7 lakh houses are being constructed in different States using new technologies. The progress of the houses on the ground has been monitored through geo-tagging using space technology.  The Ministry has further rolled out eight models of Public-Private Partnerships for Affordable Housing that has ushered in a revolution in Affordable Housing sector in India.

 

The investment in the housing sector has a spiral and cascading effect on other sectors of the economy as well, thereby boosting the GDP of the country. The increased activity in the housing sector, increases the demand of not only construction material such as bricks, cement, sand and steel but also the allied sectors. 

 

In addition, the impetus in housing sector, also results in huge direct employment creation, as large number of jobs, both skilled and unskilled, are also created potentially.

Swachh Survekshan 2018 – Details  

During Swachh Survekshan 2018, a record number of 37.66 lakh citizen feedbacks were collected and 53.58 lakh Swachhata Apps downloaded.  The total number of interactions on Swachhata App by citizens were around 1.18 crore.  In 2016, Swachh Survekshan was conducted in 73 cities having a population of one million or more and capital city of States/ UTs and Mysore had bagged the award of being the cleanest city of India.  In 2017, the scope of Swachh Survekshan was enlarged to cover 434 cities having a population of one lakh or more and Capital city of states/ UTs and Indore was awarded as cleanest city of India. 

The on-field survey for Swachh Survekshan has been conducted by an independent agency and the data for ranking of the cities collected from 3 sources: 


	Service Level Progress:  To verify whether systems and processes are in place in Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to implement Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) in the most efficient way. 
	Direct Observation: To verify and assess general cleanliness in the cities by making random field visits in different parts of the city and public conveniences (Community/Public Toilets).
	Citizens Feedback:  To collect feedback directly from citizens and monitor the performance of Swachhata App, a citizens grievance Mobile App.  


The overall and component wise weightage for Swachh Survekshan-2018 had a shift from Swachh Survekshan-2017 weightages. The weightages are produced below:



Under ‘Service Level Progress’, Swachh Surveksan-2018 introduced one more component ‘Innovation and Best Practices’ in addition to existing five components shown below:



Citizens played a key role in the survey.  Higher weightage was given on citizen feedback alongwith direct observation by assessors on the performance parameters of Swachhta by their local bodies. The focus of Swachh Survekshan 2018 was on the outcome, innovation and sustainability of initiatives taken by Urban Local Bodies under Swachh Bharat Mission. The highlights of Swachh Survekshan-2018 are as below –

Cities having population of one lakh and more and capital cities were ranked at National Level and cities with population of less than one lakh were ranked at Zonal Level – North, south, East, West and North East. Based on the performance in Swacch Survekshan, 2018, it has been decided to confer awards 29 cities/ cantonment boards at National Level, 20 cities at Zonal Level and 3 states having the best performance in the urban areas. While deciding the awards, it has been kept in mind that one city gets only one award i.e the category in which it has performed the best. In case a city has already been awarded in some category, next best is awarded in the other category.

                The redevelopment of the seven colonies viz. Nauroji Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Sarojini Nagar, Mohammadpur, Sriniwaspuri, Kasturba Nagar and Thyagaraj Nagar     will lead to an increase the green area coverage by about 3 times from the existing green space area and the compensatory plantation of trees will be done in the ratio of 1:10 thereby resulting in enhanced tree coverage area. The re-development of the seven colonies is been done with complete adherence to environmental sustainability and green building concepts and special care and attention is being given towards retaining maximum number of existing trees and incorporating them in large cluster as an integral part of landscaping design scheme. 

 

There have been misleading press reports in the media regarding felling of trees in the context of redevelopment of the above mentioned government colonies which are not only factually incorrect but also ignore the magnitude of compensatory efforts undertaken to not only increase the tree count but also efforts made for substantial increase in the green space area in the redeveloped colonies. 

 

 As regards to felling of trees, the following facts are highlighted:


	With the design of multi-storied residential/commercial blocks, the effective ground coverage has drastically reduced; enabling more space for the green area. Green area of 10,69,235 Sqm is being proposed in the conceptual plan of all the seven colonies against the existing Green Space of 3,83,101 Sqm.  in these colonies.   Thus about 3 times more green space shall be available. — Refer Annexure-I


 


	All the trees are not being cut.   Only 14,031 nos. trees are to be cut out of the existing trees of 21,040 nos.   Moreover, against the 21,040 nos. of existing trees; 23,475 nos. of trees shall be available in these colonies during/after the Re-development (saving of 6,834 nos., transplantation of 1,213 nos. and new plantation of 15,428 nos.). — Refer Annexure-II.


 


	Besides the above, compensatory plantation of trees is being carried out in a ratio of 1:10, i.e. ten trees are being planted against the loss of one tree.   Thus 1,35,460 (one lakh thirty-five thousand four hundred sixty) trees shall be planted which will create an ""Urban Forest"" thus generating oxygen and reducing the pollution level in the city. - Refer Annexure-II.


Apart from the special efforts for protection, preservation and replantation of  trees as given above, the upcoming complexes are being developed according to “Green Building Concepts”, zero waste discharge and environmental sustainability by the following measures:


	Ground coverage restricted to 15-20% against the existing ground coverage of 50%.  The green area will be 50%.
	Plantations/transplantation as green barrier along boundary to cover main roads.
	Orientation of houses as per sun path to avoid heat gain in the building and green terraces to mitigate heat gain.
	Solar panels used for renewable energy. The total solar power generation in the 7 GPRAs will be 5,654 KW.
	Solid waste/Waste water will be collected, segregated and treated in-house and reused for horticulture purposes and flushing. Solid waste will also be used as manure for horticulture.  
	Rainwater harvesting system for recharging the ground water.
	Use of recycled material from construction and demolition waste to be used in construction of structures such as kerb stone, footpath tiles, etc.


 

The upcoming complexes are being developed by providing green spaces, with lush green trees around the constructed building.   An example of the same is the development of New Moti Bagh Complex and East Kidwai Nagar Project.

 

 Ministry's endeavour has been to provide exemplary models of development for the future generations. Change is inevitable and so is the need of the hour for the city. With utmost care and respect towards our natural environment, all measures are being taken in the planning and designing of these colonies to construct a Green Project with ""Griha Certification"". As such green cover and sustainability of environment is adequate and appropriately ensured after the redevelopment of Seven Colonies.

CLSS – MIG Scheme Details post this Revision:

**with effect from 01.01.2017 i.e from the date when the scheme became operational.

 

BENEFITS    


	The decision is another big step to boost the construction sector that contributes to increased activity on the supply side. This initiative is expected to result in enhanced economic activity that would contribute to improvement in the demand side.
	These enhancements will now enable more MIG customers to qualify for subsidy and avail the benefits provided under the ambitious flagship Mission of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban). 
	Apart from increasing the number of beneficiaries, the increase in carpet area will improve the construction activity and will assist in moving the housing sector forward. 
	This also augurs well with the Reserve Bank of India policy to revise the housing loan limits for Priority Sector lending (PSL) eligibility where it has been decided to revise the housing loan limits for PSL eligibility from existing ₹28 lakh to ₹35 lakh in metropolitan centres (with population of ten lakh and above), and from existing ₹20 lakh to ₹25 lakh in other centres, provided the overall cost of the dwelling unit in the metropolitan centre and at other centres does not exceed ₹45 lakh and ₹30 lakh, respectively. 
	The increased construction activity in housing sector has a cascading effect on core sectors like cement, steel, machinery and other allied sectors. More construction activity in the urban areas would result in creation of more jobs for both skilled and unskilled workers. 
	Overall this will be a big boost to the economy. 


            Pursuant to the address to the Nation on 31.12.2016 by Hon’ble Prime Minister, the scope of the CLSS had been expanded to MIG category with the approval of the Cabinet on 01.02.2017. The scheme approved, initially, for implementation for the year 2017 has been extended up to 31.03.2019. The CLSS for MIG scheme has gained momentum in the last couple of quarters and the offtake has picked up significantly. As on 11.06.2018, an amount of Rs.736.79 crore has been disbursed to 35,204 beneficiaries belonging to the MIG category.

            The MIG segment is an aspirational class which is upwardly mobile. The role of the hardworking citizens belonging to the MIG segment who play a significant role in the economy of the country has been acknowledged by the government time and again. The intent of the CLSS for MIG is to support the dream of every family in owning a house. 

            The decision to increase the carpet area for MIG section was done after inputs from various stakeholders. One of key issues was denial of CLSS benefit to potential beneficiaries, because they were buying flats/houses, constructing houses, where the carpet area exceeded the cap of either 120 square metre or 150 square metre, thus rendering them ineligible for the interest subsidy under MIG. 

            During workshops and review meetings by the Central Nodal Agencies (CNAs) - Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) and National Housing Bank (NHB) - with the PLIs, there had been requests for increasing the carpet areas specified for the MIG I and MIG II categories.

                Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State(I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs has stated that Smart City Center project is a unique component of the Smart City Mission which is helping in improved and efficient delivery of public services. He was speaking while chairing the Consultative Committee meeting attached to the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs held at Surat on 8th June, 2018.  Shri K.R.P. Prabhakaran, MP-LS, Shri RaghavLakhanpal, MP-LS, Shri Rattan Lal Kataria, MP-LS, Shri Santokh Singh Chaudhary, MP-LS, Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary and senior officers of the M/o HUA attended the meeting.         

 During the meeting presentations were made by the CEO/representatives of Smart cities from Surat, Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Pune, Visakhapatnam, NDMC & Bhubaneshwar.The presentations showcased the progress made by projects in various sectors like Smart class rooms (Visakhapatnam& NDMC), Social Equity Centre(Bhubaneshwar), Mayor’s Express(Bhopal), Disaster resilience mechanism adopted in smart cities located in coastal areas etc. The members of Consultative Committee were also shown some of the projects in Surat Smart City like Bamroli Tertiary Treatment Plan, Althan Water Treatment Plant, Visible Improvement of area-Smart Road, Affordable Housing projects, Vertical Garden, BRTS (Gujarat Gas Circle), Surat Fort and SMAC Centre.   

Currently nine Integrated Control and Command Centre at Ahmedabad, Kakinada, Visakhapatnam, Nagpur, Pune, Rajkot, Surat, Vadodara and Bhopal have become operational. Sh. Puri said that it has been observed that the cities are becoming cleaner due to monitoring of cleaning work through CCTV cameras leading to reduction in instances of thrown garbage, littering, urination in public and nighttime burning of garbage while increase in traffic challans issuance indicates an orientation for better traffic discipline. He further informed that Intelligent Transit Management System has helped Ahmedabad to improve its operational efficiency by reducing its operational cost while improving the service levels. He further said that Smart City Centers are also providing technological support in ensuring better safety of women on our streets, environment sensitivity of people, faster response and better preparedness for emergencies and disasters.

During the course of the meeting, the Minister further informed that around 1350 projects worth Rs.50,000 crore have been tendered in the Smart City Mission, of which work has begun or has been completed in 950 projects costing Rs 30,675 crore. Another 400 projects costing about Rs.20,000 crore are at tendering stage.  Other projects being implemented in the mission are Smart Roads which optimize the utilization of space and are adding universal accessibility in 31 cities.   47 cities are implementing more than 120 MW of solar projects promoting cleaner energy. Development of public spaces like riverfront, water fronts, rejuvenation of city lakes and ponds are a priority of the mission, he said.One innovative feature of the mission, is that our municipal bodies need to leverage their financial resources by municipal bonds, value capture finance, PPP, multi-lateral loans etc. It is noteworthy that 98 projects costing Rs. 6,000 crore are under implementation with Public Private Partnership (PPP). PPP projects are getting good responses not only in the big cities but even in the smaller towns.

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has also started a campaign to do the credit rating of cities, which has been completed in 412 cities. He informed that 155 cities have ""investment grade"".

                Minister of State (I/C) for Information & Broadcasting and Sports & Youth Affairs, Col Rajyavardhan Rathore inaugurated the European Union Film Festival here today. Shri Amit Khare, Secretary Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India; Mr. Raimund Magis, Deputy head of Delegation of the European Union to India; Ms. Katarina Tomkova, Deputy Head of Mission, Embassy of the Slovak Republic; Producer of the opening  Slovakian film Little Harbour Ms. Katarina Krnacova, Additional Director General, Directorate of Film Festival Shri Chaitanya Prasad and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. The opening ceremony was followed by the screening of Slovakian movie “Little Harbour”.

Speaking on the occasion, Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore said that the charm in watching the film is in seeing the story as well as meeting people and that is the essence of film festival. Though people across the border vary by skin color, culture they are one people. He also said that  watching films breaks these barriers and story gets communicated to people of any country. He said that even if language of the film is not understood the emotion in the film is understood through the body language. 

Background:

The European Union Film Festival 2018 brings to the city a selection of some of the finest and most riveting films coming out of Europe today. With a selection of 24 latest European films from 23 EU Member States, this years' film festival brings some unusual stories for the world cinema enthusiasts. The European Union Film Festival is organized by Directorate of Film Festivals, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India partnering with the Delegation of the European Union and embassies of EU Member States in various city film clubs.

The festival will traverse through 11 cities in India including New Delhi, Chennai, Port Blair, Pune, Puducherry, Kolkata, Jaipur, Visakhapatnam, Thrissur, Hyderabad and Goa from 18th June till 31st August. Celebrating diversity, the EUFF will screen movies from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. 

As a special attraction this year, audience, students and filmmakers will get an opportunity to interact with Katarína Krnáčová (Slovakian producer), Paula Ortiz (Spanish Director), Salvatore Alloca (Italian Director), Yannis Korris (Greek Director), Douglas Boswell (Belgium Director) and Ádám Fekete (Hungarian Actor) who are travelling to India for the festival. Indian actress Neena Kulkarni who has worked in the Luxembourg movie being screened at the film festival will be attending the festival in Goa. 

23rd European Film Festival has some unusual stories to tell: the lines of reality are blurred when the cyber world comes to life; a play done by a motley cast of antiheroes provides an opportunity for redemption; a man stuck in an unhappy marriage practices unusual ways to assert his freedom; a music critic finds his father irksome when they both begin to compete for the attention of an attractive psychotherapist; and three Kurdish siblings come together unexpectedly in a hair-raising journey during which they are pursued by angry relatives. These are just some of the curious themes of the European Union Film Festival of 2018. 

Paula Ortiz (Spanish Director), Salvatore Alloca (Italian Director) will be present during their respective movie screenings.  

The award winning film Little Harbour is inspired by true events about two children whose innocent play changes their lives forever. It's a story of children who feel safer in the streets than at home, about children seeking out sturdy lifeboats that cross between the world of fantasy and the harsh reality of life. The ten year old Jarka lives with her mother, who is not yet ready to be a Mum. She spends most of her time alone. Pushed by her desire for love and to form a fully functional family, she finds herself substituting as a mother to two babies. 

Film will be with English subtitles. Entry will be allowed for 18+ and will be on a first come, first served basis.

The films to be screened at the EUFF are - The Magic of Children (Austria); Labyrinthus (Belgium);  Viktoria (Bulgaria); Cowboys (Croatia); Boy on the Bridge (Cyprus); Tiger Theory / Teorie Tygra (Czech Republic); Walk with me / De Standhaftige  (Denmark);  Land of Mine / Under Sandet (Denmark);  The Man Who Looks Like Me / Minu Näoga Onu (Estonia); Unexpected Journey (Finland); 9 Month Stretch / 9 Mois Ferme (France); House without Roof / Haus ohne Dach (Germany); Kissing? / Ontos Filiounte?

About the European Union (EU): 

The EU, which consists of 28 countries, has the world's largest economy and its third largest population, after China and India. Though richly diverse, the countries that make up the EU (its 'Member States') are all committed to the same basic values: peace, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. They have set up common institutions so that decisions on matters of joint interest can be made democratically at European level. By creating a frontier-free single market and a single currency (the euro) which has been adopted by 19 Member States, the EU has given a significant boost to trade and employment. It is also at the forefront of policies on sustainability.

                Government has taken measures in recent past to bring in more transparency in data releases. It would like to present a proper perspective on these issues so that the end users and public at large become aware of the processes involved in generation of these estimates.  

Labour Bureau conducts two major surveys on employment scenario i.e Annual Employment-Unemployment Survey (EUS) and Quarterly Employment Survey. So far, five Annual Employment-Unemployment Surveys have been conducted by Labour Bureau and reports on all five surveys have been released. The field work of Sixth Annual Employment Unemployment Survey (2016-17) has been completed and data entry validation work is in progress. The report pertaining to 6th Annual EUS is to be completed by September, 2018.     

On the recommendations of Task Force on Employment, chaired by Dr. Arvind Panagariya, the then Vice-Chairman of NITI Aayog the Annual Employment Unemployment Survey has been replaced by Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) being conducted by Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI). The Periodic Labour Force Survey would not only have annual data on employment-unemployment on rural sector but will also have quarterly data on employment-unemployment on urban sector based on larger sample size. Therefore, the corresponding AEUS data set would be comparable. 

The Quarterly Employment survey (New Series) is an enterprise based survey, carried out with an objective to measure relative change in employment situation over successive quarters for the establishments having 10 or more workers. The QES has several limitations and `some of the important ones include i.e (i) enterprise data of the 6th Economic Census (January, 2013 - April, 2014), therefore, does not include the new units which have been added after April 2014 and (ii) takes into account the enterprise having more than 10 workers and does not cover employment in establishments having less than 10 workers. As a result, the QES effectively, captures the employment size of about 2.40 crore workers only as against the total workforce of about 47 crore.

Therefore, the Government has constituted a Technical Committee under the Chairmanship of former Chief Statistician Prof. T.C.A Anant to look into the above aspects and submit its report at the earliest. 

The Employees Provident fund Organization (EPFO), a statutory organization under Ministry of Labour & Employment has commenced releasing of payroll data on monthly basis.  Under Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana, 46.36 lakh new employees covering 58,400 establishments have been enrolled under PMRPY and an amount of Rs. 855 crore has been spent.

                The Union Government has allowed 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the mining sector and exploration of metal and non-metal ores under the automatic route, which will propel growth of this sector. Addressing the 7th India Minerals and Metals Forum in New Delhi today Joint Secretary Ministry of Mines, Mr Anil Kumar Nayak said Power and cement industries are also aiding growth in the metals and mining sector. Demand for iron and steel is set to grow, given the strong growth expectations for the residential and commercial building industry.           

     

He said exploration of the deep seated minerals needs to be focused. Lot of work needs to be done and private sector must play role in exploration too. He also said that there is large number of small players in the mining business. Now the time has come for the consolidation, either through consortium of miners.In our country there is lot of low grade minerals. For example, bauxite reserve in Orissa, however there is huge reserve of low grade bauxite in Maharshtra and Gujarat also, he said. He emphasized the importance for utilizing the low grade ore. 

     

 He said India is deficient in lithium and cobalt. These two minerals are required for electric vehicle which is one of the major missions of Government of India. The government has initiated a proposal where NALCO, Hindustan Copper and MECL will form a joint venture to acquire lithium and cobalt mines abroad. 

        

This event was attended by Mr. Santosh Sharma, CMD, Hindustan Copper Ltd, Mr. Anjani K Agrawal, National Leader Mining and Metal Sector, Ernst &Young has prepared a Knowledge Document which highlights the overview of the Volatility in metal sector.

                The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy recently invited Expressions of Interest (EoI) for the first 1 GW offshore wind project in India, which has evoked keen response from the industry both global and Indian. Now to give confidence to the wind industry, the Ministry has declared medium and long term target for off-shore wind power capacity additions, which are 5 GW by 2022 and 30 GW by 2030. While this may look moderate in comparison to India’s on-shore wind target of 60 GW and its achievement of 34 GW and solar target of 100 GW by 2022, this would still be challenging considering the difficulties in installing large wind power turbines in open seas. It may be mentioned that offshore wind turbines are of much larger dimensions and capacities than onshore turbines.

Offshore wind power would add a new element to the already existing basket of renewable energy for the country.

The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy had notified National Off-Shore Wind Policy in October 2015 to realize the offshore wind power potential in the country.  Preliminary studies have indicated good wind potential for off-shore wind power both in southern tip of Indian peninsula and west coast.  Two regions where preliminary studies are conducted are off coast of Gujarat and that of Tamil Nadu.  For precise wind quality measurements one LiDAR has been installed near Gujarat coast which is generating data about quality of off-shore wind since November, 2017.  Encouraged by quality of off-shore wind, a private sector player has also installed LiDAR in Gulf of Kutch in Gujarat for offshore wind resource measurements. Plans are afoot to install more of such equipment in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Surveys to understand the oceanographic and sea bed condition within identified zones off the coast of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have been planned.  Globally there has been installation of about 17 to 18 GW of off-shore wind power led by countries such as UK, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands & China.  Recent years have witnessed fall in off-shore wind tariff in some of these markets.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for implementation of Phase-Ill of Off-grid and Decentralised Solar PV (Photo Voltaic) Application Programme to achieve additional 118 MWp(Mega Watt peak) off-grid solar PV capacity by 2020.

Phase-Ill of Off-grid and Decentralised Solar PV Application Programme covers following components:

i)   Solar Street Lights: 3,00,000 numbers of solar street lights will be installed throughout the country with special emphasis on areas where there is no facility for street lighting systems through grid power, North Eastern States and Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts.

ii) Stand-alone Solar Power Plants: Solar power plants of individual size up to 25 kWp(kilo Watt peak) will be promoted in areas where grid power has not reached or is not reliable. This component is mainly aimed at providing electricity to schools, hostels, panchayats, police stations and other public service institutions. The aggregated capacity of solar power plants would be 100 MWp.

iii) Solar Study Lamps: 25,00,000 numbers of solar study lamps will be provided in North Eastern States and LWE affected districts.

For solar street lights and solar power plants, financial support up to 30% of the benchmark cost of the system will be provided except for NE States, Hill States and Island UTs where up to 90% of the benchmark cost will be provided. For solar study lamps only 15% of the lamp cost to be borne by beneficiary student and balance will be provided as financial support as such systems will be provided to school going children in backward and remote areas. 

The total project of the three components included under the phase-Ill is Rs. 1895 crore of which Rs. 637 crore will be provided as central financial assistance.

The off-grid solar systems will also open better livelihood opportunities for beneficiaries in rural and remote areas thereby increasing self-employment in such areas. It is estimated that, besides increasing self-employment, the implementation of Phase-Ill is likely to generate employment opportunity equivalent to 8.67 lakh man-days for skilled and unskilled workers.

Off-grid and Decentralized Solar PV Applications Programme has high impact in the rural and remote areas of the country where grid power has either not reached or is not reliable. During the Phase-Ill, the programme is likely to benefit 40 lakh rural households. In addition, the off-grid solar power plants proposed in the programme to provide electricity to schools, hostels, panchayats, police stations and other public service institutions will help communities at large and also help in increasing participation of women in education, social and livelihood activities.

	Last 4 years have been path-breaking in India’s renewable energy landscape. 


 


	Renewable power installed capacity has already reached over 70 GW. Over 40 GW renewable power capacity is under construction/tendered. 


 


	Globally, India stands 4th in wind power 5th in renewable power and 6th in solar power installed capacity.


 


	Solar energy capacity increased by over 8 times from 2.63 GW in 2014 to 22 GW.


 


	Wind energy capacity increased by 1.6 times from 21 GW in 2014 to 34 GW.


 


	Trajectories for bidding 115GW renewable power projects upto March 2020 have been announced.


 


	We are well on track to achieving 175 GW target of installed renewable energy capacity. 


 


	Trends suggest that the target will not only be achieved but exceeded.


 


	New schemes at advanced stages of being launched:


 


	KUSUM (KisanUrja Suraksha evamUtthaanMahabhiyan)Scheme:

	
		27.5 lakh solar pumps (17.50 lakh standalone + 10 Lakh Grid-connected)
		10 GW of Solar Power Plants of intermediate capacity of 0.5–2 MW
		50,000 Grid-connected tube-wells/lift irrigation and drinking water projects 
	
	


 


	SRISTI (Sustainable Rooftop Implementation for Solar Transfiguration of India) – new scheme for solar rooftop being formulated.


 


	Round the Clock renewables policy has been finalized.


 


	For realising 175 GW target a number of policy measures have been taken.


 


	Transparency is an overarching guidelines principle of our government. Transparent bidding and facilitation for procurement of solar and wind power through tariff based competitive bidding process have led to significant reduction in cost of solar and wind power. In the year 2017 competitive bidding guidelines for procurement of solar and wind power have been notified. The lowest tariff of Rs. 2.44 per unit for solar and Rs. 2.43 per unit for wind discovered. The first solar plant bid at Rs. 2.44 will be inaugurated in August 2018.


 


	We have waived the Inter State Transmission System charges and losses for inter-state sale of solar and wind power for projects to be commissioned by March 2022. This will encourage setting up of the projects in states that have greater resource potential and availability of suitable land. It also helps in creating a pan-India renewable power market, as generation in excess of the state’s own requirement could be transmitted to the resource poor states without additional financial burden;


 


	In our efforts to send right signal about government of India’s commitment towards renewables we have notified Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) trajectory upto the year 2019. We are in a process to notify RPO trajectory upto the year 2022;


 


	For mainstreaming renewables, we have introduced Renewable Generation Obligation (RGO). This provision will encourage coal based thermal power generators to diversify in renewable energy portfolio;


 


	For optimizing land use and harnessing solar and wind energy potential optimally, we have notified Solar-Wind hybrid policy. This policy will help in better harnessing of renewable energyresources and to an extant also addressrenewableenergy variability, The Ministry has also brought out one tender for setting up 2000 MW solar-wind hybrid in existing projects;


 


	Target for Solar Parks has been enhanced from 20 GW to 40 GW. 41 Solar Parks in 21 States with aggregate capacity of over 26 GW have already been sanctioned. Largest Solar Park of 2 GW capacity in Pavagada, Karnataka is under implementation. New Solar Park policy has been announced to encourage participation by private parties and CPSUs in setting up Solar Parks. 


 


	Off-shore from Tamil Nadu and Gujarat coast provides among the best locations from wind power generation.In order to harness this potential we have formulated offshore wind power policy and expression of interest for initial 1GW off-shore wind power have already been issued;


 


	Creating an ecosystem for domestic manufacturing of solarcells is our priority. We have issued expression of interest for setting up solar PV manufacturing capacities linked with assured off take of 20GW. This stimulus is expected to kick start domestic manufacturing in solar energy space;


 


	The Green Energy Corridor projects seek creation of grid infrastructure for renewable power evacuation and to reshape grid for future requirements.The intra state transmission scheme (InSTS) being implemented by eight renewable rich States with an investment of Rs. 10,141 crores will set up about 9400 ckm transmission lines and Substations of total capacity of approx. 19000 MVA to be completedMarch 2020.


 


	Over US$ 42 billion investment was made in renewable energy in India during last 4 years. New opportunities have emerged- altogether new business space has been created. Indian companies have begun to explore foreign stock exchanges as a source of funds. India is progressively becoming a most favored destination for investment in renewables.


 

Foreign investors can enter into joint venture with an Indian partner for financial and/or technical collaboration and for setting up of renewable energy-based power generation projects. 100% foreign investment as equity qualifies for automatic approval. Government of India is also encouraging foreign Investors to set up renewable energy-based power generation projects on build-own-operate basis.

 


	  Renewable energy projects set up in last 4 years have created around 10 million man day’s employment per annum. The Suryamitra program was launched for creation of a qualified technical workforce in 2015 and over 18,631 Suryamitras have been trained under the programme up to 31 March 2018. 


 


	For quality assurance we have notified standards for deployment of solar photovoltaic systems/devices; and


 

11. On 6 December 2017, the International Solar Alliance (ISA) has become first international intergovernmental organization headquartered in India. ISA is part Shri Narendra Modi, Hon’ble Prime Minister of India’s vision to provide clean and affordable energy to all.

                Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs, Statistics and Programme Implementation, Shri Vijay Goel called on former Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh here today, as part of an effort by the Government to seek cooperation of all political parties in running the Parliament smoothly during the ensuing Monsoon session 2018. 

 

Shri Vijay Goel said that the Government is ready to discuss any issue on the floor of the House and urged all political parties to extend their support for smooth running of the House.The Minister will also be meeting a number of leaders from opposition parties as a part of this effort in the days to come.

 

In conversation with Dr. Singh, Shri Goel noted that 68 bills are pending in the Lok Sabha and 40 in the Rajya Sabha, thus making it imperative for all political parties to cooperate in passing these important Bills in the interest of the Nation during 18-days Monsoon Session from 18thJuly till 10th August.

 

Dr. Singh welcomed the initiative of the government in reaching out to various opposition leaders and Members for running the House and noted thatit is the responsibility of both the ruling and opposition parties to let both the Houses work smoothly.

 

Shri Goel said the last Budget session was a complete wash-out. The productivity of Rajya Sabha was only 8% and in Lok Sabha the productivity was only 4%.For this upcoming session, accusations and counter-accusations need to give way to cooperation in letting the Parliament function constructively. 

 

The Minister further added that important pending Bills such as the Muslim Marriage (Protection of Marriage Rights) Bill, 2017, the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2017, the Constitution (123rd Amendment) Bill, 2017 and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2013 need to be passed during the Session for the larger interest of the Nation. Shri Vijay Goel also expressed hope that the election of a new Deputy Chairman of  Rajya Sabha will be held in the House with consensus.

                Instances have occurred wherein an Appellant/Complainant dies before his case is considered by the Central Information Commission (CIC). Further action to be taken in such a situation has engaged the attention of the Commission. 

The Commission carefully considered this matter in its meeting held on June 5, 2018 and decided that in case of death of the Appellant/Complainant, the case will be heard as usual as Second Appeal/Complaint and the decision put up on the website of the Commission. Orders have accordingly been issued on June 18, 2018 and also put on the website of the Commission.

                The 32nd lecture of the “Lecture Series” organized by the Central Vigilance Commission was delivered by Shri Surjit S. Bhalla, Member, Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council here today on the topic “Employment and Poverty Reduction in India ”.

In his lecture, Shri Bhalla dealt with several economic issues of contemporary relevance. The first issue was the computation of employment and unemployment in the Indian economy, and how this is linked to perceptions of economic growth. He further spoke in detail on poverty as an economic concept and how this has been calculated worldwide. He outlined the development of India’s poverty line and shared his belief that a government should work for the poorest quarter of the population, as against the present system of calculation of the national poverty line and debates on what percentage of the population fell below this line. He opined that the methodology to measure poverty should be consistent for an economy over a period of time, as this would enable more accurate assessments of the development and growth outcomes for the Indian economy in the long term.  The concept of higher economic growth rate being associated with rising inequality, the phenomenon of jobless growth and the skewed growth distribution in economies were some other areas covered in his lecture where he sought to dispel some popular misconceptions in the public mind. The lecture was followed by a lively question and answer session. 

Full time and part time CVOs based in Delhi/NCR attended the lecture along with CMDs, Board of Directors and other officers of the vigilance administration. The lecture may be viewed online as it was webcast live through NIC and the web page link is available on www.cvc.nic.in.

                The Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh felicitated the students from Jammu and Kashmir (supported by ‘Kashmir Super 30’ Project) who have qualified for the JEE (Main & Advance), 2017-18, at a function organised here today. 

These students belong to the ‘Kashmir Super 30’ initiative of Indian Army, training partner Petronet LNG Limited (PLL) and Centre for Social Responsibility and Leadership (CSRL). The project aims to support the talented underprivileged students of the economically weaker sections of the State to achieve educational success by providing engineering entrance exam coaching. Total 50 students were enrolled under the project this year and in the result declared of JEE this year, 32 students have qualified the JEE Mains Exam, 2017-18. Out of these successful students, 7 students have cracked the JEE Advance test and made it to the prestigious IITs. 

 

Dr Jitendra Singh congratulated the students and their mentors for their achievement. While interacting with the Minister, the students shared their experiences about their journey. The students thanked the Indian Army, Petronet LNG Limited (PLL) and Centre for Social Responsibility and Leadership (CSRL), for supporting them in their efforts. 

 

While addressing the students, Dr Jitendra Singh said that these students have set an example before others to follow. He complemented the Indian Army, PLL & CSRL, for their contribution in supporting these students. He appreciated the students for their hard work and focussed approach.  He said that we have one of the best talents in the State. The Minister added that under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, various new schemes have been initiated which are youth-centric like Start-up India, Stand-up India and the youth of country are getting benefitted due to these schemes. 

 

The Minister said that the students of remote and peripheral areas earlier were at disadvantage because of constraint of resources and lack of material available for studying. But now with the changing times and onset of latest technology, the information is easily available to them and there is no dearth of study material. This has helped the students from remote areas to achieve their goal in life, he added. 

 

The Minister also advised the organisers to explore the possibility of expanding their noble initiative in other areas and fields, which will be of great help to the underprivileged sections of society. He also advised them to use latest technology like tele-education for giving lectures to the students studying in remote areas. 


Brigadier A. Sridhar, Commander, 19 Artillery Brigade, Shri Rajesh Singh, Director (Tech), PLL and other officials were also present on the occasion.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh​ inaugurated an event organised on the occasion of World Environment Day 2018, here today. The event is being organised by the Indian Institute and Ecology and Environment and other associates. The theme of this year’s World Environment Day is “Beat Plastic Pollution”.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that celebration of World Environment Day is an opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the cause of protection of environment. There is still a lot that we need to do to protect our environment, he added. 

Speaking about the Swachhata Campaign launched by the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, he said this has now become a mass campaign. He said that special emphasis has been laid on constructing toilets for girl children and within one year, 4 lakh such toilets were built, he added. On completion of 4 years of Central Government, about 7.5 crore toilets have been constructed, the Minister further said.  He said that the Government has taken various other initiatives to spread awareness among the masses to keep their environment clean. The Minister added that the mind set needs to be changed to achieve the target of clean environment. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that this year’s theme: “Beat Plastic Pollution” is very important keeping in mind the use of plastic these days. He said that the citizens need to be educated about the harmful effects of the use of plastic on marine life, human health and environment. The plastic pollution can be beaten only when awareness is generated at a mass level, he said. 

The event is laying emphasis on role of schools, colleges and universities in protecting our nature & environment and beating plastic pollution.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Mechanism for procurement of ethanol by Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to carry out the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme- Revision of ethanol price for supply to Public Sector OMCs.

Now, CCEA has approved  the following for the forthcoming sugar season 2018-19 during ethanol supply period from 1st December 2018 to 30th November 2019:


	To fix the ex-mill price of ethanol derived out of C heavy molasses to Rs.43.70 per litre (from prevailing price of Rs.40.85 per litre). Additionally, GST and transportation charges will also be payable.
	To fix ex-mill price of ethanol derived from B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice at Rs.47.49 per litre.  Additionally, GST and transportation charges will also be payable.
	As the price of ethanol is based on estimated FRP for sugar season 2018-19, it will be modified by MoP&NG as per actual Fair & Remunerative Price (FRP) declared by the Government.
	For ethanol supply year 2019-20, ethanol prices will be modified by MoP&NG as per normative cost of molasses and sugar derived from FRP of sugarcane.


All distilleries will be able to take benefit of the scheme and large number of them are expected to supply ethanol for the EBP programme. Remunerative price to ethanol suppliers will help in reduction of cane farmer's arrears, in the process contributing to minimizing difficulty of sugarcane farmers.

Ethanol availability for EBP Programme is expected to increase significantly due to higher price for C heavy molasses based ethanol and enabling procurement of ethanol from B heavy molasses and sugarcane juice for first time. Increased ethanol blending in petrol has many benefits including reduction in import dependency, support to agricultural sector, more environmental friendly fuel, lesser pollution and additional income to farmers.

Government has  notified administered  price of ethanol since 2014. This

decision has significantly improved the supply of ethanol during the past four years. The ethanol procured by Public Sector OMCs has increased from 38 crore litre in ethanol supply year 2013-14 to estimated 140 crore litre in 2017-18.

The sugarcane and sugar production in this sugar season is very high leading to   dampening   of sugar prices.   Consequently, sugarcane farmers’ dues have increased due to lower capability of sugar industry to pay the farmers. Government has taken many decisions for reduction of farmer's dues.          

As realization from ethanol is also one of the components in revenue of sugar mills/distilleries, Government has decided to review the price of ethanol derived out of C heavy molasses.

Government is also deciding the price of B heavy molasses and Sugarcane juice for the first time which is likely to positively impact the capability of sugar industry to pay farmers dues and increase availability of ethanol for EBP Programme. This is also in line with the National Policy on Biofuels -- 2018 announced by the Government during May, 2018 which has widened the scope of raw material for ethanol production.

Background:

Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme was launched by the Government in 2003 on pilot basis which has been subsequently extended to the Notified 21 States and 4 Union Territories to promote the use of alternative and environmental friendly fuels. This intervention also seeks to reduce import dependency for energy requirements and give boost to agriculture sector.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approvedestablishment of additional 6.5 Million Metric Tonne (MMT) Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) facilities at two locations, i.e. Chandikhol in Odisha and Padur in Karnataka, including construction of dedicated SPMs (Single Point Mooring) for the two SPRs. The SPR facilities at Chandikhol and Padur will be underground rockcaverns and will have capacities of 4 MMT and 2.5 MMT respectively. Government had announced setting up of two additional SPRs during the budgetannouncement for 2017-18.

 

The in principle approval is to take up the project under PPP model to reduce budgetary support of Government of India. The terms and conditions of such participation, would be determined by M/oP&NG in consultation with Ministry of Finance after conducting road shows to elicit requirements of market, including prospective investors.

 

 ISPRL has already constructed underground rock caverns for storage of 5.33MMT of crude oil at three locations, viz. Vishakhapatnam (1.33 MMT), Mangalore (1.5 MMT) and Padur (2.5 MMT). The total 5.33 MMT capacity under Phase-I of the SPR programme is currently estimated to supply approximately 10 days of India’s crude requirement according to the consumption data for FY2016-17. Cabinet’s approval for establishing additional 6.5 MMT Strategic Petroleum Reserve facilities will provide an additional supply of about 12 days and is expected to augment India’s energy security.

 

The construction phase of the SPRs at Chandikhol and Padur is likely to generate significant direct & indirect employment opportunities in the states of Odisha and Karnataka.

                Friends,

 

You just witnessed the signing of an MoU  between Saudi ARAMCO and ADNOC for participating in the greenfield Ratnagiri Refinery cum petrochemical project in Maharashtra. It is an honour for us that the signing took place in the presence of His Highness Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the UAE. 

 

Today’s MoU is in continuation of the MoU entered between Saudi ARAMCO and RRPCL and the three oil marketing companies – IOCL, BPCL and HPCL signed in April on the sidelines of the16th International Energy Forum Ministerial Meeting in the presence of my colleague Minister  and friend H.E. Khalid Al Falih. Today we have been joined by ADNOC as another partner in this mega project. 

 

The investment by Saudi ARAMCO and ADNOC in the $ 44 billion project will be the highest ever overseas investment in the Indian refining sector. The significance, however, goes much beyond FDI. It is a strategic partnership between India, Saudi Arabia and the UAE which is symbolised by the MoU. The strategic partnership brings together crude supply, resources, technologies, experience and expertise of these multiple oil companies with an established commercial presence around the world.

The last four years have seen the three countries coming closer than ever before owing to the commitment and vision shown by our leadership. Prime Minister Modi and the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the UAE have met multiple times to strengthen the political, economic and strategic relations and people to people contacts. 

Saudi Arabia has always been a trusted and reliable suppplier of crude for India and a key element of India’s energy security. I have received this assurance from my colleague minister, H.E. Khalid Al Falih, several times including during our last meeting at Vienna last week on the margins of the OPEC International Seminar. With the UAE too we have investment in India’s strategic reserves programme. The first crude consignment to fill the Mangalore SPR was received last month. Our companies – IOCL, OVL and BPRL have invested in Lower Zakhum offshore oil field in February this year and I am happy that the first crude consignment from this investment also reached Mangalore on June 8. 

Regarding the Ratnagiri Refinery, I wish to inform you that the mega refinery will be capable of processing 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day (60 Million Metric Tonnes Per Annum). It will produce a large range of refined petroleum products, including petrol and diesel meeting BS-VI fuel efficiency norms. The Refinery will also provide feedstock for the integrated petrochemicals complex, which will have the capacity of producing approx. 18 million tonnes per annum of petrochemical products.

We look forward to usering a new era of cooperation between India, Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the oil andgas sector.

                Saudi Aramco and ADNOC signed an MoU today to jointly develop and build an integrated refinery and petrochemicals complex at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra. The project will be implemented by Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. (RRPCL).  

The MoU was signed between Saudi Aramco President and CEO, Amin H. Nasser and H.E.Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of State & ADNOC Group CEO. The signing was witnessed by His Highness Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, UAE Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation,who is on an official visit to India, and Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Government of India. 

Earlier, Saudi Aramco had joined the project by signing an MoU with the Indian consortium on 11th April 2018 on the sidelines of the16 International Energy Forum Ministerial. Saudi Aramco also sought to include another strategic partner to co-invest in the project as an overseas investor.

RRPCL which is promoted by a consortium of India PSUs consisting of IOCL, BPCL and HPCLwill now have Saudi Aramco & ADNOC as overseas strategic partners. The project will be set up as a 50:50 joint partnership (50:50) between the consortium from India and Saudi Aramco and ADNOC. This will be single largest overseas investment in the Indian refining sector.

The strategic partnership brings together crude supply, resources, technologies, experience and expertise of these multiple oil companies with an established commercial presence around the world.

The mega refinery will be capable of processing 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day (60 million metric tonnes per annum). It will produce a range of refined petroleum products, including petrol and diesel meeting BS-VI fuel efficiency norms. The Refinery will also provide feedstock for the integrated petrochemicals complex, which will have the capacity of producing approx. 18 million tonnes per annum of petrochemical products.

RRPCL will rank among the world’s largest refining & petrochemicals projects and will be designed to meet India’s fast-growing fuels and petrochemicals demand. The project cost is estimated at around Rs.3 lakh crore (USD 44 billion). 

Background on Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd.(RRPCL):

 

Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. (RRPCL), a JVC, was formed on 22nd September,2017 between IOCL,BPCL& HPCL with equity participation of 50:25:25 respectively. This is to implement a 60 MMTPA (1.2 MMBD) Integrated Refinery & Petrochemicals Project at Ranagiri, Maharashtra. The expected Petrochemical production is likely to be around 18 MMTPA. The estimated cost of the Project would be around Rs. 3,00,000 crores (around 44 billion dollars). |This would potentially be one of the largest Projects in the world. It is expected that it will contribute to a GDP improvement of around 2% Nationally and about 12% to the state of Maharashtra.

 

A preliminary Feasibility Study has been conducted by Ms. EIL which has also provided the basic technical configuration of the Project. Certain pre-project activities have also been initiated.  A demand supply market study for petrochemicals has also been completed through M/s HIS Markit, a reputed global consultant. A further configuration study through an international consultant is being taken up shortly which will lead to carrying out the Detailed Feasibility Study for the Project culminating into a Final Investment Decision.

Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production

 

                


	
	
		CPSE Refineries’ production during May, 2018 was 12792.67 TMT which is 0.89% higher than the target for the month and 2.73% higher when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-May, 2018 was 24427.92 TMT which is 1.04% higher than the target for the period and 3.42% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:
	
	


 


	IOCL, Paradip: Throughput lower due to RCO pump high vibration issue.
	IOCL, Gujarat: Throughput lower due to HGU interruption.
	IOCL, Haldia: Throughput lower due to DHDS shutdown for catalyst change.
	HPCL, Visakh: Throughput lower due to unplanned CDU shutdown.
	NRL, Numaligarh: Throughput lower due DCU shutdown on account of increase in furnace pressure leading to VR ullage constraint and thereby lesser crude throughput.
	MRPL, Mangalore: Crude cut for the month due to unprecedented heavy rain fall on 29th May, 18 resulted in submerging of drives in Oil Movement & Storage (OM&S) and effluent treatment plants. Submergence of drives in OM&S has affected the crude & secondary units processing rates.   


 

3.2    Production in JV refineries during May, 2018 was 1691.43 TMT which is 11.20% higher than the target for the month and 166.16% higher when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-May, 2018 was 3192.08 TMT which is 9.77% higher than the target for the period but 58.97% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. The major reason for high variation in production was major turnaround underway in HMEL refinery during April - June, 2017.

3.3    Production in private refineries during May, 2018 was 7757.0 TMT which is higher by 1.66% than the target for the month and 0.24% higher when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-May, 2018 was 14473.94 TMT which is 4.13% lower than the target for the period and lower by 4.94% compared to  production during corresponding period of last year.

3.4    Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of May, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-May, 2018 vis-à-vis April-May, 2017 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.

                Topic - SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY FUTURE

 

Fellow panelists, Excellencies and distinguished guests,

It is indeed a pleasure to meet you all here at this OPEC forum. I have earlier attended this forum in 2015.  This year is probably more critical to present a major buying country’s point of view than ever before in the recent past. 

The energy vision of Prime Minister Modi has 4 pillars - Energy Access, Energy Efficiency, Energy Sustainability and Energy Security.  Energy sustainability has to be seen in tandem with the other three pillars for a stable energy future. India has demonstrated very strong commitment to the Paris Agreement and has taken the lead in promoting the International Solar Alliance. In the oil and gas sector we have migrated to Euro IV norms, we have introduced Euro 6 norms in National capital Delhi and now we are preparing to migrate to Euro 6 by April 2020 in whole of India. Promoting biofuels, energy efficiency and moving to a gas based economy are also our priorities.  

Since this forum has Ministers of producing and consuming countries and captains of industry, it is the right forum to discuss sustainable pricing. Oil and Gas are commodities of trade but also of basic necessity. Whether it is the kitchen of a common man or an aircraft, energy is essential. The world has for too long seen prices on a roller coaster and interventions which are detached from market fundamentals. It is high time to move to responsible pricing, one that balances the interests of both the producer and consumer. We also need to move to transparent and flexible markets for both oil and gas. 

We often see global trade practices in the field of oil and gas which are not contributing to Energy Access and Affordability and become a hindrance to sustainability. Price of oil and gas have become subject to vagaries of geo-politics. Political conditions, sometimes internal and sometimes external, result in reduced output of some countries. We expect from OPEC and its members a commitment to step in more than fill the gap to ensure sustainable prices. 

 Globally crude prices have gone beyond the threshold which can be sustained by the world, particularly countries like India which is a key driver of world economy. These prices are creating stress throughout global economy, as it is giving pain to us in India. The global economic outlook already has threats from trade wars, geo political events and threat of instability coming back to the Euro Zone. The already fragile world economic growth will be at threat if oil prices persist at these levels. My fear is – this will lead to energy poverty in many parts of the World. 

While we are not in favour of prices as low as $30 per barrel we also do not support the prevailing high price which dent our fiscal balance and undermine our development process. They also cause undue hardships, particularly to those at the bottom of the pyramid in developing and least developed countries. 

If the world has to grow as a whole, there has to be a mutually supportive relationship between producers and consumers. It is in the interests of producers that other economies keep growing steadily and rapidly so as to ensure growing energy markets for themselves. This is the key to energy sustainability. OPEC as the predominant supplier has the responsibility to maintain supply equilibrium.

I will end by quoting Mahatma Gandhi, Father of our Great Nation who said that earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s need but not every man’s greed.

Thank you friends!

                Dharmendra Pradhan, the Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship today met with the Ambassadors from OPEC countries to India. The timing of the meeting comes at a crucial time when the global crude oil prices are at the highest since the peak of 2014. 

India has a strong engagement with the OPEC countries and top 8 suppliers of crude oil to India are OPEC Member countries. The block accounted for about 83% of India’s total crude oil imports, 98% of our LPG imports and 74% of our LNG imports during the last financial year.

During the meeting Minister Pradhan expressed his concern about rising crude oil prices and its negative impact on consumers across the world, particularly in India. He emphasized that globally crude prices have gone beyond the threshold which can be sustained by the world. He highlighted that market fundamentals do not support such high prices.  He urged the OPEC Ambassadors to convey the message to their respective Governments regarding the need to move to responsible pricing, one that balances the interests of both the producer and consumer. He reiterated the issue of discriminatory pricing through measures such as Asian Premium. Minister urged the move to transparent and flexible markets for both oil and gas.

Minister is scheduled to visit Vienna next week from 20-21 June 2018 to participate in the 7th OPEC International Seminar to further discuss these key issues with Mr Sanusi Barkindo, Secretary General of OPEC and Ministers from OPEC member countries who will also be attending the Seminar.

1.   What is the objective of the BEE (Bureau of Energy Efficiency) for recommending optimum temperature setting of air conditioners?

Answer:Bureau of Energy Efficiency (Ministry of Power) has issued the guidelines to major commercial establishments with the objective of conserving energy through optimum temperature settings for the Air Conditioners, within the comfort zone /chart.It is estimated that changing the temperature from conventional 20-21 degree Celsius can result in approximately at 24 per cent of energy savings.

 

2.         What is the estimated saving potential due to this initiative?

Overall potential for energy conservation through such measures is estimated to the tune of 20 billion units(worth Rs10,000 crores) annually. If about half (50%)the consumers adopt to such recommendations, this would result in about 10 billion units of electricity, which is equivalent to reduction of 8.2 Million tonne of CO2 per year.

 

3.    What does default setting at 24-degreeCelsius mean? Whether the consumers will be able to adjust their ACs to a lower temperature?

Answer:Default setting is the setting at which a machine comes from the factory. Therefore, when the machine is switched on then it will have a preset temperature of 24 degrees Celsius.However, a user can adjust or set the air conditioner at a lower (or higher) temperature, as per her choice.

 

4.         Whyis it beneficial topreset the temperatureof AC equipment at 24-degree Celsius?

Answer: Normal human body temperature is between 36-37 degree Celsius. It is generally observed that in large commercial establishments,e.g.hotels, Airports and offices, the AC operating staff, try to set the lower temperature (around 18-21 degree Celsius), believing that it indicates a better cooling performance of AC system. However, technically this is not true and the cooling action of compressor is same at other settings also. On the other hand, setting the temperature in the range of 18-21 degree Celsius results into a very cool internal ambient conditions, which compels people to wear warm clothing leading to wastage of energy. As per the comfort chart, the temperatures upto 25 deg. C are quite comfortable for human body, along with desired humidity and air movement values.

 

5.         If there are more persons in the room, will it be possible to maintain comfort conditions?

Answer:The same temperature setting would enable AC equipment to provide sufficient cooling, even if there are more persons. The compressor will work slightly longer till such time equilibrium is reached.

 

6.         What are the advantages of setting AC default temperature at 24 degree Celsius?

Answer: It is estimated that by increase in temperature of room by 1 degree Celsius, we can save about 6 per cent of electricity. Typically, room temperature is set between 20-21 degree Celsius whereas, as per standard comfort conditions, ideal temperature is 24-25 degree Celsius. Considering change from 20degree Celsius to 24 degree Celsius, there is potential to increase at least 4 degrees Celsius, which will lead to savings of about 24 per cent of electricity.

 

Therefore, the users will be able to save significant amount of energy (and money) by running their air-conditioners at 24-degree Celsius.

 

7.         Which are the potential buildings/areas that BEE is targeting to implement the guidelines?

Answer: The Guidelines have been recommended to the major commercial establishments such as Airports, Hotels, Shopping Malls, Offices and Government Buildings (Ministries & attached offices, State Government and Public-Sector Undertakings).

 

8.         What do you mean by comfort chart /zone?

Answer: According to (ASHRAE Standard 55-2013 Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy) Thermal comfort zone is the condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment. This condition is defined using temperature, humidity level and air flow experienced by the human body, apart from individual parameters such as clothing, metabolism, etc. We feel thermally comfortable within a particular range of these parameters. Technical analysis indicates that in order to achieve desired comfort level at steady state, the temperature setting can be between 24-25 degree Celsius, at desired levels of humidity and air movement. The chart below suggests that the comfort zone in Indian climatic condition.

 



 

9.         Is the advisory mandatory right now?

 Answer:The advisory for thecommercial establishments has been issued for voluntary adoption. The aim is to increase awareness and encourage consumers to adopt the guidelines.A public survey would be conducted after 4-6 months awareness campaign by the Ministry of Power/ Bureau of Energy Efficiency.

 

10.       Does setting the thermostat at 18 degree Celsius cool the room faster than keeping it at 24 degree Celsius?

 Answer: No. The thermostat[1] just checks the temperature of the air inside the room and stops the compressor when the temperature reaches the desired level. This means that the compressor will work longer if the temperature is set to a lower level, i.e it will work more and use more electricity if temperature is set to 18-degree Celsius than if it is set to 24-degree Celsius. This is because it will take less time for air to reach to 24-degree Celsius than 18 degree Celsius, as the compressor is working with the same power or wattage.

 

11.       Why is this move important for India?

 Answer: Bureau of Energy Efficiency estimates that considering the current market trend, total connected load in India due to air conditioning will be about 200 GW by 2030 and this may further increase as today only 6 per cent of households are using one or more air conditioners. If the measures are followed by all consumers, India can save about 23 billion units of electricity. The total installed capacity of air conditioner is about 80 million TR, which will increase to about 250 million TR in 2030. 

 

12.       Is India the first country to take such a measure?

 Answer:No. Countries like Japan and US[2]have already put in regulations for the functioning of air conditioners. Japan introduced a default setting for air conditioners at 28 degrees Celsius. While in U.S, states like California have enforced limits on lowering the air condition beyond 26 degrees Celsius.

                Shri R.K Singh, Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable launched a campaign to promote energy efficiency in the area of air-conditioning here, today. Speaking on the occasion, he said ""Every one degree increase in the air-conditioner temperature setting results in saving of 6 per cent of electricity consumed.  Normal human body temperature is approximately 36-37 degree Celsius, but large number of commercial establishments, hotels and offices maintain temperature around 18-21 degree Celsius. This is not only uncomfortable but is actually unhealthy. Setting the temperature in the range of 18-21 degree Celsius compels people to wear warm clothing or use blankets; therefore, this is actually wastage of energy.  Some countries like Japan have put in place regulation to keep the temperature at 28 degree Celsius"".

Therefore, under the guidance of Ministry of Power, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has carried out a study and has recommended that the default setting in the air-conditioning should be at 24 degree Celsius. The new campaign will result in substantial energy savings and also reduce greenhouse gas emission.

 

To begin with this will be an advisory to be issued to all establishments and manufacturers.  A meeting with major air-conditioner manufacturers was held today under the Chairmanship of Shri RK Singh, where the manufacturers were advised to keep the default setting of air conditioners at 24 degree Celsius and also to carry out labelling indicating the optimum temperature setting for the benefits of consumers both from financial and their health points of view. These temperatures setting will be in the range of 24-26 degree Celsius.

 

After an awareness campaign of 4-6 months, followed by a survey to gather public feedback, the Ministry of Power would consider making this mandatory.  If all the consumers adopt, this will result in savings of 20 billion units of electricity in one year alone.

  

 All the manufacturers and associations of air-conditioner manufacturers present in the meeting have agreed on this and appreciated it as a step in the right direction.  Accordingly, they have agreed to support this campaign.

 

The Bureau of Energy Efficiency informed that, considering the current market trend, total connected load in India due to air conditioning will be 200 GW by 2030 and this may further increase as today only about 6 per cent of households are using air conditioners.  As per our current estimate total installed air conditioner capacity is 80 million TR (ton of refrigerator) in the country, which will increase to about 250 million TR by 2030.  Considering this huge demand, we can save about 40 million units of electricity usage every day.

 

The targeted commercial buildings will include Airports, Hotels, Shopping Malls, Officers and Government Buildings (Ministries & attached offices, State Government and Public Sector Undertakings).  This initiative is launched on voluntary basis to increase awareness and encourage consumers to adopt the guidelines.

In line with digital initiatives of Hon’ble PM, Indian Railways has for the first time completely digitized the Complaint management system. Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of Railways & Coal today launched a new App “Rail Madad” – An App to expedite &  streamline passenger grievance redressal. RPGRAMS (Railway Passenger Grievance Redressal and Management System),which has been developed by Northern Railway (Delhi Division) and comprises many novel features including ‘Rail Madad’ – a  mobile App  to register complaints by passengers through mobile phone/web.  It relays real time feedback to passengers on the status of redressal of their complaints- the passenger gets an instant ID through SMS on registration of complaint followed by a customized SMS communicating the action taken thereon by Railway. RPGRAMS integrates all the passenger complaints received from multiple modes (14 offline/online modes currently) on a single platform, analyzes them holistically and generates various types of management reports which enable the top management to continuously monitor the pace of grievance redressal as well as evaluate the performance of field units/ trains/ stations on various parameters viz cleanliness, catering, amenities etc. It also identifies weak/deficient areas and laggard trains/stations for undertaking focussed corrective actions. 

Salient features of Rail Madad application are-

❖      Rail MADAD (Mobile Application for Desired Assistance During travel) registers a complaint with minimum inputs from passenger(option of photo also available), issues unique ID instantly and relays the complaint online to relevant field officials for immediate action. The  action taken on complaint is also relayed to passenger through SMS, thus fast tracking the entire process of redressal of complaints through digitisation.

❖      Rail MADAD also displays various helpline numbers (e.g., Security, Child helpline etc) and provides direct calling facility for immediate assistance in one easy step

❖      All modes of  filing complaints including offline and online modes are being integrated on a single platform, therefore the resultant management reports present a holistic picture of weak/deficient areas and  enable focused corrective action by officials concerned.

❖   The data analysis would also generate trends on various performance parameters of a selected train/station like cleanliness, amenities etc thus making managerial decision more precise and effective.

❖ Hierarchy based dashboard/reports will be available for management at Division /Zonal/Railway board level and sent through auto email to every concerned officer weekly

Union Minister for Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal today addressed the media on the four-year achievements of the ministries under his charge. Shri Goyal was joined by Minister of State of Communication (I/c) & Railways, Shri Manoj Sinha and Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain (through Guwahati VC link), and also Shri Ashwani Lohani, Chairman Railway Board on the occasion. Shri Goyal also interacted via video conferencing with media present at 12 cities - Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Chennai, Guwahati, Imphal, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Pune, Patna, Raipur, Ranchi. Shri Piyush Goyal released a booklet highlighting the achievements in the Railways and Coal Ministries in the past four years. Two mobile Applications – the ‘Rail Madad’ and ‘Menu on Rails’ were also launched on the occasion.

 

Shri Goyal reiterated Government’s resolve of Service to the Nation under the visionary leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, whose 150th birth anniversary will be celebrated in 2019.

 

In the past four years, the Government has made safety the top priority of Indian Railways keeping in mind the philosophy of ‘Saaf Niyat, Sahi Vikas’.  Safety has reigned supreme with consequential train accidents reduced to 62% from 118 in 2013-14 to 73 in 2017-18. Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) fund of Rs. 1 Lakh Cr has been allocated for safety expenditure over 5 years. Addressing the issue of unsafe crossings on a war footing, 5,479 Unmanned Level Crossings have been eliminated in the last four years. 1.1 lakh safety posts are also being filled-up through recruitment amongst other measures to improve safety.

 

Laying the foundations of infrastructure for a New India, there has been a quantum leap in capital expenditure, with the average annual capital expenditure in last 4 years being  more than double of average during 2009-14. Railways is connecting India at a faster pace with a 59% increase in the average pace of commissioning new lines from 4.1 km (2009-14) to 6.53 Kms per day (2014-18).

 

Commuter travel in urban India received a boost with major investments earmarked for Bengaluru suburban system (Rs. 17,000 Crore in Budget 2018-19) and Mumbai suburban system (Rs 54,777 crore in Budget 2018-19) for upgradation and better infrastructure. The Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-speed Rail (HSR) will revolutionise the transport sector in India through speed, safety and service. Besides the Make in India benefits from the HSR project, Railways is creating large scale employment and economic development through a host of upcoming projects in Latur, Marathwada; New Bongaigaon, Assam; Lumding, Assam;  Jhansi, Bundelkhand and Sonepat, Haryana. Railways has embarked on transitioning to sustainable rail transport with a six times increase in electrification from 610 RKM during 2013-14 to 4,087 RKM during 2017-18.

 

Railways has achieved significant milestones in moving the country’s economy better with the highest ever freight loading of 1,162 MT in 2017-18 and 1,107 MT in 2016-17. Freight earnings have also shot up with  a 12% increase expected over the previous year, projected to be Rs. 1.17 Lakh Cr in 2017-18. The commissioning of Dedicated Freight Corridors in phases by 2019-20 will further boost the Indian economy.

 

Railways is improving passenger services including a complete makeover of Stations by installing modern facilities including escalators, lifts, free wifi etc. while instilling local art and culture in the design. 68 stations are slated for improvement by March 2019. Government has improved trains and coaches including launching the Tejas, Antyodaya and Humsafar trains. Catering to passengers’ travel and comfort needs, 407 new train services have been launched in last four years with 1.37 lakh services to meet festival demand. Catering has also been a focus area with compulsory printing of MRP on all food items started on more than 300 Trains, and use of artificial intelligence to monitor food production in base kitchens for improving quality and hygiene.

 

Punctuality in the short-term has been impacted due to giving priority to infrastructure and safety works but in the long-term this would enable faster and safer train movement. Time tabling of trains has been improved by reducing running time and allowing planned maintenance blocks. SMS services have been started on 1,373 trains for informing passengers about any delay in trains. 

 

To commemorate the 150th Birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Indian Railways is also contributing its bit. There has been a major focus on cleanliness, Swacchata including third party independent surveys, introduction of Integrated Mechanized cleaning, bio-toilets, Automatic Rail-mounted machine to clear muck etc.

 

Indian Railways has also focused on digital initiatives and transparency and accountability. E- reverse auction policy being introduced, which could help save approximately Rs. 20,000 crore. Simpler approval processes in Research Designs and Standards Organisation reduced process timeline from 30 months to 6 months.

 

Recognising the significance of empowering and upskilling the 13+ lakh railway family, various steps have been taken including delegation of powers. India’s First National Rail & Transportation University in Vadodara is set to open in August 2018. From employee empowerment to new avenues for skilling, Railways is injecting a new drive in the workforce to ensure Railways becomes the lifeline that can power the Indian economy and fulfil the aspirations of 1.3 billion Indians.

                As World Environment Day 2018 celebrations kick off in India, Ministry of Railways PSU IRCTC launched its trial run of environment friendly bagasse based food packaging on 8 select Shatabdis and Rajdhanis originating from New Delhi. Passengers in these trains will be served meals on eco-friendly disposable plates (compostable containers) instead of the polymer ones as part of the Railways’ drive to go green.

 

 

 

IRCTC with this new initiative reaffirms its commitment to a cleaner and greener India and has taken a small step in this direction to achieve the same. Bagasse, the fibrous remains left behind after extracting sugarcane juice, is being used to make disposable cutlery and containers in which meals will be served. Provision will be made to collect the used packaging which will then be processed for disposal through composting to ensure environmental sustainability.

 

The endeavour after the initial trails is to progressively introduce bagasse based packaging as a viable alternative of non bio-degradable material being currently used on all Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duranto trains managed by IRCTC in the coming months.

                The introduction of ‘’Deccan Queen’’ between the two premier cities of Maharashtra on 1st June 1930 was a major landmark in the history of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the forerunner of the Indian Railways. This was the first deluxe train introduced on the railway to serve two important cities of the region and was aptly named after Pune, which is also known as ‘’Queen of Deccan’’ (‘’Dakkhan ki Rani’’).

 

Initially, the train was introduced with 2 rakes of 7 coaches each one of which was painted in silver with scarlet mouldings and the other with royal blue with gold lines. The under frames of the coaches of the original rakes were built in England while the coach bodies were built in the Matunga Workshop of the GIP Railway.

The Deccan Queen, initially, had only first class and second class accommodation. First class was abolished on 1st January 1949 and second class was redesigned as first class, which continued up to June 1955 when third class was introduced on this train for the first time. This was later re-designated as second class from April 1974 onwards. The coaches of the original rakes were replaced in 1966 by anti-telescopic steel bodied integral coaches built by Integral Coach Factory, Perambur. These coaches incorporated improved design of bogies for better riding comfort and also improvements in the interior furnishings and fittings. The number of coaches in the rake was also increased to 12 from the original 7 coaches providing additional accommodation. Over the year the number of coaches in the train has been increased to the present level of 17 coaches.

 

 

From its inception, apart from providing high standards of comfort to the passengers, the train has witnessed various improvement such as introduction, for the first time in India, of coaches with roller bearings, replacement of end on generation coaches with self generating coaches with 110 volts system and introduction of first and second class chair cars providing increased accommodation to passengers. The distinctive colour scheme of cream and oxford blue with red band above the window level has been recently adopted as the colour scheme for this train.

With the ever-growing aspirations of the travelling public for better amenities, improved standards of comfort and better quality of service, it was considered necessary to give a complete facelift to theDeccanQueen.

The rake was changed in 1995 with the following special features:


	All newly manufactured or about a year old, air brake coaches.
	The 5 first class chair car in the old rake have been replaced by 5 ACchair cars providing an additional seating capacity of 65 in a dust-free environment. Also the 9-second class chair cars provide additional seating capacity of 120 seats compared to the old coaches. Thus, new rake provides a total seating capacity of 1417 as against 1232 seats in the old rake i.e. an increase of 15%.
	The dining car offers table service for 32 passengers and has modern pantry facilities such as microwave oven, deep freezer and toaster. Thedining car is also tastefully furnished with cushioned chairs and carpet.


 

The management systems of Deccan Queen (2123 Dn / 2124 Up) have been assessed by International Services Ltd. and found to comply with the requirements of ISO 9001-2000 under the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand in November 2003. At Present Deccan Queen (12123/12124) runs with 17 coaches including 4 AC chair car, one Buffet Car, 10 second class chair car and two second class cum brake vans.

                Following a marathon, two day review of over 700 ongoing National Highways projects in the country, the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has identified about 300 projects for completion by March 2019. Of these, about 100 projects are likely to be completed by December 2018.  Addressing media persons in New Delhi today, the Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari informed that he, along with  MoS Shri Mansukh L Mandavia,  had held extensive, state-wise review of the ongoing highways projects of 20 states in Goa earlier this week. The meeting was attended by senior officials of the Ministry, NHAI (National Highways Authority of India) NHIDCL ( National Highways Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd) , the PWD Secretaries of respective states , Project Directors, Regional Officers, every   Central and State  Government official associated with the project and also the concessionaires/ contractors. 

Shri Gadkari informed that they reviewed about 427 projects of NHAI and 311 projects of NHIDCL and the Road Transport Ministry covering 20 states  over the two day period. 127 NHAI projects and 153 Ministry projects, which were  scheduled for completion by June 2019, have now been targeted for expedited completion by March 2019.   In addition, there are about 100 projects that are going to be completed by December 2018. The construction target of NHAI for the year 2018-19 has been  revised upwards from 5058 km to 6000 km , and the Minister expressed confidence that the organization would surpass this target. The Minister also informed that the projects of Maharashtra and the North Eastern states remain  to be reviewed, and the meeting for this will be held soon. 

Delay in land acquisition and utility shifting, environment clearance and permission for cutting of trees have been identified as some of the main reasons for delay of highways projects. The Minister lauded the performance of states like Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh in sorting out these issues and helping expedite the highways projects. States like Bihar and Odisha on the other hand, need to greatly improve their performance in this regard, he said.  

The Minister stressed upon the necessity  of  regular reviews and monitoring for removing the above problems and expediting projects across the country. He said that he has visited states like Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu recently and held extensive review meetings with concerned state and central officials to expedite projects in these states. Following  the Goa review meeting Chief Secretaries of all states have been asked to hold monthly review meetings to sort out problems at their ends. Secretary Road Transport & Highways will hold meetings with  Chief Secretaries of every state to sort out the encumbrances that are delaying the highways projects. CGMs of projects have been directed to visit sites every 10 days to see the progress on ground. 

Faulty DPRs have been found to be another reason for delay. Very often Detailed Project Reports (DPR) are made without taking actual ground realities into consideration. It has been decided to compile a list of projects that have been delayed for this reason. The consultants making faulty DPRs will be penalized and black listed. 

The Minister also stressed upon a performance audit of concessionaires. Good performers will be rewarded with incentives and poor performers may be black listed. Shri Gadkari also said that he will soon hold meetings with  the heads of major banks to sort out issues related to flow of funds.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, approved the project for construction of 9.9 km long new 6 - lane bridge across river Ganga on NH - 96 at Phaphamau in Allahabad with total capital cost of Rs. 1948.25 crore. 

The construction period for the project is three years and likely to be completed by December, 2021. The new bridge will resolve the traffic congestion on existing old 2 - lane Phaphamau bridge on NH-96 at Allahabad.

The new bridge will also facilitate to the large congregation of people at Holy City Allahabad during Kumbh, Ardh-Kumbh and other yearly ritual baths at SANGAM in Prayag. This will give a boost to pilgrimage tourism and local economy of Holy city of Prayag.

This new 6 - lane bridge will also be beneficial for the Lucknow / Faizabad bound traffic coming from Madhya Pradesh via National Highway - 27 and National Highway - 76 through Naini Bridge.

In addition, this project of new bridge will generate direct employment during construction for about 9.20 lakh mandays.

At present all the Allahabad bound traffic coming from National Highway - 96, National Highway - 24 B, Asian Highway -1 and other local highways are using the existing old 2 - lane bridge at Phaphamau for crossing the River Ganga. There is no entry for goods vehicles on this bridge from 06 am to 11 pm. The present traffic on the old bridge is about 40,000 PCUs (Passenger Car Units) which is manifold greater than its designed capacity of 15,000 PCUs (Passenger Car Units), resulting in severe jam over bridge all around the day and night. This new 6 - lane bridge will decongest the old bridge and will also ensure fast and safe movement for traffic.          

Background:

It may be noted that there were only 13 bridges on river Ganges between Allahabad to Farakka before May'2014. After 2014, additional 20 bridges were planned, out of which five have been opened to traffic and seven are under construction on the above stretch, thus bringing the total number of bridges to 33.  Out of balance 8 bridges, which are planned for construction, work on Farakka, Sahebganj and Mokarnah is likely to start very soon. The present Phaphamau bridge would be therefore 29th Bridge on river Ganges between Allahabad and Farakka.

                The Union Minister for Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Mines Shri Narendra Singh Tomar has inaugurated the National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS)in all sub-registrar offices in Andaman & Nicobar Islands from New Delhi through a Video-Conferencing. To aptly address the diversity and variations prevailing across the States on account of languages, processes, formulae and formats, the Department of Land Resources has developed a National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) through the National Informatics Centre (NIC) to include the requirements of all the States. After the Inauguration, Shri Tomar said that this generic customizable software, when universally adopted in the Country, will enable ‘anywhere access’ to data and information to both the common man and the enforcement and regulatory agencies. He also said that transparency will be promoted due to registration through digital means and people will get the benefits in a hassle-free manner. 

To encourage the offices working in geographically far situated areas and to interact with the people availing benefit of this system, Shri Tomar held a video conference with Chief Secretary, Deputy Commissioner and Sub Registrars of Andaman & Nicobar Islands and the people present in the sub-registrar offices.All 5 sub-registrar offices in the UT of Andaman & Nicobar Islands have been computerized and the NGDRS has been adopted in all 5 offices.

Similarly, all 173 sub-registrar offices in the State of Punjab have been computerized and the NGDRS has been adopted in all 173 offices. State-wide inauguration of the NGDRS was done by the State Government on 27th June 2018 with the technical assistance and collaboration of NIC including its software development unit at NIC Pune and its technical unit in Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Rural Development.

 

The NGDRS system has been piloted in 3 States (Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra). 6 more states and UTs (Goa, A&N Islands, Bihar, Jharkhand, Manipur, Mizoram) are moving towards this system. Moreover, 5 states (HP, AP, MP, Kerala, Uttarakhand) have shown interest to adopt this common software (NIC has given them guidance and technical demos). The Department is presently focussing on implementation of NGDRS in these 14 States, to optimally use the available funds in a cost-effective, productive and time-bound manner. 

Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme (DILRMP)

With its priority to updated and error-free land records and easy access to information thereto, Government of India made the DILRMP into a cent per cent centrally-funded central sector scheme from 01st April 2016. 

National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) for rural and urban areas 

Computerization of sub-registrar offices is beinggiven focussed attention.Out of total 5083 sub-registrar offices in the Country, 4509 have been computerized and 2769 have been connected with tehsils.

                 As part of the ongoing DISHA Week being celebrated from 25th to 29th June, 2018 to mark the successful completion of 2 years of the District Development Coordination & Monitoring Committee (DISHA), the Union Minister of Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Mines, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, held wide ranging discussions on the DISHA initiative with Special Secretaries of the states/ UTs at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi today. The discussions centeredon various topics related to DISHA initiative and ways and means to make it a powerful and potent tool of participative governance. The Minister of State for Rural Development, Shri Ram Kripal Yadav also shared his views in the meeting.

 

The UnionRural Development Minister interacted live with 7 Members of Parliament during the course of District Level DISHA Committee Meetings in districts of Dindori, Jodhpur, Jashpur, Sikar, Jalaun, Jabalpur and Sambhal.  During the meeting, UnionRural Development Minister discussed about the incremental effectiveness of these committee in pursuing the convergence agenda. Shri Tomar also interacted with 36 States Rural Development Department Secretaries, wherein he stressed on implementing the convergence of Schemes in rural areas. Awards of appreciation were conferred for exemplary work towards regular organization of DISHA meetings to Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Mizoram and Uttarakhand. 

 

Addressing the gathering, Union Minister of Rural Development said that government schemes should be implemented in a time bound manner and the money that is spent on such schemes should commensurate with the progress at the grass root level. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has right from the beginning always wanted to change the perception of government in the minds of the people and DISHA is an efficacious tool and step in that direction. Shri Tomar said that the seed for this scheme was implanted during the NDA government led by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee government and has been improvised and taken forward from being a tool for monitoring schemes for Rural Development and broad based by incorporating other flagship schemes across various ministries of the government. 

 

Shri Tomar,hailing the DISHA initiative, said that data regarding 42 schemes of the ministry are available at one glance and therefore it makes it easy to identify which districts are lagging behind scheme wise and accordingly corrective action can be taken. He urged all MPs and other representatives toincrease their participation and also the number of meetings to ensure that the schemes are better implemented with a focus on those schemes that have been lagging behind. He also suggested that number of meetings held should become one of the criteria for the DISHA Awards. The Minister of State for Rural Development, Shri Ram Kripal Yadav said that the agenda of this government is the benefit of Gaon, Gareeb and Kisan and that all efforts of the government are directed in this direction. Shri Yadav said 70% of India’s population lives in its villages and therefore the progress of India depends on the progress of the villages and DISHA is an effective tool for monitoring the progress of various schemes of the government at different levels.

 

On the occasion, State Level Guidelines were released clearing way for constitution of State DISHA committees under the chairmanship of respective Chief Ministers.  District Committees Guidelines were also revamped and launched. State DISHA committees are envisaged with the objective of ensuring quality of expenditure, particularly in the context of optimization of public funds spent under different programmes of Central Government and other escalated issues from District Disha Committees. The Union Minister also launched a Meeting Management Software to serve the objective of end-to-end solution of paperless meeting. This software will help in preparing Meeting Notice, Agenda setting, communicatingwith members, Circulating agenda, meeting minutes and also generate triggers on items which require follow-up action. An e-book on DISHA was also released whichlucidly elaborates background of DISHA initiative, learning experience, requirement of DISHA Dashboard its features and user manual, and guidelines of district and state level DISHA committees.

 

During the DISHA week ‘DISHA Meetings’ are being organized under the chairmanship of Member of Parliament, across all the districts, to monitor the progress of 42 schemes across the country. The most notable aspect of these meetings is the effective use of IT tools in making the agenda more focused and result oriented. The cutting edge One Stop – ‘DISHA Dashboard‘ created bythe Rural Development Ministry has been designed to facilitate data driven decision making. Real time data from 18 schemes of 9 ministries have been integrated with the Dashboard and other 12 schemes of 8 Ministries are in theprocess of integration. One Time Passwords or OTPs are being provided to all MPs to ensure that such key data indicators remain protected from misuse.

                The Union Minister of Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Mines, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar today conferred the National Awards on Best Performing Self Help Groups (SHGs) under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM) to provide public recognition to the outstanding performance of the community institutions. For the assessment year 2017-18, a total of 34 SHGs have been awarded National Awards at an event held in New Delhi.As part of the Award, each SHG received a cash award of Rs. 1,00,000 along with a commemoration and a certificate of appreciation.

 

Addressing the gathering, Union Minister for Rural Development Shri Narendra Singh Tomar hailed the key role played by women in becoming agents of change and in promoting and realizingthe multi-pronged rural development approach of the government. Shri Tomar said that these SHGs are being honored today for excellent work in their respective fields and that collectively they are coming up in a big way. He said that Centre as well as State governments are promoting SHGs in a big way and that this will benefit India as a whole.

 

Shri Tomar asserted that the focus of the Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi led government is to bring prosperity into rural areas and into the lives of poor, marginalized and the deprived. He further stated that the Hon’ble Prime Minister ensured that 14 lakh crores out of 24 lakh crores in the Union Budget is dedicated for the betterment and progress of Gaon, Gareeb and Kisan of the nation. He said that this will play a key role in reducing the socio-economic inequalities and poverty alleviation. 

 

Talking about the importance of financial assistance being provided to the SHGs through the DAY-NRLM, Shri Tomar said that credit facilities are being provided which have led to SHGs becoming an agent of change and a leading light for others to follow. Shri Singh also said that 5 crore women are already dedicated towards this end and the target is to get 9 crore women to become a part of this movement and bring qualitative change into the lives of people.

 

Shri Tomar also gave two suggestion for further improving the overall awards process and including more people into it. First suggestion related to the problem of NPAs being faced by banks. Talking about this, Union Rural Development Minister said that banks don’t give loans easily and especially not to poor but government has ensured that SHGs get loans and easy credit facilities from banks and the overall rate of NPAs among SHGs is very low. Shri Tomar urged all concerned to ensure that this rate becomes zero so that SHGs become an excellent example for others to follow. The second suggestion related to increasing the participation in the awards and also assigning grades among various SHGs to spur healthy competition among them to do better and better and also to highlight their success stories.

 

Shri Ram Kripal Yadav, Minister of State for Rural Development, was the esteemed Guest of Honor at the Awards Function.

They highlighted how their association with NRLM and its interventions, has been very virtuous and inculcated a sense of self-respect and dignity to their lives. The three members were Rajkumari Kevat, Santoshi SHG, MPSRLM, Md. Nazeema, Kareena SHG, Telangana SRLM and Rajlakshmi Banik, Radharani SHG, Tripura Rural Livelihoods Mission.

The National Awards to the Self-Help Groups (SHGs) are intended to provide public recognition to the outstanding performance of the community institutions and incorporate a sense of pride among the poor community members. Conferring awards to best performing SHG and Village Organizations was initiated by DAY-NRLM in 2016-17.  

 

The Awards have motivated the State Missions across the country to perform better and it has also brought the mission to the attention to the senior officers in the states. The financial resources leveraged by the Self Help Group members has enabled them to undertake a large ensemble of livelihood activities such as agriculture and allied activities, sheep and goat rearing, horticulture, running of local means of transportation, rearing of milch animals, irrigation development through bore wells, carpentry etc. 

 

The Union Minister of Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Mines also launched the NRLM Best Practices Compendium and Self Help Group products catalogues.

                (Curtain Raiser)                                                                       

The Union Minister of Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Mines, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar will confer the National Awards on Best Performing Self Help Groups under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM) on Monday, 11th June, 2018. The National Awards to the Self-Help Groups (SHGs) are intended to provide public recognition to the outstanding performance of the community institutions and incorporate a sense of pride among the poor community members. Conferring awards to best performing SHG and Village Organizations was initiated by DAY-NRLM in 2016-17.  For the assessment year 2017-18, 34 SHGs have been shortlisted for receiving DAY-NRLM National Awards in an event to be held at A. P. Shinde Hall, PUSA on 11th June, 2018 in Delhi.  

The DAY-NRLM awards are conferred on the Best Performing Community Based Organizations (Self Help Groups and Village Organizations) after screening the nominations received from the SRLMs. The selection process adopted is that the SHGs are first assessed for their performance on several indicators such as Institution Building-Capacity Building, Financial Inclusion, Livelihoods, Convergence etc. and then nominated by the respective SRLMs for receiving awards. The National Unit of DAY-NRLM then screens the applications thus received and finalizes the awardee list. 

The Awards have motivated the State Missions across the country to perform better and it has also brought the programme to the attention to the senior officers in the states. The financial resources leveraged by the Self Help Group members has enabled them to undertake a large ensemble of livelihood activities such as agriculture and allied activities, sheep and goat rearing, horticulture, running of local means of transportation, rearing of milch animals, irrigation development through bore wells, carpentry etc. 

The SHGs are a perfect example of how livelihoods of households can transform through a collective approach, managed in line with core democratic and financial principles. The SHG has contributed to several community level activities for the common good. These include awareness promotion for constructing household toilets using SBM funds, environmental sanitation, liquid waste management and support for maintenance of village commons.

The members are conscious of their social responsibilities and have undertaken several collective activities including campaign against child labour, illicit distillation and child marriages etc. SHG has demonstrated strong features of a progressive community based institution.

The Union Minister of Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Mines will also launch NRLM Best Practices Compendium and Self Help Group products catalogues for stimulating grass root development. The compendium of 24 select Best Practices under DAY-NRLM will facilitate cross learning from successful implementation and innovation among the State Missions, MoRD has been organizing workshops on Best Practices in DAY-NRLM.  The 1st such workshop was organized during Aug 2016 and the document was published in early 2017. The second workshop was organized during Feb, 2018 at New Delhi. A large number of best practices and innovations in the areas of community institutions and capacity building, skill building, financial inclusion, farm and non-farm livelihoods and health and nutrition were present at the second workshop. The document released presents the best practices and innovations for wider dissemination and adaption.

He said that this government has shown good intentions (Achi Neeyat) and given a good stable policy (Achi Neeti) along with a strong leadership (Netritva) which has led to a transformation in governance and has shown a positive impact on the lives of people.

Speaking about the landmark Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform ushered in by PM Modi, Shri Tomar said that GST had been in limbo for 10 years due to the previous government under UPA which failed to provide decisive governance and courageous government. He said that this government has remedied that and brought in landmark reforms to provide further impetus to growth and development. He said that PM Modi has no personal agenda and has been working for the nation to ensure that the economy becomes strong, the malice of corruption and poverty can be eradicated and a clean and transparent government can be given for the service of the nation.

He said that India is recognised as the fastest growing economy the world over. Shri Tomar also said that terrorism is a big issue for India and this government has exposed Pakistan of all its lies and deceit and it is thanks to PM Modi that Pakistan stands completely isolated globally.

He said that Rs. 1,11,000 Crore has been accumulated by this government through the auction route. Shri Tomar also highlighted the District Mineral Foundation which has been setup in every district affected by mining to ensure that Miners feel accountable for the Mining area and develop the area without its negative impact on the local environment. He also said that Star Rating mechanism has been developed for Miners so as to ensure that Miners remain accountable for their actions.

Replying to queries about the National RURBAN Mission, the Union minister said that it aims to develop cluster of villages that preserve and nurture the essence of rural community life with focus on equity and inclusiveness without compromising with the facilities perceived to be essentially urban in nature, thus creating a cluster of ""Rurban villages. He said that 287 such clusters have been allocated by the Rural Development Ministry with emphasis on Infrastructure Development and Cleanliness. He said that both Centre as well as the states are working on about 300 such clusters. 

Talking about the success of the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan, Shri Tomar said that after the successful implementation of many schemes under Gram Uday to Bharat Uday Abhiyan and Sankalp se Sidddhi, the Union Cabinet under the leadership of PM Modi decided to hold the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (GSA) from 14th April till 5th May, 2018 to provide government schemes in mission mode to the villages in aspirational districts as identified by the Niti Ayog. He also commended the efforts of officials in making GSA a success by achieving 100% saturation in all the identified villages.

                Durable Water Conservation assets have been a priority under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) over the last 3 years.  Over 143 lakh hectares have benefitted in the last 3 years through Water Conservation under MGNREGS.  The Institute of Economic Growth study and the Council for Social Development study have indicated improvements in productivity, acreage, incomes and water table. Hon’ble Prime Minister had reviewed with Hon’ble Chief Ministers of States at the time of 2015-16 rainfall deficiency and has again reiterated the need for fully utilizing MGNREGS in April to June period for Water Conservation.

 

To ensure a concerted thrust on Water Conservation during the summer months, already Rs. 25,376 crore have been released to the States and UTs in the current Financial Year.  Every State has taken up Water Conservation works as per its felt needs.  2,156 river rejuvenation works have also been planned by the States across the country.  Some very meaningful work has been undertaken to revive water bodies, and to construct new ponds.  Districts in nearly every State have come forward to start a people’s movement for Water Conservation.  Efforts in Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, West Bengal, Sikkim, Maharashtra, are all designed as per local needs to ensure that durable Water Conservation assets contribute to the well-being of marginal and small farmers.  Through these concerted efforts, over 15 lakh farm ponds have already been completed besides a very large number of dug wells, community water bodies, check dams etc.  Each and every asset being created is also geo-tagged.  The Ministry’s thrust on ensuring timely wage payments is showing remarkable results.  Of the 38.4 crore persondays already generated in the current Financial Year, payments in over 95% cases have been generated within 15 days.  In 86.4% cases, the same has even reached the Bank account of the beneficiaries within the stipulated time period.  The Water Conservation thrust, with a focus on transparency, technically sound planning and execution, and timely wage payments, is transforming the lives and livelihoods of a large number of Villages and households in Rural India.

                Union Minister  for Science & Technology, Environment , Forests and Climate Change and Earth Sciences Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that the combination of scientific, medical and technology community trio should be institutionalized all over the country for better results. He said there has to be a mechanism where an engineer goes to a medical college and a technician goes to a scientific lab and a scientist also goes to a clinician’s clinic. Launching the four major projects of Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology in Thiruvananthapuram on saturday, he said institutions like Sree Chitra working in the healthcare sector should be aligned towards “Make in India for Healthy India”.  There is a crying need in the country for import substitution, particularly in the healthcare sector. He said some of the technologies that call for immediate attention are low-cost diagnostic machines such as MRI, CT, Cardiac catheterization laboratories and digital subtraction Angiography machines. He pointed out that apart from these, research should be undertaken to develop artificial implants, bionic organs and state-of-the art rehabilitation technologies. The Minister said there is a great need for research and clinical trials in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, stem cell engineering and gene therapy. Biochips and biosensors have to be developed for early diagnosis and monitoring of diseases. Indigenous technology for production of low-cost rapid diagnostic kits is a requirement that cannot wait. Dr. Harsh Vardhan said, for managing diabetes, indigenous production of low cost, self-monitoring kits and inexpensive newer types of is required.  Increased use of technology in healthcare should necessarily be accompanied by increased manpower to operate and manage devices and equipment and to ensure optimal and safe use of technology. The Minister called for collaborative teaching programmes with faculty from both medical and engineering institutions for manpower generation and skill development in health care technology.  

Pointing out that the country had made great strides in the field of Science & Technology in the last three –four years, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said funding for scientific research has been tripled in the last 3-4 years. He said India is sixth in whole world in science publications. The International growth rate of science publications is 4%.  For India it is 40 %. India is third in accurate weather forecast and in the ninth position in patents. CSIR ranks ninth in whole world among institutions with public funding. In the last four years India had developed over 5000 technologies and transferred over 800 technologies. Thousands of young people with their Start Ups, incubation Centres, technology parks have benefitted from this. The Minister said Narendra Modi government stand rock solid behind every youth who wants to start any enterprise or develop any technology for the benefit of the society. 

Shri Kadakampally Surendran, Minister for Co-operation, Tourism and Devaswom, who presided over the function pointed out that Sree Chitra Institute can play a vital role in the study of dreaded viruses which are afflicting the people of the state. Members of the Parliament Smt. P. K. Sreemathy Teacher, Shri. Joy Abraham, Shri. O. Rajagopal, MLA, President of the Institute and former Cabinet Secretary Shri. K. M. Chandrasekhar, and SCTIMST Founder Director Prof. M. S. Valiathan spoke on the occasion. 

Prof. Asha Kishore, Director, SCTIMST welcomed the gathering and Dr. P. R. Harikrishna Varma, Head, Biomedical Technology Wing,  proposed the vote of thanks.

                 Central Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI), Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu under Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) and RAASI Solar Power Pvt Ltd have signed a Memorandum of Agreement for transfer of technology for India’s first Lithium Ion (Li-ion) Battery project. The Agreement was signed in Bengaluru on Saturday (June 09, 2018) by Dr Vijayamohan K. Pillai, Director, CECRI and C. Narasimhan, Chairman-cum-Managing Director of RAASI Group in the presence of  Union minister for Science & Technology Dr Harsh Vardhan. 

A group at CSIR-CECRI headed by Dr Gopu Kumar has developed an indigenous technology of Lithium-ion cells in partnership with CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL) New Delhi, CSIR- Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute (CSIR-CGCRI) Kolkata and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) Hyderabad. CSIR-CECRI has set up a demo facility in Chennai to manufacture prototype Lithium-Ion cells. It has secured global IPRs with potential to enable cost reduction, coupled with appropriate supply chain and manufacturing technology for mass production. 

Currently, Indian manufacturers source Lithium Ion Battery from China, Japan and South Korea among some other countries. India is one of the largest importers and in 2017, it imported nearly 150 Million US Dollar worth Li-Ion batteries. 

“Today’s development is a validation of the capabilities of CSIR and its laboratories to meet technology in critical areas to support our industry, besides other sectors,” said Dr Harsh Vardhan after the signing ceremony. “It will give tremendous boost to two flagship programmes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi – increasing the share of Clean Energy in the energy basket by generating 175 Giga Watts by 2022, of which 100 Giga Watts will be Solar and the second, National Electric Mobility Mission, to switch completely to electric vehicles by 2030.” 

Dr Harsh Vardhan said, the project is in tune with Prime Minister’s vision of “Make in India”, to turn India into a manufacturing hub and to cut down outflow of foreign exchange. 

Raasi Group will set up the manufacturing facility in Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu close to Bangalore. “We want to bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs. 15,000/- per KW to replace Lead Acid Battery,” said Narasimhan. “We also have plans to make Lithium Ion battery for solar roof top with life span of 25 years to make it affordable enough to drive the Photo Voltaic segment.”

Li-Ion batteries have applications in Energy Storage System – from hearing aid to container sized batteries to power a cluster of villages, Electric Vehicles (2-wheeler, 3-wheeler, 4-wheeler and Bus), portable electronic sector, Grid Storage, Telecom and Telecommunication Towers, Medical Devices, Household and Office Power Back (UPS), Powering Robots in Processing Industry. Lithium-ion batteries can power any electrical application without the need of physical wires-means wireless.  



 

Dr Jitendra Yadav, Director, CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru, Dr Vidyadhar Mudkavi, Director, CSIR-4PI, Dr. M. Annadurai, Director, ISRO Satellite Centre, Bengaluru were also present on the occasion. Dr Annadurai stressed, the Li-Ion cells developed by ISRO is primarily for space applications and there is room for convergence.

The government, during the last four years, has been working on building an end-to-end, holistic scientific ecosystem. This includes enhancing the quality and quantity of impactful basic research to translation research to technology development, to technology transfer, to innovation and startups to enabling commercialization of indigenous technology. 

Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences today briefed media about achievements of Ministry of Science & Technology and Ministry of Earth Sciences in last 4 years in New Delhi. The minister said, our science is now working to solve important challenges in the areas of water, energy, health, environment, climate, agriculture, food. At the same time, India is getting future-ready in launching ambitious missions in cyber physical system, Artificial Intelligence, Super Computing, Deep Ocean, biopharmaceuticals, and others, which will make us globally competitive in a rapidly changing world order, said Dr harsh Vardhan.

The government has also connected our science to our national needs, opportunities and priorities, such as those reflected in the national missions like Make in India, Start-up India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat. Government emphasizes on new and strong connections with industry, education, with the line ministries and with other nations. 

S&T collaborations with the best in the world benefit immensely our scientific community and R&D institutions. Some noteworthy international collaboration during the last four years are: India becoming a partner in the LIGO project for gravitational wave detection with agreement to set-up the detector station in India and India becoming an Associate Member State of CERN; Establishment of India-Israel Industrial R&D and Technological Innovation Fund, etc. 

The investment in Science, Technology and related areas has gone up during the last four years starting 2014-15 to 2018-19, as against five years earlier, i.e., 2009-10 to 2013-14. The budget allocation to Department of Science & Technology was Rs. 19,764 crores, which is a whopping 90% increase. Similarly, there was an increase of 65% for the Department of Biotechnology; almost 43% increase for CSIR and 26% increase for Ministry of Earth Sciences. 

The notable achievements during the last four years have been development of new technologies and transfer of over 800 technologies to the industry. A new synergy has been established between intra-ministry laboratories and inter-ministry institutions. Scientific laboratories have increasingly become problem-resolution hubs for many government agencies like Railways, Heavy Industry, Urban Development, Defence, Drinking Water and Sanitation, Power, Coal and New and Renewable Energy. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to name a few. 

The approach has been realigned to have a mix of fundamental science and application science. This year’s budget announcement on Mission for Cyber-Physical Systems is one such example of application science. Mission-based projects on Supercomputing, Aroma, Sickle Cell Anemia and Biopharma are some illustrative examples of application and solution science initiatives. 

S&T intervention in Agriculture sector to improve crop productivity makes a huge impact on rural economy. Ministry of Earth Sciences provides agro-meteorological advisories to 24 million farmers currently, which will be scaled up to 40 million by July 2018. The timely weather information has helped in farming activities, which had resulted in a positive economic impact of Rs. 50,000 crores to national GDP. During the last four years, the quality of weather and ocean forecast services has improved substantially. On 1st June, 2018 Ministry of Earth Sciences has commissioned the Ensemble Weather Prediction system, one of the best in the world, for generating probabilistic block level weather forecasts. This was possible due to the procurement of new Super computers Pratyush and Mihir with a combined capacity of 6.8 Peta Flops by the Ministry.

A similar kind of information is provided to fishermen in the country on potential fishing zones, on fish availability. These advisories reach more than four lakh users every day, a four-fold increase during the last four years.

A joint research by CSIR DBT and ICAR has developed blight resistant improved Samba Mahsuri Rice, which is now being cultivated in an area of 120,000 hectares in seven states. This variety of rice is amongst the low glycemic index, which is amongst the lowest value for several rice varieties tested and thus, is considered highly suitable for diabetic patients. 

CSIR has launched a project in Mission-mode for development of Chemical Intermediaries and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), which would significantly reduce India’s dependence on imports, especially from China. 

With India pledging to reduce fossil fuel, the new energy mix includes higher percentage of clean energy. Several technologies have been developed indigenously by CSIR, such as coal dust collecting and briquetting system, Solar Power Tree, Novel Hydro-Electric Cell, etc. India’s first Second-Generation (2G) Ethanol plant has been formally unveiled and transferred to Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) to build commercial scale biomass ethanol plants.

In the area of Clean Energy India today occupies a leadership role in the 23 country Mission Innovation network. In less than 3 years, the investment in R&D has been doubled. India has announced the first International Clean Energy Incubator. 

 



As several areas in the country are facing acute shortage of water or poor quality of drinking water, the Ministry has launched several initiatives during the last four years to augment safe drinking water at affordable cost through appropriate S&T interventions developed indigenously. 

In order to boost the start-up ecosystem, government have increased the allocation by five times in DST alone. The Ministry has supported more than 5,000 Start-ups and 200 incubators. Apart from this, the ministry has also launched a programme called MANAK (Million Minds Augmenting National Aspiration and Knowledge), to trigger innovation among school children from 6th to 10th standard. 

S&T manpower is the foundation of R&D. During the last four years, ministry has enhanced capacity building of scientists, teachers, young researchers and attracting students to science streams. Ministry supported around 11 lakh persons – right from school level to post-doctoral research. The Department of Science & Technology has launched several new schemes to attract young scientists.  The Ministry has successfully attracted more than 600 eminent scientists of Indian origin from overseas to return to the country.

However, salvage operations are held up due to adverse weather and sea conditions. The salvers have reached Kolkota and the operation will commence once the weather improves. No loss of life has been reported due to the fire in the ship. 

The communication centre of the Directorate General of Shipping - DGComcentre, received a call on the 13th last at 2250 hrs, from merchant container ship,stating that the vessel had an explosion in a cargo hold and containers were on fire and requested for assistance. The vessel had 22 crew members and was carrying 464 containers (613 TEUs) from Krishnapatnam port, Andhra Pradesh to Kolkata port, West Bengal. Immediately the DGComcentre alerted MRCC Haldia and all concerned authorities of the Directorate General of Shipping, Coast Guard and Kolkata Port Trust to provide necessary assistance to vessel’s Master and crew.

The situation was reviewed early next morning and the Kolkata Port Trust and Indian Coast Guard were requested to render full support to the vessel for dousing the fire, save lives and prevent pollution from ship.  The vessel master and crew abandoned the ship due to uncontrollable fire onboard the ship and the Indian Coast Guard rescued the entire crew and brought them to Haldia by their vessel ICGS Rajkiran.

Next day, the technical officers of the Directorate General of Shipping advised to take urgent steps to avoid any kind of pollution as the vessel was floating with fire close to Sunderbans which is an eco-sensitive area. The shipping company and its managing counterpart were instructed to take swift action, with the support of all agencies, experts and salvers to arrest the drifting of the vessel towards international boarder and Sunderbans. 

The Principal Officer, Mercantile Marine Department, Kolkata convened a meeting with the representatives of Kolkata Port Trust, Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard, the Indian Register of Shipping (the Classification Society of the vessel SSL Kolkata) and Ship owner on the same day and took measures to coordinate and ensure that the ship does not drift towards Sunderbans and Bangaladesh waters. The Indian Navy accordingly led an operation on 16th June, - Indian Navy commandos and 3 crew were flown by helicopter sea king and boarded the vessel safely and anchored the vessel 15 miles away from Bangladesh boarder.

                Ministry of Shipping in association with Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gramin Kaushal Yojana (DDU-GKY), Ministry of Rural Development conducted a one-day workshop on “Skill Development in the Port and Maritime Sector” in New Delhi today. The workshop was inaugurated by Secretary (Shipping) Sh. Gopal Krishna and Sh. Bishnu Pada Ray, Member of Parliament from Andaman and Nicobar. 

 

Speaking on the occasion Secretary, Shipping said, Skill Development in the Port & Maritime sector is an opportunity to improve India’s coastal areas, usher in port led prosperity and provide the world with skilled youth. India is one of the leading suppliers of seafarers in the world and now want to be the leading supplier for all talent in the Port and Maritime sector. Shri Bishnu Pada Ray, Member of Parliament from Andaman and Nicobar also lauded the efforts made by the Ministry of Shipping. The workshop brought together employers, training partners and government institutions working in the Port and Maritime sector. The workshop also highlighted various skill development initiatives undertaken by the Ministry of Shipping. 

 

The Ministry of Shipping has completed skill gap studies of 21 coastal districts in eight states and three Union Territories (Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep) and currently its implementation is underway.  Training of 500 students per-year-per-district for the next 3 years through Sagarmala DDU GKY (MoRD) - convergence for Port and Maritime sector skills is being undertaken and respective State Governments are issuing Expression of Interest (EoI) for empaneling training partners.  Project approvals for Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal have been done. For the first phase, training has commenced for 2028 students, 1917 have been trained and 1128 have been placed. 92 students are under training in Odisha. 

 

Additionally, under the Ministry of Shipping’s flagship Sagarmala Programme a world class Center of Excellence in Maritime and Ship Building (CEMS) is being set up in partnership with Siemens and Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) at a cost of INR 766 crore. It will have campuses at Vishakhapatnam and Mumbai and will train 10,512 students per year. The CEMS aims to become an international nodal Centre in South Asia, attracting students from neighboring countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia for skill development in the Port and Maritime sector. Partial operationalization of CEMS is expected to start by end of June 2018 and complete operationalization is expected by September 2018.

 

In order to improve Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) in ship breaking yards in Alang, Bhavnagar, Gujarat, a mandatory 12-day Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) training for all entry level workers has been undertaken.  So far 5011 workers have been trained in OSH. The course has been reviewed by DG FASLI, Ministry of Labour and third party certification for the training is under consideration. For Maritime Logistics, a Multi-skill Development Centre for Maritime Logistics is being set up in Uran near JNPT Mumbai.  This centre in collaboration with Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship will provide for entry level skilled workforce for maritime logistics.

On this occasion a testimonial booklet highlighting the success stories of trainees trained in Phase -1 of the Sagarmala-DDU GKY convergence program was released by the dignitaries. The Ministry of Shipping also released skill gap studies for 21 coastal districts of India. The reports and the testimonial booklet can be accessed at http://sagarmala.gov.in/project/coastal-community-development/report

                The Standing Finance Committee of Ministry of Shipping has cleared a project for setting up an exclusive, fully mechanized handling facility for fertilizer cargo at Deendayal Port in Kandla.  The facility will be developed at berth number 14 of the port, which is being constructed   at an approximate cost of Rs.138 crore. The port will further invest approximately Rs.340 crore for the project from its internal resources. Initially, the proposed facility will handle 2.60 MMTPA and subsequently this will be raised to 4.50 MMTPA. 

 In the proposed project all activities, right from unloading of bulk fertilizer cargo from the ships to loading of the bagged fertilizer onto the wagons will be fully mechanized. The fertilizer cargo will be unloaded using Mobile Harbour Cranes onto Mobile Hoppers. The conveyor system, along with the tipper system, will transfer the cargo to the cargo storage shed of 38,500 m2.  The storage shed will be equipped with 40 sets of bagging and stitching units which will feed the bagged cargo directly into wagons to reduce labour, movement and will optimize time and as such the logistic cost will come down.

At present, the handling of fertilizer cargo at Deendayal Port involves multiple movements and agencies.  The mechanized facility will reduce the same and ensure faster delivery of the cargo to the end users. It will be beneficial to the farmers in terms of cost and faster delivery. For the fertilizer importers, the benefits of the proposed facility will be:

 


	Efficient operation due to end to end mechanization
	No contamination of fertilizer cargo due to dedicated mechanization and closed PEB Shed
	No internal vehicular movement for transfer of cargo
	Less number of labour required due to mechanization and no multiple handling
	One time transfer through equipment and conveyor
	Mechanized Dust Suppression to avoid dust
	Lower rake turn-around time 
	Lower vessel turn-around time
	Lower logistics cost


 

The tendering work for the project is in progress.   The facility is expected to be commissioned by October, 2020.

                National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) has organized a Two daysNational Seminar on “Conservation of Particularly Vulnerable Tribes of Andaman and Nicobar Islands: The Way Forward”here today.The Seminar was inaugurated by the Lt. Governor of Andaman & Nicobar Islands Admiral (Retd.) D.K. Joshi. The Chairman of NCST Shri Nand Kumar Sai presided over the inaugural function.

 

About 44 Ministries/Departments areparticipating in the seminar to present their strategies and approach towards PVTGs in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This Seminar has been organized in collaboration with Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI) and Directors of 18 Tribal Research Institutes in different States are also participating to deliberate on critical issues of tribal groups who are at the verge of extinction.  Vice Chancellors of six Universities including Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Amarkantak will provide academic inputs on PVTGs.  Domain experts, NGO and Civil Society representatives are also providing their perspective so that a holistic view is taken on way forward.

 

Delivering inaugural address, Lt. Governor, Andaman and Nicobar IslandsAdmiral (Retd.) D. K. Joshi emphasized that let PVTGs of Andaman & Nicobar Islands grow with their genius and at their own pace. He said that Andaman & Nicobar Islandsare home to the most primitive tribal groups: Great Andamanese, Onge, Jarawa, Sentinelese, Nicobarese and Shompens.  Some of these tribal groups are on the verge of extinction.  It is important to understand the challenges they face and to preserve them.

 

In his address, Shri Nand Kumar Sai, Chairman, NCST said that today these fragile communities are facing expropriation of their ecosystem by outsiders. There is an aggressive brush off with non tribals- traders and tourists and this is impacting their physical, environment and routine life. The outside influences are impacting their land use patterns, use of the sea, overall biodiversity leading to material and non-material changes in them and to some deleterious consequences. These is clearly need to learn from what happened to the Onges and the Great Andamanese who have been adversely impact by outside influences brought in by tourism and modern development.

 

In his welcome address, Secretary, NCST Shri Raghav Chandra dwelt upon many important issues pertaining to the most primitive tribal groups of Andaman and Nicobar Islands viz Great Andamanese, Onge, Jarawa, Sentinelese, Nicobarese and Shompens.  He said that the Tribal way of life is the simplest, serene and sustainable in the world, Modern mankind with its expensive, waste-including, consumerist lifestyle has a lot to learn from our ancient native tribes- most notably about to coexist peacefully and how to reduce our footprint on mother earth.  The total area of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands is 8249 sq kms or twelve times the size of the country of Singapore. The total number of tribes on these islands are 28077, out of which 97% are the more developed Nicobarese. The five particularly venerable tribes are the sentinelese only 50, in North Sentinel Island; Andamanese: 70 in Strait Islands; Ongese : 120 in little Andaman Islands;  Shompens: 238 in Great Nicobar Island and Jarawas : 500 in middle and South Andaman Islands.

 

He further said that historically, although these islands lay along the grand trade routes between Europe and East Asia, they remained isolated and unexplored. The A&N tribes represent oldest living indigenous communities of the world, with anthropological connections with both the original inhabitants of Africa and of East Asia which reveals in their features. Many attempts have been made across history by the colonial British rulers to subjugate them and to keep Andamans as a penal colony, but the indomitable spirit of the tribes was not easy to defeat.

 

Exclusive Thematic Sessions have been organized held on the Sentinelese, Great Andamanies, Onge, Jarawa, Shompen.  The deliberations take stock of the impact of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation 1956 as amended in 2005 and 2012 along with 2004 Policy on Jarawa Tribes of Andaman and Nicobar.  Similarly, the 2015 Policy on Shompen of Great Nicobar Islands have been discussed in the Seminar. The entire architect of welfare approach by the Government is analysed in the seminar for a road map for PVTGs in Andaman, which are a role model for PVTGs in other States.

                The President of India Shri Ram Nath Kovind presented the “Fourth National Awards for outstanding services in the field of Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drug) Abuse” to the institutions and individuals on the occasion of ‘International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking’ at a function organized by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi today. Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, Ministers of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar, Shri Ramdas Athawale, Shri Vijay Sampla and Secretary, M/o SJ&E Smt. Neelam Sawhney graced the occasion. State Government Officials, NGOs, National and International organizations working in this field, Students from Colleges & Schools, professionals & experts and Personnel from Para Military Forces also attended the function.

Addressing on the occasion, the President said that the problem of drugs addiction and alcoholism negatively impacts the individual, family and society in multiple domains such as health, culture, development and politics. Drug addiction spurs poverty and also poses a challenge to our national security as well as to our development and public welfare goals.

He said that our geographical location between Myanmar-Laos-Thailand’s ‘Golden Triangle’ and Iran-Afghanistan-Pakistan’s ‘Golden Crescent’, makes the problem of Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking even more acute and complicated. Increase in drug trafficking and drug abuse in the border areas is also associated with issues of terrorism and political unrest. That is why there is a need to be more vigilant in Border States like Punjab and Manipur.

The President said that misuse of illegal drugs is creating health challenges especially for the young generation and school going children. He stated that the problem of drug abuse can be solved by awareness, prevention, incentives, and support efforts. In these efforts compassion and sympathy for the drug addicts is also necessary. Parents, teachers, doctors, voluntary organizations should be associated in the medical and rehabilitation efforts. He expressed his happiness that the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has taken necessary steps in these directions.

Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, in his address said that the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has set up a National Toll Free Drug De-Addiction Helpline Number-1800110031 to help the victims of drug abuse, their family and society at large and it is functional 24x7. The Ministry uses print, electronic and social media for creating awareness. The Ministry has started an online system for processing of Grant-in-Aid to Voluntary Organizations (VOs)/Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) from the financial year 2014-15. At present, approximately 400 Integrated Rehabilitation Centre for Addicts (IRCAs) are being run across the country with support from this Ministry.  About one lakh drug/alcohol addicts are benefitted every year under the Scheme. 

The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment celebrates 26th June every year as International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. The Government of India has instituted a Scheme of the National Awards for outstanding services in the field of prevention of Alcoholism & Substance (Drug) Abuse from the year 2013. The Awards were earlier conferred annually till 2014. However, the Scheme of the Award has now been revised and the Awards are now conferred biennially.

                National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) is organizing a National Seminar on “Conservation of Particularly Vulnerable Tribes of Andaman and Nicobar Islands: The Way Forward” on 27th and 28th June, 2018 at Kamaladevi Multipurpose Hall, India International Centre, Max Mueller Marg, New Delhi.  About 44 Ministries/Departments have been invited by the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes to present their strategies and approach towards PVTGs in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This Seminar is being organized in collaboration with Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI) and Directors of 18 Tribal Research Institutes in different States have also been invited to deliberate on critical issues of tribal groups who are at the verge of extinction.  Vice Chancellors of six Universities including Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Amarkantak will provide academic inputs on PVTGs.  Domain experts, NGO and Civil Society representatives will provide their perspective so that a holistic view is taken on way forward.

 

Andaman and Nicobar Islands are home to the most primitive tribal groups: Great Andamanese, Onge, Jarawa, Sentinelese, Nicobarese and Shompens.  Some of these tribal groups are on the verge of extinction.  It is important to understand the challenges they face and to preserve them. With these objectives in view, the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST), a Constitutional body set up under Article 338(A) of the Constitution to protect the interests of Scheduled Tribes, is organizing for the first time a two-day Seminar. 

 

Exclusive Thematic Sessions will be held on the Sentinelese, Great Andamanies, Onge, Jarawa, Shompen.  The deliberations will take stock of the impact of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation 1956 as amended in 2005 and 2012 along with 2004 Policy on Jarawa Tribes of Andaman and Nicobar.  Similarly, the 2015 Policy on Shompen of Great Nicobar Islands will also be discussed in the Seminar. The entire architect of welfare approach by the Government will be analysed in the seminar for a road map for PVTGs in Andaman, which will be a role model for PVTGs in other States.

Manju Dilermet Shri Naresh Kumar, Chairman and other senior officers of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) at NDMC Headquarters today to discuss various issues of Safai Karamcharis and follow up action by NDMC on Commission’s earlier recommendations/directions. Shri Naresh Kumar, Chairman, NDMC briefed them about the new initiatives and steps taken by the Council for the welfare of the Safai Karamcharis. Representatives of SafaiKaramcharis of the Council were also present in the meeting.   

 

ShriZala and Smt. Manju Diler distributed Reinforced Prior Learning (RPL) certificates to 25 Safai Karamcharis of NDMC. They also unveiled the newly acquired wheel barrows which will simplify the work of the Safai Karamcharis.  

 

 

Shri Zala raised the issue of exploitation of contractual Safai Karamcharis by their contractors and exhorted the council to explore the possibility of direct hiring of Safai Karamcharis on contract basis instead of leaving them at the mercy of the unscrupulous contractors.  He also expressed his dismay at the large number of compassionate appointment cases pending in the Council due to ceiling of 5% on such appointment. In this regard, he suggested the Council to pursue the matter with the Central Government for seeking relaxation of this condition in the case of Safai Karamcharis. After listening to the demands of the Safai Karamcharis present in the meeting, Shri Zala directed the Council for converting Temporary Muster Roll workers into Regular Muster Roll and Regular Muster Roll into Permanent workers. A demand for allotment of houses by the Council was also made by the Safai Karamcharis. In this regard, while acknowledging the shortage of accommodation with the Council, Shri Zala advised the Safai Karamcharis to acquire their own houses under Pradhan Mantri AwasYojana. The Chairman and Member of the Commission also impressed upon the Council to provide necessary safety kits/gears to the Safai Karamcharis to carry out their job.

                The Foundation of stone of “Auxiliary Production Unit and State-of-the-Art Artificial Limbs Fitting Centre” of Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO) under Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment was laid by Shri Manohar Lal, Chief Minister of Haryana and Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar, Minister of State for Social Justice & Empowerment at a function  at village Nawada, Tigaon (Ballabhgarh), Faridabad, Haryana today. 

 

There has been an ever increasing demand from the Divyangjan about the difficulty being faced by them in visiting Kanpur to avail facilities of evaluation, measurements and fitment of assistive devices from ALIMCO Hqrs. at Kanpur. Diversification of rehabilitation and fitment of assistive devices services to other areas will facilitate Divyangjans to cover less a distance for acquiring these devices.

 

Establishment of the State of the Art Rehabilitation Centre at Faridabad would substantially reduce botheration of long travel for Divyangjans from J&K, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan and to some extent MP and Chhattisgarh. Once established, the production centre at Faridabad will not only reinforce capacity of the Corporation but also provide other rehabilitation services like limbs fitting, disabled help centres, awareness generation about other schemes for empowerment of Divyangjan in NCR and neighbouring states of the country. Apart from facilities for filment of State-of-the-art Artificial Limbs, Manufacturing of Tricycle, Wheelchair, Motorized Tricycle, Walker, Crutches, and Walking Stick etc. will also be undertaken in this centre.

                The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has been regularly bringing out macro-economic aggregates and indicators. The statistical processes involved in producing such estimates are open, transparent and in line with the best international practices and standards. The processes and estimates are evolved after detailed deliberations in various technical committees and the recommendations placed in the public domain. Efforts have also been made to increase the sample size and use of high frequency data released by various agencies. These measures have been largely appreciated by different sections of society including research analysts, experts, international organisations etc. However, recently certain sections of the media have reported on the revision in base years of various statistical products and estimates brought out by the Government of India. The Government would like to present a proper perspective on these issues so that the end users and public at large become aware of the processes involved in generation of these estimates and in the base revision exercise. 

2. Macro-economic indicators and estimates released from time to time are essential to provide decision makers with reliable informationon the current level of economic activity and how the current level compares with the activity in previous time periods.Change of base year to calculate these indicators area normal activity which is periodically undertaken. This is in line with the global effort in the G20 and other fora to capture economic information accurately and to analyse the changing structure of the economy. While undertaking revisions, it is also a global statistical practice to continuously identify and tap new data sources in the economy which have wider coverage and where data is available regularly. 

3. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has revised the base years of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) to 2011-12 and for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to 2012.For the IIP and CPI, the item baskets were revised to remove items that were no longer relevant and include those that had become relevant since the last base revision. For the National Account estimates, the new seriesis a structural breakaway from the old series, as it includes information sources which have newly become available or are more regular than the earlier ones. Some examples of these are the new information which is now available for the corporate sector, the estimates of the unorganised sector from the 2010-11 National Sample Survey on unincorporated enterprises and the data on sales and service taxes. All these have been used in the new series. 

4.  Normally, when a new series of National Account Statistics (NAS) is introduced with an updated base period, it is customary for the Central Statistical Office (CSO)to undertake a research exercise to link the old series with the new series. For the compilation of a linked series, the standard methodology used by CSO is the splicing method and reworking the estimates as per the current series methodology at the component or detailed item level. CSO in the past has adopted the following guidelines for the compilation of linked series.

 


	For the years from the last base (2004-05) to the current base (2011-12), the components are re-estimated by following the same procedure as for the new series of NAS. Thus new data sources and additional coverage of activities introduced in the new series also need to be accounted forin all the previous years in which these activities were in existence in the economy and the datasets were available and reliable for use.


 


	For the years prior to previous base year (2004-05), the estimates are prepared by using the splicing technique. Consequently, it implies that there would be no change in the growth rates of aggregates for the same years between the old series and new series. However, additivity of detailed estimates with the aggregates will not be maintained. This is an accepted practice adopted globally as well as in India.


 

5.  The 2011-12 GDP series incorporates data emanating from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and this data source has been evolving over the years. For back casting the series till 2004-05, various alternatives are being worked out under the guidance of the Advisory Committee on National Accounts and the back series will be finalized and released after due consultations with this expert committee. 

 

6.The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) was also revised and the weighting diagram and item basket now includes new items that are relevant to the present context. In addition, a mechanism for a regular review of the item basket and data sources has also been put in place. Similarly for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), in addition to a revision of the item basket, several methodological improvements have also taken place in line with international practices. For instance, the geometric mean is now being used in place of the arithmetic mean for computing item level indices so that there is less volatility on account of extreme values. The number of dwellings covered under Repeat House Rent Survey has been doubled for better representation of each category of dwelling. Further, the basket of items and their weighting diagram have been prepared using Modified Mixed Reference Period in place of Uniform Reference Period, which are methodological improvements. 

7. Information on employment and unemployment was being estimated from the Employment and Unemployment Survey of households conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) every five years. With the need to have more frequent data on employment and unemployment, several initiatives were launched including the Annual Employment and Unemployment Surveys of Labour Bureau using the household approach; the Quarterly Employment of Labour Bureau using the establishment approach; the Periodic Labour Force Survey being conducted by NSSO and more recently the use of high frequency data like the new subscribers/members enrolling in the EPF, ESIC and NPS. These matters were deliberated on in the meetings of the Task Force on Improving Employment Data constituted by the Ministry of Labour & Employment under the Chairpersonship of Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog. One of the key recommendations of the Committee was to bring about a gradual convergence of these various initiatives so that a more holistic view on the levels of employment and unemployment could emerge for policy interventions and for evolving targeted schemes. 

8.  Recently, the Government has started bringing out estimates of new subscribers/members enrolling in large social security schemes like the Employee’s Provident Fund (EPF), Employee’s State Insurance Scheme (ESI) and the National Pension Scheme (NPS). The new members enrolling in these schemes are a good measure about the numbers in the workforce moving towards formality. The Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana is another scheme which encourages employers to recruit/hire newcomers in the formal sector. 

9. It needs to be appreciated that the data collection, processing and releasing of estimates is a resource and time intensive exercise. The National Statistical Commission gives overall guidance to the Ministry of Statistics & PI in undertaking all statistical activities based on priorities and resource availability. Similarly, the Labour Bureau also undertakes surveys based on the needs of Government and policy makers. The Task Force on Improving Employment Data has given several recommendations which are gradually being implemented to improve the availability and frequency of information on employment. In addition, a Committee under Dr. T.C.A. Anant, former Chief Statistician of India, is also examining various approaches with a view to reducing redundancy and avoiding duplication of efforts in estimation of employment through the establishment approach. With the availability of results of the Periodic Labour Force Survey, India should be meeting the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) for releasing quarterly data on macro-economic indicators which we haves subscribed to. The PLFS will also replace the Annual Employment and Unemployment Survey undertaken by the Labour Bureau.

10. The MoSPIis also planning to launch new surveys for better measurement of the economy in sectors that are growing and contribute to measurement of the economy. Some of these surveys include the Annual Survey of Service Sector Enterprises, the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE), the Time Use Survey (TUS) and the Economic Census. 

11.The MoSPI has also decided to revise the base year of the macroeconomic indicators and aggregates to 2017-18 and is working with other Ministries and State Governments towards aligning the data systems to achieve this. The Ministry remains committed to improving the availability, reliability and quality of information of its various products for measuring various aspects of the economy to meet the requirements of policy making, informed debate and academic research. More details on these aspects are available on the Ministry’s website at www.mospi.gov.in.

                            In its commitment to ensure 100% quality regime in steel sector, Ministry of Steel has issued two Quality Control orders namely Steel and Steel Products (Quality Control) Order, 2018 and Stainless Steel Products (Quality Control) Order, 2018 vide Notification No S.O 2998 (E) and S.O. 2999 (E) respectively dated 20th June 2018.  As a result, 16 more steel products have been brought under the ambit of quality control order. Prior to this, 34 carbon steel products and 3 stainless steel products were notified by the Ministry. In effect, these orders now cover 50 carbon steel and 3 stainless steel products, which have direct bearing on human health and are critical to safety and security of infrastructure, housing, engineering application and public at large. By implementing these orders, around 85-90% of steel and steel products consumed in the country would be covered under Quality Control Orders (QCO).

            Ministry of Steel has decided to cover Tin Plates (IS: 1993), used in food, food additives, drug and medicines, under the mandatory quality control regime and the process is being initiated. Tin plate is largely used in packaging of food and food additives as well as drugs and medicines and beverages besides other non-critical, non-food applications. The Ministry is also considering bringing the remaining steel products under QCO in consultation with stakeholders in a phased manner.

            In terms of the above notification, the notified steel items cannot be produced, sold, traded, imported and stocked unless they bear BIS Mark. Domestic manufacturers of these items have to obtain BIS certification mark licences. Foreign suppliers willing to supply these items to India will have to obtain BIS registration.

            Government of India is concerned about reasonably large production and import of inferior quality of steel getting delivered to important end use segments such as power distribution, human health and safety of infrastructure and construction.

                A Task Force constituted by Steel Ministry is examining the feasibility of setting up steel plants in Andhra Pradesh and Telengana by any interested parties at Bayyaram and Kadapa. The task force comprising of representatives from the Central Government, State Government and Central Public Sector Enterprises under the Ministry of Steel was set up on 19.10.2016 to consider the feasibility issues and prepare a roadmap for setting up of steel plants.

It has held series of meetings since then which were attended by the representatives of the State Governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as well. The last meeting of the Task Force, being sixth in the series of meetings, was held on 12.06.2018. The relevant data for preparation of the feasibility reports based on realistic assumptions is to be shared by the State Governments with MECON (CPSE under Ministry of Steel) entrusted with the task.

Ministry of Steel is making sincere and relentless efforts in working out a feasible solution to make the project financially viable so as to bring about positive and sustainable development of not only Andhra Pradesh and Telangana but also the nation as a whole.

As per the Thirteenth Schedule of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) examined the feasibility of establishing an Integrated Steel Plant in YSR District of Andhra Pradesh and Khammam District of Telangana and submitted its report examining the feasibility of installation of 3 MTPA Integrated Steel Plant in both the States on 02.12.2014.  As per the feasibility report, setting up of steel plant was found prima facie not financially viable.

Union Minister of Steel interacting with MDs/CEOs of major steel producing units in Kalinganagar, Odisha

 

Union Minister of Steel Chaudhary Birender Singh visited Kalinganagar on 12th June, 2018 and interacted with MDs/CEOs of major steel producing units located in the State of Odisha.  In his remarksthe Minister stated that India has become the second largest steel producing country. In the financial year 2017-18, India produced more than 100 million tonnes of steel.  Indian Steel Industry has come out of the difficulties faced during 2014-15 and 2015-16 due to various policy interventions by the Government of India.  National Steel Policy and DMI&SP Policy were notified during 2017 giving direction and fillip to the domestic industry. 

 

Odisha is a major steel producing State contributing more than half of steel production in the country.  It is rich in minerals and mines and has a potential to produce 100 million tonnes of steel out of 300 million tonnes envisaged in National Steel Policy by the year 2030-31.  Kalinganagar is a major industrial hub.  Around 15 steel plants are located in this region which include public sector plants like NINL and private sector plants like TATA Steel, Jindal Stainless Limited, Visa Steel and MESCO.  To achieve the common objective of producing 300 million tonnes by 2030, enhanced production from Kalinganagar and Odisha State is important.  The Minister expressed the hope that Kalinganagarwill develop potential for downstream facilities which include ferro alloy plants, duct iron pipes, steel furniture, power component manufacturing as well as stainless steel units.

 

Industry representatives spoke about increased need for utilizing iron ore fines for pellet manufacturing so that precious iron ore can be preserved.  The Minister discussed in detail the challenges to the growth of Indian Steel Industry, such as logistics in terms of development of ports and increasing capacity of Indian railways, creating dedicated freight corridors to move raw materials as well as finished goods. The Steel Minister expressed confidence that both Central Government and State government together find solutions at policy and operational level to achieve higher level of production in Odisha. 

 

Officers from the Central Government and the State Government were also present in the meeting.

                The Government proposes to set up 3000 Van Dhan Kendras involving 30,000 SHGs across the country under the Van Dhan Scheme of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. In a new game changing initiative, the Prime Minister launched the Van Dhan Scheme of Ministry of Tribal Affairs and TRIFED on 14th April, 2018 during the celebrations of Ambedkar Jayanti at Bijapur Chattisgarh.  Emphasizing the important role of value addition in increasing tribal incomes, the Prime Minister stated that Van Dhan, Jandhan and Goverdhan Schemes had the potential to change the tribal-rural economic system. All these three schemes in tandem need to be promoted for this purpose by the State Governments.

 

Under Van Dhan Scheme, 10 Self Help Groups of 30 Tribal gatherers each have been constituted at Bijapur, Chhattisgarh. They are then trained and provided with working capital to add value to the products, which they collect from the Jungle.  Working under the leadership of Collector, these groups can then market their products not only within the States but also outside the States.   Training and technical support is provided by TRIFED.

 

Van Dhan Mission is an initiative for targeting livelihood generation for tribals by harnessing non-timber forest produces, the true wealth of forest i.e. Van Dhan with an estimated value: Rs.2 Lakh Cr. per year. It shall promote and leverage the collective strength of tribals (through SHGs) to achieve scale. It also aims at build upon the traditional knowledge & skill sets of tribals by adding technology & IT for value addition. Further it is to set-up tribal community owned Van Dhan Vikas Kendras (the Kendra) in predominantly forested tribal districts. A Kendra shall constitute of 10 tribal SHGs, each comprising of upto 30 tribal NTFP gatherers or artisans i.e. about 300 beneficiaries per Kendra.

 

Value addition assumes critical importance in ensuring remunerative prices to the tribals in this approach. Three stage value addition would be the corner stone for enhancing incomes of the tribals under the scheme. The grass root level procurement is proposed to be undertaken through SHGs associated with Implementing Agencies. Convergence and Networking with other Govt. departments/scheme shall be undertaken to utilise the services of existing SHGs like Ajeevika, etc.  These SHGs shall be appropriately trained on sustainable harvesting/collection, primary processing & value addition and be formed into clusters so as to aggregate their stock in tradable quantity and linking them with facility of primary processing in a Van Dhan Vikas Kendra.

 

Talking about the new initiative, the Union Minister for Tribal Affairs, Shri JualOram said that the scheme has a huge potential to empower the tribals.

 

 

The Minister said that convergence with Panchayati Raj is envisaged. Initially, the focus of the scheme will be in aspirational districts and gradually the scheme will be implemented in all tribal areas, Tribal Affairs Minister explained.

                 In a recent review of the ongoing sewage infrastructure projects under Namami Gange programme in Varanasi, Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, Director General of National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has sought fast tracking of the work.  There are two major upcoming STP projects in the city which will together prevent 19 crore litres of sewage water from entering the river once they are complete. Of these, the 140 MLD STP in Dinapur is almost complete, while the 50 MLD STP project in Ramana under Hybrid Annuity Mode is progressing well. One of the most important features of HAM model is that both the Annuity and O&M payments are linked to the performance of the STP. This will ensure continued performance of the assets created due to better accountability, ownership and optimal performance. 

 

The DG also reviewed 10 projects of rehabilitation of old trunk sewer in Varanasi, work on all of which are in the final stages of execution. The rehabilitation work is expected to be complete by October 2018. Apart from the STP works, DG reviewed the cleaning being undertaken on the 84 ghats in the city, spread along an 8.5 km stretch. Activities like sweeping, washing, mopping, collection and transportation of silt, construction and demolition waste, awareness generation and education are conducted as part of this project. As per feedback received from the local population and visitors, 65.4% people have rated this work as Very Good and 33.5% people rated it as Good. DG also took stock of the progress on a project for improvement of 26 bathing ghats in Varanasi, which was sanctioned in January 2018 at a cost of Rs. 11.73 crore. 

A presentation was also made on the JICA assisted Ganga Action Plan projects, including sewerage, non-sewerage and Institutional Development Plan components costing a total of Rs. 641.19 crore, during the review. The components of the non-sewerage project are construction of community toilets, construction of dhobi ghats, ghat improvement etc. Cumulative physical progress of all projects is 87%. The sewerage component projects include construction of relieving trunk sewer lines, procurement and construction of Chaukaghat/Phulwaria pumping stations, design and  construction of 140 MLD STP at Dinapur including 10 years Operation & Maintenance, Condition Assessment and Rehabilitation of Old Trunk Sewers, Renovation/Rehabilitation works at Konia Pumping Station, Bhagwanpur and Dinapur STP and 5 ghat pumping stations.

                In the run-up to the upcoming Kumbh Mela 2019 in Allahabad, the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) in its 13th Executive Committee meeting held today,  approved two projects for community toilets and procurement of dustbins at an estimated cost of Rs. 113 crore and Rs. 3.6 crore respectively . More than 12 crore people are expected to attend the Mela and NMCG is committed to ensuring that pollutants are not dumped into river Ganga .

The first project includes setting up of 27,500 community FRP toilets (with septic tank) and pre-fabricated toilets (with septic tanks). Besides this, 20,000 community FRP urinals will also be set up during the Kumbh Mela. 

Another project for deployment of 16000 dustbins for solid waste management in the mela area, along with installation of lining bags in dustbins has been approved during the 13th EC meeting. The projects have been approved keeping in mind the enormous gathering that will take place on the banks of river Ganga for a period of 60-90 days with close to 10 lakh pilgrims stationed in the camps. 

Sewage Infrastructure for Moradabad

One project for the construction of a 25 MLD STP, among other works, in Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh has also been approved at an estimated cost of Rs. 118.69 crore under Hybrid Annuity based PPP mode. The other components of the project are developing Interception & Diversion (I&D) structures for 5 drains, I&D network laying, Sewage Pumping Stations including Operation and Maintenance for 15 years etc. Moradabad is situated on the banks of Ram Ganga, a tributary of River Ganga. Moradabad is an important industrial city, mainly famous for manufacturing of brassware. People from all over the world come to the city for business purposes. Most of the population of the city depends upon cottage industry related with brassware. The project approved under Namami Gange programme is important as the Moradabad city has an old underground sewer network of a total length of 44 km, which does not cover the entire city. Only 6% of the households in the city are connected to the sewer lines which, too, have completed their term of usability and are not in a good condition. This project has been approved to take care of the existing sewerage problems in the town and take care of the resultant sewage pollution in the Ram Ganga. 

Ghat Cleaning

After the success of the ghat cleaning project in Varanasi, two more ghat cleaning projects in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand at an estimated cost of Rs. 14.26 crore and Rs. 15.90 crore respectively were approved in the 13th EC meeting of NMCG. The Uttar Pradesh project is for four towns– Bithoor, Kanpur, Allahabad and Mathura-Vrindavan.  

In Uttar Pradesh, the project includes cleaning of 94 ghats in four towns (Bithoor-19; Kanpur – 27;Allahabad – 21; Mathura – Vrindavan – 27) for a period of 3 years. Besides, the project also includes providing of dustbins in sufficient numbers to ensure cleanliness of the ghats. These towns are major towns along river Ganga in Uttar Pradesh from thereligious and visitor footfall perspective. 

In Uttarakhand, the project includes cleaning of 72 ghats (18 major Ghats and 54 other Ghats) of Haridwar through manual and mechanized equipments such as scrubber, jetting machines, dustbin, mobile vans etc. for a period of 3 years. Haridwar is an ancient city and municipality in Haridwar district of Uttarakhand with a population of 2,31,338. In addition, the city has an average of 1.6 lakh floating population which makes it an important city for the Namami Gange programme.

Cultivation of Medicinal Plants

A project for the promotion of cultivation of medicinal plants indigenous to the Ganga Basin,along the River Ganga in Uttar Pradesh has been approved at an estimated cost of Rs. 35.46 crore for two years. The project that spans 8 districts and 40 blocks of Uttar Pradesh envisages covering an area of 2,500 hectare. The number of farmers expected to be benefited from the project is about 7,800. So far, 8 species of medicinal plants have been identified which will be planted during the project. These are Vach, Kalmegh, Shatavari, Tulsi, Arjuna, Khas-Khas grass, Bel and Sarpgandha. The expected outcomes of the project are improved soil health, reduction in water pollution, livelihood and increase in farmers income through diversification for high value medicinal plants.   

Training of the Ganga Mitras

In an attempt to develop a self-sufficient cadre for the Clean Ganga Mission at the grass roots level, one pilot project for training of the Ganga Mitras entitled “Eco-Skills and Capacity Building Training Programme for Ganga Mitras (Task Force at Grass Root Level) has been approved at an estimated cost of Rs. 63.07 lakh. Once trained, the main task of Ganga Mitras will be to promote eco-tourism, spread public awareness among school children in particular and local people in general, develop green belts in their localities etc. The Ganga Mitras will be trained in specialized water testing, sources of pollution and adverse impact of pollution onHealth etc.The nomenclature of the Ganga Mitras is also used by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) who has trained some local people. The development of Ganga Mitras by NMCG will be an addition to the WWF efforts.

                The India Meteorological Department has forecast heavy to very heavy rains for the next three days in Gujarat region – that is from today to the 28th of June, and heavy to very heavy rains for this entire week in Konkan and Goa, Coastal Karnataka, West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura

Due to this warning, there is likelihood of rise in water levels in various river basins. The likely impact of these rains as inferred from rainfall runoff model run for 3 days advisory forecast is detailed as under: 

Damanganga Basin - Rapid rise in water level in Damanganga basin in the districts of Nasik in Maharashtra, Valsad in Gujarat and Daman in UT of Daman and Diu during the next 48 hours. Since the level in Madhuban Dam in Valsad district of Gujarat is low, there will be good inflows increasing the water level and storage in the reservoir

Mumbai - Due to very heavy rainfall forecast with isolated extremely heavy rainfall in North Konkan on 26th June, there is likelihood of urban flooding and associated inundation in view of the high tides associated with severe monsoon conditions.

West Flowing Rivers Basin - Rivers having source in Western Ghats and flowing into Arabian Sea may witness flash floods in association with the forecast rainfall during the next 5 days. Necessary precautions in the old bridges along the highways and along the Konkan Railway routes needs be taken as flow may increase suddenly along the course of these rivers in districts of Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg in Maharashtra, Goa, Uttara Kannada, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada Districts of Karnataka.

 

Krishna Basin - River Krishna and its tributaries are likely to rise in upstream districts of Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Pune, Sholapur districts in Maharashtra. Since most of the dams in Krishna Basin are having very low storage, the inflows into Dams in Maharashtra may increase with the forecasted rainfall. 

Brahmaputra Basin - River Teesta and its tributaries are likely to rise in the districts of Jalpaiguri and Coochbehar in West Bengal and in Sikkim. Necessary precautions need to be taken in these rivers in Sikkim and West Bengal. In view of  the forecast rainfall in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam in the districts of Siang, East and West Kameng, Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Jorhat, Sonitpur, Barpeta, Chirang, Goalpara, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, South Salmara and  Dhubri districts, strict vigil along the rivers in these districts have to be maintained for the next 3 to 5 days.

 

Barak Basin - River Barak and its tributaries in Cachar, Hailakhandi and Karimgunj district of Assam and rivers Manu, Gumti, Haora and their tributaries in Tripura are also likely to rise depending on the intensity of rainfall.

Addressing the gathering, Shri U.P. Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation said: “Cleaning of tributaries of River Ganga is also the mandate of Namami Gange programme and projects on Rivers like Yamuna are being taken up.” Speaking on the relationship between River Cleaning and Water Conservation, Shri Singh added: “Steps like recharge of groundwater, rejuvenation of water bodies etc. are important for River Rejuvenation and should be worked upon.” 

DG, NMCG Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra informed the gathering about the MoU which has been signed between NMCG and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL) for reuse of treated waste water in Mathura, a town on River Yamuna where project under Hybrid Annuity mode has been taken up. Stressing on the need to promote reuse of treated waste water Shri Mishra added that such partnerships are the need-of-the-hour and that NMCG has also signed MoUs with railway and power ministries for reuse of treated waste water. NMCG offered to provide technical support in developing projects on the line of “One-City-One-Operator” under Hybrid Annuity-PPP mode. 

During the workshop, a need to focus on preparing a comprehensive database on towns and villages along River Yamuna was stressed upon.  Yamuna Nagar, Karnal, Panipat, Sonipat and Faridabad are some of the major towns along River Yamuna in Haryana. 

Under Namami Gange programme, two interventions have already been made for two projects in Panipat and Sonipat sanctioned at a cost of Rs. 217.87 crore for creation of 70 MLD STP capacity and rehabilitation of 75 MLD STP capacity. 

Some of the topics which were discussed during the workshop are “Suitable technologies available for treatment of waste water flowing in drains”, “Using Micro-Irrigation technology and use of wastewater for irrigation”, “Adaptability of various treatment technologies with respect to treatment of waste water entering River Yamuna” etc.

                  Following is the Text of speech delivered by Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation in the “Conference on International Decade for Action: Water for Sustainable Development 2018-28” held at Dushanbe, Tajikistan:-

Tajikistan has taken a leading role to get the theme of water at the centre of global Sustainable Development Goals for the coming decade. I am thankful to the President and the Government of Tajikistan for organizing the High Level International Conference as part of the International Decade for Action “Water for Sustainable Development, 2018-2028”. The topic chosen for this present Conference, “Promoting Action and Policy Dialogue on Water for Sustainable Development” is extremely relevant today, especially in the light of climate change. This Conference will go a long way in the development of common understanding and international dialogue on water, promote national, regional and international action on integrated and sustainable water resources management worldwide.
 Water is a cross cutting element of sustainable development and for poverty eradication. It  is key to food, energy and health security, and therefore it is not surprising  that water is  covered under many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  including SDG 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13 and 14 . There is enough water in the world, but many people do not have access to it due to problems of water management. Sanitation remains a major issue. Further, demography, pollution and urbanization are putting additional challenges on management of water.  I believe that political will is extremely essential for water governance, finance and education. The key to promote sustainable water management and to explore synergies with other water related aspects of the SDGs calls for  cooperation at all levels across all sectors and stakeholders including the sharing of knowledge, experiences, innovations and solutions.

The Government of India clearly sees sustainable water as a vital input for sustainable development.  India has taken significant steps during the last 4 years and made sustainable development of water as one of the top priorities of the Government of India and I will be failing in my duty if I don’t mention few of these initiatives.

In the field of resource assessment, India is in the process of upgrading its water resources information and management system for scientific development, conservation, and conjoint use of our ground and surface water resources.  The National Water Information Centre (NWIC) is a modern platform for assessment of surface water and ground water, flood forecasting, reservoir monitoring, coastal information management system and river basin management. India has launched an ambitious  national  project on aquifer management (NAQUIM)  to  completely  map 2 million sq. km. of the map-able area of the country. The mapping is followed by proper aquifer management plan. 

In the field of river rejuvenation, the Namami Gange is our flagship programme to rejuvenate and make river Ganga pollution free.  We are also taking similar steps to rejuvenate other rivers to bring them to their pristine form. To increase our food grain production, India is committed to bring more areas under assured irrigation.  My Government has launched a flagship programme of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna-PMKSY (Prime Ministers Irrigation Project) whereby we will complete 99 large irrigation projects till December, 2019 and thereby create additional irrigation potential of 7.62 million hectares. The other important objective of this programme is  “Har Khet ko Pani” or provide water to every field by extending command area development & undertaking water management  works.  The other objective of PMKSY is to ensure ‘More Crop Per Drop’, through promotion of micro and drip irrigation and ensuring better water efficiency. We are also settling outstanding issues on the international rivers with our neighbouring countries and within the country, on the inter-state rivers. 

 In the field of drinking water, my Government is undertaking National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) with the objective of providing adequate safe water for drinking, cooking and other domestic basic needs on sustainable basis through creation of infrastructure. The Government of India plans to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030. Another flagship programme of my Government is Swachh Bharat Mission, which is being executed in both urban and rural areas of India, with focus on safe sanitation and aim to achieve universal sanitation coverage. This program in rural areas shall improve the level of cleanliness, solid and liquid waste management activities and make villages open defecation free (ODF), clean and sanitized. In the urban areas, Swachh Bharat Mission targets construction of 6.6 million individual house hold toilets, 0.25 million community toilets and 0.26 million public toilets.  Besides, the programme aims to achieve 100% door to door collection and scientific management of municipal waste.

To mitigate against floods and droughts and to make the country water secure, my Government is committed to implement the programme for inter basin transfer of water, through the program of inter-linking of rivers.  We have identified 30 such priority links to be undertaken which would add 35 million hectares of irrigated area and produce 35 GW of additional power.  Under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, water conservation and water harvesting works are being undertaken by digging wells, ponds and repairing of traditional water bodies, reservoirs and canals.  India is spending about USD 5 billion on water conservation across the country in around 100,000 villages.  

In conclusion, my Government is taking steps for development and management of water resources in sustainable manner through improved water assessment, equitable resource allocation, improved efficiency, pollution abatement, conservation and water harvesting and providing safe sanitation.

                The Union Cabinet,in its meeting chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on 13.6.18,  approved the proposal for introduction of Dam Safety Bill, 2018 in the Parliament. The objective of this Bill is to help develop uniform, countrywide procedures for ensuring the safety of dams.

Over the last fifty years, India has invested substantially in dams and related infrastructures, and ranks third after USA and China in the number of  large dams. 5254 large dams are in operation in the countrycurrently and another 447 are under construction .In addition to this, there are thousands of medium and small dams.

While dams have played a key role in fostering rapid and sustained agricultural growth and development in India, therehas been a long felt need for a uniform law and administrative structure in the country for ensuring dam safety. The Central Water Commission, through the National Committee on Dam Safety (NCDS), Central Dam Safety Organization (CDSO) and State Dam Safety Organizations (SDSO) has been making constant endeavours in this direction, but these organizationsdo not have any statutory powers and are only advisory in nature. 

This can be a matter of concern, especially since   about 75 percent of the large dams in India are more than 25 years old and about 164 dams are more than 100 years old..A badly maintained,  unsafe dam can be a hazard to human life, flora and fauna, public and private assets and the environment. India has had 36 dam failures in the past – 11 in Rajasthan, 10 in Madhya Pradesh, 5 in Gujarat, 4 in Maharashtra, 2 in Andhra Pradesh and one each in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu and Odisha. 

The provisions of the Dam Safety Bill 2018 will empower the dam safety institutional set-ups in both the Centre and States and will also help in standardizing and improving dam safety practices across the country. The Dam Safety Bill, 2018 addresses all issues concerning dam safety including regular inspection of dams, Emergency Action Plan, comprehensive dam safety review, adequate repair and maintenance funds for dam safety, Instrumentation and Safety Manuals. It lays the onus of dam safety on the dam owner and provides for penal provisions for commission and omission of certain acts.

INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 

The institutional framework for dam safety as provided under the dam safety bill 2018 includes the following:

National Committee on Dam Safety(NCDS)

The Bill provides for constitution of a National Committee on Dam Safety which shall evolve dam safety policies and recommend necessary regulations as may be required for the purpose.

 

National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA)

The Bill provides for establishment of National Dam Safety Authority as a regulatory body which shall discharge functions to implement the policy, guidelines and standards for dam safety in the country.


	It shall maintain liaison with the State Dam Safety Organisations and the owners of dams for standardisation of dam safety related data and practices;
	It shall provide the technical and managerial assistance to the States and State Dam Safety Organisations;
	It shall maintain a national level data-base of all dams in the country and the records of major dam failures;

	Further, in certain cases, such as dams of one State falling under the territory of another State, the National Authority shall also perform the role of State Dam Safety Organization thereby eliminating potential causes for inter-state conflicts.


State Committee on Dam Safety (SCDS)

The Bill provides for constitution of a State Committee on Dam Safety by State Government. It will ensure proper surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of all specified dams in that State and ensure their safe functioning. It further provides that every State shall establish a ""State Dam Safety Organisation"", which will be manned by officers from the field dam safety preferably from the areas of dam-designs, hydro-mechanical engineering, hydrology, geo-technical investigation, instrumentation and dam-rehabilitation.

State Dam Safety Organization (SDSO)

The Bill provides that every state having specified number of dams will establish a State Dam Safety Organization which will be manned by officials with sufficient experience in the field of dam safety. 

DUTIES AND FUNCTIONS 

The Bill lays down that all specified dams will fall under jurisdiction of the SDSO of the State in which the dam is situated; For specified dams owned by CPSUs or where a dam is extended in two or more states or where a dam owned by one state is situated in other state, NDSA shall be construed as SDSO. 

For all dams under their jurisdiction, the State Dam Safety Organizations will be required to

                Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has expressed hope that collaboration with Google will help in effective flood management in India. Central Water Commission (CWC), India’s apex technical organization in the field of Water Resources, has entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Google. CWC would use state-of-the-art advances made by Google in the in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and geo spatial mapping for effective management of water resources particularly in the field of flood forecasting and dissemination of flood related information to the masses widely using the dissemination platforms developed by Google. This initiative is likely to help crisis management agencies to deal extreme hydrological events   in a better manner. 

Under this Agreement, CWC and Google will share technical expertise in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, geospatial mapping and analysis of hydrological observation data to collaborate on (i) improving flood prediction systems, which will help provide location-targeted, actionable flood warnings,  (ii)  high priority research project utilizing Google Earth Engine to help visualize and improve flood management and (iii) a cultural project to build online exhibitions on the Rivers of India .

The Ministry had earlier launched an ambitious programme ‘National Hydrology Project’ (NHP) during the year 2016-17. NHP is a World Bank assisted central sector scheme with pan India coverage. The objective of National Hydrology Project is to improve the extent, quality, and accessibility of water resources information, decision support system for floods and basin level resource assessment/planning and to strengthen the capacity of targeted water resources professionals and management institutions in India.

The initiative on flood forecasting is likely to meet the much awaited demand of the inhabitants of the flood prone areas for inundation warnings with sufficient lead time. Till 2016, CWC was disseminating flood levels with maximum lead time  of one day. During the flood season of 2017, CWC resorted to rainfall based modelling and issued flood advisories on trial basis with 3 days lead time.  Under collaborative arrangement, Google would use high resolution Digital Elevation Model and vast computational resources and its expertise in the field of Artificial Intelligence to generate flood inundation maps utilising the level forecast input provided by CWC. The information in the form of likely extent and depth of inundation would be disseminated with a lead time of up to 3 days. For the flood season of 2018, inundation forecasting would be done on trial basis and the same would be up scaled in near future. The collaborative arrangement is likely to result in saving of crore of rupees which otherwise would have to be spent by the government  on acquiring high resolution DEM, high end computational resources and developing dissemination platforms widely used by the masses.  This would enable the Government as well as disaster management organisations to identify well in advance the locations and population, which are at risk from floods and require warnings and information. This collaborative initiative is expected to be a milestone in flood management and in mitigating the flood losses.

                Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Shipping, Road Transport & Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari released a book ‘Water productivity mapping of major Indian crops’ published by NABARD in a function at New Delhi today.

Addressing the gathering Shri Gadkari said that there is no scarcity of water in the country but we have to improve upon the planning and management of water resources. Our Ministry and Government is thinking about innovative ways for better management of water resources. Proposal for three projects at Tuticorin, Paradip and Kandla are under consideration where sea water can be desalinised and used for irrigation and other works. 

He further said that we are in a process to encourage pipelines in place of long canals.  Piped and drip irrigation will definitely conserve water. We are committed for the vision of ‘Har Khet Ko Pani’ and ‘Per Drop More Drop’. He also stressed on the need of water testing like soil testing before cultivating any crop. This will improve crop yield and avoid wastage of water also.

Secretary Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri U.P. Singh emphasized on the need of short term measures also for water conservation. He said that perforated Borings should be used for quick recharge and storage for underground water. 

The book ‘Water productivity mapping of major Indian crops’ is based on study of 10 important crops by a team under the leadership of leading agricultural economist Dr. Ashok Gulati. The ten    important crops include rice, wheat, maize, pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton and potato etc. The book suggests to realign cropping pattern keeping in view water scarcity of irrigation, ration irrigation supplies in canal irrigation system, improve micro-irrigation and invest in water harvesting and artificial recharge and encourage participatory irrigation management through water user association and farmer’s producer organisation. Secretary Ministry of Agriculture Shri S.K. Pattanayak and NABARD Chairman Dr Harsh Kumar Bhanwala also spoke on the occasion.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for introduction of Dam Safety Bill, 2018 in the Parliament.

Benefits:

          It will help all the States and Union Territories of India to adopt uniform dam safety procedures which shall ensure safety of dams and safeguard benefits from such dams. This shall also help in safeguarding human life, livestock and property.

The draft Bill has been finalised after wide consultation with leading Indian experts and international experts.

Details:


	The Bill provides for proper surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of all specified dams in the country to ensure their safe functioning. 
	The Bill provides for constitution of a National Committee on Dam Safety which shall evolve dam safety policies and recommend necessary regulations as may be required for the purpose. 
	The Bill provides for establishment of National Dam Safety Authority as a regulatory body which shall discharge functions to implement the policy, guidelines and standards for dam safety in the country.
	The Bill provides for constitution of a State Committee on Dam Safety by State Government.


 

National Dam Safety Authority


	It shall maintain liaison with the State Dam Safety Organisations and the owners of dams for standardisation of dam safety related data and practices;
	It shall provide the technical and managerial assistance to the States and State Dam Safety Organisations; 
	It shall maintain a national level data-base of all dams in the country and the records of major dam failures; 
	It shall examine the cause of any major dam failure; 
	It shall publish and update the standard guidelines and check-lists for the routine inspection and detailed investigations of dams and appurtenances;
	It shall accord recognition or accreditations to the organisations that can be entrusted with the works of investigation, design or construction of new dams; 
	It will also look into unresolved points of issue between the State Dam Safety Organisation of two states, or between the State Dam Safety Organisation of a State and the owner of a dam in that State, for proper solution; 
	Further, in certain cases, such as dams of one State falling under the territory of another State, the National Authority shall also perform the role of State Dam Safety Organization thereby eliminating potential causes for inter-state conflicts.


 

State Committee on Dam Safety

It will ensure proper surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of all specified dams in that State and ensure their safe functioning. It further provides that every State shall establish a ""State Dam Safety Organisation"", which will be manned by officers from the field dam safety preferably from the areas of dam-designs, hydro-mechanical engineering, hydrology, geo-technical investigation, instrumentation and dam-rehabilitation.

Background:

There are over 5200 large dams in India and about 450 are under construction. Plus there are thousands of medium and small dams. Due to lack of legal and institutional architecture for dam safety in India, dam safety is an issue of concern. Unsafe dams are a hazard and dam break may cause disasters, leading to huge loss of life and property.

The Dam Safety Bill, 2018 address all issues concerning dam safety including regular inspection of dams, Emergency Action Plan, comprehensive dam safety review, adequate repair and maintenance funds for dam safety, Instrumentation and Safety Manuals. It lays onus of dam safety on the dam owner and provides for penal provisions for commission and omission of certain acts.

                Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Shipping, Road Transport & Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari, presided over the signing of a tripartite Concession Agreement between National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), UP Jal Nigam and Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd. for developing an Integrated Sewage Infrastructure for Mathura on the Hybrid Annuity-based PPP mode, in New Delhi today. Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, the Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas and Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, MoSfor Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Dr. Satya Pal Singh and MoS for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and Parliamentary Affairs Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal were also present on the occasion. 

 

An agreementwas also signed between NMCG and Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) for the reuse of 2 crore litres per day of treated sewage water by IOCL’s refinery  in Mathura, which has so far been using water from the over stressed Yamuna.  

 

The Mathura sewage project is special in three respects. This is the country’s first Integrated Sewage Infrastructure project based on One City – One-Operator concept, which means that  the project integrates building of new STPs and maintenance of the existing infrastructure under one operator for the whole city. Secondly, under this  project the treated sewage water is going to be reused by IOCL , and thirdly, the project is based on  Hybrid Annuity Mode, the third of this kind in this sector after the HAM based STPs being developed in Haridwar and Varanasi. 

 

The components of the Mathura project include  construction, operation, and maintenance of  a 30 MLD STP in Masani, the work for which has been awarded to the Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd. at an estimated cost of Rs. 437.95 crore on Hybrid Annuity Mode.Other components of the project include development and rehabilitation of Masani Sewerage Infrastructure, upgradation and rehabilitation of the existing Masani STP with a capacity of 6.8 MLD, upgradation and rehabilitation of two existing STPs (14.5 MLD and 16 MLD) in the Trans-Yamuna region of Mathura, leading to a total sewage treatment capacity of 67.3 MLD.  

 

A 20 MLD Tertiary Treatment Plant (TTP) will also be set up for the  supply of  treated wastewater to Mathura refinery of IOCL. The cost for the development and operation of the TTP for 15 years is Rs. 162.38 crore. IOCL will bear the entire operations and maintenance cost of the TTP amounting to Rs. 82.38 crore for a period of 15 years. Over and above this, IOCL will pay Rs. 8.70 per kilo litre towards the partial capital cost for the development of the TTP. This  will save 2 crore litres per day in the water-stressed Yamuna river which was earlier being used by IOCL. This will also promote the market for recycle/reuse of treated waste water in India, which will further help in sustaining the operation of the infrastructure created, a need-of-the-hour in the sewage sector. 

 

Speaking on the occasion Shri Nitin Gadkari expressed happiness that his Ministry and IOCL had taken this important step forward in creation of wealth from waste.  He said this step would not only help in abating pollution, but would also bolster the economy . He said that  in another example of waste to wealth , Power Ministry is making it  mandatory for the power plants along  Ganga to use treated waste water. He also said that he is trying to get the Railways to use treated waste water to wash their wagons .

 

Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said that ""I am happy that Water Ministry and IOCL have collaborated for the cause of Ganga rejuvenation and I assure that all support will be extended from Petroleum Ministry and IOCL for future projects."" Shri Pradhan also said that similar Waste-to-Wealth projects will be taken up in important towns along Ganga like Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna, Haridwar etc. Referring to how the Ganga Rejuvenation project can synergize with Skill Development, Shri Pradhan added that such projects will not only clean the river but will also create employment opportunities. 

 

Shri Gadkari reiterated his commitment to clean Ganga as also his priority for  Yamuna and other tributaries for which many steps have been taken. Giving details of the projects on Yamuna and other tributaries he said that 14 projects are going on. These include 10 in Delhi, 2 in Uttar Pradesh and 2 in Haryana – at Sonipat and Panipat. In addition 20 new towns on Yamuna and its tributaries (Hindon and Kali) have been identified for pollution abatement. 8 of these towns are on Yamuna (Kalpi, Loni, Auriya, Kairana, Etawa, Bagpat, Tundla and Firozabad), 4 on Hindon (Saharanpur, Muazaffarnagar, Khora and Muradnagar) and 6 on Kali river (Meerut, Hapur, Deoband, Modinagar, Budhana and Autrauli). He said that six sewerage management projects in Delhi have been awarded and two are under tendering for Yamuna.  

 

He also added: ""It is my vision to develop a world class ecological and environment friendly River Front park on 35km stretch of river Yamuna in Delhi."" 

 

The Minister also extended his satisfaction at the performance of the STP at  Sisamau drain in Kanpur which is one of the biggest sources of pollution of  Ganga. Shri Gadkarisaid  that 140 MLD of waste water was flowing into Ganga from this drain out of which 80 MLD has been tapped and it is being diverted to STPs for treatment. Very soon the remaining 60 MLD untreated water will also be tapped and no sewage water from Sisamau drain will go into river Ganga. He also mentioned that one STP for Ayodhya has been sanctioned and we have begun the process of cleaning river Saryu. Referring to the industrial pollution, Minister said that strict action will be taken against anyone who is polluting Ganga and its tributaries. 

 

The Hybrid Annuity model marks a paradigm shift in the sewerage sector. An  important feature of HAM  is that both the Annuity and Operation and Maintenance payments are linked to the performance of the STP, which was not the case earlier when the projects were implemented under EPC or DBOT mode.  This would ensure continued performance of the sewage infrastructure assets created due to better accountability, ownership and optimal performance. More sewage treatment projects under Hybrid Annuity mode (HAM) are to be awarded soon. The upcoming projects which are at various levels of implementation under HAM are STPs at Naini, Jhusi, and Phaphamau at Allahabad (72 MLD), STPs at Unnao, Shuklaganj, and Bithoor along with Kanpur (21.4 MLD), STPs at Digha and Kankarbagh in Bihar (150), STPs at Kolkata and Howrah (141 MLD) STPs at Farukhabad (30 MLD), STP at Bhagalpur (65 MLD).  

 

In a bid to use the extensive Yes Bank network across India, Namami Gange has partnered with Yes Bank for display of Clean Ganga messages on their ATMs and branches. This is a first-of-its-kind initiative by NMCG to have partnered with the banking set-up to reach out to people at large through the bank’s extensive reach to engage them in the Clean Ganga Mission. Yes Bank has more than 1,700 ATMs across the country and a good number of them are in the Ganga basin. Country-wide, Yes Bank has 40 branches on which Namami Gange messages will be displayed through an arch on the main entry of the each branch.

The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) had organized a photo contest on social media platforms during the ‘Ganga Swachhta Pakhwada’ 2018 which was observed from 16th March to 31st March 2018. On social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, more than 1900 entries were received from across the country. Some of the entries were of a very high quality and depicted various facets of the Ganga. Shri Gadkari felicitated the winners of the contest who are from various walks of life and different parts of the country.

                The water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on June 07, 2018 was 26.742 BCM which is 17% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs. This percentage was at the same level for the week ending on May 31, 2018. The level of water storage in the week ending on June 07, 2018 was 83% of the storage of corresponding period of last year and 89% of storage of average of last ten years. 

 

The total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 161.993 BCM which is about 63% of the total storage capacity of 257.812 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. 37 Reservoirs out of these 91 have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW.

                Rainfall Forecast issued by India Meteorological Department todayindicate that Heavy to Very Heavy rainfall is likely at a few places with extremely heavy fall at isolated places over Konkan and Goa, Madhya Maharashtra during June 07 to 12, 2018. Heavy to Very Heavy rainfall is also likely to occur over Coastal Karnataka tomorrow and throughout Karnataka during 9June to June 11, 2018. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is also likely to occur at isolated places over Kerala during June 09 to  June 10, 2018.          

Due to this warning, there is likelihood of rise in water levels in various river basins such as West Flowing rivers Between Tapi and Tadri, Godavari and its tributaries near the west coast, Krishna and its tributaries near west coast, Cauvery and its tributaries near west coast as well as in West flowing rivers between Tadri and Kanyakumari.

Due to the forecast of very heavy rains in and around Mumbai and advance of Southwest monsoon causing tidal waves, there is likelihood of inundation in some of the heavy rainfall affected urban areas of Mumbai City. Rivers having source in Western Ghats and flowing into Arabian Sea may witness flash floods in association with the forecasted rainfall. Since most of the rivers are dry, necessary precautions to control the activities along the river bed may be taken as flow may increase suddenlydrowning men and materials.

Due to the expected rainfall, River Damanganga and its tributaries are expected to rise in Nasik district of Maharashtra, Valsad district of Gujarat and Daman district in Daman and Diu Union Territory.Since most of the rivers are dry, necessary precautions to control the activities along the river bed may be taken as flow may increase suddenly drowning men and materials.

River Godavari is likely to rise in Upstream reaches in district of Nasik, Ahmednagar and Aurangabad district. Since almost all the dams are in very low level, this rain may give inflows into various upstream reservoirs. River Krishna and its tributaries are likely to rise in upstream districts of Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Pune, Sholapur in Maharashtra as well as in Bagalkote, Vijayapura and Kalaburagi districts on Krishna and in Chikmagaluru, Shivamogga and Bellari districts on river Tungabhadra in Karnataka. Since almost all the dams are in very low level, this rain may give inflows into various upstream reservoirs. 

Rivers flowing West into Arabian Sea south of Tapi in Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka are also likely to rise and inundate areas in Raigad, Thane, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts of Maharashtra and in Uttara Kannada, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts in Karnataka. Traffic along the old road and rail bridges in Konkan Railway along these river reaches have to be regulated accordingly.

River Cauvery and its tributaries in upstream reaches in Kodagu, Chikmagaluru, Hassan and Mysuru districts of Karnataka and Wynad district of Kerala are likely to rise in association with the forecasted rainfall. However, as the dams in the basins have sufficient storageand hence the expected rainfall may give some inflows into these reservoirs depending on the severity of the rainfall.

                The World Bank has approved Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABHY), a Rs.6000 crore  Central Sector Scheme of the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development  and Ganga Rejuvenation. The scheme is  to be implemented over a period of five years from 2018-19 to 2022-23, with World Bank assistance. The scheme proposal has already been recommended by the Expenditure Finance Committee and the  Ministry will  be seeking Cabinet approval for the project shortly.

 

Atal Bhujal Yojana has been formulated by the Ministry to address the  criticality of ground water resources in a major part of the country. The scheme aims to  improve ground water management in priority areas in the country through community participation.  The priority areas identified under the scheme fall in the states of  Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. These States  represent about 25% of the total number of over-exploited, critical and semi-critical blocks in terms of ground water in India.  They also cover two major types of groundwater systems found in India - alluvial and hard rock aquifers- and have  varying degrees of institutional readiness and experience in groundwater management. 

 

Funds under the scheme will be provided to the states for strengthening the institutions responsible for ground water governance, as well as for encouraging community involvement for improving ground water management to foster behavioural changes that promote conservation and efficient use of water. The scheme will also facilitate convergence of ongoing Government schemes in the states by incentivizing their focussed implementation in identified priority areas. Implementation of the scheme is expected to benefit nearly 8350 Gram Panchayats in 78 districts in these states. Funds under the scheme will be made available to the participating states as Grants.

 

Ensuring active community participation in groundwater management is among the major objectives of the scheme. The scheme envisages active participation of the communities in various activities such as formation of Water User Associations, monitoring and disseminating ground water data, water budgeting, preparation and implementation of Gram-Panchayat wise water security plans and IEC activities related to sustainable ground water management. Community participation is also expected to facilitate bottom-up groundwater planning process to improve the effectiveness of public financing and align implementation of various government programs on groundwater in the participating s0tates.

 

The implementation of the scheme is expected to have several positive outcomes like better understanding of the ground water regime, focused and integrated community based approach for addressing issues related to ground water depletion, sustainable ground water management through convergence of on-going and new schemes, adoption of efficient water use practices to reduce ground water use for irrigation and augmentation of ground water resources in targeted areas.

                On the occasion of the World Environment Day 2018, the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) today organised a workshop on “Collaboration for Ganga Rejuvenation” that witnessed participation from several foreign dignitaries who appreciated the efforts being made under the Namami Gange programme. 

H.E. Tomasz Kozlowski, Ambassador, Delegation of the European Union to India, H.E. Jan Luykx. Ambassador of Belgium, H.E. Micheal A. N. N. Oquaye, High Commissioner of the Republic of Ghana, Ms. Alich Bak, Head of Chancery, Republic of Gambia and Ms. Adva Vilchinski, Political Advisor to the Embassy of Israel graced the occasion. Representatives from the Netherlands, Norway, Germany (GIZ), New Zealand, Hungary and Australia were also present at the workshop.  

Delivering the inaugural address, the Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri U.P. Singh said: “Ganga cleaning means different things to different people. It is a complex issue and a herculean task. We will have to go beyond making STPs and CETPs, which the government is already doing, to bring about attitudinal and behavioural change.” 

Ambassador Tomasz Kozlowski said: “I am impressed that so many things have already been done in the Clean Ganga project and a lot of progress has been made.” He added that a work plan is ready for 9 priority areas on which EU will cooperate with India and the approach now is to be result-oriented. Mr Kozlowski also talked about the experience of the EU on the Legal Framework for Water Management which could be helpful for India. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between India and the EU in 2016 that envisages strengthening the technological, scientific and management capabilities of India and the European Union in the field of water management on the basis of equality, reciprocity and mutual benefit. 

Ambassador Jan Luykx stressed on the need for  “integrated solutions” to the issue of water management and extended all his support by offering to share best practices in Belgium in providing safe drinking water and waste water management.  Ambassador Micheal Oquaye said: “Ghana has water bodies as big as River Ganga and we would like India to share with us the technological and financial models they are using for rejuvenation of Ganga.” 

Ms. Adva Vilchinski from the Israel Embassy shared with the gathering the struggle their country faced due to water scarcity. She also talked about the Indo-Israel Joint Working Group on Water Management which is working closely. An Israeli delegation will be visiting India this month to interact with officials of NMCG on ways to take the cooperation forward. Ms. Birgit Vogel, Water Expert, GIZ gave a presentation on Hot Spots in Ganga River Basin during the workshop. 

Acknowledging that it is great beginning by NMCG to reuse treated water in their Mathura project, Ms. Annelieke Laninva from Water Resources Group stressed on the need to develop a market mechanism for resource recovery and create a water market.

DG, NMCG Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra gave an overview of the Namami Gange programme and talked about the paradigm shift that has been brought about by the use of the Hybrid Annuity model in the waste water sector by NMCG. The Ganga Action Plan (GAP-I) was started in 1986 but what is new in the Namami Gange programme is that an integrated approach is being adopted which is yielding positive results.” 

Explaining in detail the Hybrid Annuity model, ED (Projects), NMCG, Mr. Hitesh Kumar S. Makwana said that NMCG has gone a step ahead and has now tied up with Indian Oil Corporation for reuse of treated sewage water in Mathura. 

Professor Vinod Tare, Founding Head, Centre for Ganga River Basin Management and Studies also addressed the gathering on the mandate and role of C-Ganga in preparing the main plan document for River Rejuvenation.

                A new grassroot-level volunteer workforce is out there to protect the bio-diversity of river Ganga called Ganga Praharis. A group of 427 trained volunteers are reaching to each and every house in areas along river Ganga to educate them about the importance of protecting river’s bio-diversity. They are spread over Ganga basin states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal.

 

Roped-in by Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun as part of the “Biodiversity Conservation and Ganga Rejuvenation” project being sponsored by National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) under the aegis of the Namami Gange programme, these Ganga Praharis are well trained in ecological monitoring of Ganga aqua life, plantation techniques, awareness creation and community mobilization. They were trained through a series of national, state and site level workshops in diverse skills such as ecological surveys, rescue and rehabilitation of aquatic species, awareness meetings, social interactions and green livelihood skills.

 

The Ganga Praharis will be linked to various local environmental authorities, non-governmental stakeholders in their respective states and various other national, academic and research institutions for their capacity development.

 

Not only do these Ganga Praharis performing the task of conserving the deteriorating biodiversity of river Ganga, they are also motivating other people to spread the clean Ganga message, thus, contributing in making clean Ganga mission a mass movement.

 

The Ganga Praharis will be the role models in inspiring other members of the community to join hands in the efforts for conservation of the biodiversity of river Ganga. Thus, each Prahari shall work on the model of ‘Each One Make Ten’. 

 

Ganga Praharis of the five main stem Ganga basin states will be linked through mobile applications such as Bhuvan Ganga app, my gov app and Swachhta app thereby creating a broad network among them.

 

One national level training program was conducted recently at Rishikesh for Ganga Praharis from all five main stem Ganga basin states. The Praharis were imparted training on biodiversity, solid waste management, community engagement and cleanliness.  

 

Three livelihood centres have been established in villages around Varanasi (Rampur, Tantepur and Dhakka). Ganga Praharis particularly women are being imparted trainings in these centres.  

 

Some of the activities that Ganga Praharis are regularly involved in are Shram Daan, Ghat Cleaning, Awareness Campaigns, Plantation Drives and coordination with local administration. Ganga Praharis are playing a crucial role in reporting and rescuing of aquatic wildlife in distress, reporting of illegal activities like poaching etc.

                The Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri Harsh Vardhan on Saturday visited the pavilion set up by National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) at Vigyan Bhawan lawns from 2nd June to 5th June 2018 to observe the World Environment Day.  India is the global host for Environment Day celebrations this year. 

Director General, NMCG Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra briefed the Union Minister about the progress being made under Namami Gange programme. The Minister appreciated the efforts of NMCG. 

In the NMCG pavilion which is in Hall Number 1 at Vigyan Bhawan lawns, the projects and the progress under Namami Gange programme are being showcased. 204 projects costing Rs 21, 367 crore have been sanctioned as part of clean Ganga mission till May 2018. Out of these, 52 projects have already been completed and 97 are under progress. 55 projects are under tendering. 

Under Namami Gange programme, special attention is on 10 major towns along river Ganga contributing almost 64% of total sewage discharge in river Ganga and many of these are being taken up for better and comprehensive coverage under Hybrid Annuity mode and with One City –One Operator mode. 

As part of spreading awareness about Clean Ganga Mission, especially amongst children, a cartoon character Ganga Ram has been introduced at the exhibition which is a hit with children. Ganga Ram is a common man who exhorts his fellow citizens to contribute in Clean Ganga Mission and join hands with the government. The cutouts on one side depict the aspirations/vision of an Indian as to how river Ganga should be and other side depicts the kind of interventions under Namami Gange. 

Ganga Puzzle, which has been developed by GIZ, one of NMCG’s partners in Clean Ganga Mission is attracting a lot of children/students. On the first day of the exhibition, nearly 20 Ganga Puzzles were won by children on answering of 5 questions related to Ganga. Display is interactive and visitors can see details of their interest on touchscreens and Bhuvan App.

These include NMCG, Yes Bank, World Bank, GIZ, IL&FS, Jamia Millia Islamia, South Delhi Municipal Corporation and other departments.

While I thank all who participated in today’s the event, I request the people of Delhi to join hands with us in more numbers to clean River Yamuna. The involvement of each and every one of us is indispensable to clean Ganga mission.”

                As per a recent poll titled ‘The world’s most dangerous countries for women 2018’ Thomson Reuters Foundation has proclaimed India as the most dangerous country for women. This proclamation is based on an opinion poll, rather than any reports or data.

Reuters has used a flawed methodology to arrive at this claim. The ranking is based on a perception poll based on responses to simply six questions. The results are not derived from any kind of data and are solely based on inherently subjective opinions. Further, the poll has been conducted with 548 respondents, which have been defined by Reuters as ‘experts focused on women’s issues’. However, information on their designation, credentials, country of expertise or qualifications is not available thus reliability is an issue. The methodology given by the organisation also includes ‘policymakers’ as one of the respondents. However, no information or opinion has been sought from this Ministry regarding this poll. 

The six questions posed as part of the poll cannot fairly be applied to all countries. E.g. the age bar for defining child marriage is different in every country, mutilation as a means of punishment, female genital mutilation, stoning etc. are not practiced in India.

Further, it is due to open data sharing, a consultative policy formulation process and transparent systems of the government that problems affecting women can be highlighted. There is open communication of the government with the media, researchers and NGOs thus creating the opportunity for public debate. The strong public discourse and independent media in the country are able to openly discuss sensitive issues of violence against women and debate is encouraged. It is due to this open system that issues of women are highlighted in India, thus perhaps building the perception that the situation in the country is particularly bad.

The poll has collected opinions of 548 persons on healthcare, discrimination, cultural traditions, sexual violence, non-sexual violence and human trafficking. India is far ahead of many countries in most of these areas and has also seen significant improvement in indicators when compared with its own performance in previous years. Therefore, the ranking of India is a surprise and clearly inaccurate. 

For example, as per Sample Registration Survey (SRS) released in June 2018, India has registered a significant reduction of 22% in Maternal Mortality Ratio since 2013. Further, sex ratio at birth has significantly increased across the country, pointing to a drop in sex selective abortions.

On the economic front too there has been huge progress – over 45.6 lakh SHGs have been promoted across the country for women’s livelihood with over Rs. 2000 crore available in their revolving funds. More than 1.26 crore bank accounts have been opened under SukanyaSamruddhiYojana to ensure financial inclusion of girls and more than half the Jan Dhan bank account holders in India are women. In primary and secondary levels of education, India has achieved Gender Parity with equal enrolment of girls and boys. It is thus not accurate to say that women in India lack access to economic resources.

There is positive data in the areas of violence too. There has been a drastic reduction in child marriage over the years, with reports of marriage in the age group of 0-9 years now being nil. Further, the percentage of women age 15-19 years who were already mothers or pregnant has dropped from 16% in 2005-06 to 7.9% in 2015-16.

As per NCRB data, 38,947 cases of rape have been registered in the year 2016. In the year 2014 and 2015, 36,735 and 34,651 cases were reported. The increase in reporting is a result of the favourable environment for women to access police authorities. Further, the rate of rape in India stands at 0.03 per 1000 population whereas US has reported a much higher figure of 1.2 rapes per 1000 population. The cases of acid attack are only incidental in the country and as mentioned earlier, practices of stoning, female genital mutilation etc. are not seen here. India can thus not possibly be the worst in the world in terms of violence.

Data on bonded and forced labour is also dropping drastically and the reports of crime are being dealt with seriously. Trafficking will also be comprehensively addressed through the recently prepared Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2018.

Despite data to the contrary, the usage of an opinion poll to peg India as the most dangerous country for women is clearly an effort to malign the nation and draw attention away from real improvements seen in recent years.

Ever since the unfortunate incident of 2012, the entire country has been alert about the safety of women and ensuring their equality at home, in the economy and in society at large. The government has been taking a lead in this direction.

The recently enacted Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012, the Criminal Law Amendment Act 2013 and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 have provided more stringent punishment for rape, have broadened its definition and included new offences such as acid attack, stalking, sexual harassment, voyeurism, disrobing and sexual violence against boys below 18 years of age. Amendment in The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 has also broadened the definition of child in need of care and protection to include those children who are at imminent risk of child marriage. The Act also allow juveniles (16 years or older) to be tried as adults for heinous offences like rape and murder.

State Governments are increasing representation of women in police to 33% of the total strength, to make the force more women-friendly. Institutional support mechanisms have also been put in place like 193 One Stop Centres and Women Helplines in 31 States to provide 24 hour emergency and non-emergency response including police assistance, legal aid and legal counselling, medical aid, psycho-social counselling, temporary shelter etc. The institutions have provided support to over 12 lakh of women in the past ~3 years.

The bill making instant triple talaq a criminal offence has been approved which grants equality to Muslim women and is a powerful measure for women’s empowerment.

To ensure women have equal opportunities, loans worth Rs. 2,25,904 crore have been extended to 7.88 crore women entrepreneurs, under the MUDRA Yojana. Over 50% of the certifications provided under the PM KaushalVikasYojana have been to women. More women are joining the workforce and starting to control economic resources. Over 5 lakh women Directors currently appointed in companies, which is highest ever number in India.

Under PMAY (Urban), houses are being allotted in the name of the female head of the household or joint name of male head and wife. In PMAY (Grameen), this is being done where government land is allotted, and encouraged in other cases. Over 2 lakh houses for women sanctioned under PMAY (Grameen). The right of women to ancestral land is also being encouraged.

The government has further launched multiple scholarships with special focus on education of girl child in secondary as well as higher education which are showing significant positive outcomes. Dropouts rates have come down dramatically and more women are carrying on their education to college level and beyond.

Maternal health has also shown significant improvement with concerted efforts having been made by the government. In a major step, maternity leave has been extended to 6 months so women do not lose their jobs or income due to pregnancy. Cash incentives are also being given to mothers across the country to encourage them to register pregnancies, deliver in hospitals and access pre and post-natal care.

These efforts have shown results and the life of the average Indian woman is far improved from a decade ago. She is also in a much better position than a number of women in other countries around the world. Facts clearly show that the opinion of India as the most dangerous country for women is not a reflection of reality.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) has come up with its report titled ‘Women in Prisons’ which aims to build an understanding of the various entitlements of women in prisons, the various issues faced by them and possible methods for resolution of the same. The report contains a comprehensive list of 134 recommendations for improving the lives of women under incarceration, addressing a wide range of issues pertaining to pregnancy and childbirth in prison, mental health, legal aid, reintegration in society and their caregiving responsibilities among others. Various changes in the National Model Prison Manual 2016 have also been suggested to bring it in line with international standards and norms.

Speaking about the report, Honourable Minister for Women and Child Development Smt.Maneka Sanjay Gandhi has said that this initiative should change the way prison administration perceives women inmates.  

The excerpts of the report:


	The report covers a wide range of issues that women face in prisons, and is inclusive of the needs of the elderly and the disabled. The report not only considers the needs of pregnant women, but also those who have recently given birth but whose children are not with them in prison, those who have miscarried, or those who have recently undergone abortion. Apart from this, due consideration has also been given to the religious and customary beliefs of inmates. 
	The report suggests that prior to their imprisonment, women with care-giving responsibilities must be allowed to make arrangements for their children, and a reasonable suspension of detention may also be provided for this purpose. In case there are no family/friends where the child (above 6 years of age) can be left, he must be placed in a Child Care Institution. To address the problems of loss of ties with the child, the report encourages greater links of the child with the mother throughout her incarceration through extended visits and frequent meetings. 
	The report proposes that bail should be granted to those under-trial women who have spent one-third of their maximum possible sentence in detention, by making necessary changes in Section 436A of the CrPC which provides for release after half of the maximum sentence has been served. The report also recommends that a maximum time frame may be decided for release of women prisoners after bail is granted but surety is not produced. This would ensure that poor or financially dependent women are not left to languish in prisons.
	Considering the needs of women in their post-natal stages, the report recommends a separate accommodation for mothers in post-natal stage to maintain hygiene and protect the infant from contagion, for at least a year after childbirth. Apart from the needs of pregnant and lactating women, the report has also suggested that special provisions relating to health and nutrition be made for women who have recently given birth outside prison, or who have undergone abortion or miscarriage. The report recommends that instruments of restraint, punishment by close confinement or disciplinary segregation should never be used on pregnant and lactating women. The report also suggests that pregnant women must be given information and access to abortion during incarceration, to the extent permissible by law.
	To make legal aid more effective, the report suggests that legal consultations must be conducted in confidentiality and without censorship. For persons with language barriers or sensory disabilities, adequate arrangements must be made by the prison administration to ensure that such persons do not face any disadvantage by providing an independent interpreter.
	Re-integration of women in society is a grave problem, due to the stigma attached to incarceration. In the study conducted by MWCD, it was found that in many cases, women were abandoned by their families and were left to fend for themselves after their release. The report proposes a comprehensive after-care programme to be put in place, covering employment, financial support, regaining of child custody, shelter, counselling, continuity of health care services etc. Counselling should also be provided to family members and employers to adequately receive the woman after release. 
	The report also recommends that prison authorities should coordinate with local police to ensure released prisoners are not harassed by them due to the attached stigma. At least one voluntary organisation should be designated in each district to help with integration of released prisoners. Prisoners must also be given the right to vote, so as not to disconnect them from the larger political process and to enable them to become equal citizens of a democracy.
	The grievance redressal mechanism in prisons was found to be inadequate, with scope for abuse and retaliation. Thus, a need for a more robust grievance redressal system was felt. The report therefore recommends that apart from the prisoner herself, her legal adviser or family members should be allowed to make complaints regarding her stay in prison. An inmate register can also be placed at an accessible spot in the prison for submitting grievances. All official visitors must hold special one-on-one interviews with prisoners away from prison authorities during inspection visits.
	Keeping in mind the mental needs of prisoners it has been recommended that inmates should have access to female counsellors/psychologists at least on a weekly basis or as frequently as needed by them.
	It is widely known that women in prisons face greater hardships than their male counterparts due to many factors such as social stigma, financial dependence on their families or husbands etc. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the woman has children. In the study conducted for the purpose of this report, it was found that women have to face numerous problems in prisons owing to inadequacy of female staff which often translates to the reality that male staff becomes responsible for female inmates, which is undesirable. It was also found that women were not provided with meals that are nutritious and according to their bodily requirements. Apart from these issues, women are at a most disadvantageous position when it comes to their reintegration in society after release. Many are abandoned or harassed post-release, mainly due to the stigma attached with incarceration, which is even more pronounced in cases of women. Further, women tend to lose ties with their children over the years, due to inadequate child custody procedures. Also, a robust grievance redressal mechanism was required to tackle cases of sexual harassment, violence and abuse against women in jails. 


This report would now be shared with the Ministry of Home Affairs for issuing advisory to the States for implementation of the recommendations made in the Report. 

 

Background: As per most recent data available from the end of 2015, there are 4,19,623 persons in jail in India, of which, 17,834 (about 4.3%) are women. Of these, 11,916 (66.8%) are undertrial prisoners. In India, an analysis of prison statistics at five-year intervals reveals an increasing trend in the number of women prisoners – from 3.3% of all prisoners in 2000 to 4.3% in 2015. A majority of female inmates are in the age group of 30-50 years (50.5%), followed by 18-30 years (31.3%). Of the total 1,401 prisons in India, only 18 are exclusive for women, housing 2,985 female prisoners. Thus, a majority of women inmates are housed in women’s enclosures of general prisons.

In the making of this report, widespread deliberations and extensive consultations were held by the MWCD with all relevant stakeholders for the purpose of this study. The officials of MWCD visited 5 prisons across NCR in September and October 2017 to understand the various issues faced by women and children in prisons. This was followed by a round of wide-ranging consultations with NCW, BPR&D, DIG Prisons, Delhi and select civil society organisations and representatives specialising in the subject. 

In addition to this, MWCD commissioned National Law University, Delhi to undertake a comprehensive review of Prison Manuals and International Norms, between March and June 2018. Further, NCW was commissioned to conduct jail visits to 21 prisons across the nation between November 2017 and May 2018 to collect primary data on the current status of the conditions of women prisoners. The study also considered secondary data shared by Ministry of Home Affairs pertaining to the facilities available to women prisoners from nine States/UTs. Qualitative data on the conditions of prisoners was obtained from the National Crime Records Bureau, Bureau of Police Research and Development and National Human Rights Commission. In addition to this, various central level committees set up to review prison conditions as well as orders and judgements of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India were also studied.

                ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) has been specially designed to strengthen the Service Delivery System as well as the mechanism for Real Time Monitoring (RTM) for nutritional outcomes. Briefing the media on the upcoming POSHAN Abhiyaan TECH-THON, WCD Secretary Sh. Rakesh Srivastava said that it looks at improving the nutrition outcomes through effective monitoring, timely intervention and also act as a fact-based decision-making tool. 

Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India will organize a day-long Seminar on Technology Partnerships for Steering POSHAN Abhiyaan called ‘TECH-THON’ for POSHAN Abhiyaan - PM’s Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nourishment on 28th June, 2018 at Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra in New Delhi. 

WCD Secretary said that the Seminar is being organised to showcase and orient the environment towards the initiative, exchange ideas and to explore avenues of cooperation and partnerships for technology support, as well as, reaching-out to the beneficiaries for effective behavioural change to initiate a ‘Peoples Movement’ or Jan Andolan towards Nutrition. He said that Convergence and use of Technology are the two hallmarks of POSHAN Abhiyaan. The Abhiyaan lays-down specific targets to be achieved across different monitoring parameters over the next few years. Never before has nutrition been given such prominence at the highest level in the country.

                In order to address the larger agenda of Women Empowerment, the focus on Women by each of the sections of the Government needs to be constant as well as evolving. This was stressed by Smt.Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Hon’ble Minister for Women and Child Development in her letter to the various Ministers of the Union Government. The Minister also noted that complete convergence of the inter-ministerial efforts for effective implementation of various initiatives and schemes is needed. A focal point in the key Ministries at the central level so that the women are kept in focus in the overall Governance scheme is also necessary, the Minister specified in the letter.

To keep Women in focus in all the Government schemes, the Minister requested to create a division headed by Joint Secretary (or designate one of the existing Joint Secretaries as head) to spearhead engendering of Government schemes/programmes from conceptualization to the last mile implementation.

	This Centralised Authority will be authorized to receive complaints or grievances regarding any programme or advertisement broadcasted or publication and investigate/ examine all matters relating to the indecent representation of women.


The Government of India has enacted the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act (IRWA), 1986 to prohibit indecent representation of women through advertisements, publications, writings, paintings, figures or in any other manner. Since the enactment of the Act, technological revolution has resulted in the development of new forms of communication, such as internet, multi-media messaging, cable television, over-the-top (OTT) services and applications e.g. Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Chat On, Snapchat, Instagram etc. 

Keeping in mind these technological advancements, it has been decided to widen the scope of the law so as to cover such forms of media on one hand and to strengthen the existing safeguards to prevent indecent representation of women through any media form on the other. Hence, the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Amendment Bill, 2012 was introduced in Rajya Sabha December, 2012 which referred the Bill to Department related Parliament Standing Committee for consideration.

                Hon’ble Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi laid foundation of Sakhi Suraksha Advanced DNA Forensic Laboratory in the campus of Central Forensic Science Lab, Chandigarh today. Speaking at the event, the Minister said that forensic analysis plays critical role in criminal investigation and the Advanced Lab will contribute to address the gap in forensic DNA analysis of pending sexual assault cases in the country. The Minister added that the lab is being set up as a model forensic lab and would be replicated in other parts of the country.

The Minister mentioned that the current capacity of CFSL, Chandigarh is less than 160 cases per year and the Sakhi Suraksha Advanced DNA Forensic Laboratory is estimated to increase the capacity to 2000 cases per year.  The Minister further said that 5 more advanced forensic labs would come up in Mumbai, Chennai, Guwahati, Pune and Bhopal in the next 3 months bringing the total minimum annual capacity of the labs to 50000 cases. The Labs in Chennai and Mumbai would be set up with WCD funds while remaining 3 labs would be set up with funds by Home Ministry. To meet international standards and deliver timely justice to women, advanced forensic DNA laboratories with latest high throughput DNA technology, are required, she added. 

 



Special forensic kits for rape cases: Underscoring the importance of the forensics in nabbing the culprits in sexual assault cases, the Minister said that special forensic kits for rape would be distributed to all the police stations and hospitals by the month of July. The Minister said that forensic rape kits are currently with CFSL Chandigarh for validation. These inviolable kits will be used for providing uncontaminated evidence. These kits would contain a complete list of evidence/samples to be collected along with the equipment required to collect the evidence.  The kits would be locked and sealed before being sent to forensic labs.  The details of name of the person, date and time of sealing the kit would be recorded in the kit.   

         Secretary WCD Sh. Rakesh Srivastava said that this project is a joint effort of Ministry of Home Affairs and WCD Ministry and it will play a vital role in justice delivery system. 

In sexual assault cases, the ideal time frame to complete the examination and submission of report is 90 days. Furthermore, it is important that the biological crime exhibit is stored and preserved in scientific manner so as to make any examination/reporting meaningful. However, presently such a storage/preservation capacity is around 200 cases in CFSL, Chandigarh.  

At present there are 6 Central Forensic Science Labs (CFSLs) in Chandigarh, Guwahati, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Pune and Bhopal and one State Forensic Science Lab in each State/UT.  These las are responsible for conducting forensic analysis of all cases in the country including sexual assault, criminal paternity and homicide.  

In Sakhi Suraksha Advanced DNA Forensic Laboratory, four units are to be established to address cases related to women:


	Sexual Assault and Homicide Unit
	Paternity Unit
	Human Identification Unit
	Mitochondrial Unit


Apart from the Sexual Assault and Homicide Unit, the other three units are interlinked and will work to examine cases related to crime against women. Paternity Unit is essential to solve cases related to criminal paternity, gender selection & child swapping in hospitals. Human Identification Unit is important in cases of missing person or children. Mitochondrial Unit will conduct mitochondrial DNA analysis in cases where regular Nuclear DNA analysis is not possible such as in case of highly degraded samples. The Mitochondrial Unit can also be used to better explore family relationships.

 

Background :   Forensic science plays a vital role in the criminal justice delivery system by providing investigators with scientifically based information through the analysis of physical evidence. With increasing reports of crime against women such as sexual assault, foeticide, homicide etc. there is an increasing demand for better scientific analysis of physical evidence. Scrutiny by Hon'ble courts demands more admissible, accurate and powerful forensic proof for human individualisation.

                Minister of State (I/C) Youth Affairs and Sports Col Rajyavardhan Rathore has sanctioned a special financial assistance of Rs.5 lakhs to former International Archer & Arjun Awardee Shri Limba Ram.  Shri Limba Ram, who is suffering from neuro generative disease or neurological illness is undergoing treatment at Jaipur. He is working for the State Government of Rajasthan and is in receipt of salary beyond the ceiling of Rs.4 lakhs fixed under the scheme of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay National Welfare Fund for Sportspersons. The Minister in his capacity as Chairperson of the Fund, has relaxed the condition and by invoking the discretionary clause sanctioned Rs.5 Lakhs considering that his widowed mother, widowed sister and her children, widowed mother-in-law and unemployed brother are dependent on him.  

Earlier, on getting the news of Shri Limba Ram’s admission in a hospital, the Minister had deputed a team of officers to visit and enquire if any assistance is required.  The sanctioned amount is based on the report of this Committee.  The Minister has also asked his officers to regularly visit him and update on his health.

                National Sports University Ordinance, 2018 has come into force as the President of India has given his assent to the Union Cabinet’s decision to promulgate the said Ordinance. Earlier, the Union Cabinet, in its meeting held on 23rd May, 2018, had decided to approve the proposal of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports to promulgate the National Sports University Ordinance, 2018, by which the National Sports University will be established with headquarters at Manipur.

National Sports University Ordinance, 2018 (“the Ordinance”) will be on the lines of the National Sports University Bill, 2017, introduced in Lok Sabha on 10.08.2017. This will be a specialized University, first of its kind, to promote sports education in the areas of sports sciences, sports technology, sports management and sports coaching besides functioning as the national training centre for select sports disciplines by adopting the best international practices.

The proposal was formally announced by the Finance Minister in his Budget speech of 2014-15 on 10.07.2014. For setting up the University, 325.90 acres of land has been made available by the Government of Manipur in Koutruk, West Imphal district of Manipur. The University would provide a boost to sports activities in the country, and also improve the country’s sports performance at the national and international levels. The proposed University has also considerable employment generation potential.

                NITI Aayog and Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited (GNFC) have signed a Statement of Intent (SOI) today to work together towards implementing a Proof-of-Concept (“PoC”) application using Blockchain Technology for fertiliser subsidy management. 

They will jointly develop the use case, under take research, interact with multiple stakeholders, develop Blockchain solutions, exchange learnings, organise forums, and disseminate learnings across their networks. Learnings, insights and outcomes of the PoC will enable NITI Aayog to suggest policy recommendations and actions in strengthening the subsidy mechanism, making it more transparent and immune to leakages.

Fertilizer units manufacture approximately 31 Million MT of fertilizers across country, where total approximately Rs. 70,000 Cr. of subsidy is disbursed to the manufacturing units. The subsidy disbursal takes two to three months’ time.There are multiple entities involved in verification process, and the transaction process is very cumbersome which has the potential to be automated to give significant efficiency gains.

With implementation of BlockchainTechnology,it is expected that the distribution will become effective and efficient, and subsidy transfer could be automated and made real time.

Blockchain platform have inherent characteristics of distributed computing and ledger keeping of transactions i.e. confidentiality, authenticity, non-repudiation, data integrity, and data availability. 

Overall implementation ensures that there is no dependence on intermediary agencies to prove the validity of transactions and resulting subsidy claims. The blockchain based process will also use Smart Contracts which will enable quick and accurate reconciliation of transactions between multiple parties with minimal human intervention. Implementation platform is such that process transparency is evident, transactions cannot be altered and audit trails of transactions are available.

The NITI Aayog today launched the first Delta ranking (incremental progress) for the Aspirational Districts, based on self-reported data of districts between March 31, 2018 to May 31, 2018, across five developmental areas of Health and Nutrition, Education, Agriculture and Water Resources, Financial Inclusion and Skill Development, and Basic Infrastructure.

Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, highlighted the keen interest displayed by the districts to provide real-time data points by filling up the Champions of Change Dashboard.

“The purpose of this ranking is to spur a sense of competition among the dynamic teams in the districts. Since these districts face many challenges including legacy, unexploited or weak resource base, deficit of manpower at different levels due to difficult living conditions etc, the ranking is also a tool to identify sectors and indicator specific challenges so that Team India, which is driving this programme, can take immediate corrective measures”, said Shri Amitabh Kant, releasing the first delta ranking of the Aspirational Districts. 

The Districts started entering data from 1st April, 2018 in the Champions of Change Dashboard and 108 districts out of total 112, participated in this ranking. Data entry by remaining four districts is also in progress, though they are not part of this ranking.

The delta ranking is computed in a transparent manner for combined improvements made during April and May 2018.

Some of the data points have been sourced from Central Ministries viz. Financial Inclusion, Skill Development and 3 indicators of Basic Infrastructure - Household Electricity Connections, Household Toilets and Rural Drinking Water. Most of the data points, however, have been self-reported by the various districts themselves.

Asifabad district of Telangana, which was ranked 100 in Baseline ranking released in March this year, has made significant improvements in past two months and stood at 15 in Delta ranking. Dahod district of Gujarat improved 19.8 points to rank first in the Delta ranking (was Ranked 17 in Baseline ranking).

West Sikkim district in Sikkim stood second with 18.9 points, a huge improvement from being in the 30th position in Baseline ranking. Bijapur district in Chhattisgarh also made significant strides by improving 14.7 points and ranked 6th position in Delta ranking from 45th position in Baseline ranking

This Delta ranking takes a step further and looks into specific aspects of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and analyses how districts have performed in last two months across important sectors. This grouping and positioning would aid the District Magistrates/Collectors to focus more on these sectors and improve their ranking in future.

The knowledge partners of NITI Aayog – Tata Trusts, and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (ID Insights) - are expected to provide data on 13 survey indicators and have validated values for 29 data-points. The next ranking will take into account these inputs and will be released soon thereafter. 

About ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ programme

Launched by the Hon’ble PM in January this year, the ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ programme aims to quickly and effectively transform some of the most underdeveloped districts of the country.

The broad contours of the programme are Convergence (of Central & State Schemes), Collaboration (of Central, State level ‘Prabhari’ Officers & District Collectors), and Competition among districts driven by a Mass Movement or a Jan Andolan. With States as the main drivers, this program will focus on the strength of each district, identify low-hanging fruits for immediate improvement, measure progress, and rank districts.

The Government is committed to raising the living standards of its citizens and ensuring inclusive growth for all – SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas.

To enable optimum utilization of their potential, this program focuses closely on improving people’s ability to participate fully in the burgeoning economy. Health & Nutrition, Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Financial Inclusion & Skill Development, and Basic Infrastructure are this programme’s core areas of focus.

After several rounds of consultations with various stakeholders, 49 key performance indicators have been chosen to measure progress of the districts. Districts are prodded and encouraged to first catch-up with the best district within their state, and subsequently aspire to become one of the best in the country, by competing with, and learning from others in the spirit of competitive & cooperative federalism.

The WEP was established on the occasion of International Womens’ Day in March 2018 to substantially increase the number of women entrepreneurs who will create and empower a dynamic New India. 

The WEP intends to undertake this task through its partner organizations, private as well as public organizations; by bringing their existing as well as new women specific initiatives on a single platform, which in turn will also address knowledge gaps, promote partner connects and will increase the outreach of partner programmes. 

The SoIs signed with financial institutions such as the Shri Mahila Sewa Sahakari Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance and SREI Infrastructure Finance shall be housed under the WEP-Finance vertical and will provide financial assistance to women entrepreneurs and address the finance related challenges faced by them through WEP.

WEP will partner with the Sreemanta Sankar Mission of Guwahati to empower established as well as aspiring women entrepreneurs in North East India through WEP North East Chapter and will work to popularize WEP in North East so that more women entrepreneurs in that region can avail benefits under the WEP initiative. Similarly, the SoI with the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), a trade union and as an organization of poor, self-employed women workers, includes commitments to mobilize women entrepreneurs in rural areas and promote them in Livelihood Entrepreneurship.

Through its partner organizations, WEP aims to create opportunities and support women in order to help them realize their entrepreneurial aspirations, scale up innovative initiatives, and chalk out sustainable and long-term strategies for their businesses. WEP website which will be enriched with entrepreneurial initiatives and support programmes would guide you to schemes, initiatives and products relevant to your requirement.

The WEP is an initiative under the NITI Aayog which was launched on March 8, 2018 on the occasion of the International Women’s Day. The idea of the Platform was first mooted by Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog who announced the setting-up of a Women Entrepreneurship Platform in NITI Aayog at the conclusion of the 8th Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) held in Hyderabad in 2017 with an overarching theme of ‘Women first, Prosperity for All’.

                The fourth meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog was held under the chairmanship of the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi at Rashtrapati Bhavan today. It was attended by 23 Chief Ministers and the Lieutenant Governor of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, apart from Union Ministers, who are ex-officio members and special invitees.

At the end of the day-long deliberations, the Prime Minister highlighted the importance of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog as a platform to inspire cooperative federalism, stressing the need for effective center-state cooperation to advance development outcomes and achieve double-digit growth for India. He called upon States to fix growth targets for their economies as the world looks towards India soon becoming a USD 5 trillion economy. He advised the States to pay special attention to expanding their exports and attracting export oriented investment while organizing their investments summits and events.

Welcoming the constructive discussion and suggestions made by various Chief Ministers, the Prime Minister assured the gathering that these suggestions would be seriously considered in the course of decision-making. NITI Aayog was asked to follow up with the States within three months on the actionable points made by them.

The Prime Minister also called upon the Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Sikkim, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh to work together to make recommendations on a coordinated policy approach on the subject of ‘Agriculture and MNREGA’. He also encouraged States to explore opportunities to increase corporate investment in agriculture, such as in food processing, warehousing and logistics. 

He reiterated the Union Government's commitment to provide 100% coverage of seven flagship schemes to 45,000 additional villages and those in 115 Aspirational Districts by August 15th, 2018.  He urged States to identify 'aspirational blocks’ to take development to the grassroots. 

NITI Aayog will soon invite States for consultations on how to improve the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in India and also to improve the ‘Ease of Living’ for the common man. The Prime Minister also emphasized that States may set up their own Committees to look into ‘Ease of Living’ for the common citizen, which is the need of the hour.

The Prime Minister expressed the hope that all Government buildings and street lighting across the country should be replaced with energy-efficient, economical LED lighting as soon as possible and also urged States to work towards the goal of a TB-Free India by 2025, five years prior to the global target of 2030. 

The Prime Minister also took into consideration States’ concerns over the Terms of Reference of the Fifteenth Finance Commission and encouraged States to think of new ideas or a new formula, which incentivizes states for their performance. For instance, good practices such as reducing wasteful expenditure and increasing technology use. He emphasized that the Finance Commission devolution formula has to take cognizance of the relative backwardness and low per capita incomes of some states.

Elaborating on the Union Government's guiding principle of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, the Prime Minister said the schemes of the Union Government are no longer limited to certain people, or to certain regions, and are reaching everyone without discrimination, in a balanced way.

The Chief Ministers of the various States highlighted issues such as adaptation to climate change, the need to design and implement State-specific schemes to suit local needs. They also presented the work done by the various states in implementing the Ayushman Bharat and the Aspirational Districts Programme.

All Chief Ministers expressed their commitment to celebrating the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in a befitting manner. The Prime Minister in his closing remarks said the best manner of showing respect to the Father of the Nation would be to not only achieve a 100% Open Defecation Free (ODF) status for the country but also to make India free from dirt and squalor by October 2, 2019.

The Prime Minister called for exploring the possibility of holding simultaneous and the advantages of a common voter list for each State.

The Prime Minister thanked the Chief Ministers for their suggestions and reassured all present that the Union Government will work towards resolving all issues pending with the States.

                NITI Aayog has been engaging with State Governments to evolve a shared vision of national development and strategies from time to time to share the best practices. In this context, India Consensus - a partnership between Tata Trusts and Copenhagen Consensus which has undertaken more than 160 cost-benefit analyses across all main policy areas in Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan presented their findings on 14th June 2018 in NITI Aayog. The presentation on evidence-based policy prioritisation model was chaired by Dr Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog. It was attended by Chief Secretaries, Additional Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries/Secretaries dealing with the Planning Department of 32 States and Union Territories, Joint Secretaries from 14 Ministries, senior officers from NITI Aayog, eminent economists and researchers. Copenhagen Consensus President, Dr Bjorn Lomborg presented the policies and interventions which generate the most social, economic and environmental good for the States. 

The focus of the presentation was on how this approach and method could be replicated across other States. There was extensive discussion on the cost benefit analysis of seven specific research themes- Conditional Cash Transfer for ANC visits, doubling teacher-pupil ratio at school, using technology enabled computer assisted learning at the right level, promoting secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, improving private sector TB care,  propagating  E- mandis to reduce middle-men superprofits and improving land records digitisation. The meeting demonstrated alternative ways to prioritizing policies using data on social and economic benefit and cost. The suggestions included how to use the evidence based tool in prioritizing policies and cost benefit studies. Shireen Vakil, Head Policy and Advocacy, Tata Trusts shared the initiative undertaken by Trusts across the states in partnership with various stakeholders including NITI Aayog and Copenhagen Consensus center. 

The India Consensus project started a year ago with two pilot states with identifying more than 1200 interventions in Rajasthan and almost 1000 interventions in Andhra Pradesh. Almost 160 cost benefit studies were conducted in both states covering all major sectors. The cost benefit studies were done for both States. The final outcomes of the Rajasthan priorities were presented in an outcome seminar to Chief Secretary, Addl Chief Secretaries, Pr. Secretaries from the State   and honorable Chief Minister of Rajasthan before presenting to NITI Aayog.

The CWMIis an important tool to assess and improve the performance of States/ Union Territories in efficient management of water resources.  This has been done through a first of its kind water data collection exercise in partnership with Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation and all the States/ Union Territories.The index would provide useful information for the States and also for the concerned Central Ministries/Departments enabling them to formulate and implement suitable strategies for better management of water resources.Simultaneously a web portal on the subject has also been launched.

The report released today ranks Gujarat as number one in the reference year (2016-17), followed by Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra.  In North Eastern and Himalayan States, Tripura has been adjudged number 1 in 2016-17 followed by Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Assam.  In terms of incremental change in index (over 2015-16 level), Rajasthan holds number one position in general States and Tripura ranks at first position amongst North Eastern and Himalayan States.  NITI Aayog proposes to publish these ranks on an annual basis in future.

About Composite Water Management Index (CWMI)

CWMI has been developed by NITI Aayog comprising 9 broad sectors with 28 different indicators covering various aspects of ground water, restoration of water bodies, irrigation, farm practices, drinking water, policy and governance (Box-1).  For the purposes of analysis, the reporting states were divided into two special groups – ‘North Eastern and Himalayan states’ and ‘Other States’, to account for the different hydrological conditions across these groups.

The Report on the Composite Water Management Index can be accessed at http://pibphoto.nic.in/documents/rlink/2018/jun/p201861401.pdf

                The objective of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas can be fully achieved once the benefits of the interventions reach the last mile. As a step beyond measurement of outcomes, NITI Aayog has come out with various indices that not only fulfills its mandate of cooperative and competitive federalism but also challenges States and Union Territories (UTs) them to meet the aspirations of the new India. 

Furthering this mandate, NITI Aayog has come up with the Composite Water Management Index as a useful tool to assess and improve the performance in efficient management of water resources. This index is an attempt to inspire States and UTs towards efficient and optimal utilization of water, and recycling thereof with a sense of urgency. 

In view of limitations on availability of water resources and rising demand for water, sustainable management of water resources has acquired critical importance. The index can be utilised to formulate and implement suitable strategies for better management of water resources. It has been finalized after an elaborate exercise including seeking feedback from the States and consultation with reputed experts.

The index would provide useful information for the States and also for the concerned Central Ministries/Departments enabling them to formulate and implement suitable strategies for better management of water resources.

Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (WR,RD&GR) shall be releasing the Index during a press conference, in the presence of Shri Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, Shri UP Singh, Secretary, WR, RD & GR, Shri Amarjeet Sinha, Secretary, Rural Development and Shri Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Drinking Water & Sanitation.

                Methanol is a clean burning drop in fuel which can replace both petrol & diesel in transportation & LPG, Wood, Kerosene in cooking fuel. It can also replace diesel in Railways, Marine Sector, Gensets, Power Generation and Methanol based reformers could be an ideal complement to Hybrid and Electric Mobility. Methanol Economy is the “Bridge” to the dream of a complete “Hydrogen based fuel systems”. Methanol is a scalable and sustainable fuel, that can be produced from a variety of feedstocks like Natural Gas, Coal (Indian High Ash Coal), Bio-mass, Municipal Solid waste and most importantly from CO2. The Concept of “Methanol Economy” is being actively pursued by China, Italy, Sweden, Israel, US, Australia, Japan and many other European countries. 10% of fuel in China in transport Sector is Methanol. 

Methanol burns efficiently in all internal combustion engines, produces no particulate matter, no soot, almost nil SOX and NOX emissions (NEAR ZERO POLLUTION). The gaseous version of Methanol – DME can blended with LPG and can be excellent substitute for diesel in Large buses and trucks. To adopt Methanol as a transport fuel, it requires minimal infrastructure modifications and capital both in vehicles and in terminal and distribution infrastructure. Methanol 15 % blend (M15) in petrol will reduce pollution by 33% & diesel replacement by methanol will reduce by more than 80%. Urban Transport contributes to close to 40% towards urban air pollution. Annually 400000 deaths take place in India due to air pollution. Field trials are under way for India to adopt M15 program in transportation sector. The notification of fuels for M15 & M100 are already complete. Methanol 100% engine will look to replace diesel in its totality.

One of the reasons why Methanol has the potential to be an enduring solution to human energy needs is because the beltched out C02 (greenhouse gas emission) both from using Methanol and while producing Methanol can be tapped back to produce Methanol. Thereby a seamless loop of CO2 sequestration cycle is created to perpetually burn fuels without polluting the environment at all. C02 from steel plants, Thermal Power plants, Cement Plants etc. can be tapped in large quantities to produce Methanol. The Technology has acquired commercial maturity and countries like Iceland are producing in meaningful quantities already.

NITI Aayog has drawn out a comprehensive plan to replace 20% of crude imports from Methanol alone. Adopting Methanol in this scale would bring down pollution in the country by more than 40% and not to forget the benefits from import substitution. Over a period of time of time diesel can completely be done away with. Indian Railways alone burns three billion litres of diesel every year. Plans are in place to convert 6000 diesel railway engines to work on 100% Methanol and make railways a carbon neutral organisation. The other sector where Methanol is becoming the fuel of choice because of emission benefits is the ‘Marine Sector’. IMO Regulations on sulphur particulates and NOX (0.50% m/m on and after 1 January 2020) will make it compulsive to switch to a clean fuel. Project is underway convert Ro/RO (Roll on & Roll Off) vessels in to Methanol, which will run on the National Waterways for Inland waterways-based transportation. 500 barges will be converted to run on 100% Methanol replacing heavy oil or bunker oil. All this will result in a massive reduction of pollutants into our seas and rivers. 

Other major area where methanol can reduce pollution is the Energy sector. India has an installed capacity of 22000 MW on HFO (Heavy fuel oil) alone. HFO is one of the dirtiest fuel and most countries of the world have abandoned it. The entire HFO usage can be replaced by Methanol. Power Modules of Mobile Towers (about 750000) in India can fully be replaced by Methanol Reformer / Fuel Cell based platforms in the next two years. Diesel industrial Gensets, Gas Turbines running on Naptha, LFOI (Light Fuel Oil) and other dirty fuels can also be fully replaced. Industrial boilers which are running on diesel will also be replaced with Methanol.

India by adopting Methanol can have its own indigenous fuel at the cost of approximately Rs. 19 per litre at least 30% cheaper than any available fuel. Methanol fuel can result in great environmental benefits and can be the answer to the burning urban pollution issue. At least 20% diesel consumption can be reduced in next 5-7 years and will result in a savings of Rs. 26,000 crore annually. Rs. 6000 crore can be annually saved from reduced bill in LPG in the next 3 years itself. The Methanol blending program with petrol will further reduce our fuel bill by at least Rs. 5000 crore annually in next 3 years.

Methanol Economy, if adopted by India can be one of the best ways to mitigate the Environmental hazards of a growing economy. NITI Aayog is preparing a road map for a full-scale implementation in the near future.

                The Global Initiative on Academic Network (GIAN) course on Urban Analytics: Evaluating and Measuring Sustainability of Cities is an initiative of the Ministry of Human Resource Development and actively supported by the NITI Aayog. It is hosted by the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. Mr. Ratan P. Watal (Principal Adviser, NITI Aayog and Member Secretary, EAC-PM), inaugurated the GIAN course at a function in Roorkee on 4th June,2018 in the presence of Prof.Ajit Kumar Chaturvedi, Director IIT Roorkee, Prof.ManoranjanParida, Dean and other distinguished guests. This is the second GIAN course on Urban Planning, the first being held in January 2018 at IIT, Kanpur’s outreach center in Noida.

The objective of this course is to enlighten the participants with the knowledge and resources to understand and analyse the emerging trends of urbanization and its impacts. It will enable them to evaluate the conditions of sustainability in Indian cities. The course specifically focuses on the drivers of urban growth and its uneven impact on different places and peoples. The duration of the course is from 4th June to 9th June 2018.

Professor Arindam Biswas from the Department of Architecture and Planning at IIT Roorkee is coordinating this course along with Professor SubhroGuhathakurta, from the School of City and Regional Planning at the Georgia Institute of Technology, USA. He is also working as the Director of the Center for Spatial Planning Analytics and Visualization.

More than 35 participants from planning authorities, academic and research institutions and private organisations are participating in this course. In his inaugural address, Mr. Watal emphasized the need to harness the potential of urban information system and urban planning for making Indian cities more sustainable. He urged the participants to come forward with innovative and contextual solutions for Indian cities and create a model of a “living lab” by adopting a rural agglomeration in a nearby area which will transform into a township in the near future. The relevance of the course is underlined by the fact that India is the global host of the World Environment Day being observed on 5th June 2018, where the focus is on Sustainability and achievement of Sustainable Development Goals including SDG 11 which has a goal to “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”.

इंदौर शहर में आज जो सफलता की कहानी लिखी गई है उसके पीछे इस शहर की जनता की जीवटता, सहयोग की भावना और शहर के प्रति अपनापन सबसे बड़ा कारण रहा है। इंदौर शहर की सफलता का इतिहास जनभागीदारी की सफलता का इतिहास है|

बापू की 150 वीं जन्म जयंती पर स्वच्छ भारत का सपना, अब बहुत दूर नहीं। ये सपना पूरा होगा और हम सब मिलकर इसे पूरा करेंगे। बीते चार वर्षों में देश में शहरों और गांवों को मिलाकर 8 करोड़ 30 हजार से ज्यादा शौचालयों का निर्माण किया गया है|

मध्य प्रदेश में भी 65 लाख से ज्यादा शौचालय बने हैं। ये प्रयास एक बड़ी वजह हैं कि मध्य प्रदेश के सभी शहर खुद को खुले में शौच से मुक्‍त घोषित कर चुके हैं|

 

हमारी सरकार नई सोच, नई अप्रोच के साथ शहरों के लिए 5 बड़ी योजनाओं पर काम कर रही है। इसमें स्वच्छ भारत मिशन, प्रधानमंत्री आवास योजना शहरी, स्‍मार्ट सिटी मिशन, अमृत योजना और दीनदयाल राष्‍ट्रीय शहरी आजीविका मिशन शामिल हैं|

 

अमृत योजना के तहत देश के शहरों में पीने के पानी से लेकर सीवेज की सुविधाएं जुटाने का काम तेज़ गति से चल रहा है। मध्य प्रदेश के 34 शहरों में इस योजना के तहत 6 हजार करोड़ की योजनाएं जारी हैं|

 

MP के शहरी क्षेत्र में पीने के पानी से लेकर सीवेज और ट्रांसपोर्ट और कूड़ा प्रबंधन से जुड़ी लगभग 800 करोड़ की योजनाओं का आज लोकार्पण किया गया। इसमें इलेक्ट्रिक बसों जैसी स्मार्ट ट्रांसपोर्ट से जुड़ी कुछ व्यवस्थाएं भी शामिल हैं|

मुझे खुशी है कि आज मध्य प्रदेश के शहरों में रहने वाले मेरे एक लाख से अधिक बेघर भाई-बहनों का अपने घर में गृह-प्रवेश हुआ। जिन-जिन भाई-बहनों के घर का सपना आज सच हुआ है उनको मेरी बहुत-बहुत बधाई। आपके लिए ये घर सुखी और समृद्ध जीवन की बुनियाद बनें, यही मेरी कामना है|

हमारे देश में आवास योजनाएं पहले भी बनी हैं, लेकिन वो कैसी थीं ये आप सभी भली भांति जानते हैं। योजना के नामकरण से लेकर, लाभार्थियों के चयन, मकान बनाने की गति और आवंटन तक क्या-क्या होता था ये सब कांग्रेस के इतिहास के पन्नों में दर्ज है|

लेकिन 2014 में जब आपने NDA सरकार को अवसर दिया तो एक नई अप्रोच के साथ हमने काम शुरु किया। हमने ये संकल्प लिया कि साल 2022 में देश जब आजादी के 75 वर्ष का पर्व मनाएगा तब तक हर बेघर को घर देने का प्रयास किया जाएगा|

बीते चार वर्ष में लगभग 1 करोड़ 15 लाख घरों का निर्माण किया जा चुका है। इसमें पुरानी सरकार के लटके हुए प्रोजेक्ट्स भी शामिल हैं। पिछले 4 वर्षों में यूपीए के 10 वर्षों की तुलना में 3 गुना से अधिक मकान स्वीकृत किए गए|

 

ये सरकार गरीबों के साथ-साथ मध्यम वर्ग के घर की भी चिंता कर रही है। प्रधानमंत्री आवास योजना के तहत मध्यम वर्ग को भी घर बनाने के लिए ब्याज दरों में छूट दी जा रही है|

 

पिछले दिनों एक और अहम फैसला सरकार ने लिया है। इस स्कीम के अंतर्गत जो मकान का कार्पेट एरिया पहले तय था उसको बढ़ाया गया, जिसकी वजह से अब इस योजना के दायरे में ज्यादा लोग आ गए हैं|

 

साथियों, इतना ही नहीं बल्कि मध्यम वर्ग के भाई-बहनों के साथ घर के नाम पर हो रही ठगी और धोखाधड़ी को रोकने के लिए भी सख्त कदम उठाए गए हैं। RERA कानून के बाद बिल्डरों की मनमानी पर लगाम लगी है|

 

ये सरकार की नीतियों का ही परिणाम है कि आज हवाई चप्पल पहनने वाले मेरे भाई-बहन भी हवाई जहाज में घूम रहे हैं। पिछले वर्ष लगभग 10 करोड़ लोगों ने हवाई सफर किया, यानि एसी ट्रेन में जितनों ने यात्रा नहीं की उससे अधिक हवा में सफर किया|

 

मध्य प्रदेश ने शिवराज जी के नेतृत्व में विकास के नए आयाम तय किए हैं। विकास का रिश्ता मानवीय आकांक्षाओं से है और आकांक्षाएं असीमित होती हैं। इसलिए विकास का रास्ता भी निरंतर आगे बढ़ता रहता है। एक लक्ष्य पर पहुंचते हैं तो दूसरे नए लक्ष्य मिल जाते हैं|

 

इन लक्ष्यों को पूरा करते हुए, बीते चार वर्षों में New Madhya Pradesh और New India के लिए ठोस नींव तैयार की जा चुकी है। अब आप सभी के सहयोग से इसे और गति देने का प्रयास चल रहा है|

                On 7th August, 2017, the Competition Commission of India (Commission) received a notice from Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (Bayer) in relation to its proposed acquisition of Monsanto Company (Monsanto). Bayer, the acquirer, is a German stock corporation and is a life sciences company with competencies in the areas of health care and agriculture. The activities of Bayer are carried out in three main divisions viz. pharmaceuticals, consumer health, and crop sciences. Monsanto is a global supplier of agricultural products like seeds, biotechnology traits, and herbicides.

Based on its investigation, the Commission was of the opinion that the proposed combination is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in some markets in India but the same could be addressed by way of modifications to the proposed combination. Accordingly, the Commission approved the proposed combination under Section 31(7) of the Competition Act, 2002, subject to the following remedies to be implemented by the parties:


	Divestment of the following businesses of Bayer to an independent entity, which meets the parameters prescribed in the order of the Commission:



	Glufosinate ammonium (a non-selective herbicide);
	Crop traits of cotton and corn; and
	Hybrid seeds of vegetables



	Divestment of the shareholding of Monsanto in Maharashtra Hybrid Seed Company Limited (26%), to an independent entity, which meets the parameters prescribed in the order of the Commission.
	In addition to the above divestiture, Bayer is also bound by the following commitments for a period of 7 (seven) years from the closing of the Bayer/Monsanto transaction, 
	The resultant entity of the combination (Combined Entity) would follow a policy of broad based, non-exclusive licensing of Genetically Modified (GM) as well as non-GM traits currently commercialized in India or to be introduced in India in the future, on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND Terms); 
	The Combined Entity would follow a policy of non-exclusive licensing of non-selective herbicides and / or their active ingredient(s) in case of launch of new GM / non-GM traits in India that restrict agricultural producers including farmers to use specific non-selective herbicide(s) being supplied only by the parties, on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis;
	Combined entity would allow Indian users / potential licensees to access the following on FRAND Terms: (a) existing Indian agro-climatic data owned and used by the Combined Entity for its digital applications commercialized in India; (b) commercialized digital farming platform(s) of the Combined Entity for supplying/selling agricultural inputs to agricultural producers in India; and (c) digital farming applications of the Combined Entity, commercialized in India, on subscription basis. This remedy shall operate for a period of 7 years from the commencement of commercialization of digital farming product(s) or digital farming platform(s), subject to a total period of 10 years from the closing of the combination.
	Combined Entity would also grant access to Indian agro-climatic data, free of charge to Government of India and its institution(s), to be used exclusively for creating a public good in India.
	Combined Entity is barred from offering its clients, farmers, distribution channels and/or its commercial partners, two or more products as bundle which may potentially have the effect of exclusion of any competitor.
	Combined Entity is further barred from imposing, directly or indirectly, commercial dealings capable of causing exclusivity in the sales channel for supply of agricultural products.


The Commission further ensured in its order, that in case the Combined Entity offers better commercial terms to a new licensee for any of the above licenses, then it would be bound to offer, within 60 days, such similar terms to all existing licensees. 

Bayer is also directed to disclose, on its Indian websites, all contact details to facilitate the implementation of remedies ordered by the Commission. 

The remedies ordered by the Commission will strengthen the agricultural input suppliers in India, by enabling innovation and launch of new products for the benefit of the farmers.

                The Competition Commission of India (‘CCI’) passed final order in two cases involving bid rigging/ collusion in three tenders floated by Pune Municipal Corporation for “Design, Supply, Installation, Commissioning, Operation and Maintenance of Municipal Organic and Inorganic Solid Waste Processing Plant(s)”. These cases were taken up by CCI suo motu under Section 19 of the Act based on the disclosure by firms under Section 46 of the Competition Act, 2002 (‘the Act’) read with the Competition Commission of India (Lesser Penalty) Regulations, 2009 (‘Lesser Penalty Regulations’). All firms in these cases had approached CCI as lesser penalty applicants.

 

While in one case, the tenders pertained to the financial year 2013-14, in other case the tender pertained to financial year 2014-15. From the evidence gathered during investigation, CCI found that there was bid rigging/ collusive bidding in the Tender nos. 21 and 29 of 2013 and Tender no. 59 of 2014 floated by Pune Municipal Corporation for Solid Waste Processing Plant(s), in contravention of Section 3(3)(d) read with Section 3(1) of the Act by way of submitting proxy/ cover bids.

 

In case involving tender floated in financial year 2013-14 penalty was imposed on four firms in terms of Section 27 (b) of the Act at the rate of 10 percent of their average turnover for the years 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 i.e. three years preceding the year in which collusion took place. An amount of INR 46.45 Lakhs was imposed on Saara Traders Pvt. Ltd. (Saara), INR 33 Lakhs on Ecoman Enviro Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (‘Ecoman’), INR 11 Lakhs on Fortified Security Solutions (‘Fortified’) and INR 26.40 Lakhs on Raghunath Industry Pvt. Ltd. (‘Raghunath’). The penalty was also imposed on individual officials of three firms namely Saara, Ecoman and Raghunath at the rate of 10 percent of their average income for the same three years. No penalty was imposed on individual of Fortified as it is a proprietorship firm. Further, in view of penalty already levied in Case no. 50 of 2015 for infringement during the period 2014-15, no penalty was levied in case involving tender floated in financial year 2014-15.

 

Keeping in view the modus operandi of the cartel, the stage at which the lesser penalty application was filed, the evidences gathered by the DG independent of lesser penalty application and co-operation extended in conjunction with the value addition provided in establishing the existence of cartel, CCI granted 50 percent reduction in penalty to Saara and its individuals than otherwise leviable. Pursuant to reduction, penalty imposed on Saara was INR 23.22 Lakh and INR 74,513 on its individual.
