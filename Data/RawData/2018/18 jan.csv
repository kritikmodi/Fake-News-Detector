                Hon’ble members,


	We are in the third year of the pandemic caused by Corona-virus. In these years, people of India have displayed profound faith in the democratic values, discipline and sense of responsibility. At a time, when India is celebrating the Amrit Mahotsav on the occasion of 75th year of its independence, this willpower of every Indian creates immense confidence for India’s bright future. With this confidence, I extend my greetings to every Indian from this historic Central Hall of the Parliament. 


 


	Addressing both Houses of Parliament assembled together today, I salute lakhs of freedom fighters who gave highest priority to their duties and secured the rights of India. I also salute all the great personalities for their contribution in the development-journey of our country in these 75 years of independence. 


 


	In this period of Amrit Mahotsav, special events related to great personalities of the country are also inspiring us. My government is celebrating the sacred occasions of the 400th Prakash Parv of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, the 150th birth anniversary of Sri Aurobindo, the 150th birth anniversary of V.O. Chidambaram Pillai and the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose with grandeur. From this year onwards, the government has started the Republic Day celebrations from January 23, the birth anniversary of Netaji.


 


	My government believes that remembering the past and learning from it are equally important for a secure future of the country. Observance of 'Veer Bal Diwas' on 26th December in the memory of sacrifice of Sahibzadas and 'Vibhajan Vibhishika Smriti Diwas' on 14th August is a reflection of this thinking. The government also decided to celebrate the birth anniversary of Bhagwan Birsa Munda on 15th November as ‘Jan-jatiya Gaurav Diwas’ as a tribute to him.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is a sacred occasion for all the Indians to give concrete shape to the resolutions for the next 25 years. My government is moving fast on building a strong foundation for the next 25 years following the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Aur Sabka Prayas'. The most important resolution related to this foundation is the creation of an India which includes all, benefits all, which is strong and self-reliant. The challenging period of Corona has inspired us to achieve our goals at the fastest possible pace.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	The Covid pandemic affected the entire world and in India too, many of our loved ones were snatched away from us. In these circumstances, the Central Government, State Governments, local Governments and administration, our doctors, nurses and health workers, our scientists and entrepreneurs have worked as a team. This mutual trust, coordination and cooperation between the government and citizens is an unprecedented example of the strength of our democracy. For this, I appreciate every health and front-line worker, and every citizen.


 


	An example of India's capability in the fight against Covid-19 is evident in the ongoing Covid vaccination program. We have surpassed the record of administering more than 150 crore vaccine doses in less than a year. Today we are among the leading countries in the world with the highest vaccine doses administered. Success of this campaign has given a shield to the country providing enhanced protection to our citizens, while also boosting their morale.


 


	Today, more than 90 percent adult citizens of the country have received the first dose of the vaccine, whereas more than 70 percent have been administered  both the doses. The government is also reaching out to the rest of the population through the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign. Adolescents in the age group of 15 to 18 years have also been included in the vaccination program from this month. Precautionary dose for the front-line workers and senior citizens with co-morbidities has also been started. 


 


	So far, eight vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the country. Three vaccines being manufactured in India have also got approval from the World Health Organization for emergency use. These vaccines manufactured in India are playing an important role in making the entire world free from the pandemic and in saving crores of lives.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	The efforts of the country are not limited to addressing the immediate challenges in the fight against Covid pandemic. My government is developing far-reaching solutions which would be effective and useful in future also. The launch of Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission with an outlay of Rupees 64,000 crore is a commendable example. This will not only help in meeting the current health requirements, but will also prepare the country for any future crises.


 


	Health facilities are now easily accessible to the common people because of the responsive policies of my government. More than 80,000 health and wellness centres and crores of Ayushman Bharat cards have helped the poor immensely in getting treatment. Government has reduced the cost of treatment by providing affordable medicines through more than 8,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras. ‘Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission’ is an important step in providing easy and accessible health services.  


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	The Indian pharma sector has also proved its mettle during the Corona period. Presently, products of Indian pharma companies are reaching more than 180 countries. However, there is a wide range of opportunities for India in this sector.  The PLI scheme announced by my government for the pharma industry will further expand the opportunities, and will also provide impetus to research.  


 


	Yoga, Ayurveda and traditional medical practices are also becoming increasingly popular due to the efforts of the government. The country used to export AYUSH products worth Rupees 6,600 crore in 2014. This export has now increased to more than Rupees 11,000 crore. India is going to establish the world’s first ‘WHO Global Centre of Traditional Medicine’.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	The chief architect of our Constitution, Baba Saheb Doctor Bhimrao Ambedkar, had said: 


 

“My ideal would be a society based on Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity... Democracy is not merely a form of government… It is essentially an attitude of respect and reverence towards one’s fellow men”.

 

My government considers these ideals of Baba Saheb as its motto. My government believes in the mantra of Antyodaya, which encompasses social justice, equality, respect and equal opportunities. Therefore, in the policies of the government, top priority is being given to villages, the poor, Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes and backward communities. This spirit of India is clearly reflected in the selection for Padma awards in recent years. In a diverse country like India, dedicated people across the country are engaged in the service of the nation. They reflect the strength of India.

 

Hon’ble members, 

 


	Several major countries have experienced scarcity of food-grains and faced starvation during the Corona crisis. But my sensitive government ensured that nobody remained hungry during the worst pandemic in 100 years. My government is providing free ration to each poor household every month under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. This is the world’s largest food distribution program with an outlay of Rupees two lakh sixty thousand crore reaching out to 80 crore beneficiaries for 19 months. Being fully sensitive to the present circumstances, the government has extended this scheme till March 2022.


 


	Government is also running the PM-Sva-Nidhi scheme for enhancing the self-esteem of the poor and protection of their livelihood also during the Corona period. This scheme is proving to be very useful for the street vendors.  Under this scheme, more than Rupees 2900 crore have been provided to 28 lakh street vendors. The government is also connecting these street vendors with online food delivery companies. Further, government has started the e-SHRAM portal to protect the interests of labourers and more than 23 crore workers have joined it so far.


 


	We can see the impact of Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile or JAM trinity which my government has leveraged for the empowerment of citizens. With more than 44 crore poor people joining the banking system, crores of people benefitted from direct cash transfer during the pandemic.


 


	Amidst the progress made in respect of Digital India and Digital Economy, I also appreciate the government's vision for the success of the country's UPI platform. Transactions worth more than Rupees 8 lakh crore have taken place in the country through UPI in December 2021. This is a clear example of how fast our people are adopting technology and rapid change. 


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	My government considers provision of basic amenities as a means of empowering the poor and enhancing their dignity. More than two crore pucca houses have been provided to the poor under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana as a result of the efforts made in the last few years. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Gramin, 1 crore 17 lakh  houses have been approved at a cost of about Rupees one and a half lakh crore in the last three years.


 


	Launched with the aim of ‘Har Ghar Jal’, the Jal Jeevan Mission has  brought about a huge difference in the lives of the people. Nearly six crore rural households have been provided tap water connection despite the constraints imposed by pandemic. It has been of huge benefit for the women, sisters and daughters in our villages.


 


	The Svamitva scheme, launched to provide property documents to people in rural areas, is also an extraordinary initiative. So far, more than 40 lakh property cards have been issued in 27,000 villages under this scheme. These property cards are not only preventing disputes but are also assisting rural population in accessing banking support. 


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	My government is working continuously to empower the farmers and the rural economy of the country. Despite the pandemic, our farmers produced more than 30 crore tonnes of food grains and 33 crore tonnes of horticulture produce in 2020-21. The government made record procurement to match the record production. The government procured 433 lakh metric tonnes of wheat during the Rabi season benefiting about 50 lakh farmers. A record quantity of about 900 lakh metric tonnes of paddy was procured during Kharif season, benefiting 1 crore 30 lakh farmers.


 


	 Our agriculture exports have also reached a record level due to the efforts of the government. Agricultural exports registered a growth of more than 25 percent in the year 2020-21, and have reached nearly Rupees 3 lakh crore.


 


	Horticulture and honey production are important means of generating new sources of income for farmers, as also to provide them better access to markets. Because of incentives provided to honey production, domestic production of honey has reached 1 lakh 25 thousand metric tonnes in 2020-21, an increase of about 55 percent compared to 2014-15.  Export volume of honey has also grown by more than 102 percent as compared to 2014-15.


 


	In order to ensure remunerative prices to farmers for their crops, it is necessary that their products reach the right market. In this direction, the government has endeavoured to open new avenues of prosperity for the farmers by launching Kisan Rail Seva. During the Corona period, Indian Railways operated over 1,900 Kisan Rails on more than 150 routes to transport perishable food items like vegetables, fruits and milk, thereby transporting   about 6 lakh metric tonnes of agricultural produce. This is an example of how new avenues can be created from the existing resources if the thinking is innovative. 


 

Hon’ble members, 

 


	I would like to give maximum credit to the small farmers of the country for this consistent success and strengthening the agriculture sector. Interests of the small farmers, who constitute 80 percent of the farmer-community, have always been central to our government. Under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi, Rupees 1 lakh 80 thousand crore have been provided to more than 11 crore farmer families. With this investment, the agriculture sector is witnessing major transformations today. The small farmers of the country have also benefited from the new changes in the crop insurance scheme. More than Rupees one lakh crore have been given as compensation to about eight crore farmers since these changes were introduced.


 


	Government is also making investments at an unprecedented level for developing infrastructure required near farmlands. Thousands of projects have been approved under the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund having a corpus of Rupees one lakh crore. In order to ensure self-sufficiency in edible oil, my government has also launched the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm with an outlay of Rupees 11,000 crore. Government is also making special efforts like organic farming, natural farming and crop diversification.


 


	All of you are aware that the United Nations has declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets. My government will celebrate the International Year of Millets on a large scale with farmers, Self-Help Groups, FPOs, food industry and the common citizen. 


 


	My government is also working sincerely for rain water conservation. Special campaigns are being implemented for creation of rain water harvesting infrastructure and restoration of traditional water sources in the country. Sixty-four lakh hectares of land with irrigation facilities has also been developed in the country with the help of various projects under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana and Atal Bhu-jal Yojana. The government has also taken forward the plans for interlinking of rivers. Recently, the Ken-Betwa link project to be completed at a cost of Rupees 45,000 crore has also been approved. This project will be helpful in ending the water crisis in Bundelkhand.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	Women are playing an increasingly important role in providing impetus to rural economy. Banks have extended financial help to the tune of Rupees 65,000 crore to more than 28 lakh Self-Help Groups in 2021-22. This is four times the amount extended in 2014-15. The government has also provided training to thousands of members of the women self-help groups and made them partners as ‘Banking Sakhi’. These women are delivering banking services to rural households at the doorsteps. 


 


	Women’s empowerment is one of the top priorities of my government. We are all witness to the success of Ujjwala Yojana. Entrepreneurship and skills of the mothers and sisters of our country have been promoted through the ""Mudra"" scheme. “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” initiative has yielded many positive results, and there has been an encouraging improvement in the number of girls enrolled in schools. Treating sons and daughters as equals, my government has also introduced a Bill to increase the minimum age of marriage for women from 18 years to 21 years at par with men.


 


	The government has made a beginning to liberate the society from the manifestly arbitrary practice of Triple Talaq by making it a criminal offence. Restrictions on Muslim women from performing the Haj only with Mehram have also been removed. While about three crore students from minority communities were provided scholarships prior to 2014, my government has provided scholarships to 4.5 crore such students since 2014. This has led to a significant reduction in the school dropout rate of Muslim girls and an increase in their enrolment.


 


	A provision has also been made for Gender Inclusion Fund in the National Education Policy to promote learning capability among our daughters. It is a matter of happiness that all the existing 33 Sainik Schools have started admitting girl students. The government has also approved the admission of women cadets in the National Defence Academy. The first batch of women cadets will enter the NDA in June 2022. With the policy decisions and encouragement of my government, the number of women personnel in various police forces has more than doubled as compared to 2014.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	The great saint Thiruvalluvar had said:  


Karkka kasaddar karpawai katrapin,

Nirkka adarkka taga.

That is, what a person has learnt is reflected in his conduct.

 

My government is implementing a new National Education Policy across the country to give shape to the resolve and potential of Atmanirbhar Bharat.  Local languages ​​are also being promoted through the National Education Policy. Emphasis is being laid on conducting important entrance examinations for undergraduate courses in Indian languages ​​as well. This year, 19 engineering colleges in 10 states will start teaching in six Indian languages.

 


	Under the Skill India Mission, more than 2 crore 25 lakh youth across the country have been skilled through ITIs, Jan Shikshan Sansthans and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras. Many changes have also been made in the UGC regulations to link skills with higher education.


 


	In the battle against Corona, six special training programs related to health care have been launched under the Skill India Mission. These are helping the health care sector.


 


	Eklavya Residential Model Schools are being expanded to every tribal majority block for the education of tribal youth. These schools will empower about three and half lakh tribal youth.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	We have all witnessed the potential of India's youth power during the Tokyo Olympics. In its best performance ever in this international competition, India won seven medals. In the Tokyo Paralympics too, Indian para-athletes set a record by winning 19 medals. In order to improve India's performance in the Olympics and sports, the Central Government along with the state governments is setting up hundreds of Khelo India Centres in the country. The government has also established Centres for Disability Sports in Gwalior with modern facilities to provide training to Divyang youth in para sports.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	Accessibility, equality and a dignified life for Divyang people is our collective responsibility as a society. In this direction, Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan is a symbol of our national sensibility. The country is implementing several programs - from providing free assistive devices to Cochlear Implant surgery - in order to transform the lives of Divyang people. Under these programmes, more than 25 lakh assistive devices have been provided to Divyang people so far and about 4,000 successful Cochlear Implant surgeries have been performed. Taking these efforts forward, the government has also established the National Institute of Mental Health Rehabilitation in Madhya Pradesh. A 10,000-word Indian Sign Language Dictionary has also been developed for the future of Divyang youth.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	Our start-up industry is also an example of the infinite new possibilities that are rapidly taking shape under the leadership of our youth. Since 2016, sixty thousand new start-ups have been established in 56 different sectors in our country. More than six lakh jobs have been created by these start-ups. In 2021, during the Corona period, more than 40 unicorn start-ups have emerged in India, each with a minimum market valuation of Rupees 7,400 crore.


 


	Because of the policies of my government, the cost of internet connectivity and price of smartphones in India today are among the cheapest in the world. This has hugely benefitted our young generation. India is also working with great pace on 5G mobile connectivity, which will open doors to new opportunities.  India's efforts on semiconductors will significantly benefit our start-up ecosystem. The government has taken many policy decisions and opened up several new sectors so that our youth can benefit from rapidly changing technology. Through the Start-ups Intellectual Property Protection Program, the government has simplified and accelerated the processes related to patents and trademarks. As a result, nearly 6 thousand patents and more than 20 thousand trademarks have been applied for in this financial year.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	Due to consistent endeavors of my government, India has again emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world. GST collection has consistently remained above Rupees one lakh crore during the last several months.  Inflow of 48 billion dollars in the first seven months of the current financial year is a testimony to the belief the global investor community has in India’s growth story. India’s foreign exchange reserves today exceed 630 billion dollars. Our exports are also growing rapidly, breaking several past records. During April to December 2021, our goods-exports stood at 300 billion dollars or more than Rupees 22 lakh crore, which is one and a half times more than the corresponding period of 2020.


 


	My government has launched 14 key PLI schemes with an outlay of more than Rupees 1 lakh 97 thousand crore to fully realize the potential of the manufacturing sector and to create new opportunities for the youth. These PLI schemes will not only help transform India as a global manufacturing hub but also create over 60 lakh jobs. The domestic mobile manufacturing sector is a shining example of the success of the PLI scheme. Today India has emerged as the second largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world, generating lakhs of jobs for our youth.


 


	In order to develop our country as a global leader in the field of electronics and technology hardware, the government has also recently announced a package of Rupees 76,000 crore for silicon and compound semiconductor fabrication, display FAB, chip design and related ventures.


 


	Along with developing new areas, my government is restoring our traditional strength in domains in which we possess centuries of experience. In this direction, my government has approved seven Mega Integrated Textile Regions and Apparel Parks with an investment of about Rupees 4,500 crore. This will facilitate integrated textile value chain. These mega textile parks will attract both Indian and foreign investors, and create lakhs of new employment opportunities.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	Along with large companies, our small and medium enterprises have a critical role in India’s prosperity. Our MSMEs have been the backbone of our economy, and a driver of Atmanirbhar Bharat. In order to protect MSMEs from crisis and ensure adequate availability of credit during the Corona period, the government started a scheme for guaranteed Collateral Free Loans of Rupees 3 lakh crore. It is evident from the recent studies that this scheme has given a fresh lease of life to 13 lakh 50 thousand MSME units and also secured 1 crore 50 lakh jobs. In June 2021, the government has enhanced credit guarantee from Rupees 3 lakh crore to Rupees 4.5 lakh crore.


 


	 Several policy decisions have also been taken to expand the scope and opportunities for the MSME sector. The new definition of MSMEs is helping small industries to expand. The government has also permitted wholesale and retail traders, as well as street vendors to get themselves registered on the Udyam portal so that they can avail benefits of Priority Sector Lending.


 


	The success of Khadi also deserves a special mention. Khadi, which was a symbol of the country's consciousness during the freedom struggle under the leadership of Bapu, is once again becoming the mainstay of small entrepreneurs. With government’s efforts, sale of Khadi products has trebled in the country since 2014.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	Infrastructure is the foundation for development in any country. My government also views infrastructure as a bridge to address social inequality. Investment in infrastructure not only generates lakhs of new jobs, but also has a qualitative impact, enhancing ease of doing business, facilitating faster transport and promoting economic activities across sectors.


 


	My government has integrated different ministries to work in a synergised manner under the Pradhan Mantri Gatishakti National Master Plan to accelerate infrastructure development. This plan is going to usher in a new era of multi-modal transport in India. In future, the railways, highways and airways in India will no longer be separate and isolated infrastructures, but will be an integrated resource to the country.


 


	Construction of roads, resources and infrastructure in rural areas has opened up possibilities for the country which have been neglected for decades. The achievements of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana are something to be proud of. In the year 2020-21, 36 thousand 5 hundred kilometres of roads have been built in rural areas, at the rate of more than 100 km per day, and thousands of habitations have been connected with all-weather roads.


 


	Today, the national highways too are connecting the length and breadth of the country from east to west and north to south. As against 90 thousand kilometres of national highways in March 2014, today we have more than 1 lakh 40 thousand kilometres of national highways. Under the Bharatmala Project, construction of more than 20,000 kilometres of highways is in progress with an outlay of about Rupees 6 lakh crore, including 23 green expressways and green-field corridors.


 


	The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is also nearing completion; it will be the longest and fastest expressway in India. It is also a matter of privilege for my government to start widening of Sant Dnyaneshwar Marg and Sant Tukaram Palkhi Marg connecting Pandharpur temple.


 


	Today, while on the one hand the modern infrastructure of the country is opening ways for development, on the other hand it is also providing new strength to country’s security. Border Roads Organization has constructed a transport-worthy road at 19 thousand feet, the highest altitude for such a road, at Umling La Pass in Ladakh. Even the most remote villages like Demchok in Ladakh, Joling Kong in Uttarakhand and Huri in Arunachal Pradesh have been connected by modern roads.


 


	My government is also modernizing the Indian Railways at a fast pace. New Vande Bharat trains and new vistadome coaches have added new feathers to the Indian Railways. In the last seven years, 24,000 km of railway route has been electrified. Laying new railway tracks and double-laning are also progressing rapidly. Gandhinagar railway station in Gujarat and Rani Kamalapati railway station in Madhya Pradesh now provide new glimpse of modern India. The railway arch bridge being constructed on the Chenab River in Kashmir is also emerging as a centre of attraction.


 


	My government has also done remarkable work in the field of public transport, enhancing ease of living for the poor and the middle class. Eleven new metro routes have commenced, benefiting lakhs of people in 8 states every day. India is now also among the four countries in the world having largest driverless train networks. We have also developed Indigenous Automatic Train System in the country which symbolizes the growing capability of Make in India. The government has also accorded approval for the construction of 21 greenfield airports in the country, among which is the country’s biggest airport coming up at Gautam Buddha Nagar district in Uttar Pradesh.


 


	More than 80 connectivity projects are also in progress under the Sagarmala program to connect the country’s important commercial hubs with ports. So far, 5 existing National Waterways and 106 new waterways in 24 States have been declared as National Waterways, taking the total number of National Waterways to 111. Out of these, 23 waterways are viable for transportation of cargo. With the objective to modernizing infrastructure, more than 27 thousand circuit kilometres of transmission lines have also been laid by the government.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	In recent times, we have witnessed a new resolve of Atmanirbhar Bharat taking shape in the country. This resolve is getting further strengthened by the energy emanating from the slew of reforms. From new reforms in labour laws to reforms in banking sector, and to insolvency and bankruptcy code, this series of reforms is rolling on uninterrupted. Last year, more than 26 thousand compliance requirements have been reduced by different departments of Centre and States. Space sector has now been opened up for private sector, providing a horizon of endless possibilities. The formation of IN-SPACE last year is one such important step to enhance India's space capabilities.


 


	My government is also aware and proactive about the rapidly evolving drone technology and related opportunities. In this direction, the government has notified the simplified Drone Rules 2021, and has also launched a PLI scheme for manufacturing of drones and drone-parts in the country. This will help India to secure its position in this critical technology of the future.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	My government is working with utmost determination to ensure a safe and secure India. Due to the policies of the government in the defence sector, especially in defence production, the country is becoming increasingly self-reliant. 


 


	Of all the approvals accorded for modernization of armed forces in the year 2020-21, 87 per cent were from ‘Make in India’ category. Similarly, in 2020-21, preference was accorded to ‘Make in India’ category in 98 per cent of equipment related contracts. Our Armed forces have also issued a list of 209 military-equipment, which will not be purchased from abroad. A list of more than 2,800 defence equipment has also been issued by defence undertakings which will be manufactured domestically.


 


	A contract has been signed with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for manufacture of 83 LCA Tejas fighter aircraft. The government has also taken important steps for reorganization of Ordnance Factories into 7 Defence PSUs. Besides, the government is also committed to rapidly promote the private sector and start-ups in the defence sector. Our objective is that the products required by our Forces should be developed in India and also manufactured in India. 


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	India has strengthened its standing in the rapidly evolving global environment through improvement in diplomatic relations. India chaired the United Nations Security Council in August 2021 and took several path breaking decisions.  Under the presidency of India, for the first time, the Security Council held a comprehensive debate on the issue of maritime security. The Security Council, for the first time, adopted a Presidential Statement on this subject, and did so unanimously.


 


	We have witnessed instability and volatility in our neighbouring country, Afghanistan. In spite of the prevailing situation, true to the spirit of humanity, India launched Operation Devi Shakti. Despite the challenging conditions, we successfully airlifted a number of our citizens and many Afghan Hindu and Sikh minorities from Kabul. We also brought back two swaroops of the Holy Guru Granth Sahib safely amidst difficult situations. From the humanitarian point of view, India is helping Afghanistan by delivering medical supplies and food-grain.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	Climate change is a major challenge confronting the whole world at present. India has emerged as a responsible global voice on the subject. At the CoP-26 summit, my government has announced that by 2030 India will reduce its carbon emission by 1 billion tonnes. India has also committed to a target of becoming net zero emission economy by 2070. India has also taken the initiative of “Green Grid Initiative: One Sun, One World, One Grid” with the global community. It is the first international network of globally interconnected solar power grids. Our ambitions and resolves towards the environment are a testimony of our sensitivity towards nature.


 

Hon’ble members,

 


	My government considers it a responsibility to preserve, enrich and empower India's ancient heritage. It is a matter of pride that the Harappan site of Dholavira and the 13th century Kakatiya Rudreshwar Ramappa temple in Telangana have been declared as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. After the Kumbh Mela of Prayagraj, Kolkata's iconic Durga Puja has also been included in UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage List.


 


	It has also been a priority of the government that the priceless heritage of India should be brought back to the country. The idol of Maa Annapurna Devi, which was stolen from India a hundred years ago, has been brought back and installed in the Kashi Vishwanath temple. Many such historical artefacts are being brought back to India from different countries.


 


	We are all aware that heritage and tourism are closely linked to each other. That is why, while India's spiritual heritage is being rejuvenated, modern facilities and infrastructure are also being developed for the pilgrims and tourists. Swadesh Darshan and PRASAD schemes started by my government are playing a significant role in it.


 


	The Fort Aguada Jail Complex has also been renovated and inaugurated on the occasion of Goa's 60th Liberation Day. It is a memorial to the warriors of the unforgettable struggle to liberate Goa. 


 

Hon’ble members, 

 


	Today, in the Amrit Kaal of independence, our resolve of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat' is enabling us to write a new chapter of development on the basis of democratic values. Today the country is making special efforts for the states and regions hitherto left neglected.


 


	The beginning of a new era of development in Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh region is a great example of this. My government has started a new central sector scheme for the industrial development of Jammu & Kashmir at a cost of about Rupees 28,000 crore. Last year Qazigund-Banihal tunnel was opened to traffic. International flights between Srinagar and Sharjah have also started.


 


	Many important steps have also been taken to provide better opportunities for education, health and employment to the people of Jammu & Kashmir. At present, works are in progress on seven medical colleges and two AIIMS, one in Jammu and another in Kashmir. Construction of IIT Jammu and IIM Jammu is also going on in full swing.


 


	The Sindhu Infrastructure Development Corporation has been set up to accelerate infrastructure and economic development in the Union Territory of Ladakh. Another chapter in this development journey of Ladakh is being added in the form of Sindhu Central University.


 

Hon’ble members, 

 


	My government is committed to sustainable development of all the states of the North East – Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura. In these states, basic amenities and economic opportunities are being developed at every level. Rail and air connectivity are no longer a dream for the people of the North East, they are now able to experience them in reality. It is a matter of pride for the country that all the capitals of the North-Eastern states are now being brought on the railway map with the efforts of my government. 


 


	A new airport is being set up at Hollongi, Itanagar. A modern new terminal has recently been opened at the Maharaja Bir Bikram Airport in Tripura. This development of North East will prove to be a golden chapter in India's growth story. Just a few days ago, January 21 marked the 50th anniversary of the creation of Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura. The journey of these states, coinciding with 75 years of independence, is inspiring us for new resolves for their development.


 


	Efforts of my government to establish peace in the North East have attained historic success. Just a few months ago, a settlement was reached between the Central Government, the State Government of Assam and the Karbi groups to end the decades-old conflict in Karbi Anglong. This has ushered in a new chapter of peace and prosperity in the region. Due to concerted efforts of my government, the number of Naxal affected districts in the country has also come down from 126 to 70 today.


 

Hon’ble members, 

 


	My government is committed to increase accountability of government departments towards the citizens. All Ministries of Government of India are undertaking special drive for cleanliness and disposal of pending references. Under Mission Karmayogi, the Government has established the Capacity Building Commission for Civil Servants. Mission Karmayogi will be helpful for civil servants’ career, and will also prepare them for new responsibilities of nation building.


 


	Many important steps are also being taken in the country to make delivery of justice easier and more accessible. A platform has been set up for pre-litigation advice through tele-law program. To expedite the settlement of disputes, my government has introduced the Mediation Bill, 2021 in the Rajya Sabha. 


 

Hon’ble members, 

 


	Today the country's achievements and successes are as limitless as the country's potential and possibilities. These achievements are not of one institution or establishment; these are the collective achievements of more than a billion citizens of our country. These are the fruits of the labour and sweat of billion plus people. These achievements are milestones in the long journey to achieve our ambitious goals, and are our motivations to move forward.


 


	In the year 2047, the country will celebrate its centenary of independence. We have to work hard now for building a grand, modern and developed India of that time. We have to ensure that our hard work leads to fruitful results in the end. We all have a stake, and an equal stake in this journey.


 


	I appreciate the manner in which all the Members of Parliament have discharged their responsibilities, and the two Houses have functioned with all precautions during this challenging time of Corona.  You are the drivers of hopes and aspirations of crores of our people. It is with the same spirit that we have to keep working in future.


 


	I have firm belief that together we will take our great Bharatvarsha to the pinnacle of its glory. With the same spirit, I once again congratulate all of you. My profuse thanks to all of you!


Jai Hind!

                Honourable Members,

I welcome you all to the Joint Sitting of the Two Houses of Parliament. We have all recently celebrated the festivals of Pongal, Bihu, Lohri, Makar Sankranti and Vasant Panchami. For us, the Republic Day is also a major festival. The presence of Heads of States and Governments of ten ASEAN countries during this year’s Republic Day celebrations added a special dimension to our vision of ‘Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam’.

2018 is an important year for realising our vision of a New India. I am confident that peoples’ representatives present here, who have come from different parts of the country, would play an active role in accelerating this great journey for the development of our nation.

Honourable Members,

The architect of our Constitution, Baba Saheb Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar used to say that political democracy cannot survive without social and economic democracy. Guided by this fundamental spirit of the Constitution and committed to the welfare of weaker sections, my Government is working towards strengthening social justice and economic democracy and to usher ease of living for the common man.

Perhaps no one had imagined that construction of toilets could also contribute towards social justice. Construction of toilets not only protects their dignity but also fosters a feeling of social justice in women. The movement for social justice is becoming widespread day by day. It is our collective responsibility to pay a befitting tribute to Pujya Bapu by making the country Swachh by 2019 when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi.

Here in this House, there are many like me who for years have seen women collecting firewood for cooking. They and their children had no option but to endure the ill effects of smoky kitchens causing disease and suffering. ‘Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana’ has empowered these poor women to enjoy equal rights with their privileged counterparts thereby addressing a hitherto ignored aspect of social justice. So far, under this scheme, over 3 crore 30 lakh cooking gas connections have been provided.

Honourable Members,

For decades, the dignity of Muslim women has remained captive to political cost-benefit. Now the Nation has an opportunity to emancipate them from this situation. My Government has tabled a Bill on Triple Talaq in Parliament. I hope that the Parliament will soon pass it into a law. The law on Triple Talaq, once enacted, will also enable Muslim sisters and daughters to live a life of self-respect with courage.

To eradicate discrimination against daughters, my Government had introduced the ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ scheme. Seeing its positive results, the scheme has been extended from 161 districts to 640 districts.

The Government has also taken a big step by amending the Maternity Benefit Act. It now provides for 26 weeks of paid leave in place of 12 weeks. Working women will now be able to devote more time towards their new born children during their crucial formative years.

Honourable Members,

My Government which feels for the poor is implementing schemes for further strengthening economic democracy in the country. We are moving towards bridging the gap between the country’s banking system and the poor completely. Under the ‘Jan Dhan Yojana’, so far, about 31 crore bank accounts have been opened for the poor. Women have especially benefitted from the scheme with the percentage of Savings Bank accounts held by them going up to more than 40 per cent from the earlier 28 per cent. 

To make bank credit accessible to the poor and middle class and to encourage self-employment, my Government has facilitated provision of credit without insisting on bank guarantee. Through easy access to credit, people are now able to fulfil their dream of setting up their own enterprise. Under the ‘Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana’, about 10 crore loans have been sanctioned so far and more than Rs. 4 lakh crore worth of loans have been disbursed. About 3 crore first time beneficiaries have received assistance under this scheme for self employment.

The endeavour of the Government towards strengthening economic and social democracy is helping redefine our national life. These efforts are establishing a new social order in the country which provides equal opportunity to the poor to march ahead.

Honourable Members,

The highest priority of my Government is to remove various difficulties faced by farmers and to raise their standard of living. The schemes of my Government are not only removing their hardships but also reducing the expenditure incurred by them on farming.

As a result of Government’s policies and the hardwork of farmers, a record production of more than 275 million tonnes of food grain and about 300 million tonnes of horticultural produce has been achieved in the country.

My Government is committed to doubling of farmers’ income by 2022. To ensure remunerative price to the farmers for their produce, the agriculture mandis are being connected online. So far, agricultural commodities valued at about Rs. 36 thousand crore have been traded on e-NAM portal.

The work of completing 99 Irrigation projects that were held up for decades is in progress.

Government is also protecting the interests of farmers by giving production bonus on pulses and oil seeds. As a result of Government’s policy for pulses, their production went up by more than 38 per cent as compared to last year, which is a record.

To prevent damage to agriculture produce before it reaches the market and to ensure its safe storage, “Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana” has been launched. The supply chain and infrastructure in the agricultural sector are being modernized under this scheme.

To enhance the income of farmers, an ambitious scheme has been introduced in the Dairy sector under which a ‘Dairy Processing Infrastructure Development Fund’ with a corpus of Rs. 11 thousand crore is being set up.

While on one hand, my Government’s policies have helped in increasing the production of urea, on the other, mandatory 100 per cent Neem coating of urea has eliminated its black marketing. The work on reopening of fertilizer plants at Gorakhpur, Barauni, Sindri,Talcher and Ramagundam is progressing at a fast pace. 

Honourable Members,

My Government is working actively and with sensitivity to remove the feeling of economic insecurity among the poor, farmers and senior citizens.

Under ‘Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana’, farmers are being provided affordable and simple crop insurance services. During 2017, under Rabi & Kharif crops, 5 crore 71 lakh farmers were provided protective coverage under this scheme.

Similarly, my Government has introduced insurance schemes for the poor at a premium of 1 rupee per month and 90 paise per day. More than 18 crore poor have been covered under the ‘Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana’ and ‘Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana’ and about Rs. 2 thousand crore has been paid out as claims. 

My Government is also committed towards social security of senior citizens. Under the ‘Atal Pension Yojana’, about 80 lakh senior citizens have benefitted.

Honourable Members,

Following the path of Ekatm Manav-vad (Integral Humanism) propounded by Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, my Government is developing mechanisms to ensure that benefits of development reach the poorest of the poor.

About 2 lakh 70 thousand Common Service Centres have been set up that provide digital services at low cost, even in the remotest areas of the country.

Under the ‘Bharat Net Project’, the Government is providing broadband connectivity to 2 lakh 50 thousand Gram Panchayats. In the first phase, more than one lakh Panchayats have already been connected. This project will play a major role in taking e-health, e-education, e-governance and e-commerce to each village of the country.

To illuminate the lives of the poor and to enable them to move forward on the path to development, my Government is providing electricity connections to 4 crore poor people under the “Saubhagya” Yojana.

To ensure that benefits of development reach all sections of society, my Government is actively pursuing the work of connecting all villages under the ‘Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana’. As compared to 2014 when only 56 per cent of the villages had road connectivity, now more than 82 per cent villages mostly in far flung and inaccessible areas have been connected by roads. Our target is to provide road connectivity to every village by 2019.

To ensure availability of two square meals to every poor person, effective enforcement of National Food Security Act is necessary. The distribution of food grains at cheap rates under this Act is being made transparent and leakage proof in all States of the country.

Honourable Members,

Working for the upliftment and dignity of all weaker and deprived sections of society is my Government’s priority.

My Government is sensitive towards the aspirations of every section of society and has introduced a Constitution Amendment Bill to provide Constitutional Status to the National Commission for Backward Classes.

A Commission has been constituted to examine the sub-categorization of backward classes so that the benefits of higher education and jobs can be availed by the most backward sections among the backward classes.

Minimum Support Price of several forest produce collected by the tribal people has been increased.

Lives of lakhs of people in tribal areas especially in the North East region are dependent on bamboo industry. Inclusion of bamboo in the category of tree had adversely affected livelihoods associated with it. Keeping in mind these difficulties, my Government has excluded bamboo from the category of tree. This has now provided freedom to cut, transport and use bamboo.

Adivasi Swatantrata Sangram Sangrahalayas are being established to honour the invaluable contribution of tribal communities in the independence struggle. Recently, the foundation stone of first such museum was laid in Kevadia, Gujarat on the banks of Narmada, near the Sardar Sarovar Dam. Proposals of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chattishgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Manipur and other States are also under consideration.

Honourable Members,

There are more than 2 crore 50 lakh Divyang jan in our country. My Government is continuously working with utmost sensitivity towards their empowerment and economic inclusion. Government has enacted the ‘Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016’. Provision has been made for 4 per cent reservation in government jobs and 5 per cent reservation in higher education for Divyang jan. In the last three years, over 6 thousand camps have been organised benefitting more than 9 lakh needy Divyang jan with necessary aids and assistive devices. 

Honourable Members,

Committed to “Empowerment and not Appeasement”, my Government is making intensive efforts for economic, social and educational empowerment of the minorities.

Employment opportunities have been provided to the youth belonging to Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi and Jain communities through programmes, such as, ‘Seekho Aur Kamao’, ‘Usttad’, ‘Garib Nawaz Kaushal Vikas Yojana’, ‘Nai Roshni’ etc.

More than 45 lakh students have also benefitted from scholarships, fellowships, skill development and coaching schemes during the last one year.

Keeping in mind the objective of womens’ empowerment, for the first time since independence, the restriction on women above 45 years of age to perform Haj pilgrimage unaccompanied by their male relatives has been removed. This year, more than 1300 women are going on Haj pilgrimage without Mehram.

Honourable Members,

With a sensitive approach towards providing housing with availability of water-electricity-toilet facility to all, my Government is targeting to provide a house to every poor and homeless household by the year 2022.

Over the last three and a half years, more than 93 lakh houses have been constructed by the Government in rural and urban areas. Under the ‘ Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Urban’ , interest subvention of 6 percent is being provided to the poor. In addition, for the first time, two new schemes have been launched keeping the middle class in mind.

Honourable Members,

One of the major worries of the poor and middle class relates to treatment of diseases. The financial burden of treatment of disease further aggravates the suffering.

A new ‘National Health Policy’ has been formulated by my Government for providing better and affordable healthcare facilities to the poor and middle class. In addition, under the ‘National AYUSH Mission’, traditional methods of treatment, such as, Yoga and Ayurveda are being promoted. It gives me pleasure to share with you that:


	Through the ‘Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi’ Kendras, 800 different medicines are being made available to the poor people at affordable rates. More than 3 thousand such kendras have been established in the country.
	Under the ‘Deendayal Amrut Yojana’, over 5200 lifesaving branded medicines and surgical implants are being provided through 111 outlets at discounts ranging from 60 per cent to 90 per cent. 
	In addition to medicines for heart patients, the cost of stent has been reduced up to 80 percent. The cost of knee implant has also been regulated.
	Under the ‘Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme’, in over 500 districts, more than 22 lakh dialysis sessions for 2.25 lakh patients have been conducted at discounted rates.
	To enhance the availability of doctors, 7 thousand post graduate seats and over 13 thousand MBBS seats have been approved.
	To ensure quality and transparency in medical education, Government has also introduced the ‘National Medical Commission Bill’ in the Lok Sabha.
	I am happy to inform that the annual rate of increase in immunization coverage in the country has increased from 1 percent to 6.7 percent. This has benefitted children living in far-flung and particularly tribal areas of our country. Recently, my Government has also launched the ‘Intensified Mission Indradhanush’.


Honourable Members,

Education provides the foundation for building the future of the Nation. My Government is committed to strengthening and modernising School and Higher Education system in the country.

My Government has approved over 2400 ‘Atal Tinkering Labs’ under ‘Atal Innovation Mission’, in order to inculcate a spirit of entrepreneurship and creativity in children at an early age.

My Government has approved setting up of a ‘National Testing Agency’ as an autonomous and self-sufficient organization to conduct all examinations of higher educational institutions in the country.

To ensure a bright future for the youth, my Government is working actively towards setting up of 20 ‘Institutes of Eminence’. Under this Mission, selected public sector institutions will be provided financial assistance of Rs.10 thousand crore.

A law has also been enacted to provide autonomy to all ‘Indian Institutes of Management’ in order to upgrade them further.

Honourable Members,

Our country is the youngest among all nations in the world. My Government is implementing programmes like Start Up India, Stand Up India, Skill India Mission, Mudra Yojana to provide self-employment to the youth and to enable them to fulfill their dreams.

My Government has recently approved two schemes – ‘SANKALP’ and ‘STRIVE’ for skill development of youth in line with the needs of the industry. 

Enterprises or companies creating new employment opportunities are being provided financial assistance under the ‘Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana’. Over 20 lakh people have benefited under this scheme.

About 5 lakh youth have benefitted under the ‘National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme’.

Our workers play a central role in Nation Building. Sensitive towards safeguarding their interests, my Government is continuously working for reforms in Labour laws. 

My Government has increased the minimum wage of workers by more than 40 per cent. The number of registers for compliance of Labour laws has also been reduced from 56 to 5. All returns are now filed online on the Shram Suvidha Portal.

Honourable Members,

Excellence in sporting arena is viewed as an indicator of progress in the world. Alive to all round development of youth, my Government is working towards registering an effective presence in sports on the world stage.

In recent months, International Sports Competitions like FIFA Under-17 World Cup and Asian Athletic Championship have been successfully organized in the country. This has not only enhanced the prestige of the country in the sports arena but has also increased attraction towards sport disciplines like Football.

My Government has started an ambitious campaign namely ‘Khelo India Programme’ with an outlay of over Rs. 1750 crore.

For transparent selection of talented sportspersons, a ‘Sports Talent Search Portal’ has been started.

A scheme has been launched to provide stipend of Rs. 6 lakh per annum to one thousand talented sportspersons.

Honourable Members,

The cultural heritage of our country is a part of our identity and provides the foundation for ‘Ek Bharat- Shreshtra Bharat’.

It is a matter of pride for us that recently Kumbh Mela was included in the list of ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity’. Last year, UNESCO has accorded Ahmedabad the status of India’s first ‘Heritage City’. Chennai, on account of its glorious tradition of music, has been included in the list of Creative Cities by UNESCO.

It is my Government’s continuous endeavor to preserve and protect our historical heritage through programmes such as ‘Swadesh Darshan’ and ‘Amrut Yojana’.

Honourable Members,

Our Space programme contributes immensely in providing right information in a timely manner to farmers, fishermen, students, scientists, thus contributing to the development of the country. Towards this end, India’s ambitious space programme is accomplishing new heights in promoting national development and in furthering regional and international cooperation.

For the first time in the world, 104 Satellites were launched successfully at one go by ISRO.

In June 2017, the first developmental flight of India’s GSLV MK-III was successfully launched which marked an important step in taking forward the launch capability of the country.

Last year on 5th May, ISRO launched the South Asian Satellite which demonstrated India’s commitment towards sharing benefits of its technical capabilities with neighbouring countries.

This year on 12th January, ISRO made the country proud by successfully launching the PSLV-C40. On this day, ISRO also scored a century of satellites launched.

Honourable Members,

In this modern era of digital connectivity, my Government is continuously working towards ensuring that our countrymen and future generations are able to harness the power of digital technology. The Digital India Mission is proving to be a milestone in providing due recognition and in securing the rights of the poor and deprived. 

My Government is implementing the largest Digital Literacy Programme of the world under the ‘Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharata Abhiyan’. So far, one crore people have been made digitally literate.

‘BHIM App’ is playing a major role in promoting digital transactions. The recently launched ‘Umang App’ has made more than 100 public services available on mobile phones.

‘Aadhar’ has helped in securing the rights of the poor by eliminating middlemen. At present, Digital Payments are being carried out in more than 400 schemes of the Government. As a result, it has become possible to provide Government benefits to the genuine beneficiaries. Till now, more than Rs. 57 thousand crore have been prevented from going into the wrong hands.

As a result of commendable efforts in the field of electronic manufacturing, the number of mobile companies in the country have gone up from a mere 2 in 2014 to 113. This has helped in providing new employment opportunities to our youth in small towns of the country.

Honourable Members,

Digital and physical connectivity play a big role in country’s balanced development. My Government is striving towards enhancing connectivity and is equipping the transport sector to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Modern transport arrangements are being developed in a manner that different modes complement each other.

Railways remain the main mode of transport even today and that is why investment in Railways for capacity development and modernization is being enhanced continuously. My Government is committed to the construction of world class Railways. Work on Mumbai-Ahmedabad High speed bullet train has commenced.

My Government has formulated a new Metro Rail Policy which lays emphasis on ‘last mile connectivity’. Presently, Metro work is in progress in 11 cities of the country.

Recently, my Government has approved an ambitious programme for development of highways namely ‘Bharatmala’. A provision of Rs. 5 lakh 35 thousand crore has been made for this. Under this project, in order to enhance National Corridor Efficiency, about 53 thousand km. of National Highways have been identified.

Under ‘Jalmarg Vikas Pariyojana’, major projects on Ganga river have started in Varanasi, Sahibganj, Farakka and Haldia.

Under the ‘Sagarmala programme’, works on Special Economic Zone in Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and ‘Smart Port Industrial Cities’ in Paradip and Deen Dayal Port Trust have been taken up.

To provide air connectivity to smaller cities and to enable the lower middle class, middle class and young people to fly, “Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik” or ‘UDAN’ scheme has been launched. While only 76 airports of the country were connected with commercial flights since Independence, under the aegis of ‘UDAN’, work has been initiated to connect 56 airports and 31 helipads in a short span of 15 months. So far, flights have commenced from 16 such airports.

Along with improving connectivity, these schemes are also generating new employment opportunities.

Honourable Members,

For the first time, increase in Power generation capacity in the country has exceeded the target. Today, India has become a net exporter of power.

My Government has ensured power availability to States at cheap rates by completing work on the ‘One Nation, One Grid’. Schemes worth Rs. 1.5 lakh crore have been implemented to strengthen the power distribution network in all villages and towns of the country. The work of electrifying 18 thousand villages is also nearing completion.

As of now, more than 28 crore LED bulbs have been distributed under ‘UJALA scheme’ and the private sector has also sold over 50 crore LED bulbs. This has resulted in an annual saving of over Rs. 40 thousand crore in the electricity bills for poor and middle class. In addition to conserving the environment, this has also resulted in an annual saving of 10 thousand crore units of electricity to the nation.

Mission to save electricity and efforts to increase electricity production are moving hand in hand. In last three years, solar energy generation has increased by seven times.

With Indian efforts, the International Solar Alliance has now become a legal entity. Its headquarter has been set up in India. 

Honourable Members,

With the objective of taking the benefits of development to every part of the country, my Government is working with sensitivity towards achieving the hopes and aspirations of the people of North-East.

To accelerate the pace of development of this area, North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme has been sanctioned recently, with 100 percent central assistance. Under this scheme, projects relating to drinking water supply, energy, education and health will be completed.

To strengthen electricity transmission and distribution network in the North Eastern States, Government has sanctioned schemes worth Rs. 10 thousand crore in the last three years.

In Mizoram, a Hydro Electric Power Project constructed at a cost of Rs. 913 crore has been dedicated to the nation recently.

My Government is also striving to enhance road connectivity in the North-East.

Work on Agartala-Akhaura rail-link which will connect India and Bangladesh is progressing rapidly.

Shillong –Tura road project was dedicated to the people last year in December. This road will improve connectivity in the entire North-East region.

Last year, the longest river-bridge of the country- Dhola-Sadiyaa- was also dedicated to the nation. This bridge has reduced distance between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh by 165 kilometers.

My Government has also decided to develop the Barak River as National Waterway-16.

Honourable Members,

Due to regular efforts of the Central and State Governments, there has been a significant improvement in internal security of the country. The North East has also witnessed an improvement in the security situation. There has been a reduction in incidents of Naxal-Maoist violence. For this, the enlightened citizens of the region, our military, paramilitary and police forces deserve to be congratulated. We commend all our security personnel and pay heartfelt tribute to the martyrs.

Terrorist violence in the interiors of Jammu & Kashmir is directly related to cross-border infiltration. With better coordination, our Army, Para-Military Forces and Jammu-Kashmir Police are giving a befitting response to the perpetrators.

My Government has kept open the path of dialogue with those who wish to shun violence and join the main stream, while reposing faith in the Constitution of India. In the past three years, maximum number of youth influenced by the Naxal-Maoist ideology, have surrendered and joined the main stream.

My Government has also recently sanctioned a scheme of more than Rs. 18 thousand crore for the modernization of Police Forces.

The policy related to Strategic Partnership in Defence Manufacturing sector has also been given a final shape. This will encourage maximum participation of private sector in the manufacture of major defence platforms and equipment and would provide a fillip to employment generation.

My Government has fulfilled its commitment of ‘One Rank One Pension’ and disbursed arrears of more than Rs. 10 thousand crore to over 20 lakh retired armed forces personnel.

Honourable Members,

Service to humanity is an integral part of India’s cultural heritage. Because of these values, India has always remained the First Responder in times of crises, such as the earthquake in Nepal, flood calamity in Sri Lanka and drinking water crisis in Maldives.

Today, all Indians residing in any corner of the world are confident that in case of a crisis, their Government will provide them with a safe passage to the country. More than 90 thousand Indians stranded abroad have been safely brought back since 2014.

Due to the successful diplomatic efforts of my Government, there has been a new found respect for India. As a result, India has been able to secure representation in the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, International Maritime Organization and Economic and Social Council. In a keenly contested election to the International Court of Justice, India emerged victorious.

Subsequent to inclusion in the Missile Technology Control Regime last year, India has been inducted as a member in the Wassenar Arrangement and Australia Group this year. This success has come after a long wait and with prolonged efforts and is an important achievement of my Government.

The commencement of operations at Chabahar Port is a historic event. First shipment of wheat has been sent to Afghanistan through this Port. An Air-corridor between India and Afghanistan has been made operational this year and shipment of freight has started.

Ties with Indian Diaspora are being progressively strengthened. On 9th January this year, on the occasion of ‘Parvasi Bhartiya Divas’, a Conference of Parliamentarians of Indian origin was organized for the first time in which elected representatives from 24 countries participated.

The Ministry of External Affairs, in collaboration with Department of Posts, has embarked upon a comprehensive programme for expansion of Passport services in the country. Under this programme, establishment of 251 Passport Service Kendras has been announced, of which 60 centres have started functioning.

Honourable Members,

To consolidate the foundation of development in the country, my Government has taken up the strengthening of financial institutions on priority.

As a result of this, India’s growth rate remained impressive despite global economic slow-down. During the first quarter of 2016-17, the economy witnessed a temporary slowdown in GDP growth. The second quarter of 2017-18, however, has seen a reversal of this trend. In the last 3 and a half years, the rate of inflation as well as Government’s fiscal and current account deficits have, on an average, shown a decline.

In 2017, Foreign Exchange Reserves have risen to a level of more than US dollar 410 billion. Appropriate policies adopted by my Government have contributed to an increase in Foreign Direct Investment from US Dollar 36 billion to US Dollar 60 billion during the last three years.

Honourable Members,

With a view to resolving the problems of citizens, my Government has accorded priority to simplification of procedures. In the last three years, 1428 obsolete laws have been repealed and this is a continuous process.

Working towards achieving robust and inclusive development, my Government is striving to institutionalize honesty and develop transparent systems in the country.

To achieve economic integration of the country, my Government has introduced GST which is the biggest tax-reform since Independence. My Government has also constituted the National Anti-profiteering Authority so that benefits of lower prices of goods and services are passed on to the consumers.

My Government is also committed to revitalizing the banking system and to make it transparent. It has been decided to re-capitalise the public sector banks by infusing more than Rs. 2 lakh crore of capital in them.

Our fight against corruption continues. Towards this end, registration of about 3 lakh 50 thousand dubious companies has been cancelled in the last one year.

To bring transparency in government procurement and to provide opportunity to maximum number of entrepreneurs, a new system - Government E-market place has been created by the name of GeM. With the help of GeM portal, even the smallest of entrepreneurs are now capable of selling their products to Government.

To give preference to Make in India in public procurement, a new policy has been formulated. This policy promotes domestic manufacturing and services which in turn would create new opportunities for employment.

The Central Government is working together with States for creating a favourable business environment.

As a result of these efforts of my Government, India has moved up from 142nd to 100th rank in the Ease of Doing Business ranking of the World Bank. This has improved the credibility of the country in the global market.

Honourable Members,

The effort of my Government is to achieve welfare of the people through public participation. My Government is taking feedback by communicating with the youth, women, farmers, entrepreneurs, students, workers and also from the people of civil society. Their suggestions are being incorporated in the policies and decisions of the Government.

Honourable Members,

Citizens alive to the state of governance in the country are concerned about the frequent elections in one part of the country or another, which adversely impact the economy and development. Frequent elections not only impose a huge burden on human resources but also impede the development process due to the promulgation of the model code of conduct. Therefore, a sustained debate is required on the subject of simultaneous elections and all political parties need to arrive at a consensus on this issue.

Honourable Members,

Nation building is a continuous process in which each citizen of the country has a role to play. It is our responsibility to exhibit exemplary conduct before the nation. The completion of time bound goals towards Nation Building is our collective responsibility.

Attaining these goals by 2022, when the Nation celebrates the 75th year of Independence, would not only fulfil the dream of our freedom fighters and founding fathers but also strengthen the foundation of New India.

Dream of a New India does not belong to one political party or organization. It is an embodiment of the aspirations and expectations of 1 hundred 30 crore countrymen. To fulfil this dream, we all have to work together with complete dedication.

Come, let us all work towards achieving the ideals of equality and fraternity enshrined in our Constitution. Let us move ahead together in one direction with full commitment and energy towards creating a glorious India.

 

Jai Hind!

During the conversation, the President said that we are honoured by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s presence at our Republic Day and the ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit. The President stated that India had a longstanding relationship with her and her family.  And Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Mughal Gardens also have a special connection with her. The President presented her bush roses from the Long Garden of Rashtrapati Bhavan.  

The President said that Myanmar occupies the highest priority for India under its ‘Neighbourhood First’ and ‘Act East’ policies.  He assured India’s continued support to the Government of Myanmar in its peace process, and efforts towards national reconciliation and economic and social development.  

The President said the India-Myanmar relationship will get a boost if we ensure that our strong political and cultural bonds are supported by commerce. Bilateral trade of just over US $ 2 billion is not reflective of our close ties.  There is immense scope for cooperation in sectors such as power, renewable energy, hydrocarbons and health.

                My Dear Fellow Citizens 

 


	Greetings to all of you on the eve of our 69th Republic Day. This is a day for all of us to celebrate and honour our nation and our sovereignty. This is a day to remember with gratitude the enormous efforts and sacrifices of millions of freedom fighters whose blood and sweat gave us Independence and created our Republic. Above all, this is a day to cherish our republican values. 


 


	A Republic is its people. Citizens do not just make up and preserve a Republic; they are its ultimate stakeholders and in fact pillars. Each one of us is a pillar – the soldier who defends our Republic; the farmer who feeds our Republic; the forces that keep our Republic safe; the mother who nurtures our Republic; the doctor who heals our Republic; the nurse who tends to our Republic; the sanitation worker who makes our Republic cleaner and hygienic; the teacher who educates our Republic; the scientist who innovates for our Republic; the missile technologist who puts our Republic on a new trajectory; the wise tribal who conserves the ecology of our Republic; the engineer who re-imagines our Republic; the construction worker who builds our Republic; senior citizens who can look back with pride at how far they have brought our Republic; the youth in whom lie the energy, hopes and future of our Republic; and our dear children, who dream for our Republic.


 


	There are so many more who contribute to our Republic in diverse ways and whom I may have missed mentioning. Happy Republic Day to all of you.  


 


	India became a Republic on January 26, 1950. This was the second major milestone in our nation building process. Independence had come a little over two years earlier. But it was with the framing and adoption of the Constitution – and the birth of the Republic of India – that we truly achieved the ethic of equality among all citizens, irrespective of religion, region or community. This ethic of equality complemented the liberty that had come at Independence. And a third principle also defined both the cooperative efforts at creating our Republic as well as the India that we wished to be. This was the principle of fraternity. 


 


	Independence had come after a great struggle in which millions had participated. They gave their all; many gave their lives. Inspired and led by Mahatma Gandhi, the men and women who took us to freedom could have rested on the gaining of Independence. They could have let down their guard, and remained satisfied with political freedom. But they did not rest. Instead, they re-doubled their efforts. They immersed themselves in the process of writing a Constitution. They saw the Constitution not just as a basic law for a new nation, but as a scripture for social transformation. 


 


	Our Constitution framers were men and women with great foresight. They understood the majesty of the rule of law, and of rule by laws. They represented an important phase in our national life. We are fortunate to have inherited its legacy in the form of the Constitution and the Republic.


 

FELLOW CITIZENS


	The lessons from that formative period, the period that gave shape to our Republic, serve us well to this day. They serve us well in whatever we do, wherever we work, whichever goal we aim for. These lessons continue to spur our nation building project. Nation building is a grand project. But it is also the compilation of a million – rather, a billion – smaller projects, each as sacred as the other. Nation building is also about building a family, building a neighbourhood, building a community, building an enterprise, building an institution. And building society. 


 


	A happy and equal-opportunity nation is built by happy and equal-opportunity families and communities. Families where girls have the same rights and the same access to education and healthcare as boys. Governments can bring in policies and laws to ensure justice to women – but these policies and laws can only be made effective by families and communities that must hear the voices of our daughters. We cannot shut our ears to their urgings for change.


 


	A confident and forward-looking nation is built by confident and forward-looking young people. Over 60 per cent of our fellow citizens are below the age of 35. It is in them that our hopes lie. We have made strides in spreading literacy; now we must expand the frontiers of education and of knowledge. Our aspiration must be to reform, upgrade and enlarge our education system – and to make it relevant to 21st century realities of the digital economy, genomics, robotics and automation.


 

Many programmes and initiatives have been launched to equip our youth with the education and skills to compete in a globalised world. Sizeable resources have been set aside for these programmes. It is for our talented young people to make the most of these opportunities.

 


	An innovative nation is built by innovative children. This must be our obsessive goal. Our schooling system has to encourage our children to think and to tinker, not just to memorise and reproduce. We have made strides in tackling hunger, but the challenge of malnutrition and of bringing the right micronutrients to the plate of every child is still there. This is important for both physical and cognitive development of our children – and for the future of our country. We simply have to invest in our human capital. 


 


	A civic-minded nation is built by civic-minded neighbourhoods, whether in our cities or our villages. Where we respect the next-door person’s space, privacy and rights. Where we do not inconvenience our neighbours – while celebrating a festival or while resorting to a protest or on any other occasion. Where one can disagree with another viewpoint – or even with a historical context - without mocking a fellow citizen’s dignity and personal space. This is fraternity in action.


 


	A nation with a sense of selflessness is built by citizens and by a society that embraces selflessness. Where voluntary groups clean public places such as beaches and rivers. And care for orphaned children and homeless people, and even for homeless animals. Where we donate blood or a body organ to help a fellow citizen who may be a stranger to us. Where idealistic individuals travel to remote places to teach children, and change their lives with the magic of education. They do so not because anybody has asked them to, but because of a call from within. 


 

Where a better-off family voluntarily gives up an entitlement – it could be subsidised LPG today and some other entitlement tomorrow – so that another family, which has a greater need, can avail it. Let us all collate our privileges and entitlements. And then look at less-privileged members of a similar background, those who are starting off from where we once started off. And let each of us introspect and ask: Is his need or her need greater than mine? The spirit of philanthropy and of giving is part of our age-old culture. Let us renew it.

 


	A culturally vibrant nation is built by a collective will that cherishes and preserves cultural traditions, art forms and handicrafts. Whether these be folk theatre artistes, traditional musicians, weavers and handloom workers, or those whose families have been hand-making marvellous wooden toys for centuries. Or day-to-day articles made of bamboo.


 


	A disciplined and morally upright nation is built by disciplined and morally upright institutions. Institutions that respect their fraternal relationship with other institutions. Institutions that maintain the integrity, discipline and limits of their functioning, without compromising on excellence. Institutions that are always more important than the individuals located there. And institutions where the holders and members make every attempt to live up to the office they occupy as trustees of the people.


 


	And of course the highest stage of India’s nation building project is to contribute to building a better world – a composite and cohesive world, a world at peace with itself and at peace with nature. This is the ideal of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam – of the World being One Family. It is an ideal that may sound impractical in today’s times of tensions and of terrorism. But it is an ideal that has inspired India for thousands of years – and that ideal can be felt in the very texture of our constitutional values. The principles of compassion, of assisting those in need, of building capacities of our neighbours, or even of those further away, underpin our society. These are the very principles that we bring to the international community.


 


	Such principles are also meant for our global Indian family. When Indians living abroad face humanitarian or similar challenges, it is natural for us as a country to reach out to them. We have, and we will continue to do so.  


 

FELLOW CITIZENS


	I referred earlier to that glorious period between Independence and our first Republic Day. This was a period of constant striving – of dedication, determination and commitment to improving our country. And setting right the aberrations of our society. Today, we are at a similar juncture. We have achieved a lot as a nation, but much remains to be done. We need to work on this in the spirit of the generation that gave us our Republic. 


 


	In 2020, our Republic will turn 70. In 2022, we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of our Independence. These are special occasions and we must strive, in the manner of the leaders of our national movement and the framers of our Constitution, to build the edifice of a better India – an India where each and every citizen will be able to realise his or her full potential. An India that will reach its deserved pedestal in the 21st century.  


 


	We need to further improve the lives of our hardworking farmers. Like mothers, they toil to feed us – more than a billion of us. We need to continue to modernise and strengthen our strategic manufacturing sector so as to provide the valiant personnel of our Armed Forces, and our police and paramilitary forces, the equipment that they need. We need to move ahead rapidly on the Sustainable Development Goals – Goals that commit us to eliminating poverty and hunger, to universal access to quality education and healthcare, and to giving our daughters equal opportunity in every field. We need to make clean, green, efficient and affordable energy reach our people. We need to ensure that housing for all becomes a living reality for the millions of families who await their own home. We need to craft a modern India that is both a land of talent – and a land of unlimited opportunities for that talent. 


 


	Above all, our Republic cannot rest and cannot be satisfied without meeting the basic needs and essential dignity of our less well-off brothers and sisters. I refer to those from a less privileged socio-economic background, from the weaker communities and from families that still live at the edge of poverty. It is our sacred obligation to eliminate the curse of poverty in the shortest possible time. This is non-negotiable for the Republic.


 

FELLOW CITIZENS


	The promise of a developed India beckons us. This is the new stage of our nation building project on which we have embarked. This is the Republic that our young people need to take forward and enhance – in keeping with their vision, their ambition and their ideals. And their vision, ambition and ideals, I am confident, will always draw inspiration from both our republican values – as well as from our ancient Indian ethos.


 


	With those words, I once again wish all of you a very happy Republic Day. And wish all of you a very bright and fulfilling future.


 

Thank you

 

JAI HIND!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced the 8th National Voters’ Day celebrations today (January 25, 2018) in New Delhi. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that we have been celebrating National Voters Day on January 25 every year since 2011. The aim is to encourage our voters to participate enthusiastically in the democratic process. And that is why the relevance of this day is even more pronounced on the eve of Republic Day. The President congratulated young voters who have just turned 18 and got the right to vote for the first time.

The President said that voting in elections is a spiritual rite in a democracy, with every single vote as a sacred offering. Our Constitution empowers an independent Election Commission. And our election process makes every vote important, with the right to equality and freedom. As such Indian democracy is known through the world for its maturity and stability.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received the ASEAN Heads of State and Government at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (January 25, 2018) and hosted a lunch in their honour. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India-ASEAN relations have come a long way since we established our Dialogue Partnership with ASEAN on January 28, 1992. Today, ASEAN is a Strategic Partner for India. We have 30 dialogue mechanisms between India and ASEAN, including Annual Summits and 7 Ministerial Meetings in a wide range of sectors.

The President said that India’s “Act East policy” reinforces our ancient links with Southeast Asia through enhanced political, security, economic and cultural ties. In this context, India greatly values ASEAN’s role as a proponent of peace, stability and prosperity in the region. We iterate our support to ASEAN’s unity and centrality. We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with ASEAN in pursuit of a rules-based regional architecture that is open, inclusive, balanced and equitable.

The President said that India and ASEAN are bound by history and by geography. Culture, commerce and connectivity – and ideas and thought - have woven us together in one common fabric. Our partnership is based on our shared heritage and is built on the foundation of strong people-to-people contacts, nurtured through the millennia. The theme of the Commemorative Summit, “Shared Values, Common Destiny”, is reflective of our desire to work for a shared future.  

The 10 ASEAN Heads of State and Government who visited the Rashtrapati Bhavan today are Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah of Brunei; President Joko Widodo of Indonesia; President Rodrigo Roa Duterte of Philippines; Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia; Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore; Prime Minister Dato’ Sri Md. Najib Bin Tun Abdul Razak of Malaysia; Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha of Thailand; State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar; Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc of Vietnam; and Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith of Lao PDR. These leaders are in India to attend the ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit.  They will be Guests of Honour at India’s 69th Republic Day celebrations on January 26.

                His Excellency Mr Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (January 24, 2018).

Welcoming the Vietnamese Prime Minister to India, the President said that India is delighted to host him as a guest of honour at the Republic Day celebrations. India is also celebrating 25 years of its partnership with ASEAN. This makes his presence even more special.  

The President said that Vietnam is a preferred partner for India in ASEAN. Our economic engagement has witnessed a remarkable growth.  We need to redouble our efforts to reach the target of US $ 15 billion in bilateral trade by 2020. He stated that India remains committed to encouraging its industry to explore investment opportunities in Vietnam in pharma, solar, education and other sectors.  We also need to enhance cooperation in the oil and gas sector, including through trilateral cooperation with friendly countries. 

The President said that India-Vietnam relations are on an upward curve.  Last year, we have celebrated ‘Year of Friendship’ to mark our warm and close ties.  He thanked the Vietnamese Prime Minister for Vietnam’s support for India at various multilateral fora and expressed hope that this visit will give further boost to India-Vietnam relations.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 66th convocation of the Maharaja Sayajirao University in Baroda today (January 22, 2018).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Maharaja Sayajirao Gaikwad had envisaged this University to promote quality higher education in the region. He had supported and encouraged talented people from underprivileged sections of society, including Dr B.R. Ambedkar. At the time there were very few people with such an expansive vision. 

The President appreciated Maharaja Sayajirao University for institutionalising fellowships for students from economically weaker sections. Contributions of students of this University towards development of those from a deprived and underprivileged background would be consistent with the ideals of Sayajirao.

Later in the day, the President graced the 150th anniversary of Akshar Deri at Gondal.

Speaking on the occasion, the President noted that the Swaminarayan Sanstha is engaged in providing assistance to spread education among weaker sections. Similarly, it is providing health services for the welfare of people. He praised the humanitarian work of the Swaminarayan Sanstha.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 66th convocation of Gujarat University today (January 21, 2018) in Ahmedabad.

Speaking on the occasion, the President noted that Gujarat University is supporting many new entrepreneurs through its “Start-up and Entrepreneurship Council”. The creation of the “Council of Skill Development” is also a welcome step towards empowering students. He stated that today’s universities should give top priority to preparing their students for employability, and for self-employment and entrepreneurship.

The President said that there are many good institutions in Ahmedabad that promote a start-up culture. Recently, the Prime Ministers of India and Israel inaugurated the International Centre for Entrepreneurship and Technology – or iCreate – in Ahmedabad. This will provide world-class facilities to young Indian entrepreneurs. The President urged students of Gujarat University to take advantage of these facilities.

Addressing the students, the President said that whatever they have received in life is not only due to their own efforts but also due to contributions from their family, well-wishers, teachers, society and the government. It is up to them to think of how they must pay back, especially to society. He urged them to think of those who had been deprived of opportunities for education and try and help their process of development.

The President said that good education should not only make students skilled but also sensitive. He said that it was natural to expect that students from Gujarat, the state of Narsee Mehta and Mahatma Gandhi, will contribute to compassion, morality and human well-being.

A narrow beam lens has been used to highlight specific objects such as the lotus on the Jaipur Column and a wider beam lens to spread light on a larger area. Features that have been highlighted prominently in the lighting are the Jaipur Column, dome of the main building, chattris, fountains at terrace and ground level, as well as loggia columns.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 45th convocation of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi today (January 16, 2018).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that AIIMS is a national centre of excellence. In medical research and healthcare, it is a model for the country. The name “AIIMS” has become a byword for quality, commitment and rich experience. The faculty and doctors, as well as of course the students, are the pride of our medical fraternity and our nation. 

The President advised the graduating doctors that as they go into the world – a world that needs their services more than ever before – they should remember that they need to give back to society. He stated that it is true that they need to be legitimately rewarded for their academic excellence, their medical skills and their expertise. Yet, as doctors, their services must be available both to those who can afford their fees and also to those who are less fortunate and cannot. Disease does not distinguish between rich and poor but unfortunately the poor suffer the most. It is for society to profit from medical science – it is not for medical science to profiteer from society. 

Pointing out the shortage of doctors in our country, the President said that doctors need help in the form of more colleagues. And this is where we need a new regulatory system to enhance availability of doctors and medical professionals in our society. In the absence of this, the work-load on our doctors is very high.

The President said that currently our medical colleges, whether run by the government or private institutions, have only about 67,000 undergraduate seats and 31,000 postgraduate seats. In a country of 1.3 billion people this is highly inadequate. We have to overcome regulatory bottlenecks and interest groups that have prevented the growth of quality medical education in our country. This gives us far fewer medical graduates and postgraduates every year than our people need. It also leads to aspiring medical students seeking admission in colleges in other countries – simply because they have limited options at home. This is simply not acceptable. As a nation, we need to address this situation very urgently. We need to create more opportunities for those young people who want to make medicine their calling.

	It is a matter of great happiness for me to be here for the 45th convocation ceremony of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences or AIIMS. This institution is a national centre of excellence. In medical research and healthcare, it is a model for the country. The name “AIIMS” has become a byword for quality, commitment and rich experience. The faculty and doctors, as well as of course the students, are the pride of our medical fraternity and our nation. I must compliment every member of the AIIMS family for keeping up these exceptional standards, despite very difficult circumstances.



	I am especially happy to address the students and residents – those energetic young doctors and nurses – who are graduating today and getting their degrees. My congratulations to them, and in particular to those who have won medals and awards. This is a landmark moment in your lives. You have joined an illustrious list of medical graduates and postgraduates from AIIMS. Your success is a result of your hard work, as well as the efforts of your teachers and professors – and the sacrifices of your families. In a large measure, it has also been assisted by society – which has contributed to the setting up and maintenance of an institution such as AIIMS.
	As such, as you go into the world – a world that needs your services more than ever before – please remember that you need to give back to society. It is true that you need to be legitimately rewarded for your academic excellence, your medical skills and your expertise. Yet, as doctors, your services must be available both to those who can afford your fees and also to those who are less fortunate and cannot afford. Disease does not distinguish between rich and poor but unfortunately poor suffer the most. It is for society to profit from medical science – it is not for medical science to profiteer from society.
	Patients and their families have great trust in you and see you as next to God.  It is upon you to ensure that the trust is given due respect and that you treat them with care and compassion. 
	A key role in meeting our health challenges is played by our very vigilant and very skilled nurses and paramedics. Their work almost never stops. Their sense of duty and compassion has made Indian nurses – both women and men – among the most outstanding professionals in our country, across all fields. In this context, I must make a special mention of the nursing students who are graduating today. My congratulations to all of you.
	India is a country of paradoxes. Nowhere is this more apparent than in our public health. Traditional challenges such as diarrhoea, pneumonia and TB – along with maternal and child mortality figures that are improving but are still worrying – are a concern. On the other hand, non-communicable diseases and what are called life-style diseases are emerging as big killers. These could be related to the heart or to the brain, as well as to a host of cancers and pollution sources that we are increasingly exposed to. 
	In our country, both obesity and malnutrition are substantial public health issues. And in our country, we have a very large child population as well as one of the world’s largest populations of senior people. Both these groups pose very different but very real challenges to our healthcare system and our doctors and nurses.
	Despite the progress we have made, gaps remain. For example, Indian companies are among the world’s biggest manufacturers of vaccines. These vaccines are supplied across the globe. Our innovative medical scientists have even developed new vaccines. Even so, our own immunisation record remains below desirable levels. Many of our children, particularly in far-flung and difficult-to-access areas, do not get the full course of immunisation. In this context, I must appreciate the efforts of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, under Shri J.P. Nadda. By launching programmes like Mission Indradhanush, it is urgently trying to fill the immunisation gap and protect all our children – the future of our country – from killer diseases.
	The scenario I have described above requires coordinated action by all stakeholders: Whether in the government or the private sector; whether at the grassroots, in the form of our dedicated ASHA workers and ANMs, or by specialists in leading referral hospitals such as AIIMS. The use of technology and the adoption of telemedicine, at least for diagnosis, will also go a long way in taking healthcare to those who need it most. Cutting-edge research in institutions such as AIIMS will be fundamental to taking on emerging diseases and health challenges.
	In all this, the principal actors, the fulcrum of the medical system, are the doctors – all of you who are being awarded degrees today. Without you the system will not work. Led by you, it is for all of us to ensure that India’s healthcare efforts reach every citizen and not just some citizens. It is for you to ensure that healthcare indices for the entire population reach acceptable levels during our lifetime. This is how the battle against polio, and earlier smallpox, was fought and won. Those victories must inspire us and spur us to a healthier India in all its dimensions.


Ladies and Gentlemen


	I recognise that I am placing a big responsibility on the capable shoulders of our doctors. But I also acknowledge that our doctors need help. They need help in the form of more colleagues. And this is where we need a new regulatory system to enhance availability of doctors and medical professionals in our society. In the absence of this, the workload on our doctors is very high – I would say un-realistically high. I have no doubt that the hard-working doctors at AIIMS, who so diligently treat so many patients every day, will agree with me.
	Currently our medical colleges, whether run by the government or private institutions, have only about 67,000 undergraduate seats and 31,000 postgraduate seats. In a country of 1.3 billion people this is highly inadequate. We have to overcome regulatory bottlenecks and interest groups that have prevented the growth of quality medical education in our country. This gives us far fewer medical graduates and postgraduates every year than our people need. It also leads to aspiring medical students seeking admission in colleges in other countries – simply because they have limited options at home.
	You will agree that this is simply not acceptable. As a nation, we need to address this situation very urgently. We need to create more opportunities for those young people who want to make medicine their calling.
	On that optimistic note, I would like to conclude. I would once again like to congratulate those who are being awarded their degrees today, as well as the exceptional AIIMS community. May all of you have many more years of service to medicine, to our nation and to humanity.


Thank you

Jai Hind!

                His Excellency Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (January 15, 2018).

 

Welcoming the Israeli Prime Minister, the President said that his visit to India is a culmination of celebrations to mark the 25th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between India and Israel. Our warm and friendly ties are growing stronger. In a little over two years, the two countries have exchanged Presidential and Prime Ministerial visits. 

 

The President said that our bilateral cooperation has expanded manifold. Political understanding, security cooperation and technology partnerships are key pillars of strategic engagement between India and Israel. He emphasised that collaboration in newer areas such as space, cybersecurity and innovation will add depth to our partnership.

 

The President said that opportunities lay before the two countries in the fields of investment, manufacturing, services, start-ups and technology. He appreciated the presence of Israeli companies in India especially in the water, defence, technology and pharma sectors. He urged them to partner India in its programmes such as Make in India, Clean India, Smart Cities and Digital India.

 

The President said that the India-Israel security cooperation is defined by our common fight against terrorism. This challenge is eating into the vitals of our society. Our counterterrorism cooperation is progressing well but we need to do more. We need to work together to develop a strong global response to defeat terrorism in all its manifestations. 

 

The President said that India appreciates Israel’s cooperation in the field of agriculture. Israel has taught India to do more with less. Israel’s support has served our farmers exceedingly well, especially in water deficient areas. As we work to make our farming choices more sustainable, we will seek more Israeli support.

 

A prominent example of India-Israel cooperation in agriculture was evident during today’s call-on. The olive tea that was served to the Israeli Prime Minister at Rashtrapati Bhavan was produced in Bikaner by Rajasthan Olive Cultivation Ltd, a joint venture between the Government of Rajasthan and Israeli partners.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the ‘Economic Democracy Conclave’ organised by Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini at Thane, Maharashtra, today (January 14, 2018).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that it is very important for our country and society to strengthen economic democracy through entrepreneurship. He praised the Prabodhini team for its contribution to strengthening the political, economic and social dimensions of our democracy for the past 35 years.

The President said that political democracy cannot be strong in the absence of economic and social democracy. Improvement in the economic condition of deprived sections is imperative.  Many initiatives have been taken in our country with the aim of ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’ and ‘Sabka Samman, Sabka Utthan’. These have a singular goal of strengthening economic and social democracy. The idea behind these programmes is that if anyone has to really help someone, then he/she should be made financially self-reliant.

The President said that the promotion of an entrepreneurial culture in the country is not the sole responsibility of the Government. Family, educational institutions, private sector banks and entrepreneurs, NGOs, etc. all have the responsibility to create an environment where private enterprise is encouraged. Together, we should create a culture in which self-employment is not chosen just due to the compulsion of not getting a job. The idea of ​​becoming ‘job-giver’ instead of ‘job-seeker’ should be embraced.

 Later in the day, the President visited the Global Vipassana Pagoda in Mumbai.   

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that in today’s world,  it has become important to spread the Buddha's teachings. And Vipassana is one of those methods that can bring his message to the people. The President congratulated the Global Vipassana Foundation for its various social welfare initiatives.

	I am happy to be here for the inauguration of the “International Conference on State and Social Order in Dharma-Dhamma Traditions” being organised by Nalanda University in partnership with the Vietnam Buddhist University, India Foundation, and the Ministry of External Affairs, government of India. In particular, I must welcome the international scholars and delegates, from 11 countries, who have arrived here for this conference.



	I understand this is the fourth International Dharma-Dhamma Conference but the first to be hosted by Nalanda University and in the state of Bihar. In a sense, the twin traditions of Dharma and Dhamma have come home. They have come home to the sacred soil of this ancient land of faith, wisdom and enlightenment – this land of Lord Buddha. 



	In the period of Lord Buddha, well before modern states and state boundaries, this entire region was known as Magadha. In those times, Sanskrit and Pali were the principal languages of communication. Dharma is a Sanskrit word and Dhamma is a Pali word. Their meaning is the same and they have the same root.  While travelling through the Magadha region, Lord Buddha and his disciples rested in camps that grew into monasteries. These were called viharas. And from the word vihara, we get the name of Bihar. 



	Aside from the location, the timing of this conference is very appropriate. We are marking the 25th anniversary of the ASEAN-India Dialogue Partnership. The month of January is a celebration of India-ASEAN relations. This year on India’s Republic Day, January 26, leaders from all 10 ASEAN countries will be guests of honour at the ceremonial events in New Delhi. And today this conference stands testimony to the abiding friendship and shared values of India and ASEAN – as well as to the spiritual heritage and knowledge that belongs to both the sub-continent and to Southeast Asia.



	This conference is an attempt at enhancing understanding of the common roots and similarities of the diverse traditions of Dharma and Dhamma. We know them by many names, but they guide us to the same truth. They emphasise the many roads, rather than any one road, that lead us to the same desired goal. The deliberations at this conference will explore that essential truth. They will discuss and debate the role of Dharma and Dhamma in shaping ethical conduct and purposeful statecraft. These themes are universal and eternal. They have survived long periods of external challenge and of self-doubt. And they have shown a remarkable resilience through human history. 



	Nalanda University itself is an embodiment of this spirit. The ancient university that stood here was a marvel of knowledge and wisdom. It was located in this very region of India but had an international character. It attracted students, scholars and pilgrims from all over Asia. Similarly today’s Nalanda University represents the ever-lasting Dharma-Dhamma identity. And it too is a cosmopolitan enterprise. The university’s conceptualisation, founding and growth are the result of cherished efforts by India and a host of partner countries, particularly countries from the ASEAN family. 



	Along with several Indian scholars, I am told this conference will hear the wise words of eminent international delegates. They have come from far-off continents, including both North and South America. But most of all, they represent the breadth and diversity of Asia – from Central Asia to Southeast Asia. Each of the countries and societies represented at this conference is unique and has special attributes. Yet, all of them are recipients, in some manner, of the Dharma-Dhamma tradition. All of them have received the message of Lord Buddha – a message that has travelled across Asia and beyond, and a message that is a binding force for all of us. 



	That journey of Buddhism as a pan-Asian creed and later a worldwide following began 2,500 years ago right here in Bihar. As such, the conference is a commemoration of a great phenomenon that has its origins right here in this region.  



	That voyage of Buddhism to the rest of the Asian continent carried more than just the Dharma-Dhamma tradition. It carried a rich cargo of knowledge and learning. It carried arts and crafts. It carried meditation techniques and even martial arts. Eventually, the many roads that the determined monks and nuns - those men and women of faith - carved out came to carry both culture and commerce. They became among the earliest transcontinental trade routes. 



	Long before the term became popular, Buddhism was the basis for an early form of globalisation – and of interconnectedness in our continent. It promoted pluralism and diversity of thought. It gave space to multiple ideas and liberal expression. It emphasised morality in individual life, in human partnerships and in social and economic transactions. It urged principles of living, working and cooperating in harmony with nature and the environment. It inspired trade and business links that were honest, transparent and mutually beneficial to sister communities. 



	At the simplest level, the Dharma-Dhamma tradition tells us of the need and the importance for constant striving to improve oneself – to attain a higher calling and to reach a stage of enlightenment. It was the reaching of this enlightenment that led Prince Siddhartha to become Lord Buddha. Or for Ashoka, the warrior king, to become Dhamma Ashoka. 



	Anyone who has been touched by Lord Buddha has embraced a process of ceaseless and constant striving to become a better person as well as a more enlightened person. And a person who has tried to rise above material ambitions and acquisitiveness. This is true for human beings, but it also applies to societies and nations. We must all appreciate the Dharma or the Dhamma of contentment.



	It is estimated that more than half the world’s current population lives in regions that have been historically influenced – and in many cases continue to be influenced – by the enlightenment that Lord Buddha attained and placed as a model before humanity. This is the thread that stitches us all together. This is the vision that must inspire us in the 21st century as well. And this is truly what has been described as the Light of Asia.


 

Ladies and Gentlemen


	India’s Act East Policy has to be seen in this context. It is much more than a diplomatic initiative. It is not targeted at just greater trade and investment. Of course all of those aspirations are extremely important for the prosperity and well-being of the people of India and of all our partner countries. Yet, the Act East Policy aims at sharing not merely economic opportunities – but at an integration of the dreams and hopes of the hundreds of millions who live in India and in Southeast Asia. And in other parts of Asia that are covered by the Dharma-Dhamma footprint. Our past has a common source – inevitably, our destiny too is linked. This conference and the new Nalanda University are symbols of that spirit we share. Our economic and diplomatic endeavours must draw from the same well-spring. 



	For the states of India’s Northeast and east – states such as Bihar – the spiritual, cultural and trade links that were so lovingly created by the monks of Dharma and Dhamma hundreds and thousands of years ago are much more than a historical memory. They are wired into society’s DNA. They are a living reality that makes Southeast Asia a natural and irreplaceable partner in the quest for development and prosperity, for peace and pluralism, at home and across our majestic continent. And as such, for all of us here and in any area of human activity, Dharma and Dhamma are both a continuous, eternal journey – and a destination.



	With these words, I am happy to declare the fourth International Dharma-Dhamma Conference open. I wish all of you the very best for the rest of the proceedings.


 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the 4th International Conference on Dharma-Dhamma at Rajgir, Bihar today (January 11, 2018).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the timing of this conference is very appropriate. We are marking the 25th anniversary of the ASEAN-India Dialogue Partnership. The month of January is a celebration of India-ASEAN relations. India’s Republic Day, January 26, leaders from all 10 ASEAN countries will be chief guests at the ceremonial events in New Delhi.

                A group of probationers of different Railway Services, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (January 10, 2018) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said Indian Railways is an institution for national service and nation building. In 2015-16 alone, Indian Railways serviced over 8 billion ‘originating passengers’. The Railways moves our industrial and agricultural freight, defence equipment and military personnel. The rail network also helps to maintain and spread our cultural heritage and traditions. Be it by mean of special trains run to accommodate the rush for the Kumbh Melas or the majestic ‘Palace on Wheels’ that captures the imagination of people around the globe. 

The President said that trains are emerging as a means of mass rapid transport within our cities. Metro projects are being adopted by more and more cities in a bid to provide fast, secure and affordable urban connectivity. This will also help to de-clog our cities and reduce our carbon footprint. 

The President reminded the probationary officers that they have joined an institution that provides them a unique opportunity to serve the nation and millions of citizens each day. He urged them to lead a life of optimism and develop a sense of positivity. This will allow them to make meaningful changes both at their work places as well as in society at large. It will also allow them to nurture a spirit of innovation and emerge as solution providers.

	I am glad to be here for the inauguration of the International Conference of PIO Parliamentarians, being organised by Antar Rashtriya Sahayog Parishad - Bharat in association with the PIO Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of External Affairs, government of India. This event is a milestone. It brings together parliamentarians and public representatives of Indian origin from countries across the globe. It is a new and welcome addition to the commemoration of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas. The Divas itself marks the return of Mahatma Gandhi to India from South Africa on January 9, 1915. 


 


	Pravasi Bharatiya Divas is not merely the remembrance of a historical anniversary. It is the celebration of a very contemporary, very accomplished and very high-achieving community – the Indian diaspora. It is a tribute to the estimated 30 million strong Pravasi Bharatiya community that can be found in over 100 countries – from Trinidad to Fiji, from Argentina to Australia, and from the United States to the United Arab Emirates. Of these people, about 13 million are People of Indian Origin or PIOs as we know them, and some 17 million are Non-Resident Indians or NRIs. 


 


	The Indian diaspora has climbed to appreciable heights in almost all the countries where it has found a home. It has contributed to the well-being of that country and of that society – enriching the economy and adding to intellectual wealth and local culture. Members of the Indian diaspora work hard on farms in countries as far apart as Italy, Bolivia and Tanzania. They are instrumental to the tech start-up ecosystem of Silicon Valley. They form the backbone of the economy of Dubai and other major business cities in the Gulf region. The global financial centres of New York, London and Singapore would simply not be the same without the Indian diaspora. And as I discovered during my first state visit after being elected as the President of India, Pravasi Bharatiya teachers have helped educate several generations in Ethiopia. 


 


	Of course, I have given only a few examples. If I were to continue to cite instances of achievements of the Indian diaspora in different countries, I would require a few hours and not a few minutes. As a country, we are very proud of what our Pravasi Bharatiya brothers and sisters have done. They have embellished the identity of India and of the Indian people all over the world. They have also remained true to Indian culture and retained a strong and commendable bond with their roots, even when living thousands of miles away. I would go to the extent of saying that if Indian cuisine and Indian films have a global market today, it is because the diaspora has taken them to distant lands.


 

Ladies and Gentlemen


	We Indians are proud of our democracy, fabric of pluralism and diversity. This is our greatest strength. And the Indian diaspora has carried such liberal and civic-minded values with it. Instinctively, this has made members of the Indian diaspora contribute to public life in countries that they are citizens of. I am told that there are around 300 PIO parliamentarians. Among them are those who have risen to become heads of state, heads of government and senior ministers.


 


	At this conference itself some 140 elected public representatives – from MPs to mayors – from 23 countries are participating. This is a very substantial number. In November 1998, Antar Rashtriya Sahayog Parishad – Bharat had hosted the first such get-together of PIO parliamentarians. That meeting was inaugurated by India’s then Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It saw the participation of 34 PIO parliamentarians from eight countries. In two decades, the event has grown four-fold. This is a matter of happiness and satisfaction for all of us.


 


	Regular contact and outreach with the Indian diaspora, in various countries, is a cornerstone of the Ministry of External Affairs of the government of India. Our consulates and embassies have a special place in their hearts for Pravasi Bharatiyas and are making efforts to provide prompt services and support to members of the Indian diaspora. Regular interaction with PIO parliamentarians and public representatives is a part of this process.


 


	For the government of India, engagement with PIO parliamentarians – or indeed with the wider Indian diaspora community – is not a transactional relationship or a zero-sum game. Rather, we look upon the community and look upon you – the PIO parliamentarians and elected and public representatives – as a living bridge. You have a role in enhancing understanding between your countries and the country of your parents and ancestors. And in helping build economic, people-to-people and strategic connections that will be of benefit to both countries and to all of us. 


 


	Today, India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The next few decades are likely to see our economy gallop ahead. We are also at the cusp of New India – an India that will achieve certain milestones for our people by 2022, when we celebrate the 75th year of our Independence. At such a juncture, India offers huge investment, trade and developmental opportunities. And the development of India will be of benefit to not just the 1.3 billion people of India – but will be a voice of hope and prosperity and of peace and stability for our shared world. And for all the countries you represent. 


 


	I have often said that the entire global community – the entirety of human civilisation, if I could put it so – has a stake in the development of India. As PIO parliamentarians, as those in public life in your systems who have the best understanding of India, it is important for you to link your individual country’s priorities to India’s development. And to see how these can intersect. I am sure the remaining sessions of this conference will take that process forward. 


 


	With these words, I wish you and I wish the conference all success. And should you have the time, I invite you to visit Rashtrapati Bhavan. It belongs to all Indians, to all those in the Indian diaspora and to all PIOs.


 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the International Conference of PIO Parliamentarians, being organised by Antar Rashtriya Sahayog Parishad - Bharat in association with the PIO Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, in New Delhi today (January 10, 2018).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the Indian diaspora has climbed to appreciable heights in almost all the countries where it has found a home. It has contributed to the well-being of that country and of that society – enriching the economyand adding to intellectual wealth and local culture. Members of the Indian diaspora work hard on farms in countries as far apart as Italy, Bolivia and Tanzania. They are instrumental to the tech start-up ecosystem of Silicon Valley. They form the backbone of the economy of Dubai and other major business cities in the Gulf region. The global financial centres of New York, London and Singapore would simply not be the same without the Indian diaspora.

The President said that as a country, we are very proud of what our Pravasi Bharatiya brothers and sisters have done. They have embellished the identity of India and of the Indian people all over the world. They have also remained true to Indian culture and retained a strong and commendable bond with their roots, even when living thousands of miles away. If Indian cuisine and Indian films have a global market today, it is because the diaspora has taken them to distant lands.

The President said that for the Government of India, engagement with PIO parliamentarians – or indeed with the wider Indian diaspora community – is not a transactional relationship or a zero-sum game. Rather, we look upon the community and look upon PIO parliamentarians and elected and public representatives as a living bridge. They have a role in enhancing understanding between their countries and the country of their parents and ancestors. And in helping build economic, people-to-people and strategic connections that will be of benefit to both countries and to all of us.

The President said that as PIO parliamentarians, as those in public life in their systems who have the best understanding of India, it is important for them to link their individual country’s priorities to India’s development. And to see how these can intersect.

                The Committee of Governors, constituted during the 48th Conference of Governors in October 2017, called on President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, at RashtrapatiBhavan today (January 9, 2018) and submitted its report ‘Rajyapal –VikasKeRajdoot: Catalytic Role of Governors as Agents for Change in Society’. The Committee comprises Shri ESL Narasimhan, Governor of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; Shri BanwarilalPurohit, Governor of Tamil Nadu; Shri Ram Naik, Governor of Uttar Pradesh; Shri Tathagata Roy, Governor of Tripura; and Acharya Devvrat, Governor of Himachal Pradesh (not present at today’s meeting).

This Committee was constituted to examine the role of Governors in taking forward the developmental process. In its report, it describes an action-outcome framework that can be adopted by Raj Bhavans in their role as change agents and lists out potential priorities. The report emphasizes identifying priority areas along with activities that can help realise the objectives of SarvShrest Bharat. It suggests Governors play a mentoring role in overall implementation of developmental schemes in their states.

During the conversation, the President said that he was happy to note that Mr Wavel Ramkalawan is in India to participate in the PIO Parliamentary Conference. He stated that through the PIO Parliamentary Conference, we hope to reach out to the larger Indian community overseas. This also provides us a platform to engage and connect with parliamentarians of Indian origin the world over.

The President said that India and Seychelles enjoy warm and friendly ties. Our bonds of friendship are rooted in history. Strong people to people and cultural linkages are the bedrock of our relations. He expressed hope that the visit of Mr Ramkalawan to India will further strengthen ties between the two democracies.

                Participants of the Jagriti Yatra called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (January 5, 2018). The Jagriti Yatra is a 15-day long national train journey that covers 8,000 km across the length and breadth of the country. It aims to create awareness and encourage nation building though building enterprise.

Speaking on the occasion, the President appreciated the organisers of Jagriti Yatra for linking self-employment opportunities available in our country with the talent of our youth. He said that there are immense possibilities for our youth.  As such, an environment should be created for young people to generate employment opportunities instead of just looking for jobs. There is a need to bring a change in mindsets of people, and the Jagriti Yatra is making a commendable effort in this direction.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India with the world’s highest youth population, we must encourage children and youth to take up sports as a profession and government must support it.  He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Yonex-Sunrise Dr. Akhilesh Das Gupta India Open Badminton World Federation Super Series World Tour, here today. He also conferred the Life Time Achievement Award to veteran Badminton player Shri Prakash Padukone. 

The Vice President said that the “Sacred Fire” of the Yagna of nation-building is the intense combination of aspirations, emotions and excitement of more than a billion souls which unite and throb into a single heart beat called, BHARAT in certain moments of time. He further said that sport is one such field that contributes to these moments and these moments are sacred fire that engulfs this nation when our own sons and daughters represent us in the world championships. Some may call this mass-frenzy but I choose to call it as sacred fire, he added.

The Vice President said that each son or daughter of this great country in the sports field could be instrumental in lighting the spirit of Indian-ness and be the leader of nation building. He further said that sports can contribute to nation building in a huge way by not only fostering the spirit of Indian-ness but also in creating facilities and infrastructure.

The Vice President said that he see a great future for the country in the badminton with promising, beaming and bright faces of Indian youth. He further said that with enormous progress in technology, IT revolution and social media, the role of sports in nation building will grow further in our country. Shri Prakash Padukone is a huge inspiration to all the aspiring sportsmen and women in the country, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“It gives me immense pleasure to be inaugurate ‘Yonex Sunrise Dr Akhilesh Das Gupta  India Open Badminton World Federation Super Series World Tour’ and confer Life Time Achievement Award to Shri Prakash Padukone.”
I regard this event as one of the most auspicious occasions. Yes, you heard it right. I said “auspicious” because of the fact that I believe nation-building is a great Yagna.  
The “Sacred Fire” of this Yagna of nation-building is the intense combination of aspirations, emotions and excitement of more than a billion souls which unite and throb into a single heart beat called, BHARAT in certain moments of time.  Sport is one such field that contributes to these moments. These moments are sacred fire that engulfs this nation when our own sons and daughters represent us in the world championships. 
Some may call this mass-frenzy. But I choose to call it as sacred fire.

 
This fire is sacred and auspicious because it cleans the souls of the society to overcome the proverbial “narrow domestic walls” that Kavi Guru Rabindra Nath Tagore talked about.


Thus, each son or daughter of this great country in the sports field could be instrumental in lighting the spirit of Indian-ness and be the leader of nation building. More than any time in the history of India, sports can contribute to nation building in a huge way by not only fostering the spirit of Indian-ness but also in creating facilities and infrastructure.
India is having the world’s highest youth population today. This coupled with enormous progress in technology, IT revolution and social media, the role of sports in nation building will grow further in our country.


Of course, at the same time, we need to recognize the fact that every sport may not attain similar popularity at a given point of time. Each sport has its own temporal and spatial life. May be, as they say ‘cometh the hour, cometh the man’ could be the reason for this. Some personalities take the game to new heights and also its popularity. We have seen such leaders in different sports, including Cricket, Hockey, football, tennis, badminton, Kabaddi and athletics including boxing, billiards, fencing, shooting and archery.


Thus, every sport has its day. Now, we all should feel delighted that the popularity of Badminton has come to stay and it is one of the top sports of the country. I am fully confident that this will continue for long, long time.
Badminton has a unique position among sports. Being a technical sport, it requires good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements. At highest levels of play, badminton demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. 


In this background, it is truly laudable on the part of Badminton Association of India (BAI), under the leadership of Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma, to pay respect and honour to one of the great leaders of Indian sports, Shri Prakash Padukone, who became immensely popular in late seventies and eighties. 


No doubt, the Union Government and various State Governments have policies to felicitate sports personalities through various awards, including Dronacharya, Arjuna and Padma awards. But the initiative of the BAI to undertake such efforts speaks volumes about its commitment to Indian Badminton.


Shri Prakash Padukone is a huge inspiration to all the aspiring sportsmen and women in the country. Hailing from a village, Padukone in Karnataka and achieving World Rank No.1 position in Badminton at the age of 25 years is indeed a rare feet by Shri Padukone. He had won the Commonwealth Games gold medal in 1978 in Canada. He was also the winner of the Danish Open, Swedish Open and the All England Championships in March 1980. Even though, the sports infrastructure and facilities were not as well developed as they are now three decades ago, Shri Padukone brought laurels to India through sheer grit and determination. 


Besides, his indomitable spirit, passion and commitment to Indian Badminton have never waned. He continued to serve the nation as a coach of Indian teams. Further, he co-founded a Badminton Academy which currently runs the Tata Padukone Badminton Centres in Bangalore and Mumbai. He has been successful in his mission to create next generation leaders in Badminton. 


Some of his students like Shri Gopichand have been successfully carrying the torch further. Each of them of them has been our pride, hope and promise. Now we have a third generation of rising stars of badminton and some of them are present here amidst today. Thus this function augurs well for Indian Badminton. It also serves as a tribute to all those Badminton players of the past and present.


While saying this, I recall the quote of the youth icon of India, Swami Vivekananda: “A few heart-whole, sincere, and energetic men and women can do more in a year than a mob in a century.” 


I would like to pay my rich tributes to all those who contributed to the Indian sports. All these achievements have helped us to reach where we are today in the world badminton stage. 


India Open was first allotted to India by the World Badminton Federation about eight years ago and now it forms the part of World Tour Circuit. We feel proud to learn that the ongoing Championship here in Delhi is a part of world tour event. This means that it is one of the 12 key tournaments in the world and this gives points to the players and helping them in calculation of the World Rankings. This is a huge opportunity for all our Indian players.
Thus, I see a great future for the country in the badminton with promising, beaming and bright faces of Indian youth. I have no doubt that the efforts of all of you and BAI will go a long way in making Indian No.1 in World Badminton. 


I thank BAI and its president Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma and all his colleagues. My best wishes to BAI, all badminton players and Shri Prakash Padukone. I also wish all success to the participants and organizers in the Yonex Sunrise Dr ADG India Open BWF Super Series World Tour at Delhi!


With these words, I declare open this ‘India Open BWF Super Series World Tour.”
JAI HIND!”

He was interacting with the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Mr. Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen, here today. Senior officials from Cambodia and India were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President conveyed his best wishes to the visiting Cambodian Prime Minister who is the longest serving Prime Minister in the world. He further complimented Cambodian Prime Minister’s son Mr. Hun Money for being bestowed with the Padma Shri Award, India's fourth highest civilian honour, by the Indian Government.

The Vice President recalled fond memories of his personal visit along with his family to the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia few years back, which is the largest religious monument in the world. He further said that India is committed to continue its assistance in capacity building, developmental and social projects as well as preservation of historical and cultural heritage of Cambodia and the restoration and conservation of Angkor Wat temple and the continued work by Archaeological Survey of India at Ta Prohm temple was an evidence for the same. India is proud to become the co-chair of International Coordinating Committee for Safeguarding and Development of the Historic Site of Preah Vihear, he added.

The Vice President appreciated Cambodian government for the remarkable economic growth of over 7% consistently year after year in the last two decades. He further said that the economic developments in our two countries present opportunities for greater commerce and investment. Hope Cambodia will provide easy access to the Indian professionals, businessmen and service providers, he added.

The Vice President said that Indian Chair for Buddhist and Sanskrit studies at Preah Sihanouk Raja Buddhist University further deepens the interactions and understanding between our scholars. He further said that a project development fund with a corpus of 75 million US Dollars for catalyzing Indian investment in CLMV countries is created. Our EXIM Bank teams are conducting feasibility studies in the region including Cambodia to identify potential sectors, he added.

The Prime Minister of Cambodia has recalled the assistance provided by the Indian Government during it’s difficult times. He invited the Vice President to make a state visit to Cambodia at his convenience. 

The family members of the Vice President welcomed the visiting Cambodian Prime Minister with a traditional Pochampally Shawl.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we need rigorous empirical research to make good, people-centric policies. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the book ‘Staniya Svasasan Mei Addhi Aabadhi’ authored by Dr. Sadhana Pandey, in New Delhi today. 

The Vice President quoted a report based on a sample survey of women representatives elected to the position of Sarpanch in gram panchayats:


	Most of women elected to these positions are in the age group pf 26-36 years, married, living in nuclear families, completed secondary school and are from middle income category.
	All women across all age and income groups have highlighted education as the most important factor for women’s advancement in all fields including politics.
	The younger generation was much more aware of the need to focus on development issues like health, environment, planned motherhood and economic independence.
	The younger generation showed a greater open-ness to modernity but at the same time were not willing to completely do away with the past. Most of the women still accepted that the society continues to be dominated by men. 
	Most women recognized the importance of radio and television in enhancing awareness but also felt some films to be inappropriate for younger audiences
	There was a very clear awareness of the new possibilities for women to grow along with men
	There was a general feeling that more should be done for rural areas by both the officials and the political executive


The Vice President said that it is an empirical study that captures the voices of the rural women who are occupying positions of authority at the local level. He further said that It can help the policy makers to understand the perspectives of women representatives and address the key issues of education, health, nutrition, information sharing, economic independence and empowerment.

The Vice President commended the author on this valuable effort and hope that she and other researchers will do similar surveys in other parts of India.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we must be eternally vigilant against forces which are inimical to India and want to derail the country’s onward march. He was delivering the 4th R.V. Raju Memorial Lecture on 'National Security Challenges in 21st Century', organized by National Investigation Agency (NIA), here today. The Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh, the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that the national security environment in India is determined by its geographical attributes, socio-economic milieu as well as by regional and global developments. He further said that the national security challenges can be broadly categorised as internal challenges and external challenges, both of which are closely and intricately intertwined. The internal challenges include the growing radicalization in our society, separatist movements, insurgencies, communalism and Maoist violence, he added.

The Vice President said that India is now the fastest growing major economy in the world and India needs to grow faster to provide basic means of livelihood and decent opportunities to all its citizens.  The need of the hour is to ensure that India remains peaceful so that the process of all round development continues unhindered, he added. 

The Vice President said that United Nations has from time to time adopted various resolutions to combat global terrorism in all its formats. However, despite being members of the UN some member states continue to flout these resolutions by nurturing and providing support to terrorist organizations and it is time for the global community to take note of the situation and act against such errant member states, he added.

The Vice President reminded the recent investigations by the NIA in tracing and tracking the funding of the separatist groups and leaders have successfully disrupted the supply of funds to the separatist groups. He further said that this has led to a significant decrease in the incidents of terrorism as well as decline in the subversive activities being carried out by the separatists. He hoped that the NIA would continue to focus on all the aspects of financing of terrorism and effectively disrupt the channels and networks of funding to the terrorist organizations.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“At the outset, I congratulate NIA and all its personnel for organising R.V. Raju Memorial lecture as part of NIA day celebrations. Late R. V. Raju was the first DG of this premier counter-terrorism investigation agency. 

The national security environment in India is determined by its geographical attributes, socio-economic milieu as well as by regional and global developments. 

India is the seventh largest country in the world in terms of area, second most populous country, the third largest economy in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and one of the oldest civilizations with unparalleled cultural, religious, ethnic and linguistic diversity. India shares its land boundaries with six countries while it shares its maritime boundaries with seven countries. It is in this context that we should understand the national security challenges that India faces in the 21st Century.

The national security challenges can be broadly categorised as internal challenges and external challenges, both of which are closely and intricately intertwined. 

The internal challenges include the growing radicalization in our society, separatist movements, insurgencies, communalism and Maoist violence. 

We have centuries old rich cultural ethos that is rooted in strong democratic principles, which eschews violence in all its forms. However, there are certain misguided elements, who continue to use violence as an instrument to achieve political goals. No matter what the grievances are of disgruntled people or sections of people, there are ways and means to resolve all issues lawfully and peacefully within our constitutional scheme.

Having said that, I would like to point out that of immediate concern to all of us on the internal security front is the growing radicalization in our society. This has roots in a distorted view of religion and ethnic identity.

We have witnessed this phenomenon in the unending spiral of violence in different parts of our country including the Kashmir valley, in the insurgent movements in the north-eastern region and the Left Wing Extremism affected areas in the hinterland. The efforts made by the government have helped to contain the situation in Kashmir. There also has been a significant decline in the incidents of violence by Maoists and the north-east is largely peaceful. The historic peace treaty with the Naga rebels NSCN-IM was one of the successful initiatives and shows how long-festering political issues can be resolved peacefully to the advantage of all.

Friends, as you know India is now the fastest growing major economy in the world. India needs to grow faster to provide basic means of livelihood and decent opportunities to all its citizens.  The need of the hour is to ensure that India remains peaceful so that the process of all round development continues unhindered. We must be eternally vigilant against forces which are inimical to India and want to derail the country’s onward march. 

In this century wars are not fought in the battlefield alone; they are fought on all fronts including the economic front. Economic warfare is one of the most potent tools to undermine the peace and security of a nation and damage caused by it is immense. 

With regard to the external threats faced by the country, our neighbourhood remains the biggest challenge for our national security. The cross-border terrorism through both state and non-state actors has claimed thousands of innocent lives over the last three decades. One of our neighbouring countries continues to aid and abet acts of terrorism in India and for a long time has been trying to damage the monetary stability and economic security of India, through the production, smuggling and circulation of counterfeit Indian currency notes. 

The National Investigation Agency, in its investigations in the Pathankot, Uri and Handwara terrorist attack cases and in a number of counterfeit Indian currency notes cases has conclusively proved the role of the neighbouring country in orchestrating the attacks and producing and circulating the counterfeit currency. I congratulate the NIA for its thorough and professional investigation, which has exposed the machinations of various terrorist groups.

The dynamics of international terrorism have changed with certain groups using cyber communication to spread their ideology. This has led to a completely new era in terrorism world over, the phenomena of Foreign Terrorist Fighters or the FTF and Lone Wolf Attacks taking place in many parts of the world like never before.

The attacks in France, Belgium, UK and in Bangladesh to name a few made us realise that in the age of internet or cyber communication, national boundaries are no barriers for terrorists to propagate, recruit, plan and carry out attacks anywhere and at any place. I am told that the NIA has registered and investigated cases in which a number intricate conspiracies hatched in cyberspace were busted and a number of potential terrorists, both within and beyond India, were arrested.

The cyber revolution while bringing immense benefits has also created certain vulnerabilities and risks. The cyberspace transcends national boundaries. Hence, it is extremely difficult to exercise effective jurisdictional control over the same. 

The proliferation of internet-based social media platforms and communication tools by terrorist outfits for planning and execution of terrorist incidents has further exacerbated the situation. 

With Internet Service Providers operating trans-nationally across multiple jurisdictions, the only effective way to tackle globally active terrorist individuals and outfits is through international cooperation. This can be done by developing uniform standards and norms for Internet Service Providers and technology companies and with nation states facilitating information sharing to fight against terrorism. Surveillance, intelligence gathering and adequate pre-emptive and preventive measures by security agencies at a global level are required.

The United Nations has from time to time adopted various resolutions to combat global terrorism in all its formats. However, despite being members of the UN some member states continue to flout these resolutions by nurturing and providing support to terrorist organisations. It is time for the global community to take note of the situation and act against such errant member states.

No terrorist organization can function without finances. Terrorist finance is the oxygen on which terrorist activities thrive. Painstaking investigation in the past, in India and other countries, has provided useful breakthroughs and resulted into disruption of terrorist cells. 

The recent investigations by the NIA in tracing and tracking the funding of the separatist groups and leaders have successfully disrupted the supply of funds to the separatist groups. This has led to a significant decrease in the incidents of terrorism as well as decline in the subversive activities being carried out by the separatists. I hope that the NIA would continue to focus on all the aspects of financing of terrorism and effectively disrupt the channels and networks of funding to the terrorist organizations.   

Today, global terrorism is the biggest threat as internationally active terrorist groups aspire to destroy the democratic world order by using all forms of violence. These terrorist groups do not believe in equality and justice and would adopt all means propagate, advance and impose their ideologies, which are antithetical to democratic values. 

Considering the various dimensions of terrorism in India and the world as it exists today, it is extremely important to build capacities, impart training, upgrade skills and provide technological expertise to security forces and law enforcement agencies. Positive engagement with our foreign partners is necessary when it comes to fighting the scourge of global terrorism. Terrorists round the world are collaborating and adopting technology to carry out their nefarious activities surreptitiously. Therefore, it is incumbent upon law enforcement agencies and security agencies all over the world to collaborate with each other to defeat international terrorism.

For decades, India has fought the scourge of terrorism with fortitude and firm resolve. The success of India and its security forces in bringing peace to the states of North-East, Punjab, containing the situation in Kashmir and parts of the hinterland affected with Left Wing Extremism, speaks volumes of the deft handling of the situation by our security forces and agencies. We have made numerous sacrifices in our fight against terrorism and we will continue with steely determination to take on all forces inimical toward the security and integrity of India. As the largest democracy in the world, it is our duty to support the international community and collaborate with friendly countries to fight the menace of terrorism.

Lastly, a robust and strong legal framework against terrorism enforced by institutions with all the required infrastructure and human resources is a sine qua non for providing a befitting response to terrorism. Recognizing the same, the domestic legal framework against terrorism in India has been strengthened from time to time.

The government is in the process of making further amendments to the ant-terror laws to empower law enforcement agencies to not only ensure effective investigation in terrorism cases but also have fruitful prosecution to meet the ends of justice.

At the end, I once again congratulate the officers and personnel of the NIA on the occasion of NIA Day and hope that they will continue their good work and achieve greater success, in their endeavor to unearth terrorist conspiracies, apprehend the guilty, who are responsible for death and destruction, and bring them to justice and ensure peace and prosperity in the country. 

 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the State of Uttar Pradesh has to be transformed into Uttam Pradesh in terms of development and welfare. He was addressing the Lucknow Utsav on the occasion of Uttar Pradesh Diwas, in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh today. The Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Ram Naik, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Yogi Adityanath and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that Uttar Pradesh has been a great contributor to the freedom movement and it is important to remember the great figures like Veeranari Rani Lakshmi Bai. He further said that this land is a witness to the martyrdom of Amar Krantikari Mangal Pandey and his companions in 1857.  Shaheed Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Alla Khan, Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya, Govind Vallabh Pant, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jawaharlal Nehru, Acharya Narendra Dev and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee are the great men from Uttar Pradesh, he added.

The Vice President said that the State Government has taken steps to encourage new entrepreneurs in the direction of self-employment in the state through the Government of India's monetary policy, Stand-up India, PMFGP, Chief Minister Yuva Swarojgar Yojana and Vishwakarma Shram Samman Yojana. He further said that in the list of this year’s Ease of Doing Business, the state ranked 15th and hoped it will be improved during coming years. 

The Vice President said that one of the objectives of the Uttar Pradesh Utsav is to present and promote the rich cultural heritage, literary, artistic and craftsmanship. The experience of poverty eradication and employment generation through tourism in Uttar Pradesh will benefit other states, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address in Hindi:

“मैं उत्तर प्रदेश के 68वें स्थापना दिवस के अवसर पर प्रथम 'उत्तर प्रदेश उत्सव' की प्रदेशवासियों को शुभकामनाएं देता हूँ।

यद्यपि उत्तर प्रदेश के प्रत्येक जनपद का प्रखर तथा सतत् इतिहास है और जीवंत परंपरा है तथापि प्रदेश का वर्तमान नामकरण 24 जनवरी, 1950 को हुआ। 

इस वर्ष पहली बार राज्य सरकार ने 24 जनवरी को उत्तर प्रदेश दिवस के रूप में आयोजित करने का संकल्प लिया है जिसके माध्यम से अगले तीन दिन प्रदेश के नव निर्माण की अवधारणा को जनता, निदेशकों, प्रशासकों आदि के समक्ष प्रस्तुत किया जाएगा और उनकी सक्रिय भागीदारी आमंत्रित की जायेगी। 

राज्य सरकार के 40 विभाग लगभग Rs 24000 करोड़ लागत की विकासोन्मुखी परियोजनाओं का उद्घाटन करेंगे। इस अवसर पर कला, साहित्य, खेल, विज्ञान, तकनीक और शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में प्रख्यात व्यक्तियों को सम्मानित भी किया जायेगा। मैं राज्य सरकार के इस प्रयास का अभिनंदन करता हूँ तथा प्रदेश की 22 करोड़ जनता को स्वयं अपनी तरफ से तथा समस्त देशवासियों की तरफ से कोटिश: बधाई देता हूँ।

मित्रों, जैसा कि मैंने पहले कहा उत्तर प्रदेश का इतिहास समृद्ध और सतत् रहा है। राम और कृष्ण की इस पावन भूमि ने अपने समृद्ध इतिहास में आध्यात्मिक और भौतिक उत्कर्ष देखा है। 

1775 में पहली बार अवध के नवाब आसफुद्दौला ने अवध की राजधानी फैजाबाद से लखनऊ स्थानान्तरित की, तब से लखनऊ, अवध की गंगा जमुनी तहजीब का प्रतीक और पर्याय बन गया।

मित्रों, यह सप्ताह प्रदेश के निवासियों के लिए विशेष  महत्व का है। 26 जनवरी को भारत गणतंत्र भी अपनी 68 वीं वर्षगांठ मनायेगा। स्वाधीनता आंदोलन में उत्तर प्रदेश का महान योगदान रहा है। वीरनारी रानी लक्ष्मीबाई जैसे महान् विभूतियों का स्मरण करना जरूरी है। यह भूमि 1857 के अमर क्रांतिकारी मंगल पांडे और उनके साथियों की वीरता की गवाह है। शहीद राम प्रसाद बिस्मिल, अशफाक उल्ला खाँ, महामना मदन मोहन मालवीय, गोविंद वल्लभ पंत, लाल बहादुर शास्त्री, जवाहर लाल नेहरू, आचार्य नरेंद्र देव और पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री अटलजी जैसे महापुरुषों की कर्मभूमि है उत्तर प्रदेश।

आगामी गणतंत्र दिवस पर इन महान विभूतियों के संघर्ष और समर्पण का स्मरण करने और देश की सेवा के संकल्प को पुन:सिद्ध करने का अवसर होगा।

मित्रों, उत्तर प्रदेश क्षेत्रफल के हिसाब से देश के कुल क्षेत्रफल का भाग 7% है। यद्यपि भारत की कुल आबादी का लगभग 20% भाग उत्तर प्रदेश में रहता है। यह प्रदेश, देश की अर्थव्यवस्था में लगभग 8.5% अंशदान देता है।

सूक्ष्म, लघु और मध्यम इकाइयों की दृष्टि से उत्तर प्रदेश  में सबसे अधिक ऐसी इकाइयाँ हैं। देश के 8% लघु उद्योग उत्तर प्रदेश में स्थित हैं तथा कृषि के बाद सर्वाधिक रोजगार देने वाला क्षेत्र है। इसमें पारंपरिक हस्तशिल्प, खाद्य प्रसंस्करण, कालीन, चमड़े के उत्पाद, रेडीमेड गारमेंटस, प्रमुख क्षेत्र है। देश से हो रहे कुल हस्तशिल्प निर्यात का 44% उत्तर प्रदेश से होता है। इसी प्रकार देश के चर्म उत्पाद के निर्यात का कुल 26% उत्तर प्रदेश से होता है। 

प्रदेश सरकार ने 'एक जनपद - एक उत्पाद' की अवधारणा के माध्यम से परंपरागत शिल्प तथा लघु और सूक्ष्म उद्यमियों को विकसित कर इस क्षेत्र में  कौशल युक्त रोजगार की नई संभावनाएँ पैदा करने का सराहनीय प्रयास किया है। 

इसी प्रकार पारंपरिक शिल्पकारों तथा कारीगरों को प्रशिक्षण देकर उन्हें सर्टिफिकेट दिया जा सकता है जिससे उन्हें अपना व्यवसाय स्थापित करने के लिए सरकारी योजनाओं से सहायता मिल सकेगी और बैंक ऋण प्राप्त हो सकेगा।  

मुझे हर्ष है कि राज्य सरकार ने भारत सरकार की मुद्रा योजना, स्टैंड अप योजना, PMFGP, मुख्य मंत्री युवा स्वरोजगार योजना तथा विश्वकर्मा श्रम सम्मान योजना के माध्यम से प्रदेश में नव उद्यमियों को स्वरोजगार की दिशा में प्रोत्साहित करने के लिए कदम उठाये हैं। गत वर्ष Ease of Doing Business की सूची में प्रदेश का स्थान 15वाँ था। इस स्थिति में सुधार की बहुत संभावनाएँ हैं। 

मुझे यह जानकर संतोष है कि राज्य सरकार निवेश को आकर्षित करने के लिए नीतिगत तथा व्यवसथागत बदलाव कर रही है। आपके प्रयासों के लिए मेरी शुभकामनाएं।

उत्तर प्रदेश उत्सव का एक उद्देश्य यहाँ की समृद्ध सांस्कृतिक, साहित्यिक, कलात्मक तथा शिल्प परंपरा को प्रस्तुत करना तथा प्रोत्साहित करना भी है। पर्यटन के माध्यम से गरीबी उन्मूलन तथा रोजगार सृजन के आपके अनुभव अन्य राज्यों को भी लाभान्वित करेंगे।

मुझे यह जानकर हर्ष है कि राज्य सरकार भारत सरकार की  'प्रसाद स्कीम' के माध्यम से पर्यटन केंद्रों पर Tourism infrastructure तैयार कर रही है। मुझे आशा है कि प्रदेश की सांस्कृतिक धरोहर आज की पीढ़ियों को भी रोजगार प्रदान करेगी।

ग्रामीण एवं कृषि विकास के क्षेत्र में मुझे यह जानकर हर्ष है कि प्रधानमंत्री  ग्राम आवास योजना के तहत 8.80 लाख आवासों की स्वीकृति देकर 99% लक्ष्य प्राप्त कर लिया गया है। 

मित्रों,मैं एक बार पुन: राज्य के 75 जनपदों में निवास कर रही 22 करोड जनता को प्रदेश के उत्सव की हार्दिक बधाई और आगामी इन्वेसटर समिट-2018 की सफलता के लिए शुभकामनाएँ देता हूँ। आपके कर्मठ और प्रगतिशील मुख्यमंत्री को भी मैं शुभकामनाएँ देना चाहता हूं। उत्तर प्रदेश को उत्तम प्रदेश बनाना है।

जय हिंद!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that every citizen must consider it as his sacred duty to pay taxes as development and welfare measures would suffer if governments do not get adequate revenues. He was addressing the National Seminar on Contemporary Challenges and Issues in Finance, Marketing and Taxation, held at Keshav Memorial College in Hyderabad today. The Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Mohammad Mahmood Ali and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that while tax evasion has to be dealt with sternly, it should be ensured that there is no unnecessary harassment of the tax payers by overzealous officials. Transparency in governance will ensure accountability and also improve remittances to the government, he added.

The Vice President said that with introduction of GST, the biggest ever tax reform taken since Independence, India is finally ‘one-country, one-market’. He further said that this reform has changed the face of the indirect tax regime in the country as it imposes one tax instead of several taxes by various State Governments and the Union Government.  It has made compliance easy for businesses and traders and demonstrated the victory of bipartisanship in the democratic and federal set-up of India, he added.

India’s tax-to-GDP ratio is 16.6 per cent in FY2017, which compares with 26.0 per cent in the USA, 20.1 per cent in China, and 34.3 per cent in OECD countries. India needs to significantly ramp up its tax-to-GDP ratio to fund a modern 21st century government which can offer basic public goods and social security to its citizens. Direct tax collected in FY2018YTD has grown at 18.2 per cent. This increase in collection has been driven by increase in compliances with the number of taxpayers increasing for both direct and indirect taxes. 5.9 million tax-payers have registered for GST and 28.2 million people filed their income-tax returns for FY2017.

Demonetization, SIT on black money and notification of the Benami Transactions Act, 1988 are some of the strong steps taken to bring more economic activity into the tax net,  even as the war on black money needs to continue unabated.

The Vice President said that the expanding middle class will be the key driver of India’s economic growth in the coming years and the need of the hour is to take full advantage of this demographic numbers by creating adequate job opportunities for the young population.  He further said that merely turning out lakhs of students with degrees is not enough, we have to provide them skills not only to earn livelihood but life skills that will enable them to deal effectively with any situation. He opined that the education system should be re-oriented to not only impart life skills to students, but also to ensure that youngsters remain committed to strong ethical and moral values. Whatever be the line of their professional pursuit, they all must remain wedded to India’s age-old cultural and syncretic values best embodied by the concept of Vasudhaika Kutumbakam, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to inaugurate this national seminar on “Contemporary issues and challenges in Finance, Marketing and Taxation” and share my thoughts with you all.

I must compliment Keshav Memorial College for organizing this seminar at the right time in the wake of reformatory measures taken by the government like demonetization, introduction of Goods and Services Tax and Bankruptcy and Insolvency Code. 

Dear students!  India was a prosperous and wealthy nation more than two centuries ago and contributed 27 per cent of the world GDP.  India traded in textiles, spices, cotton, semi-precious stones, sugar, pepper, indigo, ivory and silk fabric, among others. Traders and travelers, who came to India from across the seas, were astonished by the wealth and prosperity of the Indians. Indus Valley Civilization is the best example of how advanced ancient India was in those times.

However, following foreign invasions, India’s colonization by the British, the country lost its pre-eminent position and even missed the industrial revolution. Post-independence, India’s economic growth remained low for several years and was described as “Hindu rate of growth”. Following liberalization in the 90s, India’s economic growth picked up momentum and the country emerged as the fastest growing large economy. India’s GDP has grown at 8.9 per cent CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) in real terms since 1991 – taking India from being a US$225 billion economy in 1991 to a more than US$ 2 trillion economy now. 

While the first major economic reforms were initiated by the P V Narasimha Rao government, the second sweeping reforms were introduced by Shri Vajpayee and the third set of reforms initiated by the present government are drastically transforming the Indian economy. 

 External agencies like the World Bank and IMF have projected India’s growth rate to be 7.3 per cent in 2018. India is projected to become the third largest economy in the next 10-15 years. A  massive recapitalization of the public sector banks at Rs.2.11 lakh crore is expected to improve credit growth and private sector investment. The other major reform of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 has strengthened the rights of the creditors.

 The infrastructure build out has been very rapid-- 24X7 electricity for all, massive increase in road construction across both rural and urban India, opening up of more than 50 airports and heliports in India as part of the UDAN scheme (up from 75 operational airports when the government came in) will boost the economy in the long run.

The expanding middle class will be the key driver of India’s economic growth in the coming years. With the a large population of India, about 65 per cent remaining under 35 years,  the need of the hour of is to take full advantage of this demographic numbers by creating adequate  job opportunities for the young population.  Merely turning out lakhs of students with degrees is not enough, we have to provide them skills not only to earn livelihood but life skills that will enable them to deal effectively with any situation.

Earlier, children used to automatically learn those type of skills due to the joint family system, but now with increasing number of nuclear families, it appears that today’s youngsters are missing out on them. The education system should be re-oriented to not only impart life skills to students, but also to ensure that youngsters remain committed to strong ethical and moral values. Whatever be the line of your professional pursuit, you all must remain wedded to India’s age-old cultural and syncretic values best embodied by the concept of Vasudhaika Kutumbakam.

Coming to the topic on hand, every citizen must consider it as his sacred duty to pay taxes as development and welfare measures would suffer if governments do not get adequate revenues. In fact, one of the major objectives of both demonetization and GST is to increase tax compliance. Expansion of formal economy will naturally lead to increased tax collections and higher revenues to the government, which in turn will be used to accelerate development—building roads, schools, hospitals and other essential infrastructure.  

While tax evasion has to be dealt with sternly, it should be ensured that there is no unnecessary harassment of the tax payers by overzealous officials. Transparency in governance will ensure accountability and also improve remittances to the government.

With introduction of GST, the biggest ever tax reform taken since Independence, India is finally ‘one-country, one-market’. This reform has changed the face of the indirect tax regime in the country as it imposes one tax instead of several taxes by various State Governments and the Union Government.  In other words, it has made compliance easy for businesses and traders and will lead to further improvement in the ease of doing business in India. GST demonstrates the victory of bipartisanship in the democratic and federal set-up of India.

India’s tax-to-GDP ratio is 16.6 per cent in FY2017, which compares with 26.0 per cent in the USA, 20.1 per cent in China, and 34.3 per cent in OECD countries. India needs to significantly ramp up its tax-to-GDP ratio to fund a modern 21st century government which can offer basic public goods and social security to its citizens. Direct tax collected in FY2018YTD has grown at 18.2 per cent. This increase in collection has been driven by increase in compliances with the number of taxpayers increasing for both direct and indirect taxes. 5.9 million tax-payers have registered for GST and 28.2 million people filed their income-tax returns for FY2017.

Demonetization, SIT on black money and notification of the Benami Transactions Act, 1988 are some of the strong steps taken to bring more economic activity into the tax net,  even as the war on black money needs to continue unabated.

Since GST will be levied at the manufacturing cost and collected at the point of sale, it will bring down the price and benefit the consumer. It will be a win-win situation for both the manufacturers and consumers as reduction in price will lead to increased consumption. GST will also eliminate corruption and tax evasion as a retailer will not be able to conduct sales without the bill. Since all the compliances like registration and returns will have to be done online, GST will increase compliance and makes the system transparent, hassle-free and eliminate corruption.

As mentioned earlier, paying taxes will improve public finances and enable the governments to meet their developmental and social objectives. Therefore, companies and businesses contribute to economic prosperity and growth of the nation.

 Economic growth and reforms have created a large consuming class of citizens in India who now have consumption patterns very similar to the best in the world. Around 50-100 million people in India have broken out into the ranks of the global consuming class. There is an aspiring class of 200-300 million middle-class Indians (many of them now own four wheelers and electronic gadgets). Another class of 500-600 million people is now breaking out of the poverty and graduating from cycles to motor cycles and mobiles. 

India has hence seen significant interest from foreign firms to invest FDI to serve this market.

Following the financial crisis, regulatory reforms such as Basel III were introduced for banks to improve their health. Various growing areas of finance, including micro finance, crowd funding for startups in India, cashless economy and impact investing are gaining popularity. 

Sophisticated mathematical and technological developments have also advanced the field of quantitative analysis for those who work in investment management, risk management, derivative pricing, algorithmic trading, and other areas that require the application of mathematics in finance.

Further social marketing, Not-For-Profit Marketing, Guerilla Marketing, Green Marketing and Buzz Marketing are gaining popularity.

Implementation of new tax reforms, raising commodities prices and uncertain global economic environment are expected to have a bearing on the Indian economy.

In the wake of these changes and challenges, the academic institutions need to make their curriculum relevant to the contemporary needs of the society. I am sure, the participants at this national seminar on the challenges to Finance, Marketing and Taxation will analyze the trends and suggest solutions to various issues pertaining to economy and provide right inputs to students, researchers and the government. I congratulate the Department of Commerce of Keshav Memorial Institute of Commerce and Sciences for organizing this event and wish them great success.

Thank You.  JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asked the medical researchers to come up with path breaking advances in the prevention and treatment of cancer. He was addressing the Graduation Ceremony at Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai today. The Governor of Maharashtra, Shri Ch. Vidyasagar Rao and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that researchers must explore ancient Indian medical systems like Ayurveda for alternative solutions. We should see if there are some indigenous cost-effective solutions that may be useful to make cancer treatment more affordable, he added.

The Vice President said that Cancer is a major public health concern in India and has become one of the 10 leading causes of deaths.  He further said that Cancer is one of the dreaded diseases and also a very costly disease in terms of treatment. A better understanding of the likely causes and early detection could help reduce the disease burden in our country, he added.

The Vice President asked doctors and students in the medical profession to create awareness on the need to observe personal hygiene and maintain sanitation. Lack of personal hygiene causes infections like HPV, which in turn has the potential to cause cancer of the cervix, he added.

The Vice President said that regarding treatment of cancer patients, there is a need to operate more number of palliative care centres or hospices. Such centres are needed to provide relief from pain and emotional distress to suffering patients, he added.

The Vice President has appealed government, media and doctors to promote measures that prevent cancer. He also said that there is further need to educate people about available treatment options.

The Vice President said that the screening of people will help in early detection of cancer. He also wanted the people to go back to roots, especially the way we live and the way we think. He said awareness must be created, particularly, among youngsters, on the need to lead healthy lifestyles and avoid consumption of junk food.

The Vice President said that Yoga training should be imparted to students as part of ensuring healthy lifestyles. Yoga is a holistic approach to healthy living and there is evidence that it enhances the well being and quality of life, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am happy to be with all of you at the graduation ceremony in which the students of the Tata Memorial Centre are being awarded various degrees. 

It is a day of celebration and an important day in the life of this illustrious institution that was founded almost eighty years ago. It is a memorable day in the life of the students and teachers as they complete an important milestone in the sacred mission of transmission of knowledge and skills. It is a joyous occasion for the parents of the students as they see their wards move on successfully in their educational journey.

This institution has a long and impressive track record of serving the suffering humanity. 

Cancer is a major public health concern in India and has become one of the ten leading causes of deaths.

In India, it is estimated that there are about 3 million cases of cancer at any particular point of time with 10 lakh new cases occurring every year. About 5 lakh deaths occur annually in the country due to cancer in India. 

Nearly two-thirds of the patients present themselves in advanced stages that are not amenable to cure. Nearly half of them die within a year of diagnosis.

Fortunately, nearly two-thirds of the cancers are completely preventable and amenable to early detection. Greater awareness and early detection are therefore very critical for reducing the incidence of cancer. 

I am pleased to learn that Tata Memorial Centre, a Constituent Institute of Homi Bhabha National Institute (Deemed to be University), which offers super-specialty and PG courses, trains the largest Human Resource for the management of Cancers in India including training of Sub-Saharan African doctors, Nurses and Doctors from Myanmar, Bangladesh and other countries.

I commend TMC for providing its technical know-how for setting up cancer hospitals and cancer wings at Government Medical Colleges and other Centers. I am told that TMC under Department of Atomic Energy has started setting up new Cancer Care Centres at Mohali, Punjab, Banaras Hindu Campus, Varanasi, Railway Cancer Hospital, Varanasi,Cancer Hospital, Vishakhapatnam and Booraha Cancer Institute, Guwahati, Assam.

I am also delighted to learn that Tata Memorial Hospital has launched a new programme called ""Navigation Program for Patient Care - KEVAT"". For the first time in India, Tata Memorial Centre (TMC) has introduced a new specialty in Healthcare. In collaboration with Tata Institute of Social Sciences and support from Tata Trust, a  one year (full time) Advanced Diploma in Patient Navigation(KEVAT) is being offered. I think this is a step in the right direction. Very often, patients and their families don’t understand diagnoses, are not aware of various treatment options and available resources. This course will create a specialized workforce of trained professionals to help patients manage their medical experience. It will assist all sections of society, particularly vulnerable populations, to overcome barriers to health care access.

By assisting patients with navigating through complicated and multi-step health care system, the doctors will earn the much-needed trust and goodwill.

Cancer is one of the dreaded diseases and also a very costly disease in terms of treatment. A better understanding of the likely causes and early detection could help reduce the disease burden in our country. According to projections made by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in 2016, the total number of new cases is expected to touch 17.3 lakh by 2020. It has been estimated that the number of deaths due to cancer is likely to reach 8.8 lakh cases by 2020. The data also showed that only 12.5 per cent of patients come for treatment in the early stages of the disease. Breast cancer was the most common among women, while the incidence of mouth cancer was highest among men. 

The burden of cancer is expected to further increase due to increase in life expectancy, lifestyle factors, unhealthy dietary habits, growing usage of carcinogenic substances such as tobacco, betel nut and alcohol. Infection with certain virus and obesity are directly attributable to cancers of cervix and breast respectively.

In Maharashtra, the leading sites of cancer in men are the cancers of the mouth, throat, lungs, esophagus (food pipe). These cancers are related to use of tobacco, supari and alcohol. Making lifestyle changes by avoiding the cancer-inducing substances can reduce the incidence of these cancers.

In women, the commonest are cancers of cervix, breast and oral cavity. Cervix cancers can be eliminated by providing basic amenities to women such as running water and privacy of a toilet. Awareness has to be created on the need to observe personal hygiene and maintain sanitation. Lack of personal hygiene causes infections like HPV, which in turn has the potential to cause cancer of the cervix. 

Breast cancer can be controlled by measures for obesity control. Simple interventions such as Visual Examination of Cervix by health worker and regular breast self examination have proven to be beneficial for early detection.

With non-communicable diseases on the rise, concerted action is need from all stakeholders, including health professionals on creating awareness among the people, particularly youngsters, on the need to lead healthy lifestyles and avoid consumption of junk food, alcohol and tobacco. 

According to Factsheet of Global Adult Tobacco Survey, India 2016-17 (GATS-2), 19.0 per cent of men, 12.8 per cent of women and 21.4 per cent of all adults smoke tobacco; 42. 4 per cent of men, 14.2 per cent of women and 28.6 per cent of all adults either smoke tobacco and/ or use smokeless tobacco.

Right from school days, Yoga training should be imparted to students as part of ensuring healthy lifestyles. I would like to emphasize that Yoga is a holistic approach to healthy living and there is evidence that it enhances the well being and quality of life. 

As regards treatment of cancer patients, there is a need to operate more number of palliative care centres or hospices. Such centres are needed to provide relief from pain and emotional distress to suffering patients.

I am glad that Tata Memorial Centre with its mission of “service, education & research”, is one of the largest tertiary cancer centres in India and is serving the needs of a large population with a record of 65,000 new cases registered and five to six lakh cases coming for follow-up at Tata Memorial Hospital. 

 

Dear students, 

You are privileged to be graduating from this institution of excellence. You have successfully acquired new knowledge and skills. 

You have chosen a profession that is the noblest among all the professions. In the Indian tradition, doctors are considered to be embodiments of divinity because they can make a difference between life and death. One of the 1000 names of Lord Vishnu, incidentally, is ‘VAIDYA’. 

The patients come to the doctor with great expectations. They look for soothing words, healing touch and a medicine that will restore them to good health. 

Your specialization here is even more challenging because cancer is generally perceived as an incurable disease and impossible to root out. 

The prolonged treatment with its attendant pain and financial resource drain can be so stressful to the patients and their families. There is tremendous suffering, anxiety and it is usually a traumatic experience for the entire family. 

 

Dear students,

You have multiple challenges ahead of you but I am sure many of the basic skills you need in your profession, you have already acquired during your stay in this institute. But, then, there are no full stops in education. There are only commas and semi-colons. You will have to constantly learn. You must strive to be the best in your field. 

I congratulate each one of you on your achievements for which you are being awarded degrees today.  I do hope you will continue to research the causes of cancer and find new ways to alleviate human suffering. 

I would urge you to broaden your knowledge base and practice medicine with greater competence, confidence and compassion.

You should try to explore if the ancient Indian medical systems like Ayurveda can offer some alternative solutions. According to some scholars, cancer treatment with Ayurveda goes back to 7th century BC, where Atreya and Dhanwanthari used herbal medicines for treating early stages of cancer. We should see if there are some indigenous cost-effective solutions that may be useful to make cancer treatment more affordable.  

I urge all the medical researchers across the country to focus on research and come up with path breaking advances in the prevention and treatment of cancer. In fact, as a country, we must devote more energy to research and development. We may get some insights from the past that may be useful to illuminate the future. We must access the state of the art from the countries around the world.

I am extremely pleased that that the Tata family has established this Centre and also many institutions of excellence. The private sector has been playing an important role in nation building and the Tatas have been the forerunners in many ways. I hope many other industrial houses will demonstrate their social commitment by establishing many more social enterprises and institutions for the larger public good.

I congratulate the Dean and the faculty members of the Tata Memorial Centre who are shaping this institution as a centre of excellence in teaching and research. 

I wish you and the Centre many more fruitful years in your most noble endeavour to bring relief to the patients suffering from cancer. I am glad that the Homi Bhabha National Institute is harnessing nuclear power for improving the quality of life of our citizens and has set new benchmarks of academic excellence. My sincerest appreciation to the Vice Chancellor and his dedicated team of professionals.

I once again appreciate the commitment and caring attitude of the doctors in this centre.

I wish them all the very best in their efforts to ensure that the students are exposed to the state of the art in the specialized fields each of them is pursuing here. 

 

JAI HIND!”

Meditation is the ultimate process of human evolution to realize who we are, why we are here and the purpose of this existence.  It is all about reclaiming or re-establishing the connection with the source we all come from, she said.

He was addressing the All India Builders’ Convention in Bengaluru today. Karnataka Governor Shri Vajubhai Vala, Lok Sabha MP Shri PC Mohan and others were present on the occasion. 

“The efforts of the Government to build an inclusive and equitable society must be supplemented by Private Industries. Organization like yours can play a key, constructive role in eradicating poverty, illiteracy, improving livelihoods and in making this planet a better place to live through environment-friendly measures,” he said 

The Vice President said that CSR is not mere charity or philanthropy but a responsibility towards making a difference to the lives of people. There is a huge scope to launch CSR initiative in different areas, including healthcare, education and environment. One important area is vocational training to improve skills and employability of the needy and poor, he said. 

The Vice President said that builders have a big role to play in developing the country’s Infrastructure, especially the Smart Cities project. “You are the valuable partners in building the Infrastructure of New India and work with the Government in the massive push to improve Infrastructure in the Railways and Roads Development and in boosting the Regional Connectivity through 50 new Airports,” he said.

The Vice President further said that Flagship Schemes of Housing for All and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation will provide a huge thrust to Housing and Infrastructure growth in the country.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that despite agriculture being the main occupation of most Indians, farmers are finding the profession unattractive because of low and stagnated income and productivity. He said this while delivering the 14th Dr V.K.R.V. Rao Memorial Lecture at the Institute for Social and Economic Change in Bengaluru today. Karnataka Governor Shri Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala, Union Minister for Chemicals & Fertilizers and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Ananth Kumar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that strategies for faster, inclusive and sustainable growth must address the issues faced by farmers.

Government initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY),  e-NAM and Soil Health Cards are  helping the farmers to improve productivity and get better returns, he said. 

The Vice President said that initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana are required for addressing the risks in livestock sector. 

The Vice President said that we have a legitimate reason for being proud of our farmers’ achievements. We have successfully overcome food shortages. We have moved from food import to self-sufficiency and exports. We have made the transition from subsistence farming to intensive and technology-led cultivation. At present, India occupies top position in the production of many crops. It has the highest milk production in the world and has seen many transformative changes as it ushered in green, white, blue and yellow revolutions, he said.

The Vice President said that an enhanced investment, both public and private is required. We need to formulate a long-term and a medium term action plan detailing how private and public investments will be channelled and the strategic directions we should pursue to revitalize this sector, he said. 

The Vice President has outlined twelve initiatives that might help increase productivity and generate adequate returns to farmers.


	First is the use of good quality seeds which can enhance productivity by 15 to 20%. 
	Second, a balanced use of fertilizers is essential for raising agricultural productivity. 
	Third, timely institutional credit plays a pivotal role for adoption of innovations by marginal and small farmers. 
	Fourth, diversification by supplementing farming with allied activities like dairying, fisheries and poultry can contribute significantly to increasing farmers’ incomes. 
	Fifth, farm mechanization in India must expand. 
	Sixth, intensification of agriculture and combining agriculture with horticulture and mechanization of hill agriculture can increase the farmers’ income. 
	Seventh, we must strengthen the ecosystem that encourages agro-based industries. 
	Eighth, there has to be a much better understanding of water use. 
	Ninth, farmers need to realize larger share of the consumer price.  Tenth, we may have to consider substantive reforms in the land policy.
	Eleventh, we need to develop climate change resilient farming practices. 
	Twelfth, knowledge sharing processes must be streamlined.

                The Vice President of India Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that Untouchability is the real enemy of humanity and helping the poor is real patriotism. He addressed the All India Telugu Association event in Chennai today commemorating 258th birth anniversary of Veerapandiya Kattabomman & 250th Jayanti of Sadhguru Thyāgarāja.  Tamil Nadu Governor Shri Banwarilal Purohit, Shri P. Balakrishna Reddy, Minister for Youth Welfare and Sports Development of Tamil Nadu and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that Veerapandiya Kattabomman, one of the earliest freedom fighters, had courageously fought against the British in the 18th century.  His saga of valiant resistance and indomitable courage continues to inspire all of us even today. Kattabomman exemplifies the qualities of courage and conviction, he said.

The Vice President said that India’s great saint-composer, Thyāgarāja, a pioneer of Carnatic music, has provided inspiration to thousands of musicians over the last century. He embodies the ennobling and enthralling range of Indian music. Music, literature and poetry give solace, he said.

The Vice President said that India has always celebrated diversity and plurality. It has welcomed co-existence of diverse languages and religions. It has fostered unity in diversity. It has facilitated individual identity but has promoted a culture of mutual respect. We have been particularly sensitive to the linguistic and cultural needs of minority groups, he said. 

The Vice President called on Youth to take full advantage of opportunities available in the country and help the country by creating jobs. Major impediments like poverty, illiteracy, gender divide and discrimination, urban-rural divide, corruption, casteism and communalism have to be addressed, he said.

The Vice President said that the pre-requisite for this transformation is to be aware of the bottlenecks and constraints, and then have the ability and agility to overcome them. We are in the process of transforming India. That is the theme that excites all of us to achieve higher levels of performance, growth and prosperity. This transformation requires a passion and sense of purpose, he further said. 

The Vice President said that one must protect and preserve the best traditions in our culture. We should be aware of the rich heritage that makes us proud heirs to a unique universal world view. We should welcome bright ideas wherever they come from, he added.

He was addressing the gathering after conferring FIEO Exports Excellence Awards 2018 in Chennai today.

With the focus on creating state-of-the-art sea ports, airports and super highways to connect manufacturing centres to ports with best supporting ecosystem, the exports should pick up faster and maintain a steady growth, he said.

 The Vice President said that Government is giving greater thrust on development of infrastructure, agriculture sector and health sector. These efforts will certainly help Indian economy grow further. The “Make in India” initiative to support India’s Manufacturing sector together with a focus on infrastructure growth and multiple initiatives for boosting domestic demand will further strengthen our economy, he said. 

The Vice President further said that the decisions of the Government including demonetization and GST are expected to have a positive impact in the coming years.  “I am aware of the initial difficulties that the exporters have been facing due to these steps. However, I am sure that the GST Council and the Government have been quite responsive to such teething troubles and have been taking prompt action to address these concerns,” he said.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that reforms in the style and substance of governance should be the constant endeavour. He was delivering the Keynote address at the 110th Annual Convention of the Indian Officers Association (IOA) on ‘Leadership at the Frontier of Tomorrow’ in Chennai today. Tamil Nadu Governor Shri Banwarilal Purohit, Fisheries Minister of Tamil Nadu, Shri Jayakumar and other dignitaries were present at the occasion. 

The Vice President said that fruits of democracy will reach the citizens if we can combine a resolute political will with robust administrative skill. Effective service delivery deepens the roots of democracy because it ensures that all citizens, especially those whose voices are not adequately heard, participate actively in nation building, he said.  

The Vice President said that any policy is only as good as its implementation. The positive impact of policies has to be felt by the citizens. This will happen only if the administration is responsive, the decisions are judicious, the execution is swift and there is a culture of continuous monitoring and evaluation, he said.  

The Vice President said that with an efficient civil administration, India can leverage every challenge that comes its way in transforming itself into a world leader in various spheres in the years to come. As we expand globally and open our doors to the entry of multinational corporations to participate in nation’s progress, there needs to be more emphasis on efficiency, transparency and ethical compliance, he said. 

The Vice President said that public administration is no longer concerned with just implementation and monitoring of government policies.  In a rapidly changing world, the administrative apparatus must be more agile than earlier. It must be innovative, humble, emphatic and objective, he said.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that education is the key lever for transforming India. He addressed the sixth edition of ThinkEdu Conclave organized by The New Indian Express (TNIE) in Chennai today where he stressed on the need to reshape the education system.  

Education is a powerful tool that empowers individuals and transforms communities. It can break the vicious cycles of poverty. It can enable a country like India with a large youth population, to grow. But only if it can capitalize on its demographic advantage, he said. 

The Vice President said that true education gives us the humility that makes us realize as to how much more there is to learn. This humility makes us lifelong learners and we grow as individuals.

The Vice President said that without a good human resource development strategy, country cannot achieve sustainable development. Without equipping our children, youth and adults with the required knowledge, skills and attitudes, we cannot be a developed nation, he said. 

The Vice President said that the humanistic, inclusive, harmonious vision given to us by ancestors must be integrated into our education system.

The Vice President called on people involved in education sector to focus on improving access to pre-primary education and elementary education of good quality. We cannot afford to ignore this vital dimension any longer. We cannot build a new India on a weak foundation. We cannot tolerate the high level of illiteracy, he said.

The Vice President said India requires a curriculum that makes learners knowledgeable, skillful and responsible. We should make put the children at the centre of schooling. We should make the system respond to the learning needs of youth and adults. The higher education system must focus on research and extending the frontiers of knowledge, he said. 

The Vice President said that Education system must have essential guiding principles to help students become good human beings. Education is for employment. Education is for enlightenment. Education is for empowerment. Education is for evolution into a competent and caring individual. Education is for transformation of societal norms, he said.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has called upon the people of the country to turn Organ Donation into a National Level Mass Movement. He also asked people leaving the country for better opportunities to come back and serve the motherland – Learn, Earn & Return, he said. 

Tamil Nadu Governor Shri Banwarilal Purohit, State Health Minister Dr. C. Vijaya Baskar and Health Secretary Dr. J. Radhakrishnan were also present at the event to celebrate successful completion of One thousand liver transplantations in Tamil Nadu, in Chennai today. 

The Vice President said that Organ Donation is a noble way of living beyond death. We must encourage people on the importance of Organ Donation and make them participate in such righteous cause. It is the best way to live after death, he said.

Voicing concerns over the rise of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), particularly among youngsters, the Vice President said that the present-day lifestyles are hugely contributing to this menace. Avoiding consumption of junk food and alcohol, eating a balanced diet, ending sedentary lifestyles and doing regular exercises or Yoga-Asanas are essential for people, particularly the youth, to remain healthy and not fall prey to various diseases, he said.

The Vice President said that complex procedures like liver transplantation must be in the reach of common man. One of the ways to make it more affordable is to create the necessary expertise and facilities in government hospitals like what Tamil Nadu is doing, he said. 

He further said that health insurance schemes must cover wider segments of population and procedures like liver and heart transplants must be included so that nobody is denied access to badly needed medical treatment for want of affordability. Partnerships need to be forged between Public and Private Healthcare Institutions to ensure quality and affordable treatment to the common man with the Government providing subsidy if needed, he added.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu has asserted that the success of the Indian diaspora in different parts of the world is a clear reflection of the strength of the Indian values of assimilation and inclusivity. Shri Naidu said so in his Key Note address at the Valedictory Session of the first ever PIO-Parliamentarians Conference held here today.

Lauding the success of the over three crore Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) across the world, Shri Venkaiah Naidu said, “The presence of such a large number of elected representatives of Indian origin in legislatures of such a large number of countries from across the world goes beyond the symbolism of the expanding horizons of the influence of India in the global scheme of things. In my considered view, it is a clear reflection of the strength of the Indian values of inclusivity and assimilation, nurtured and consolidated over the centuries since ancient times”. 

Shri Naidu further said, “This land of ours had assimilated in its fold over the centuries a large variety of people who came here for a variety of reasons including for learning, commerce and trade, religious propagation and even invaders. Every such encounter had further enriched the syncretic nature of our traditional values and ethos. The inhabitants of the motherland of India and those who have roots here can be genuinely proud of such time-tested values which constitute the principle of unity of mankind”. 

Elaborating further, the Vice President noted, “When we talk of Indian Nationalism, we refer to the pride that is associated with such inclusive humanism, which is native to this land. Some deviant words and deeds of some misguided persons can in no way dent the quality and strength of the core values of our motherland”. 

Shri Naidu asserted that while the citizens take pride in the spirit of Indian nationalism that unites the people of different social and religious hues cohabiting in the country, Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) imbibe and uphold the ethos and values of those countries which again is a manifestation of the spirit of ‘assimilation’ which is at the heart of core Indian values. 

Shri Naidu said the biggest challenge to world order today is terrorism and we must build a global consensus to fight the menace. “All of us must recognise terrorism as a threat to humanity and take concerted action to curb it. Unfortunately, some people are clothing terror in the garb of religion but, in fact, terrorism has no basis in any religion of the world,” he said.

The Vice President said the Indian diaspora, which is the second largest such community in the world has contributed enormously to strengthening India’s cultural, literary, political and economic bonds across the world. He urged them to contribute in an appropriate manner to the ongoing efforts to build a New India. He referred to the story of a little squirrel contributing its bit to the making of a bridge across the sea for Rama to reach Lanka.

Following is the text of the Vice President’s address:

“It gives me immense pleasure to be present here amidst you on this historical occasion of  the First PIO-Parliamentary Conference. This is also a  special occasion to pay high respects to our  ancestors,  remember their sacrifices, acknowledge their struggle and celebrate successes and achievements of their descendants.  We commemorated the 100 years of abolition of indentured labour last year so that the history of suffering and cruelty will not be repeated again.

As you know, country of your ancestral roots is the largest democracy  in the world. It gives us a wonderful feeling that PIO-law makers across the continents are here today with us.

India has the second largest diaspora in the world estimated at over 31 million (3.1 crore) spread across the globe whose ancestral roots can be traced to traders, indentured labourers, political deportees, business entrepreneurs among others. Far away from their homes, our Girmitiya brothers and sisters underwent a prolonged period of trial and tribulations, indignities and physical and mental sufferings. Long journeys in ships were extremely difficult and painful. Despite all these suffering and challenges, the evolution of diaspora is remarkable. 

Today, there is not a patch of foreign land which is not inhabited by Indians and glows with traces and influence of our multi-layered culture. We are proud of  our  rich Diaspora,  spread over many countries and across continents,  who stand out for  their innate ability to assimilate and yet maintain their  distinct identity.

Overseas Indians are not just content with tried and tested professions and vocations; many of them have successfully carved a career in politics, government, and diplomacy. In many countries, such as Mauritius, Fiji, Trinidad & Tobago and Portugal, PIOs have become heads of state and government. This year, to mark the return of Mahatma Gandhiji, the greatest Pravasi on the earth, to India in 1915, we are celebrating the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas with the PIO Members of Parliament and Mayors from around 23 countries, and I warmly welcome you and thank you for finding time to be here with us. 

Hon’ble Members of Parliament and Mayors, you are from different countries and regions and may be professing different professions in addition to your political career, but there is one vital spiritual bond that unites you – it is the sense of organic connection to this ancestral land, the deep-rooted sense of Indian-ness that is civilizational and predates nation states.  

The essence of Indianness is, in my view, the global vision, the holistic vision and harmonious vision.  We have believed that the whole world is one family.  We believe that life has to be viewed as an integrated whole.  We believe that harmony and peace are at the heart of sustainable development. It is this unique world view we have collectively inherited. It is this world view that has inspired all Indians over the last two thousand years.  This is the message which is probably more relevant than ever in today’s world. 

We must combat the disruptive forces of terrorism that are impeding development. All of us must recognise terrorism as a threat to humanity and take concerted action to curb it. Unfortunately, some people are clothing terror in the garb of religion but, in fact, terrorism has no basis in any religion of the world. I urge each of our countries and the United Nations to build a global consensus against terror in all its forms so that we can focus our energies and resources on the welfare of our peoples.

The presence of such a large number of elected representatives of Indian origin in legislatures of such a large number of countries from across the world goes beyond the symbolism of the expanding horizons of the influence of India in the global scheme of things. In my considered view, it is a clear reflection of the strength of the Indian values of inclusivity and assimilation, nurtured and consolidated over the centuries since ancient times. 

This land of ours had assimilated in its fold over the centuries, a large variety of people who came here for a variety of reasons including for learning, commerce and trade, religious propagation and even invaders. Every such encounter had further enriched the syncretic nature of our traditional values and ethos. The inhabitants of the motherland of India and those who have their roots here can be genuinely proud of such time tested values which constitute the principle of unity of mankind.

When we talk of Indian Nationalism, we refer to the pride that is associated with such inclusive humanism, which is native to this land. Some deviant words and deeds of some misguided persons can in no way dent the quality and strength of the core values of our motherland. 

While we take pride in our spirit of nationalism, that unites the people of different social and religious hues cohabiting on our mother land, Persons of Indian origin living in a large number of other countries, imbibe and uphold the ethos and values of those countries. This is yet another clear manifestation of the  spirit of ‘assimilation’ which is at the heart of our core human values. This first conference of Persons of Indian Origin Parliamentarians is a certain celebration of this spirit of assimilation which is the bed rock of Indian values. It is because of this spirit of assimilation that all of you have been able to get accepted in the countries of your adoption and could rise to the level of being the law makers for the people with whom you chose to live. I heartily congratulate all of you for keeping the flag of Indian values fly high all across the globe. 

The Indian diaspora has contributed enormously to strengthening India’s cultural, literary, political and economic bonds across the world. India sees in you an important bridge with the countries where you are living.  You are also instrumental in building the people to people ties.

Friends, I am happy to know that in recognition of Diaspora’s contribution to the development of India and to connect young diaspora to their ancestral roots, several flagship programmes have been taken by Government of India. Foremost among them are Know India Programme, Bharat Ko Janiye Quiz and Scholarship Programme for Diaspora Children. 

I also feel happy to share with you that in the face of hostile conditions, Government of India successfully evacuated from war-torn countries over 90,000 overseas Indian nationals, including foreign nationals from nearly 45 countries under operations Rahat and Sankat Mochan. It reassured the overseas Indian community that wherever they may be, if they face problem, the Indian government is there for them. 

I congratulate External Affairs Minister and her team on such rescue operations undertaken successfully by Government of India for the safety of overseas Indian nationals. 

Friends, there were different forces of history and circumstances that forced and prompted our people to leave India and settle abroad. The time and the world have since changed. Today, the role and stature of India, has been growing and our nation has been scaling up in the ladder of the Comity of Nations. Resurgent India is a power – economic and military- to reckon with internationally. India is a land of opportunity today.

Government of India has taken a series of steps towards economic reforms and to improve the business environment. The jump in India’s ranking in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report, from 142 to 100, in three years, is a result of this. There are many flagship programs launched by Government of India where diaspora can actively participate and be an integral part of growth story of India. There are some amongst you who would like to contribute in business and investments. Others may feel more comfortable supporting through contributions made to Swachh Bharat, Namami Gange and other flagship programmes. Some others may feel motivated to spare their valuable time and effort in volunteering in India, helping the under-privileged or contributing to capacity building programs in various sectors. 

There are many and  diverse  opportunities for contributing to your motherland and being a part of its exciting growth story.  Be it “Make in India”, “Start up India”, “Digital India” or “Swachh India”; all these programs provide ample opportunities for you to participate, contribute and benefit.

We have a story of squirrel in Ramayana. when the whole army of the Sugriva was busy making a bridge over the sea to reach Lanka, then a small squirrel in the field watched the whole scene. It thought that it should also contribute towards the construction of the bridge. But there were obstacles. The squirrel was too small even to carry little quantities of sand or stone. An idea stuck to its mind.  It went to the sea and had a dip.  Came back to the sand and rolled over.  Again with the sand all over its body, went back to the sea and had dip. The squirrel tirelessly continued its work till the construction of the bridge was completed.

So, it was an idea and sense of duty that dawned on the Squirrel, which became an agent of change. Friends, we want your ideas, best practices, richness of your experience and expertise to shape the contours of New  resurgent  global India.

Friends, I am confident that your participation in this Conference has contributed in strengthening your attachment with your place of domicile and your connect with the land of your ancestors. 

The themes deliberated upon today held during the course of the day are timely, relevant and inspiring.

With this, I take this opportunity to congratulate the External Affairs Minister for her initiative in successfully hosting the first PIO –Parliamentary Conference  and wish you all a happy, healthy, prosperous and enriching New  Year. I also wish you a safe journey back to your respective countries. 

शुभास्ते पंथान: सन्तु !

May your paths be auspicious,

and may 2018 bring happiness in your life. 

Let me end with a quotation, a prayer for peace from our ancient scriptures, a prayer that probably can inspire each one of us to make our planet a better place to live in. 

“May we hear with our ears what is good,

 May we see with our eyes what is beautiful,

 May we dedicate our lives to promote goodness, with strong bodies and steady minds.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that mind sports require support and encouragement at par with physical sports. “No doubt, physical body has its limitations but the mind has unlimited capacity and this has to be tapped to its full potential,” he said addressing a delegation of the World Memory Sports Council for India, here today. This contingent has returned after bagging the fourth place at the World Memory Championships held last month at Shenzen, China. 

The Vice President said that mind sports help students and youngsters greatly in improving their concentration levels, creativity and contribute to achieving success in life. “We need to move to analytical and logical thinking skills, not merely focus on rote learning and memorizing. Concept formation and understanding are important,” he said.

Talking about the need of a holistic education system, the Vice President said that rote mode of learning, high expectations from parents, increasing competition and eagerness of educational institutions to get top ranks are causing stress and anxiety among students. “It is really sad to come across reports of suicides by students, who are unable to cope with stress,” said Shri M Venkaiah Naidu. “Time has come for the institutions, governments and the society at large to prevent such suicides by extending support and comfort to distressed students. Under the rote system, they simply memorize to write examinations without understanding the basic concepts,” he added.

The Vice President said that there is a need for every Indian to learn these memory techniques and practice these memory sports on regular basis to have a healthy state of mind. “If students can learn and master memory techniques, they can work smarter and leave them with more time for other extra-curricular activities, thus ultimately contributing to their all-round development,” he said.

Following is the text of the Vice President’s address:

“I am happy to know that the Indian team has bagged the fourth place at the World Memory Championships held last month at Shenzen, China. 

 My congratulations to the team and the coaches! I am told that this young Indian team, comprising memory athletes, has been undergoing training on Memory Sports for the last six months under the guidance of Squadron Leader Jayasimha, President, World Memory Sports Council for India. I hope that the Indian team will be able to win the title in the next championship.

Various mind sports, including memory sports, are as important as physical sports and must be promoted and given importance. No doubt, physical body has its limitations but the mind has unlimited capacity and this has to be tapped to its full potential.

I feel mind sports should be popularized as they not only help in greatly improving the levels of concentration, but also help in enhancing creativity, mental discipline and contribute to achieving success in life.

Memory is an essential component of learning. However, the effort should be to make this the first step. We need to move to analytical and logical thinking skills, not merely focus on rote learning and memorizing. Concept formation and understanding are important.

Memorising techniques should be introduced and taught in schools so that young minds are not subjected to needless pressures. Learning must be a memorable experience not a stressful rigmarole for students. The rote mode of learning, high expectations from parents, increasing competition and eagerness of educational institutions to get top ranks are causing stress and anxiety among students. 

 We have been frequently coming across reports of suicides by students, who are unable to cope with stress. I get extremely anguished whenever I read such news reports as all those deaths of youngsters are avoidable deaths and the time has come for the institutions, governments and the society at large to prevent such suicides by extending support and comfort to distressed students. Under the rote system, they simply memorize to write examinations without understanding the basic concepts.

 I am told that Memory training will make studies a pleasurable experience rather than a stressful nightmare. If students can learn and master memory techniques, they can work smarter. This will actually enable students to get better grades and leave them with more time for other extra-curricular activities, thus ultimately contributing to their all-round development.

Friends! India is blessed with a huge demographic advantage with 65 per cent of its population in the age group of 35 years. As such, there is a need to overhaul our education system so that the country’s youngsters excel in the fields of science & technology, innovation, medicine and engineering and make new discoveries.

 Good memory is needed not only in academics, but also in our professional career. Most importantly, as we age we tend to forget people’s names, faces, numbers and many elderly people also suffer from  Alzheimer’s disease,  dementia or absent mindedness. Hence, there is a need for every Indian to learn these memory techniques and practice these memory sports on regular basis to have a healthy state of Mind.

I am told that the World Memory Sports Council conducts Memory Championships every year in 10 different fields including memorising words, memorising numbers, memorising playing cards, memorising names and faces, memorising abstract images, memorising binary digits and memorising spoken numbers. 

I once again convey my best wishes to the Indian team.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that Literacy and Education are the foundations for a strong, inclusive, gender-responsive India. Addressing the gathering of students and teachers during the 34th Convocation of Banasthali Vidyapith, in Tonk district of Rajasthan today, he called for holistic, life giving and character building education system.

Shri M Venkaiah Naidu lauded the Panchmukhi Shiksha model of Banasthali Vidyapith and said that the institution has adopted an innovative way to impart holistic education that enables every student to recognize her innate potential, and help in integrating the knowledge gained with its cultural and environmental context. 

The Vice President said the students must understand the heritage and culture of the great Indian civilization and what it stood for. “You and I have inherited this intellectual and philosophical tradition. We must nourish the beautiful tree continuously with devotion and dedication. Diffidence and despair should be dispelled,” he said.

Shri M Venkaiah Naidu said that Women’s empowerment is a key factor in determining the country’s growth and development. “I believe that education is the best way to empower women,” the Vice President said. 

“We still have formidable challenges in our country. One third of our women cannot read and write. Women enrolment in higher educational institutions is far less than men. These gender gaps need to be bridged,” he added. 

The Vice President further said that we need to strategically work together and become a developed nation. “Human resources have to be enriched. We have to work diligently to provide diversified educational opportunities to enhance employability,” he added.

Following is the text of the Vice President’s address:

“It is indeed wonderful to participate in the 34th Convocation of the world’s largest residential university for women’s education, Banasthali Vidyapith.

I am grateful to your distinguished Vice-Chancellor for inviting me to deliver the Convocation address. It is a great honour to visit and be a part of this celebratory event.  

Banasthali University has over the years developed a widely admired distinct identity.  Conceived and nurtured by Pandit Hiralal Shastri, a senior civil servant, who gave up his well paid job to start an institution devoted to rural reconstruction, it has evolved into an excellent academic institution. His wife and co-founder of Banasthali Vidyapith, Smt. Ratan Shastri has been the moving spirit behind this institution.  Generations of young girls blossomed under her personal, supportive care.  She was conferred Padma Shri in 1955, Padma Bhushan in 1975 and Jamnalal Bajaj Award for outstanding contribution in the field of upliftment and welfare of women and children.  I salute Pt. Hiralal Shastri, as well as Smt. Ratan Shastri and all those who helped them in shaping this great institution. 

Today, we celebrate the achievements of the students who have successfully completed their programme of study. We also celebrate the tireless dedicated efforts of the faculty in shaping this university.

Dear Students,

I extend my best wishes to all of you and hope that you will make use of the knowledge and training you have acquired to pursue your own dreams.  

I do hope that in addition to a fulfilled personal life, you would also be able to make a mark on the ancient land you belong to. Banasthali graduates are known the world over for their leadership qualities and have become Governors, corporate chief executives, international sportspersons, renowned artists and musicians, leading administrators, eminent educationists, social activists, and have by and large brought radical transformation in their families, organizations and surroundings. I am sure you all shall follow suit and carry the baton of leadership from your elder sisters.

Sisters and Brothers, 

On this beautiful morning, I had a good opportunity to have a glimpse of the range of activities of this unique university located in sylvan surroundings. Clearly, Banasthali Vidyapith has over the last many years emerged as a dynamic educational institution preparing its students for the many roles that they may assume in life. It has carved a niche for itself among the cluster of educational institutions in the state and country and continues to spread its wings far and wide. 

I feel that education should be holistic, life giving and character building. The Panchmukhi Shiksha (Five Fold Education) model of Banasthali Vidyapith is an innovative way to impart holistic education that enables every student to recognize her innate potential, and help her in integrating the knowledge gained with its cultural and environmental context. 

It is indeed gratifying to note that Banasthali Vidyapith has come a long way in its journey to provide education to women. In the era when literacy was low and girls remained confined to homes, Banasthali Vidyapith became the pioneer in the cause of education of girls. In the era when the women were learning to use bicycles, Banasthali Vidyapith ensured that women rode horses, and reached for greater heights as gliders and pilots. Again in the era when women are asked to settle down in mundane jobs after professional education, Banasthali Vidyapith nurtured the likes of Ft. Lt. Avani Chaturvedi, one of the first fighter pilots inducted into Indian Air Force. Today when Science and Technology courses still remain male dominated, the students of this premier university for women are learning the Internet of Things and gaining technological skills in the most advanced industry 4.0 laboratories of Mechatronics and Robotics. 

I have been told that currently Banasthali Vidyapith is the highest ranked non-governmental women’s university in India, and has been adjudged The University of the Year 2016 by FICCI, and has won several other national and international awards and honours. The day is not far when we will see the name of this university rising higher in world university rankings.

Dear Students, you should remember that a university scales new heights not only because of its existing students but also because of the engagement of its successful alumni in its entire endeavours. I hope that you will attain great heights and keep contributing not only to the success of your alma mater but also towards the wellbeing of the society, the nation and the World. 

Today, we feel proud that our country has made remarkable achievements in many fields. Our universities and institutions of higher learning have produced a good number of scientists and professionals who are making extraordinary contribution in their own fields.  Yet, we should not be complacent.  Even the ‘best’ can become ‘better’. 

I have been informed that in the last one decade Banasthali has made a significant contribution to science education and research. The student enrollment has tripled in Basic Sciences and several centres of excellence have been established. Even while visiting the science centres, I could see state-of-the-art infrastructure, world class labs with latest sophisticated equipment. I am sure that our young women scientists graduating today are an invaluable asset to the nation. I congratulate and wish each one of them a rewarding career and a fulfilling life.  

Dear Students,

Ours is a country with a long, illustrious history.  Will Durant, the famous philosopher, has said : “India was the motherland of our race, and Sanskrit the mother of Europe’s languages: she was the mother of our philosophy; mother, through the Arabs, of much of our mathematics; mother, through the Buddha, of the ideals embodied in Christianity; mother, through the village community, of self-government and democracy. Mother India is in many ways the mother of us all”.

Please consider what the great scientist Albert Einstein said: “We owe a lot to Indians who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made.”

You and I have inherited this intellectual and philosophical tradition. The question is how aware are we of this grand inheritance. More importantly, can we continue this quest for excellence? The answer, my dear friends, lies in each Indian’s mind and heart. We must know what India stood for and then nourish the beautiful tree continuously with devotion and dedication. Diffidence and despair should be dispelled. 

As our country sets itself to achieve new benchmarks in growth and development, it is beyond doubt that women’s empowerment would be a key determining factor and I believe that education is the best way to empower women. We still have formidable challenges in our country. One third of our women cannot read and write. Women enrollment in higher educational institutions is far less than men. These gender gaps need to be bridged. Literacy and education are the foundations for a strong, inclusive, gender-responsive India. 

Today, we need to strategically work together and become a developed nation. Human resources have to be enriched. We have to work diligently to provide diversified educational opportunities to enhance employability. We need women and men with right knowledge, skills and attitudes to generate wealth and contribute to inclusive growth.  Our country has a distinct advantage because of the demographic structure.  About two thirds of our population is below 35 years of age.  Equipped with skills and knowledge, this can result in a big demographic dividend.  This is the task before the nation today. The government has been responding to the challenge through programmes like Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao. However, this has to be a societal mission in which institutions like yours has a prominent role. 

To me, Banasthali Vidyapith is an epitome of tradition and modernity. I have learnt that many rare books are available in the library which have been preserved by digitization. The amalgamation of Digital India, Skill India and Clean India is apparent in the campus and is worth appreciation. With the recent establishment of the Atal Incubation Centre, the institution will also be able to take pride in its young entrepreneurs and will be a role model for Start Up India campaign as well. 

Banasthali Vidyapith has a unique educational ideology of Panchmukhi shiksha and over these 82 years of both struggle and glory it has emerged as a premier institution of women’s education and is well on its way to be recognized internationally for being unique in ways more than one.

You, my dear young friends, are so fortunate to be able to study in this dynamic University which is so agile. It is rooted in our rich fertile soil. Yet it liberates you to experience the fresh breeze of knowledge from everywhere.  It enlivens and enlightens you through the bright sunshine of wisdom. 

The logo of Banasthali Vidyapith is imbued with the same spirit of our ancient Sanskrit text “Sa Vidya Ya Vimuktaye” (Education is that which Liberates). I hope you grow from strength to strength in the years to come.  I also wish Banasthali Vidyapith, the pace setter in Women’s education, many more glorious years as the fountain – head of knowledge.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that narrow, tunnel vision creates divisions and we need to have a broad, global vision to be a global leader. Addressing the gathering during the 12th Convocation of the Malaviya National Institute of Technology in Jaipur today, the Vice President said that true education enables us to get to the truth and discover new realities.

The Vice President further said that Education the frontiers of knowledge and fosters innovation and this journey takes an individual to new areas. “I want you to widen your perspective and acquaint yourself with the rich cultural legacy you have inherited,” he said.

Shri M Venkaiah Naidu asked students not to lose their way in the maze of information and don’t stop with acquiring bits of information. “Reflect, think and discuss. Once you connect various disparate facts, you gain knowledge. But knowledge is still incomplete. You need insight, experience and the ability to make sound judgements. This is wisdom,” he said.

The Vice President told students that unless they move on to the level of making a clear distinction between good and bad, ethical and unethical, just and unjust, they will remain at the periphery of education only. “I want you to widen your perspectives and acquaint yourself with the rich cultural legacy you have inherited. Knowledge is power. Power to do good; Power to make a positive difference in our lives,” he said.

Shri M Venkaiah Naidu inspired the students to build upon the strong scientific and technological knowledge base that is now available. “You can combine the best ideas from across the world and extend the frontiers of knowledge. You also have a unique opportunity to apply the state-of-the-art technology to the Indian context. This is the larger picture you should keep in mind. This should be your mission,” he said.

Following is the text of the Vice President’s address:

“I am happy to be with all of you at the 12th Convocation of this prestigious institute. A convocation is always an important milestone both for the institution as well as for the students. It is a milestone for the institution as it moves on its path of excellence. It is a milestone for the students because it marks the successful completion of a phase of learning and the beginning of a new phase. It is a moment of celebration. It is also a moment of reflection and rededication. 

I extend my heartiest congratulations to every student on their achievements, my sincere appreciation to the parents for nurturing their children’s talents and my greetings to the faculty and the management on pursuing the quest for excellence with determination. 

My dear students, you are graduating from an institute that is named after one of the great visionary institution builders of our country – Bharat Ratna Madan Mohan Malaviya.  It would be good to recall that it was he who popularised the national motto ‘Satyameva Jayathe’ which is inscribed under our national emblem. It is the unflinching commitment to truth that characterizes our freedom fighters.  It is this commitment that has continued to inspire us all after independence. 

In my view, true education enables us to get to the truth. It enables us to discover new realities. It pushes the frontiers of knowledge and fosters innovation. 

Dear Students,

Your education journey takes you to new areas.  You have during your stay in this Institute, acquired a vast amount of information.  Hopefully, you have deepened your knowledge and gained new insights.  Famous poet T.S. Eliot had questioned: 

“Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?”

“Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?”

Dear Students,

Don’t lose your way in the maze of information. Don’t stop with acquiring bits of information.  Reflect, think and discuss.  Once you connect various disparate facts, you gain knowledge. But knowledge is still incomplete. You need insight, experience and the ability to make sound judgments. This is wisdom.  Unless you move on to this level of making a clear distinction between good and bad, ethical and unethical, just and unjust, you remain at the periphery of education. You remain at the level of ‘Jnana’ or ‘Vignana’. What you should inculcate is ‘Viveka’, the wisdom to prioritize, wisdom to use knowledge for your well being and the welfare of humanity. 

You are graduating from one of the premier institutions in the country. You have acquired knowledge and skills to make further progress in your educational endeavours. Please remember that in education there are no ‘full stops’, there are only ‘commas’.  You should continue to learn and update your knowledge.  You should aspire to be the best. You should have the humility to acknowledge the gaps in your knowledge. You should have the ability to access knowledge from all over the world. After all, knowledge has no boundaries.  Ours is a country that has welcomed noble thoughts from all over the world.  Narrow, tunnel vision creates divisions.  You need a broad, global vision to be a global leader.  

I want you to widen your perspectives and acquaint yourself with the rich cultural legacy you have inherited.  As famous philosopher Will Durant has said:

“India will teach us the tolerance and gentleness of mature mind, understanding spirit and unifying, pacifying love for all human beings”.

Dear Students, 

You must study our history and draw lessons from it. This will enable you to gain the confidence to take bold decisions, drawing from the best thoughts of our ancient sages and applying them to contemporary realities. 

You will have the courage born out of conviction to take positive action. This conviction will be born out of knowledge. That’s why you must constantly keep updating your knowledge. 

Knowledge is power. Power to do good; Power to make a positive difference in our lives. 

Dear Students,

Some of you will be entering the world of work after your graduation. You will be applying the knowledge and skills you have acquired here in your workplace. The employers will judge you by your performance, your abilities and your attitude. I am hoping that you will make a mark in your chosen professions.  Let me remind you, dear students, your ‘attitude’ can help you reach higher ‘altitude’.  In-fact, that’s what the motto of your Institute says – ‘Yogah Karmasu Kaushalam’.  You should strive to constantly do better.  Make innovation your watchword and excellence your guiding principle.

Dear Students,

You are inheritors of a long, illustrious heritage.  The ancient India was, by many historical accounts, a very advanced India.  Mathematicians like Aryabhata, Bhaskara and Brahmagupta, physicians like Sushrutha who could perform cataract and gall bladder surgeries and cure leprosy in the 3rd century are well known.  From the concept of ‘zero’ to ‘decimal system’, from the production of steel to cultivation of cotton and jute, from the metallurgical marvels like the Iron pillar in Delhi to astronomical advances like the sundials, ancient Indian scientists had made a remarkable contribution to science and technology.  The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur, as you are aware, is a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments built in 1734. India’s recent advances in Science and Technology, including Information Technology and Space Technology, are a continuation of this grand scientific tradition.

You, dear students, have an opportunity to build upon this strong scientific and technological knowledge base.  Now, you can combine the best ideas from across the world and extend the frontiers of knowledge. You also have a unique opportunity to apply the state-of-the-art technology to the Indian context.  This is the larger picture you should keep in mind.  This should be your mission.  

You are among the fortunate few who have been able to graduate from an Institute like this.  You have before you a resurgent India – an India with enormous opportunities and infinite possibilities.  Please tap into these and discover your hidden potential. While charting out your career path, choose the one that excites you.  Choose the path that contributes to your growth.  Choose the path that makes our country one of the best in the world.  Choose the path that makes our planet a better place to live in. 

Dear students,

I wish you all the very best in your future endeavours.  You will be shaping your world through your thoughts, speech and actions.  As Mahatma Gandhiji used to say – “Be the change you want to see in the world”. 

I congratulate the Director and the faculty members for striving hard to make this one of the best academic institutions in the country. I wish you all many more fruitful years of accessing, expanding, and transmitting knowledge and skills. 

I thank you for giving me an opportunity to be with you on this happy occasion reminding all of us of the noble education mission of this great institution.  You have maintained the standards over the last many years and you are among the best technical educational institutions in the country.  I hope you will make further improvements and enhance the quality of learning opportunities in the years to come.""

On the occasion, he was presented a Guard of Honour and the Vice President inspected the Parade. Addressing the Cadets, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu lauded the role of NCC cadets in social awareness campaigns especially the  Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. 

Following is the text of the Vice President’s address:

“It is my pleasure to be here at the Republic Day Camp of the National Cadet Corps. 

At the outset, I extend my best wishes for a prosperous and bright New Year to all of you. I am happy to see the bright and young faces of our youth, smartly turned out and beaming with confidence.

The National Cadet Corps is the largest uniformed youth organisation in the world, bringing together youth hailing from different parts of our country; including the remote and tribal areas, and moulding them into responsible, disciplined and united citizens of our great nation. 

This organization fosters the spirit of brotherhood, builds character, inculcates the values of selfless service, concern for fellow citizens, community service and the spirit of adventure. The very ambience of this camp fosters the feeling of camaraderie and patriotism. This Camp will be a memorable motivating and learning experience for each one of you.  It will give you an opportunity to interact with cadets not only from other parts of the country, but also from friendly foreign countries who will be arriving during the course of this camp. This will be a unique opportunity not only to understand your country better, but also to widen your horizon and foster lasting friendship with fellow cadets from other nations. This camp will highlight the essence of universal brotherhood transcending through national and international boundaries.

New challenges crop up every day, which we have to tackle as a mature democracy of the world.  Your contribution in times of crisis and natural disasters like earthquakes, cyclones and floods has been commendable.

Your efforts in contributing to the society in educating and creating awareness among the masses about the  Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, AIDS, adult education, dowry and corruption have been appreciated by one and all. Your efforts will positively improve the social fabric. I have full faith that your efforts will bear fruits in the near future.

The National Cadet Corps is a shining example of National Integration and you are the pillars of our Nation.  It was heartening to learn that the NCC cadets have been participating in large numbers on all important occasions. I am told that almost a Lakh cadets across the country participated in the International Day of Yoga this year.  I am glad to know that NCC Girl Cadets have scaled Mt Ladakhi in July 2017 and Boys have scaled Mt Jogin in September 2017. NCC has been contributing immensely towards Swachhta Abhiyan with almost 10 Lakh cadets participating in various related events.

It is a matter of deep satisfaction that you have excelled in all walks of life. Under-17 Girls football team of NCC has won the Runners Up trophy in Subroto Cup held at Delhi in September 2017. The encouraging performance of NCC cadets in the field of sports, especially Shooting, is a sure sign of the bright future of our sports in the years ahead. I am sure NCC will continue to groom sports persons who will do our country proud.

Today, I urge you all to continue with this hard work and discharge your duties with dedication and distinction in the times to come.

I am deeply impressed by your turnout and smart drill and I congratulate you all for the same.

I have great pleasure in inaugurating the Annual National Cadet Corps Republic Day Camp 2018.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we must bridge the many gaps and inequalities we have in our society. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the book ‘Bharat ke Rajneta – Ramdas Athawale’ authored by Shri Rajiv Suman, here today. The Minister of State for Social Justice & Empowerment, Shri Ramdas Athawale and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that Shri Ramdas Athawale has emerged as vocal leader for the emancipation of Dalits in modern society, adding that the book describes his accomplishments on crucial issues of national importance like, equal opportunities for all citizens, representation of women in Parliament and legislatures and protection indigenous tribal population. 

The Vice President said that the book talks about Shri Athawale’s approach of peaceful resistance and protest that strengthens the democracy adding that it is important to identify glaring inequalities and take concrete action to bridge the gaps.

The Vice President said that proper representation of women of the country in Parliament and state legislatures should be a reality soon. He further said that the the government should pay attention towards India’s Tribal population and said that protection of De-notified, Nomadic tribes is very important. Their uplift and development is necessary for the preservation of the rich diverse Indian culture, he added.

The Vice President said that what is required is critical introspection, strong political will, committed implementation and transformation of mindset. He further said that violence, hatred and divisive politics can’t achieve any positive results. Only mutual respect and dialogue can, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address in Hindi:

“भारतीय राजनेताओं के जीवन और उनके योगदान का उत्तम परिचय देने वाली पुस्तकशृंखला के वर्तमान अंक के प्रकाशन के लिए मैं संपादक श्री राजीव सुमन और ""दी मर्जीनियलाइज्ड पब्लिकशन"" को बधाई देना चाहता हूँ।

इस पुस्तक का अपने आप में ही एक विशेष महत्व है। वर्तमान समय में किसी आदर्श लोकतन्त्र में यह आवश्यक भी है कि ऐसी पुस्तकों का प्रकाशन हो जो राजनेताओं के चरित और उनकी विचारधारा को समाज के सामने लेकर आएँ।

प्रस्तुत पुस्तक महाराष्ट्र के सक्रिय राजनेता और समाज सेवक श्री रामसाद आठवले जी को उद्देश्य करके लिखी गई है। आठवले जी, पैंथर और नामांतर जैसे आंदोलनों के सक्रिय प्रतिभागी रहें हैं। मुझे खुशी है कि यह अंक उनके लिए समर्पित किया गया है। मुझे यह देखकर अच्छा लगा कि राजीव जी ने पुस्तक के आरंभ में अपनी भूमिका में लोकतंत्र के महत्व को उजागर किया है।

आठवले जी आधुनिक समाज में दलितों के उद्धार के लिए अग्रणी एवं मुखर नेता बनकर उभरें हैं। उनका सामाजिक समानता का विचार प्रशंसनीय है। उनका लक्ष्य है कि संपूर्ण मानवता का विकास हो न कि किसी विशेष जाति का, क्योंकि लोकतन्त्र किसी भेदभाव को स्वीकार नहीं करता है।

समाज में किसी प्रकार की असमानता देखकर उसका विरोध करना उचित है। पुस्तक में आठवले जी के साक्षात्कार में बताये गये बहुत महत्वपूर्ण विषय हैं। विशेषत: उनकी शांतिपूर्वक विरोध और आंदोलन की नीति लोकतन्त्र को सुदृढ बनाती है।

प्रस्तुत पुस्तक 80 और 90 के दशक की राजनीतिक गहमा-गहमी को जीवंत सा कर देती है। आठवले जी का यह विचार भी मन को भा जाता है कि किसी भी पार्टी की नीति और वैचारिक नीति अलग हो सकती है परंतु सरकार में आने के बाद उसकी नीति सरकार की नीति होनी चाहिए, संविधान की नीति होनी चाहिए। मुझे खुशी है कि आठवले जी देश के समग्र विकास की वर्तमान नीति का पुरज़ोर समर्थन करते हैं।

इसमें कोई संदेह नहीं है कि महिलाओं के अधिकारों के संबंध में आपके विचार बहुत उदार हैं। आपके अनुसार समय की मांग के अनुसार संसद का विस्तार होना चाहिए और कैसे भी हो, वहाँ देश की महिलाओं का उचित प्रतिनिधित्व अवश्य होना चाहिए,आशा करता हूँ कि आपकी यह सकारात्मक सोच भविष्य में यथार्थ होगी।

आठवले जी की शिक्षा के राष्ट्रीयकरण की अवधारणा बहुत प्रगतिशील है, इसमें कोई संदेह नहीं है कि सरकार को समान शिक्षा और शिक्षा के समान अवसर उपलब्ध कराने की ओर अपेक्षित कदम उठाने चाहिए।

पुस्तक में आठवले जी द्वारा दिए गए भाषणों और उनके द्वारा उठाए गए अनेक सामाजिक मुद्दों का विस्तार से वर्णन किया गया है। उन्होने महाराष्ट्र और समग्र देश में पिछड़ी जातियों के उन्नयन के लिए अनेक मुद्दे उठाए हैं। इसके अलावा उन्होने समय समय पर विभिन्न भ्रष्टाचार की घटनाओं का भी उजागर किया। उन्होने धार्मिक प्रभुत्व की अनुचित घटनाओं के खिलाफ भी आवाज़ उठाई।

यह सुंदर बात है कि उन्होने आधुनिक समाज में कुछ उच्च जातियों के अल्पसंख्यक होने के कारण उनकी दयनीय अवस्था को ध्यान में रखकर उन्हें भी उनकी जनसंख्या के आधार पर आरक्षण प्रदान करने पर बल दिया है।

अच्छी बात है कि आठवले जी इस कृषि प्रधान देश में किसानों की समस्या को भी उठाते हैं और देश के वास्तविक विकास का पक्ष लेते हैं।

आठवले जी की नीति के अनुसार देश की विमुक्त और घुमंतु जंजातियों की समस्याओं की ओर भी सरकार का ध्यान होना चाहिए। सच में उनका भारत की संस्कृति में अतुलित योगदान है। उनकी रक्षा से देश की संस्कृति की पूर्ण सुरक्षा का दावा किया जा सकता है।

मुझे खुशी है कि आठवले जी देश की अनेक कुरीतियों के प्रति अत्यंत सजग हैं और इस ओर सामाजिक कल्याण की पूर्ति के लिए सही दिशा में काम कर रहे हैं। ईश्वर उनके सदाशयों और सत्कार्यों में सफलता प्रदान करें और वे सदैव इसी प्रकार जनसेवा में लीन और उत्साहशील रहें।

राजीव जी को इस अनन्य पुस्तक के प्रकाशन हेतु, मेरा विशेष साधुवाद।“

                My colleague in the council of ministers Col. Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Shri Anil BaijalJi, Rahul BhatnagarJi, Shri Narendra BatraJi, Sushil Kumar Ji, all the players who bring laurels for the country in the world and their trainers and all those my young friends who have come from different corners of the world and have been completely dedicated with all their might to bring laurels for the country in future, I cordially welcome all of you.

Today, emerging players from every corner of the country for Under Seventeen are amongst us. Khelo India is not a program, but it’s a mission. How sports can acquire priority in the lives of common people of India? Parents should also realize the importance of sports in the careers of their children. How can this feeling that sport is also an important aspect for the development of life be strengthened in our school systems, in our educational eco system? If priority is to be given to five-seven things then sports should also be a part of that priority list. 

Today, instead of this approach that we should save some time after completing every work and then play a little bit, how can we move ahead of this thinking with the resolve that: ‘let’s play and blossom’? Those players who have brought laurels for India and are present here, it’s not that they have become sportspersons without any effort. Somebody recognized their talent and someone had tried to groom them. Parents would have tried to stop them during the initial stages, even these players would have been told this thing in the schools that: you people are so good in your studies why are you wasting your time in sports? There would have been a lot of such obstacles. But there must have been someone who would have taken them forward by holding their hands, who would have groomed them for their goals and then those sportspersons would have fully dedicated themselves for sports. 

Today, there is no dearth of talent in India. A country with a population of 1.25 billion people where 65% youth are below the age of 35, can’t India make its mark in the field of sports? We say that India should make a lot of progress. Progress of India doesn’t mean that India will progress onlywhen its military might goes up or India progresses only when it becomes an economic super power. It’s not like that. India will only reach to the top of the world when we progress in every sphere of life, if Nobel prizes are given then India should be all over the place, if Oscar awards are announced then India should be all over the place, when the world discusses about scientists then India should be all over the place and when sports is discussed then India should be all over the place. 

If we move forward to take India to top of the world in every sphere of life then it will certainly happen, if it does not happen today then it will certainly happen tomorrow. And I’m able to say this thing with self-confidence because I have full faith in the talent of the country, and have full faith in the young generation of the country. 

Khelo India program – as I have said that it’s not only limited to this thing that there will be a competition and the winners will get the medals. An effort has been startedwith a scientific approach, with a holistic approach and with a comprehensive strategy at the grass root level by keeping every single thing into account be it development of infrastructure or be it an issue of coaching or training or be it an issue of building of human resources so that the rules of sports reach the ground level in an even manner, so that the correct information about the play grounds is available with the last man.

The most important thing istalent hunt: searching talent in every single corner of the country. And this talent can’t be searched through an online exam. In case of sports it does not work like that who gives the best answer. The talent in the field of sports only emerges in the playground.It only flourishes in the playground. And therefore games should be played in schools on regular basis and its records should be maintained there and talent should be identified while maintaining the records. And the talented ones will receive help in true sense of the word and if they receive good training then I’m confident that the youth of my country will never turn his/her back no matter how much hard work and struggle is required and he/she will give the result in any case. 

And that is why the government has taken one important decision following the talent hunt. One thousand children will be selected throughout the country in separate sports. Those who are high-spirited, capable and have inherent qualities, those who have the required stamina and qualities for sports, those who have cleared all the tests then each of such 1,000 children will receive an assistance of Rs. 5 lakh per year.

Every year one thousand children will be selected and within five years we will have 5,000 such children who will have these inherent qualities. Training facility for their progress will be made available, they should get the best of the best coaching in the world, they should get the opportunity to go to the place anywhere in the world where they will receive the best of the best training. And their parents who sometimes feel like holding back due to monetary reasons and these days experience suggests that children from villages are coming forward, children from tier-II cities are coming forward. And if their families don’t have resources then one gem of India will not be stuck there. And that is why this facility of five lakh rupees will also ensure his/her family’s support for them. What kind of nutritional requirement they have? What should be done for maintaining their mental sense? Work will be done in all such directions to provide training for all these things. 

Another important change that we have brought about:these days when sportspersons come back after winning accolades for the country then an healthy environment is being created in the states. States announce several prizes, members of society also announce several prizes, but only those coaches were recognised who used to be with the players during the last moment. This must be done in any case. 

However, the coach who had identified the player when he/she was just a kid; the coach who groomed the player during the first four-five years; these sportspersons must have been trained by several coaches afterwards but the first coach who had initiated the player in this field and that is why we have decided that those players who bring laurels for the country and whatever awards are announced for them and whatever awards are being decided for their coaches and now therefore all those coaches and trainers who had contributed during the entire career of the sportsperson would also be entitled for the awards. 

It’s a big thing. And that is why those people who are dedicated to sports they don’t do it for money and fame, they have an internal commitment. Even you would have noticed that when international sports are organized and when Indian players participate in them then they struggle very hard, they give their best. However, the moment they hold the tricolor in their hands after winning the competition then their entire body language changes.All the fatigue just disappears. If they were hurt, even if it was a bloody injury even then they forget everything. They run like anything while holding the tricolor in their hands.When a sportsperson runs anywhere in the world by holding the tricolor in his/her hand then they fill the entire India with energy, with a new spirit. 

And once we establish this tradition and sport is not a new thing for India. If anyone of you had the opportunity to study the civilization ofMohanjeDaroand those traditions: the thousands of years old system of living; Dholavira in Gujarat, archeologists have found that five thousand year old site. And when I visited the site for the first time then the guides of the site told me that five thousand years ago there was a massive sports stadium in Dholavira for accommodating thousands of people and even today its ruins can be seen there. 

I mean to say that the tradition of sports is not new for India. We will have to establish ourselves in this world of sports with a modern eco system, with modern rules and with the latest resources in the global context once again. 

Today’s opportunity of ‘Khelo India’, all those kids from every corner of the country who are present here under this ‘Under Seventeen’, and sports, this spirit of sportsmanship develops automatically. All those who have come here will go back after getting the feeling of Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat. They will go back by internalizing the diversity of India. We may not know the language but the scent, the sense of belongingness will give us a new energy, a new strength. 

With this feeling alone I convey my best wishes to all of you sportspersons. When the games will get over on 8 February, when you will return to your places then you will go back after learning a lot of new things.You will go back after making a lot of new friends and after having the opportunity to experience the one India in this stadium. You will go back by acquiring this natural tendency: how to conduct yourself in a group. 

I convey my best wishes to all those children, and also to their coaches and parents whose parents encouraged them to come forward in the field of sports. And therefore with these wishes I announce the opening of the firstKhelo India School Games. 

Thank you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Guru Ravidas on the occasion of Guru Ravidas Jayanti.

 “I bow to Guru Ravidas Ji on his Jayanti. Guru Ravidas Ji was one of the greatest Saints to have been born in our land. He stood for a society that is equal, just and compassionate. His teachings are eternal and are relevant for people of all sections of society.

Guru Ravidas Ji ushered in several positive changes in our society. He questioned practices that were archaic and regressive, and inspired people to change with the times. This spirit of inquiry and emphasis on moving with the times makes extremely great.

Guru Ravidas Ji had unwavering faith in values of harmony and brotherhood. He did not believe in any kind of discrimination. When we work with the motto of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ we are deeply motivated by Guru Ravidas Ji’s emphasis on serving every human, especially the poor.

Today I would like to share these words of Guru Ravidas Ji: 

ऐसा चाहूँ राज मैं जहाँ मिलै सबन को अन्न। 

छोट बड़ो सब सम बसै, रैदास रहै प्रसन्न।। 

Guru Ravidas Ji dreamt of a time when everybody has enough to eat and every person is happy”, the Prime Minister said.

                Namaskar Friends. The Budget Session of the parliament gets under way today. This session begins with the address of the President. In the last session it was our effort and the nation had high hopes that there won’t be any politics on crucial issues like Triple talaq so that the Muslim women will get their rights. However, despite the orders of the Supreme Court, the bill on triple talaq could not be passed by the Parliament. I hope and appeal to the political parties across the country to join hands in passing the triple talaq bill to protect the rights of Muslim women. It will indeed be the best gift of 2018, in the new year for the Muslim women.

Budget Session is very important. Entire global community is very much optimistic about the Indian economy. It comes at a time when the world is looking at us, be it the Global Credit rating agencies, World Bank, IMF which have been very positive in their opinion about the growth of India and the road ahead. This Budget will provide a new energy to the fast growing economy of the country. It will be fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the common man. A month after the Budget session, various committees deliberate upon the details of the Budget proposals. The past experience shows that in those deliberations the national interest is above the political interests. Cutting across party line even the MPs from the ruling party highlights its short comings while the members of opposition highlight its salient feature. In a way it provides for a healthy environment and atmosphere for debate and discussion.

In the all party meeting yesterday I have urged that we should take maximum help of the debate in the committees and to ensure that how we can ensure that the common man is benefited most from the Budget. Our objective should be to reach out to the dalits, oppressed, underprivileged and to those who did not have any access to these benefits. We also need to see how the villagers, poor, farmers and laborers are benefited maximum from the Budget. Let’s have a detailed discussion, come out with positive suggestions and make a road map to march ahead.

                नमस्‍कार Friends आज बजट सेशन का शुभारंभ  हो रहा है, महामहिम राष्‍ट्रपति जी के उद्बोधन से सत्र आरंभ हो रहा है पिछले सत्र में हमारा प्रयास भी था और देश की आशा अपेक्षा भी थी कि तीन तलाक जैसे महत्‍वपूर्ण विषय पर कोई राजनीति नहीं होगी और मुस्लिम महिलाओं को उनका हक मिलेगा। लेकिन सुप्रीम कोर्ट के आदेश के बावजदू भी तीन तलाक, (Triple तलाक) संसद में हम पारित नहीं करवा पाए। मैं आशा करता हूं और मैं देश के सभी राजनीतिक दलों को विनम्र आग्रह करता हूं कि इस सत्र में, तीन तलाक महिलाओं के, विशेष करके मुस्लिम महिलाओं के हक की रक्षा करने वाले इस निर्णय को हम सब पारित करें और 2018 के नये वर्ष की एक उत्‍तम भेंट सौगात, हमारी मुस्लिम महिलाओं को हम दें।

बजट सत्र अत्‍यंत महत्‍वपूर्ण होता है। पूरा विश्‍व जब भारत की अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था के प्रति बहुत ही आशावान है। भारत की राह, भारत की प्रगति पर विश्‍व की सभी Credit Rating Agencies हो, World Bank हो, IMF हो,बहुत ही सकारात्‍मक अपने opinion देती रही है। यह बजट देश की तेज की गति से आगे बढ़ रही अर्थव्‍यवस्‍था को एक नई ऊर्जा देने वाला, देश के सामान्‍य से सामान्‍य मानव की आशा-अपेक्षाओं को पूर्ण करने वाला बजट आएगा और बजट के बाद एक महीने भर भिन्‍न भिन्‍न कमेटियों में बजट की विषद चर्चा होती है। अनुभव यह है कि उन कमेटियों में दल से ऊपर देश होता है। सभी दल के लोग सत्‍तापक्ष के लोग भी कमियां उजागर करते हैं और विपक्ष के बंधू उसकी खूबियों को उजागर करते हैं। एक प्रकार को बहुत ही healthy environment होता है,healthy atmosphere होता है।

कल जब All Party meeting हुई तो मैंने आग्रह किया है कि हम इस महीने की जो चर्चा सत्र रहता है,कमिटियों के अंदर उसका भरपूर उपयोग करे, और बजट का सर्वाधिक लाभ देश के सामान्‍य मानव तक कैसे पहुंचे? दलित, पीडि़त, शोषित, वंचित को कैसे मिले?गांव गरीब को कैसे मिले?किसान मजदूर को कैसे मिले? इस पर हम व्‍यापक चिंतन करें, सकारात्‍मक सुझाव दें और roadmap बना करके हम आगे बढ़े।

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

                It’s almost a month with several new friends, everybody came here with his or her distinct identity, with his or her own distinct background but within a month such an atmosphere was createdwhich produced an unbreakable bond amongst all of you. A bond of kinship and when you will be meeting from the cadets from other states then you would be surprised to know about their uniqueness and their diversity. You will leave this place with so much curiosity that you will feel like that as a citizen of India the more you know the country, the more you know about every corner of the country, the more you know India’s diversity the more you feel one with the country. The seed of this value systemis naturally sown within us in every NCC camp. It seems to us that we are participating in the parade, it seems like that we have come here wearing the uniform, it seems like that we are preparing for Raj Path but we don’t even realise when we start cherishing this massive India within us; how do we become so full of the country. We don’t even know that how do we develop a strong feeling to do something for India? Such an eco system, such an environment that makes us think about the country, think about its future and our role, our duties in this thing every single moment. We are going to go back after getting inspiration for all these things. NCC cadets participating in the parade at Raj Path and those who did not get the opportunity to participate in the parade or being seen on the Raj Path, those who work in the background, those who labored extremely hard for a month, for every such person, the guests from 10 countries, the entire country and Indian Diaspora spread across the world takes pride in every step taken by you people. They were proud of the every step taken by you and they felt that our country was marching ahead when you people were taking your steps. When you showed your extreme courage then every countrymen felt that the courage of the country was going to the top. This environment, this atmosphere should not be confined to this place only. The real test begins after that. 

NCC is known for its discipline and unity. NCC is not a mechanism. NCC is a mission. NCC is not just anuniform or uniformity but it is unity in true sense of the word.And therefore with this feeling…eventually why this parade, this camp, this discipline, this hard work is aimed at achieving what? Why all these things? Why the money of the poorest of the poor person of the country is being spent on all these things? This is being invested so that this kind of nucleus, this kind of individuals continue to be created within the country with a mission mode thatcontinue to inspire others, so that the determination of the country continues to increase and that is why in a way it’s an effort to develop the lives and develop the country through those developed lives. If we leave all these things here and these memories are going to be used just for sharing them with friends for the rest of life then something is missing. We should take pride in the fact that after the independence of the country the NCC act was enacted before the enactment of rules and regulation for the armed forces. Nation building was linked with the young generation of the country and given priority over security of the nation. 

Today, NCC has completed 70 years. The journey of seven decades, and millions and millions of NCC cadets like me moved on the path of life by receiving the values of patriotism.

Friends, we get a sense of mission from NCC. On the completion of 70 years of NCC the time demands that we should take a look at these things like: where we came from, where we have come and where we want to take the country. What should be the form of this NCC and what are the new things that should be added in the NCC? What should be its expanse? I would call upon the people related to these subjects that they should prepare an outline for a mission when NCC completes 75 years of its existence and we should made that mission for taking NCC to such heights that there should be something new in every corner of the country, it should bring about some changes, it should give rise to the feeling of pride due to the functioning of NCC and due to the working of NCC cadets. Today, when we are completing 70 years then we should prepare a mission for 75 years with this resolve. 

I don’t believe that any youth of my country is willing to tolerate corruption. The society has a feeling of hatred against corruption. But why should we restrict ourselves to just have the feeling of hatred against corruption, why should we just express our anguish and anger against corruption? Will this thing be enough? Then we will have to continue to wage this battle for a prolonged period, it is not going to stop. This fight against corruption, this fight against black money is aimed at making the future of the youth of my country. And if the future of the youth of my country is secured then it is going to make the future of our country. 

But, I, Prime Minister of this country want to ask something from the Indian youth, I want to ask something from NCC cadets. I know that you will never disappoint me. The youth of my country will not disappoint me. I am neither going to ask for votes nor am I going to ask your help so that we can progress on political front. If I want your help, the help of youth of my country, then I want your help for setting this country free from this corruption which is like a termite. You might feel that what you could do. At best, you might decide that: we will not bribe anyone or at best we will not accept any bribe. You will do that in any case but this will not be sufficient. There is one thing, one task and if you make a pledge, if you make a rule that every year you would associate at least 100 new families with this thing, then what is that thing. If accountability is there, if transparency is there, then there is an automatic change in the situation. Can you make a pledge that wherever we go for purchasing things, wherever there is an exchange of money, then we will not do it in cash, all of us have become mobile users. Whether we will download the BHIM App and make every purchase through BHIM App? And whether you will insist on using the BHIM App at the shop from where you purchase things, whichever store or mall you may be visiting, whether you will insist on using it or not? You must do it. Please develop a habit of this thing. You will see this kind of transparency will be there, fixing accountability will become so easy and we will be able to take strong steps in the direction of making a corruption free India. And it can’t be done without the help of my youth. If my NCC cadets take up this task on a mission mode then no one will have courage to drag the country towards corruption. Even if an extremely corrupt person succeeds in occupying a high office even then he will be forced to follow the path of honesty. 

Sometimes there was a lot of despair in the country that lofty things are discussed against the corruption but nothing could be done against powerful people. Today, you people have been passing through such a period, you are passing through such a time that at least three chief ministers are behind bars due to corruption. Who can say that there is no God, who can say that there is no justice in the house of God? Now there is no one to protect them. And that is why today I would like say this thing before the NCC cadets, and through them to the NCC cadets across the country and be it the youth of NSS or be it the youth of Nehru Youth Centre and be it the students of schools and colleges or be it the youth of the country who live and die for the country, I seek your help. Please come forward and join me in this fight as a soldier. Please come forward, by working together if we will rid the country of this termite then we will be able to win the fight for providing the rights of the poor people of the country. 

If we eradicate these evils then it benefits the most to the poor people of the country. When the money is spent in the proper manner then a poor household gets the affordable medicine. When the money is spent in the proper manner then it creates the facilities for providing good schools, good teachers to the children of a poor person. When the money is spent in the proper way then the roads are being laid up to villages, when the money is properly utilized then an opportunity for doing something for the oppressed, exploited and excluded people of the country is created. 

And dear youth of my country that is why the discussion about Aadhaar that you people get to hear these days, those people who are aware about the world of technology, who are aware about the changing times they know that this data is going to be a very powerful thing in the world in the coming days. That day is not far away when the country which will have data will be considered powerful. In the digital world, in the world of data, Aadhaar has given a big reason to India to take pride in this field. 

And now due to Aadhaar those benefits which should accrue to poor people, to common man but were earlier siphoned off into wrong hands; that was also a method of corruption. The girl that never born used to grow up into an adult, marry and become widow in the records of a government office and widow pension was paid to her from the government exchequer. This kind of business was going on but now the legitimate claimants could be identified due to Aadhaar and they have started getting their rights due to direct transfer of benefits.  And youth of my country, this has been implemented in some schemes, at present it’s not 100%, it’s just a start but because of it around Rs.60,000 crore has been saved which was siphoned off into wrong hands. All this is possible. And therefore my youth should move forward in the direction of a cashless society with the mantra of less cash and by optimally using the BHIM App for all the selling and purchasing and even if we need to pay the fee then we will pay it through BHIM App. Then you will see how the changes will come about in the country. 

My young friends, you people have got a good experience in the life. You people have got the opportunity to experience the country by living with the people from all corners of the country in a very short span of time. You people got that feeling; you got a new touch of India. With this new spirit, with this new resolve, with this new aspiration, all of us should collectively move forward with a solemn pledge to make a New India. We should take the country forward, we should make a New India with the strength to fulfill the dreams of our freedom fightersby 2022 when India will celebrate 75 years of its independence. 

My best wishes to all of you. 

Thank you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the NCC rally in New Delhi. He said every young NCC Cadet came to this gathering with his or her own personality and identity. But, he added, that over the course of a month, new friendships would have been forged, and a lot would have been learnt from each other. NCC camps teach every youngster about the different cultures of India, he said. They motivate every youngster to do something good for the nation, he added.


The Prime Minister said that this spirit that has been learnt in NCC camps will remain with the Cadets for life. He said that the National Cadet Corps is not about uniform or uniformity, it is about unity. Through NCC we nurture teams that work in mission mode and inspire others, he added. 

The Prime Minister said that the NCC has completed seven glorious decades, and has given a sense of mission to several people. Today we celebrate what we have achieved and also think about how we can make the NCC experience even more effective in the years to come, the Prime Minister said. He urged all stakeholders to think about the plan of action of the next 5 years, when NCC turns 75. 

Shri Narendra Modi asserted that the youth of India now refuse to accept corruption. He asserted that the fight against corruption and black money will not stop. He added that this is a fight for the future of India's youth. 

The Prime Minister appealed to the Cadets to promote digital transactions through the BHIM App, and to motivate others to join that platform. He said that this a step towards transparency and accountability. Once the youth of India decide something, everything is possible, he added.

The Prime Minister said that earlier, people believed that nothing happens to the rich and powerful. But, he added that things are different today. People who served as Chief Ministers are in jail for their corruption, he asserted. 

Speaking on Aadhaar, he said it has added great strength to India's development. What would earlier get into wrong hands is now going to the intended beneficiaries, he added.

                 My dear countrymen, Namaskar. This is the first episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ in the year 2018. Just a couple of days ago, we celebrated our Republic Day festival with gaiety fervour. This is the very first time in history that heads of 10 Nations attended the ceremony.

My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathi has written a rather long letter on the Narendra Modi App, urging me to touch upon the subjects he has referred to. He writes, “The 1 st of February is the death anniversary of astronaut Kalpana Chawla. She left us in the Columbia space shuttle mishap, but not without becoming a source of inspiration for millions of young people the world over”. I am thankful to Bhai Prakash ji for beginning his long letter with the sad departure of Kalpana Chawla. It’s a matter of sorrow for all of us that we lost Kalpana Chawla at that early age, but her life, her work is a message to young women across the world, especially to those in India, that there are no upper limits for Nari Shakti …. the power of women. If one possesses the will &amp; the determination, a firm resolve to achieve something, nothing is impossible. It’s a matter of joy that women in India are taking rapid strides of advancement in all fields, bringing glory to the Nation. 

 In our country, respect for women, their status in society and their contribution has proved to be awe inspiring to the entire world, since ancient times. There has been a long tradition of Vidushis… women exponents or women champions. Many Vidushis of India have contributed in composing the verses of the Vedas. Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee…it’s a long list of names. Today, we talk about ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’, ‘save the girl child, educate her’. But centuries ago, it has been mentioned in our ancient texts, in the Skand Puran :

दशपुत्र-समाकन्या, दशपुत्रान् प्रवर्धयन्

 यत फलम् लभते मRर्य:, तत् लभ्यम् कन्यकैकया ॥

This means, a daughter is the equivalent of ten sons. The ‘Punya’ that you earn through ten sons amounts to the same earned through just one daughter. This underscores the importance that has been given to women in our society. And that is why, in our society, women have been accorded the status of ‘Shakti’. This woman power binds closely together society as a whole, the family as a whole, on the axis of unity &amp; oneness. Be it the erudition of the Vidushis of the Vedic Period. Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee; be it the learning &amp; devotion of Akka Mahadevi or Meerabai, be it the governance of Ahilyabai Holkar or the valour of Rani Lakshmibai, woman power has always inspired us. They have always brought glory to the Nation.

Shriman Prakash Tripathi has further cited some examples. He writes that the flight of our courageous Defence Minister Nirmala Seetharaman in a Sukhoi 30 fighter plane is inspirational for him. He also refers to INSV Tarini, with an all women crew on board under the command of Vartika Joshi, which is currently circumnavigating the globe. Three braveheart women Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become fighter pilots and are undergoing training on the Sukhoi- 30. An Air India Boeing jet with an all woman crew led by Kshamata Vajpayee flew from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and back. These are all women achievers. You are absolutely right. Today women are not just advancing in myriad fields; they are leaders. Today there are many sectors where our woman power is playing a pioneering role, establishing milestones. A few days ago, Hon’ble President took an initiative. He met a group of extraordinary women who have achieved something significanty new in their respective fields. Women achievers of our country… the first female Merchant Navy Captain, the first female passenger train driver, the first female fire fighter, the first female Bus Driver, the first woman to set foot on Antarctica, the first woman to reach Mount Everest… ‘First Ladies’ in every field. Our woman power achieved extraordinary feats, breaking the age old shackles of social mores, creating new records. They proved that through perseverance, grit and a firm resolve, all kinds of obstacles and barriers can be broken &amp; crossed, to chart out an all new path… a path that could act as a beacon of inspiration not just to their contemporaries, but for generations to come. It will infuse afresh energy, newer enthusiasm into them. A book has beencompiled on these women achievers, first ladies, so that, the entire country comes to know about the power of these women and derive inspiration from their life work. This is also available as an e-book on the Narendra Modi Website. 

The country’s woman power has contributed a lot in the positive transformation being witnessed in our country &amp; society these days. Today, as we speak of women empowerment, I would like to refer to a railway station. You must be wondering what a railway station has got to do with women empowerment. Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India which is run by an all woman staff. All departments have women performing duties… the commercial department, Railway Police, Ticket checking, Announcing, Point persons, it’s a staff comprising over 40 women. This time, after watching the Republic Day Parade, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media that a major highlight of the parade was the BSF biker contingent comprising women participants. Daredevil stunts performed by them was awe inspiring for our foreign guests. Empowerment is another form of self reliance. Today our Nari Shakti is assuming leadership roles. It is becoming self reliant. By the way, this also reminds me of tribal women of Chattisgarh, who have done something extraordinary and set a remarkable example. When we refer to Adivasi women, a stereotypical image comes to our minds, comprising jungles, pathways in the woods and women carrying kindlewood on their heads.But the woman power of Chattisgarh, the tribal women there broke this stereotype &amp; presented an all new picture of themselves. Dantewada in Chattisgarh is a Maoist infested region. Violence, torture, explosives, guns, pistols… the Maoists have created a scary reign of terror. In this dangerous atmosphere, Adivasi women are becoming self reliant by driving e-rickshaws. In a short span of time, a  umber of women have become part of this phenomenon. This has three benefits- on the one hand self-employment has empowered them; on the other, the Maoist infested region is witnessing a transformation. And simultaneously as a consequence, it is strengthening efforts towards protecting the environment. I laud the efforts of the District Administration which has played a significant role in the successful endeavour of these women by ensuring availability of grants imparting training to them. 

Time and again we keep hearing people utter ‘There is something special that we as a people possess… no threat is big enough to annihilate our existence’. What is that ‘Special Something’? That ‘Something’ is flexibility, the ability of transformation. Leaving out things that are beyond the constraints of time and accepting betterment in things wherever necessary. And this is a salient feature of our society… relentless efforts towards self-improvement, self correction. We have inherited this Indian tradition as a cultural legacy. The benchmark of any living society is its self correcting mechanism. In our country, there have been unending endeavours against social ills and evil practices, both individually &amp; collectively. Just a while ago, Bihar launched an interesting initiative. In order to uproot social ills in the state, the world’s longest human chain spanning over thirteen thousand kilometers was formed. 

This campaign made people aware of social maladies such as child-marriage and the dowry system. The entire state thus resolved to fight against these social evils. Children, the elderly, the youth full of energy and enthusiasm, women, girls turned out to participate in this battle. The human chain that commenced formation from Gandhi Maidan in Patna gained momentum, touching the state borders. In order to ensure that the fruits of progress rightly reach all sections of society, it is imperative that our society is freed of these ills. Come, let us pledge to come together to wipe out these evil customs from our social fabric… let us build an empowered, capable New India. I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister, the administration, in fact every member of the human chain for this massive, special initiative towards social welfare. 

My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan from Mysore, Karnataka has written on My gov. He was undergoing an expenditure of six thousand rupees a month on medicines alone for the treatment of his father. Earlier, he wasn’t aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana. But now that he’s come to know of the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he has begun purchasing medicines from there and his expenses have been reduced by about 75%. He has expressed his wish that I mention this in ‘Mann Ki Baat’, so that it reaches the maximum number of people and they can benefit from it. Over some time lately, many have written on this subject; many of them have been telling me about it. I too have seen videos put up on social media by beneficiaries of this scheme. It is a matter of joy learning about happenings like these. It gives you inner satisfaction. I felt good to see Shriman Darshan ji think about sharing with others  what he gained from it. The motive behind this scheme is making healthcare affordable and encouraging Ease of Living. Medicines available at the Jan Aushadhi Centres are 50% to 90% cheaper than branded drugs available in the market. This is great help for the common man, especially for senior citizens who require medicines on a daily basis and results in a lot of savings. Generic medicines sold under this scheme strictly conform to prescribed standards set by the World Health Organisation. That is why good quality medicines are made available at affordable prices. Today, over three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country. This has led to not only availability of cheaper medicines, but also new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs. Affordable medicines are now available at ‘Amrit Stores’ at Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi Centres &amp; at hospitals. The sole aim behind this step is ensuring availability of Quality & affordable health service to the poorest of the poor, so that a healthy & prosperous India comes into being.

My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App. It was such a striking photo that my attention was magnetically drawn towards. The photo showed that a grandson was participating in the Clean Morna River along with his grandfather. I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness campaign to clean the Morna river under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan The Morna river was a perennial river flowing throughout the twelve months of the year but now it has become seasonal. The second painful fact was that the river was completely filled with wild grass and hyacinth. A lot of garbage was being dumped into the river and along its banks. An action plan was chalked out and on January 13 th a day before Makar-Sankranti, in the first phase of Mission Clean Morna sanitation of the two sides of the bank of the Morna river at fourteen places spread over an area of four kilometers, was carried out. 

This noble and grand task named Mission Clean Morna involved more than six thousand denizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, Colleges, Students, children, the elderly, mothers, sisters, almost everybody participated in this task. On January   20 th , 2018, this Sanitation Campaign continued in the same vein and I’ve been told that this campaign will continue every Saturday morning till the Morna river is completely cleaned. Mission Clean Morna shows that if a person is determined to do something, then nothing is impossible. Huge social reforms can be brought about through mass movements. I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the municipal corporation’s administration, all the citizens who were associated with this mass movement, I laud your efforts which are not only very much appreciated but this will inspire the other citizens of the country. 

My dear countrymen, these days you must be hearing a lot about the Padma Awards. These awards also attract attention innewspapers and television also. But if you scrutinize, then you will be proud of the fact that there many loftier personalities amidst us and you will naturally be proud of the very fact that today the common man is being cited for Padma awards without any recommendations. There was a certain methodology of awarding Padma Awards every year, but this entire process has been changed for the past three years. Now any citizen can nominate any person in our country. Transparency has been brought about in the entire process by making it operable online. In a way, the selection of these awards has been transformed completely. You may have noticed that many ordinary people not visible in big cities, in newspapers or on TV are being awarded with Padma citations. Now the identity of the awardee is not the deciding factor of the award, rather the importance of his work is increasing. You must have heard the name of Arvind Gupta ji. It will gladden your heart to know, that Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent all his life creating toys for children. He has been making toys from garbage for over four decades so that children can increase their curiosity towards science. 

He has been trying to get children inspired to conduct scientific experiments using waste; towards this end he has been encouraging children by showing them films made in 18 languages in three thousand schools across the country. What a wonderful life, what a dedicated mission! A similar story is that of Sitavaa Jodatti from Karnataka. She has not been hailed as Goddess of women empowerment just for nothing! For the past three decades, in Belagavi, she has made a great contribution towards changing the lives of countless women. At the age of seven she had dedicated herself as a Devadasi but in a turnaround, for the welfare of the Devdasis, she has spent her entire life. Not only this, she has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women too. You must have heard the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor tribal family. He was employed in a small job for eking out his living, but he was also fond of painting in the traditional tribal art form. Today, due to this hobby, he garnered respect not only in India but the entire world. He has exhibited his paintings in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy. The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who made India proud in many nations abroad, was also recognized and he was awarded the Padma Shri. 

You will be pleasantly surprised listening to the story of Keralas tribal lady Lakshmikutti. Laxmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still resides in a hut made of palm leaves in a tribal tract amidst dense forests. She has created five hundred herbal medicines relying solely on her memory. She has mastery in synthesizing medicines used for treatment of snake bites. Lakshmi Ji is continuously serving society with her knowledge of herbal medicines. Identifying her anonymous persona, she has been honoured with the Padma Shri for her contribution to society. I would like to mention another name today, that of 75 year old Subhasini Mistri, hailing from West Bengal, who was selected for the award. Subhasini Mistri is a woman who, in order to construct a hospital, cleaned utensils in the homes of others and also sold vegetables. At the age of 23 she lost her husband due to lack of proper treatment, and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor. Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in this hospital that has come up through hard-work. I am convinced that there are many men and women in our land filled with gems, Bahuratna-Vasundhara, many gifted women and men who remain faceless or unknown.The failure to identify such people is also a loss to the society, the Padma awards are only a medium of acknowledgement, but I would also like to tell the countrymen that people serving the society around us, people giving up all that they have got for the sake of society, millions of people who have worked for a life time for us bestowed with one or the other useful attribute should be acknowledged in our midst. They do not labour for any honor, but their work inspires us. These people should be invited to schools and colleges to share their experiences. Beyond awards, there should be some more efforts from our society in acknowledging their contribution. 

My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas on January 9 th every year. It was on the 9 th of January, when our revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa. On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond that exists between Indians in India and Indians living around the globe. This year we organized a program on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, where all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin were invited. You will be pleased to know that in this programme, Malaysia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Surinam, South Africa and America, and many other countries wherever our Mayors or MPs of Indian Origin exist, all of them participated. I am happy that the people of Indian origin who live in different countries continue to serve those countries and at the same time they have maintained their strong relationship with India as well 

This time, the European Union, has sent me a calendar, in which they have displayed the contributions by Indians in various fields of life living in different countries of Europe; whether working in the field of cyber security, or dedicated to Ayurveda, entertaining the society through music, or through poetry; someone researching on climate change or working on ancient Indian texts, someone driving a truck for livelihood, who went on to construct a Gurudwara or has built a mosque – wherever our people are, they have in their own way embellished or adorned the land of their adoption. I would thus like to thank the European Union, for recognizing the people of Indian origin and through them in making people in India and people the world over aware of their exemplary work. 

The 30 th of January is the death anniversary of our revered Bapu, who showed us a new path. On that day we also observe martyrs day in solemn memory of the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the defense of the country and pay our homage at 11 in the morning. The path of peace and non-violence, is the path of Bapu and this is applicable not only for India or the world, but also for a person or a family or a society. The ideals which Bapu practiced in his life, things that he imparted are relevant even today. They were not just mere theories. At present we witness at every step how accurate Bapus words were. What can be a bigger tribute than taking a vow that we shall tread the path of Bapu - and walk, as far as possible?

My dear countrymen, with my best wishes to all of you for 2018, my speech draws to a close. Thank you very much.

Namaskar.

                मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, नमस्कार। 2018 की यह पहली ‘मन की बात’ है और दो दिन पूर्व ही हमने गणतन्त्र पर्व को बहुत ही उत्साह के साथ और इतिहास में पहली बार ऐसा हुआ कि 10 देशों के मुखिया इस समारोह में उपस्थित रहे। 

मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, मैं आज श्रीमान प्रकाश त्रिपाठी ने NarendraModiApp पर एक लम्बी चिट्ठी लिखी है और मुझसे बहुत आग्रह किया है कि मैं उनके पत्र में लिखे गए विषयों को स्पर्श करूँ। उन्होंने लिखा है, 1 फरवरी को अन्तरिक्ष में जाने वाली कल्पना चावला की पुण्य तिथि है। कोलंबिया अन्तरिक्षयान दुर्घटना में वो हमें छोड़ कर चली गयीं लेकिन दुनिया भर में लाखों युवाओं को प्रेरणा दे गयी। मैं भाई प्रकाश जी का आभारी हूँ कि उन्होंने अपनी लम्बी चिट्ठी में कल्पना चावला की विदाई से प्रारम्भ किया है। यह सबके लिए दुःख की बात है कि हमने कल्पना चावला जी को इतनी कम उम्र में खो दिया लेकिन उन्होंने अपने जीवन से पूरे विश्व में, ख़ासकर भारत की हज़ारों लड़कियों को, यह संदेश दिया कि नारी-शक्ति के लिए कोई सीमा नहीं है। इच्छा और दृढ़ संकल्प हो, कुछ कर गुजरने का ज़ज्बा हो तो कुछ भी असंभव नहीं है। यह देखकर काफी खुशी होती है कि भारत में आज महिलाएँ  हर क्षेत्र में तेज़ी से आगे बढ़ रही हैं और देश का गौरव बढ़ा रही हैं।

प्राचीन काल से हमारे देश में महिलाओं का सम्मान, उनका समाज में स्थान और उनका योगदान, यह पूरी दुनिया को अचंभित करता आया है। भारतीय विदुषियों की लम्बी परम्परा रही है। वेदों की ऋचाओं को गढ़ने में भारत की बहुत-सी विदुषियों का योगदान रहा है। लोपामुद्रा, गार्गी, मैत्रेयी न जाने कितने ही नाम हैं। आज हम ‘बेटी बचाओ, बेटी पढ़ाओ’ की बात करते हैं लेकिन सदियों पहले हमारे शास्त्रों में,स्कन्द-पुराण में,कहा गया है:-

दशपुत्र, समाकन्या, दशपुत्रान प्रवर्धयन्।

यत् फलं लभतेमर्त्य, तत् लभ्यं  कन्यकैकया।।

अर्थात, एक बेटी दस बेटों के बराबर है। दस बेटों से जितना पुण्य मिलेगा एक बेटी से उतना ही पुण्य मिलेगा। यह हमारे समाज में नारी के महत्व को दर्शाता है। और तभी तो, हमारे समाज में नारी को ‘शक्ति’ का दर्जा दिया गया है। यह नारी शक्ति पूरे देश को, सारे समाज को, परिवार को, एकता के सूत्र में बाँधती है। चाहे वैदिक काल की विदुषियां लोपामुद्रा, गार्गी, मैत्रेयी की विद्वता हो या अक्का महादेवी और मीराबाई का ज्ञान और भक्ति हो, चाहे अहिल्याबाई होलकर की शासन व्यवस्था हो या रानी लक्ष्मीबाई की वीरता, नारी शक्ति हमेशा हमें प्रेरित करती आयी है। देश का मान-सम्मान बढ़ाती आई है।

श्रीमान प्रकाश त्रिपाठी ने आगे कई सारे उदाहरण दिए हैं। उन्होंने लिखा है हमारी साहसिक रक्षा-मंत्री निर्मला सीतारमण के लड़ाकू विमान ‘सुखोई 30’ में उड़ान भरना, उन्हें प्रेरणा दे देगा। उन्होंने वर्तिका जोशी के नेतृत्व में भारतीय नौसेना के महिला क्रू मेम्बर्स आई एन एस वी तरिणी (INSV Tarini) पर पूरे विश्व की परिक्रमा कर रही हैं ,उसका ज़िक्र  किया है। तीन बहादुर महिलाएँ भावना कंठ, मोहना सिंह और अवनी चतुर्वेदी Fighter Pilots बनी हैं और Sukhoi-30  में प्रशिक्षण ले रही हैं। क्षमता वाजपेयी की अगुवाई वाली All Women Crue ने दिल्ली से अमेरिका के San Francisco और वापस दिल्ली तक Air India Boeing Jet में उड़ान भरी - और सब की सब महिलाएँ । आपने बिलकुल सही कहा -  आज नारी, हर क्षेत्र में न सिर्फ आगे बढ़ रही है बल्कि नेतृत्व कर रही है।  आज कई क्षेत्र ऐसे हैं जहाँ सबसे पहले, हमारी नारी-शक्ति कुछ करके दिखा रही है। एक milestone स्थापित कर रही है।  पिछले दिनों माननीय राष्ट्रपति जी ने एक नई पहल की।

  राष्ट्रपति जी ने उन असाधारण महिलाओं के एक group  से मुलाकात की जिन्होंने अपने-अपने क्षेत्रों में सबसे पहले कुछ करके दिखाया। देश की ये women achievers , First female Merchant Navy Captain , passenger train की पहली महिला Train Driver, पहली महिला Fire Fighter, पहली महिला Bus Driver, Antarctica पहुँचने वाली पहली महिला, ऐवरेस्ट पर पहुँचने वाली पहली महिला, इस तरह से हर क्षेत्र में ‘First Ladies’-  हमारी नारी-शक्तियों ने समाज की रूढ़िवादिता को तोड़ते हुए असाधारण उपलब्धियाँ हासिल की, एक कीर्तिमान स्थापित किया। उन्होंने ये दिखाया कि कड़ी मेहनत, लगन और दृढसंकल्प के बल पर तमाम बाधाओं और रुकावटों को पार करते हुए एक नया मार्ग तैयार किया जा सकता है। एक ऐसा मार्ग जो सिर्फ अपने समकालीन लोगों को बल्कि आने वाली पीढ़ियों को भी प्रेरित करेगा। उन्हें एक नये जोश और उत्साह से भर देगा। इन women achievers, first ladies पर एक पुस्तक भी तैयार की गयी है ताकि पूरा देश इन नारी शक्तियों के बारे में जाने, उनके जीवन और उनके कार्यों से प्रेरणा ले सके। यह NarendraModi website  पर भी e-book के रूप में उपलब्ध है।

  आज देश और समाज में हो रहे सकारात्मक बदलाव में देश की नारी-शक्ति की महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका है। आज जब हम महिला सशक्तीकरण पर चर्चा कर रहे हैं तो मैं एक रेलवे स्टेशन का ज़िक्र करना चाहूँगा। एक रेलवे स्टेशन और महिला सशक्तीकरण, आप सोच रहे होंगे कि इस बीच में क्या connection है। मुंबई का माटुंगा स्टेशन भारत का ऐसा पहला स्टेशन है जहाँ सारी महिला कर्मचारी हैं। सभी विभागों में women staff - चाहे Commercial Department हो, Railway Police हो, Ticket Checking हो, Announcing हो, Point Person हो, पूरा 40 से भी अधिक महिलाओं का staff है। इस बार बहुत से लोगों ने गणतंत्र दिवस की परेड देखने के बाद Twitter पर और दूसरे Social Media पर लिखा कि परेड की एक मुख्य बात थी, BSF Biker Contingent जिसमें सब की सब महिलाएँ भाग ले रहीं थी। साहसपूर्ण प्रयोग कर रही थीं और ये दृश्य, विदेश से आये हुए मेहमानों को भी आश्चर्यचकित कर रहा था। सशक्तीकरण, आत्मनिर्भरता का ही एक रूप है। आज हमारी नारी-शक्ति नेतृत्व कर रही है। आत्मनिर्भर बन रही है। वैसे ही एक बात मेरे ध्यान में आई है, छत्तीसगढ़ की हमारी आदिवासी महिलाओं ने भी कमाल कर दिया है। उन्होंने एक नई मिसाल पेश की है। आदिवासी महिलाओं का जब ज़िक्र आता है तो सभी के मन में एक निश्चित तस्वीर उभर कर आती है। जिसमें जंगल होता है, पगडंडियां होती हैं, उन पर लकड़ियों का बोझ सिर पर उठाये चल रही महिलाएँ। लेकिन छत्तीसगढ़ की हमारी आदिवासी नारी, हमारी इस नारी-शक्ति ने देश के सामने एक नई तस्वीर बनाई है। छत्तीसगढ़ का दंतेवाड़ा इलाक़ा, जो माओवाद-प्रभावित क्षेत्र है। हिंसा, अत्याचार, बम, बन्दूक, पिस्तौल - माओवादियों ने इसी का एक भयानक वातावरण पैदा किया हुआ है। ऐसे ख़तरनाक इलाक़े में आदिवासी महिलाएँ, E-Rickshaw चला कर आत्मनिर्भर बन रही हैं। बहुत ही थोड़े कालखंड में कई सारी महिलाएँ इससे जुड़ गयी हैं। और इससे तीन लाभ हो रहे हैं, एक तरफ जहाँ स्वरोजगार ने उन्हें सशक्त बनाने का काम किया है वहीँ  इससे माओवाद-प्रभावित इलाक़े की तस्वीर भी बदल रही है। और इन सबके साथ इससे पर्यावरण-संरक्षण के काम को भी बल मिल रहा है। यहाँ के ज़िला प्रशासन की भी सराहना करता हूँ, Grant उपलब्ध कराने से ले कर Training देने तक, ज़िला प्रशासन ने इन महिलाओं की सफलता में एक महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाई है।

     हम बार-बार सुनते आये हैं कि लोग कहते हैं – ‘कुछ बात है ऐसी कि हस्ती मिटती नहीं हमारी’। वो बात क्या है, वो बात है, Flexibility – लचीलापन, Transformation। जो काल-बाह्य है उसे छोड़ना, जो आवश्यक है उसका सुधार स्वीकार करना। और हमारे समाज की विशेषता है – आत्मसुधार करने का निरंतर प्रयास, Self-Correction, ये भारतीय परम्परा, ये हमारी संस्कृति हमें विरासत में मिली है। किसी भी जीवन-समाज की पहचान होती है उसका Self Correcting Mechanism। सामाजिक कुप्रथाओं और कुरीतियों के ख़िलाफ सदियों से हमारे देश में व्यक्तिगत और सामाजिक स्तर पर लगातार प्रयास होते रहे हैं। अभी कुछ दिन पहले बिहार ने एक रोचक पहल की। राज्य में सामाजिक कुरीतियों को जड़ से मिटाने के लिए 13 हज़ार से अधिक किलोमीटर की विश्व की सबसे लम्बी मानव-श्रृंखला, Human Chain बनाई गयी। इस अभियान के द्वारा लोगों को बाल-विवाह और दहेज़-प्रथा जैसी बुराइयों के खिलाफ़ जागरूक किया गया। दहेज़ और बाल-विवाह जैसी कुरीतियों से पूरे राज्य ने लड़ने का संकल्प लिया। बच्चे, बुजुर्ग, जोश और उत्साह से भरे युवा, माताएँ, बहनें हर कोई अपने आप को इस जंग में शामिल किये हुए थे। पटना का ऐतिहासिक गाँधी मैदान से आरंभ हुई मानव-श्रृंखला राज्य की सीमाओं तक अटूट-रूप से जुड़ती चली गई। समाज के सभी लोगों को सही मायने में विकास का लाभ मिले इसके लिए ज़रुरी है कि हमारा समाज इन कुरीतियों से मुक्त हो। आइये हम सब मिलकर ऐसी कुरीतियों को समाज से ख़त्म करने की प्रतिज्ञा लें और एक New India, एक सशक्त एवं समर्थ भारत का निर्माण करें। मैं बिहार की जनता, राज्य के मुख्यमंत्री, वहाँ के प्रशासन और मानव –श्रृंखला में शामिल हर व्यक्ति की सराहना करता हूँ कि उन्होंने समाज कल्याण की दिशा में इतनी विशेष एवं व्यापक पहल की।

    मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, मैसूर, कर्नाटक के श्रीमान् दर्शन ने MyGov पर लिखा है – उनके पिता के ईलाज़ पर महीने में दवाइयों का खर्च 6 हज़ार रूपये होता था। उन्हें पहले प्रधानमंत्री जन-औषधि योजना के बारे में जानकारी नहीं थी। लेकिन अब जब उन्हें जन-औषधि केंद्र के बारे में जानकारी मिली और उन्होंने वहाँ से दवाइयाँ ख़रीदी तो उनका दवाइयों का खर्च 75 प्रतिशत तक कम हो गया। उन्होंने इच्छा जताई है कि मैं इसके बारे में ‘मन की बात’ कार्यक्रम में बात करूँ ताकि ज्यादा से ज्यादा लोगों तक इसकी जानकारी पहुँचे और वे इसका लाभ ले सकें। पिछले कुछ समय से बहुत लोग मुझे इस विषय में लिखते रहते थे, बताते रहते हैं। मैंने भी कई लोगों के Video, Social Media पर भी देखे है जिन्होंने इस योजना का लाभ लिया है। और इस तरह की जानकारी जब मिलती है तो बहुत खुशी होती है। एक गहरा संतोष मिलता है। और मुझे यह भी बहुत अच्छा लगा कि श्रीमान् दर्शन जी के मन में ये विचार आया कि जो उन्हें मिला है, वो औरों को भी मिले। इस योजना के पीछे उद्देश्य है - Health Care को affordable बनाना और Ease of Living को प्रोत्साहित करना। जन-औषधि केन्द्रों पर मिलने वाली दवाएं बाज़ार में बिकने वाली Branded दवाइयों से लगभग 50% से 90% तक सस्ती हैं। इससे जन-सामान्य, विशेषकर प्रतिदिन दवाएं लेने वाले वरिष्ठ नागरिकों की बहुत आर्थिक मदद होती है, बहुत बचत होती है। इसमें ख़रीदी जानेवाली generic दवाएं World Health Organisation के तय standard के हिसाब से होती हैं। यही कारण है कि अच्छी Quality की दवाएं सस्ते दाम पर मिल जाती हैं। आज देशभर में तीन हज़ार से ज्यादा जन-औषधि केंद्र स्थापित किये जा चुके हैं। इससे न सिर्फ दवाइयाँ सस्ती मिल रही हैं बल्कि Individual Entrepreneurs के लिए भी रोज़गार के नए अवसर पैदा हो रहे हैं। सस्ती दवाइयाँ प्रधानमंत्री भारतीय जन-औषधि केन्द्रों और अस्पतालों के ‘अमृत stores’ पर उपलब्ध हैं। इन सब के पीछे एक मात्र उद्देश्य है – देश के ग़रीब से ग़रीब व्यक्ति को Quality and affordable health service उपलब्ध करवाना ताकि एक स्वस्थ और समृद्ध भारत का निर्माण किया जा सके।

          मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, महाराष्ट्र से श्रीमान् मंगेश ने Narendra Modi Mobile App पर एक Photo, Share की। वो Photo ऐसी थी कि मेरा ध्यान उस Photo की ओर खींचा चला गया। वो फोटो ऐसी थी जिसमें एक पोता अपने दादा के साथ ‘Clean Morna River’ सफाई अभियान में हिस्सा ले रहा था। मुझे पता चला कि अकोला के नागरिकों ने ‘स्वच्छ भारत अभियान’ के तहत मोरना नदी को साफ़ करने के लिए स्वच्छता अभियान का आयोजन किया था। मोरना नदी पहले बारह महीने बहती थी लेकिन अब वो seasonal हो गई है। दूसरी पीड़ा की बात है कि नदी पूरी तरह से जंगली घास, जलकुम्भी से भर गई थी। नदी और उसके किनारे पर काफ़ी कूड़ा फेका जा रहा था। एक action plan तैयार किया गया और मकर-संक्रांति से एक दिन पहले 13 जनवरी को ‘Mission Clean Morna’  के प्रथम चरण के तहत चार किलोमीटर के क्षेत्र में चौदह स्थानों पर मोरना नदी के तट के दोनों किनारों की सफाई की गई। ‘Mission Clean Morna’ के इस नेक कार्य में अकोला के छह हज़ार से अधिक नागरिकों, सौ से अधिक NGOs , Colleges, Students, बच्चे, बुजुर्ग, माताएँ-बहनें हर किसी ने इसमें भाग लिया। 20 जनवरी 2018 को भी ये स्वच्छता-अभियान उसी तरह जारी रखा गया और मुझे बताया गया है कि जब तक मोरना नदी पूरी तरह से साफ़ नही हो जाती, ये अभियान हर शनिवार की सुबह को चलेगा। यह दिखाता है कि अगर व्यक्ति कुछ करने की ठान ले तो नामुमकिन कुछ भी नहीं है। जन-आंदोलन के माध्यम से बड़े से बड़े बदलाव लाये जा सकते हैं। मैं अकोला की जनता को, वहाँ के ज़िला एवं नगर-निगम के प्रशासन को इस काम को जन-आंदोलन बनाने के लिए जुटे हुए सब नागरिकों को, आपके इन प्रयासों को बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूँ और आप का ये प्रयास देश के अन्य लोगों को भी प्रेरित करेगा।

    मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, इन दिनों पद्म-पुरस्कारों के संबंध में काफी चर्चा आप भी सुनते होंगे। अख़बारों में भी इस विषय में, T.V. पर भी इस पर ध्यान आकर्षित होता है। लेकिन थोड़ा अगर बारीकी से देखेंगे तो आपको गर्व होगा। गर्व इस बात का कि कैसे-कैसे महान लोग हमारे बीच में हैं और स्वाभाविक रूप से इस बात का भी गर्व होगा कि कैसे आज हमारे देश में सामान्य व्यक्ति बिना किसी सिफ़ारिश के उन ऊँचाइयों तक पहुँच रहें हैं। हर वर्ष पद्म-पुरस्कार देने की परम्परा रही है लेकिन पिछले तीन वर्षों में इसकी पूरी प्रक्रिया बदल गई है। अब कोई भी नागरिक किसी को भी nominate कर सकता है। पूरी प्रक्रिया online हो जाने से transparency आ गई है। एक तरह से इन पुरस्कारों की चयन-प्रक्रिया का पूरा transformation हो गया है। आपका भी इस बात पर ध्यान गया होगा कि बहुत सामान्य लोगों को पद्म-पुरस्कार मिल रहे हैं। ऐसे लोगों को पद्म-पुरस्कार दिए गए हैं जो आमतौर पर बड़े-बड़े शहरों में, अख़बारों में, टी.वी. में, समारोह में नज़र नहीं आते हैं। अब पुरस्कार देने के लिए व्यक्ति की पहचान नहीं, उसके काम का महत्व बढ़ रहा है। आपने सुना होगा श्रीमान् अरविन्द गुप्ता जी को, आपको जान करके ख़ुशी होगी, IIT कानपुर के छात्र रहे अरविन्द जी ने बच्चों के लिए खिलौने बनाने में अपना सारा जीवन खपा दिया। वे चार दशकों से कचरे से खिलौने बना रहे हैं ताकि बच्चों में विज्ञान के प्रति जिज्ञासा बढ़ा सकें। उनकी कोशिश है कि बच्चे बेकार चीज़ों से वैज्ञानिक प्रयोगों की ओर प्रेरित हों, इसके लिए वे देशभर के तीन हज़ार स्कूलों में जाकर 18 भाषाओं में बनी फ़िल्में दिखाकर बच्चों को प्रेरित कर रहे हैं। कैसा अद्भुत जीवन, कैसा अद्भुत समर्पण! एक ऐसी ही कहानी कर्नाटक के सितावा जोद्दती (SITAVAA JODATTI) की है। इन्हें ‘महिला-सशक्तीकरण की देवी’ ऐसे ही नहीं कहा गया है। पिछले तीन दशकों से बेलागवी (BELAGAVI) में इन्होंने अनगिनत महिलाओं का जीवन बदलने में महान योगदान दिया है। इन्होंने सात वर्ष की आयु में ही स्वयं को देवदासी के रूप में समर्पित कर दिया था। लेकिन फिर देवदासियों के कल्याण के लिए ही अपना पूरा जीवन लगा दिया। इतना ही नहीं, इन्होंने दलित महिलाओं के कल्याण के लिए भी अभूतपूर्व कार्य किये हैं। आपने नाम सुना होगा मध्य प्रदेश के भज्जू श्याम के बारे में, श्रीमान् भज्जू श्याम का जन्म एक बिलकुल ग़रीब परिवार, आदिवासी परिवार में हुआ था। वे जीवन यापन के लिए सामान्य नौकरी करते थे लेकिन उनको पारम्परिक आदिवासी painting बनाने का शौक था। आज इसी शौक की वजह से इनका भारत ही नहीं, पूरे विश्व में सम्मान है। Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy जैसे कई देशों में इनकी painting प्रदर्शनी लग चुकी है। विदेशों में भारत का नाम रोशन करने वाले भज्जू श्याम जी की प्रतिभा को पहचाना गया और उन्हें पद्मश्री सम्मान प्रदान किया गया।         

केरल की आदिवासी महिला लक्ष्मीकुट्टी की कहानी सुनकर आप सुखद आश्चर्य से भर जायेंगे। लक्ष्मीकुट्टी, कल्लार में शिक्षिका हैं और अब भी घने जंगलों के बीच आदिवासी इलाके में ताड़ के पत्तों से बनी झोपड़ी में रहती हैं। उन्होंने अपनी स्मृति के आधार पर ही पांच सौ herbal medicine बनाई हैं। जड़ी-बूटियों से दवाइयाँ बनाई है। सांप काटने के बाद उपयोग की जाने वाली दवाई बनाने में उन्हें महारत हासिल है। लक्ष्मी जी herbal दवाओं की अपनी जानकारी से लगातार समाज की सेवा कर रही हैं। इस गुमनाम शख्शियत को पहचान कर समाज में इनके योगदान के लिए उन्हें पद्मश्री से सम्मानित किया गया। मैं आज एक और नाम का भी जिक्र करने का मेरा मन करता है। पश्चिम बंगाल की 75 वर्षीय सुभासिनी मिस्त्री को भी। उन्हें पुरस्कार के लिए चुना गया। सुभासिनी मिस्त्री एक ऐसी महिला हैं, जिन्होंने अस्पताल बनाने के लिए दूसरों के घरों में बर्तन मांजे, सब्जी बेची। जब ये 23 वर्ष की थीं तो उपचार नहीं मिलने से इनके पति की मृत्यु हो गई थी और इसी घटना ने उन्हें गरीबों के लिए अस्पताल बनाने के लिए प्रेरित किया। आज इनकी कड़ी मेहनत से बनाए गए अस्पताल में हजारों गरीबों का नि:शुल्क इलाज किया जाता है। मुझे पूरा विश्वास है कि हमारी बहुरत्ना-वसुंधरा में ऐसे कई नर-रत्न हैं, कई नारी-रत्न हैं जिनको न कोई जानता है, न कोई पहचानता है। ऐसे व्यक्तियों की पहचान न बनना, उससे समाज का भी घाटा हो जाता है। पद्म-पुरस्कार एक माध्यम है लेकिन मैं देशवासियों को भी कहूँगा कि हमारे आस-पास समाज के लिए जीने वाले, समाज के लिए खपने वाले, किसी न किसी विशेषता को ले करके जीवन भर कार्य करने वाले लक्षावधि लोग हैं। कभी न कभी उनको समाज के बीच में लाना चाहिए। वो मान-सम्मान के लिए काम नहीं करते हैं लेकिन उनके कार्य के कारण हमें प्रेरणा मिलती है। कभी स्कूलों में, colleges में ऐसे लोगों को बुला करके उनके अनुभवों को सुनना चाहिए। पुरस्कार से भी आगे, समाज में भी कुछ प्रयास होना चाहिए।

    मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, हर वर्ष 9 जनवरी को हम प्रवासी भारतीय दिवस मनाते हैं। यही 9 जनवरी है, जब पूज्य महात्मा गाँधी SOUTH AFRICA से भारत लौटे थे। इस दिन हम भारत और विश्व भर में रह रहे भारतीयों के बीच, अटूट-बंधन का जश्न मनाते हैं। इस वर्ष प्रवासी भारतीय दिवस पर हमने एक कार्यक्रम आयोजित किया था जहाँ विश्व भर में रह रहे भारतीय-मूल के सभी सांसदों को और मेयरों  ( MAYORS)  को आमंत्रित किया था। आपको यह जानकर खुशी होगी कि उस कार्यक्रम में Malaysia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Surinam, दक्षिण अफ्रीका और America  से, और भी कई देशों से वहाँ जहाँ-जहाँ हमारे मेयर हैं मूल- भारतीय, जहाँ-जहाँ सांसद है मूल-भारतीय, उन सब ने भाग लिया था। मुझे खुशी है कि विभिन्न देशों में रह रहे भारतीय-मूल के लोग उन देशों की सेवा तो कर ही रहे हैं साथ ही साथ, वे भारत के साथ भी अपने मजबूत संबंध बनाए रखे हैं। इस बार यूरोपीय संघ, यूरोपियन यूनियन ने मुझे कैलेंडर भेजा है जिसमें उन्होनें यूरोप के विभिन्न देशों में रह रहे भारतीयों द्वारा विभिन्न क्षेत्रों में उनके योगदानों को एक अच्छे ढंग से दर्शाया है। हमारे मूल-भारतीय लोग जो यूरोप के भिन्न-भिन्न देशों में बस रहे हैं - कोई CYBER SECURITY में काम कर रहा है, तो कोई आयुर्वेद को समर्पित है, कोई अपने संगीत से समाज के मन को डुलाता लाता है तो कोई अपनी कविताओं से। कोई climate change पर शोध कर रहा है तो कोई भारतीय ग्रंथों पर काम कर रहा है। किसी ने ट्रक चलाकर गुरुद्वारा खड़ा किया है तो किसी ने मस्जिद बनाई है। यानी जहाँ भी हमारे लोग हैं, उन्होंने वहाँ की धरती को किसी न किसी तरीके से सुसज्जित किया है। मैं धन्यवाद देना चाहूँगा यूरोपीय यूनियन के इस उल्लेखनीय कार्य के लिए, भारतीय मूल के लोगों को recognise करने के लिए और उनके माध्यम से दुनिया भर के लोगों को जानकारी देने के लिए भी।

      30 जनवरी को पूज्य बापू की पुण्य-तिथि है, जिन्होंने हम सभी को एक नया रास्ता दिखाया है। उस दिन हम ‘शहीद दिवस’ मनाते हैं। उस दिन हम देश की रक्षा में अपनी जान गवां देने वाले महान शहीदों को 11 बजे श्रद्दांजलि अर्पित करते हैं। शांति और अहिंसा का रास्ता, यही बापू का रास्ता। चाहे भारत हो या दुनिया, चाहे व्यक्ति हो परिवार हो या समाज-पूज्य बापू जिन आदर्शों को ले करके जिए, पूज्य बापू ने जो बातें हमें बताई, वे आज भी अत्यंत relevant हैं। वे सिर्फ कोरे सिद्दांत नहीं थे। वर्तमान में भी हम डगर-डगर पर देखते हैं कि बापू की बातें कितनी सही थीं। अगर हम संकल्प करें कि बापू के रास्ते पर चलें -जितना चल सके, चलें - तो उससे बड़ी श्रद्दांजलि क्या हो सकती है?

     मेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, आप सब को 2018 की शुभकामनायें देते हुए, मेरी वाणी को विराम देता हूँ। बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद । नमस्कार।

 Friends from Media,

Ladies & Gentlemen, 


Greetings! 

It is a great pleasure for me to once again welcome Prime Minister Hun Sen. This state visit of his is taking place after a gap of ten years.

Even though Prime Minister you yourself are well aware of India and India with you, I am sure that during this visit you have got an opportunity to closely witness its economic progress and social changes.

Two days ago during the ASEAN INDIA Commemorative Summit ASEAN-India cooperation was discussed in detail.

Leaders of 10 ASEAN countries and India made important decisions so that in the near future the cooperation of India and ASEAN scales new heights.

In this regard Prime Minister Hun Sen has honored us by his acceptance of my invitation and his gracious presence during the summit.

Not only this, you have made valuable contributions in the discussions and outcomes of the summit. I heartily thank you for that.

Friends, 

Ancient historic relations of India and Cambodia became even more intense in the second half of the last century when India stood shoulder to shoulder with its old friend and its citizens during the political changes in Cambodia.

Prime Minister Hun Sen agree that according to the contemporary requirements today we need to further deepen our relations in all areas.

India is not only willing but it is committed to extend its partnership with Cambodia in all the areas like economic, social development, capacity building, culture, trade, tourism and people to people contacts.

Our shared heritage is a very important part of our cultural relations. Restoration of the historic Angkor Wat Temple built in the 12th century is an example of this cooperation.

India is happy that it could contribute to the preservation and development of this cultural heritage of Cambodia.

Our languages have also evolved from Pali and Sanskrit. 

It is a matter of great pleasure that the roots of our historical and cultural relations are very deep therefore there are great possibilities to promote mutual tourism.


Friends, 

It is a matter of great happiness for India that our friend Cambodia is making rapid economic progress and has been growing annually at 7% in the last two decades.

India is the fastest growing large economy in the world. Since we have similar values and cultural ethos, we can have a natural synergy in enhancing trade between our two countries.

Liberal economic policies of Cambodia and establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community provides a good opportunity for Indian investments in Cambodia particularly in areas such as health, medicine, information technology, agriculture, automobile and auto parts, textile, etc. 

I am confident that in the coming years our bilateral trade will further increase and more and more investors and traders from India will be able to make a profitable presence in Cambodia.

Friends, 

Development co-operation is an important part of India's relationship with Cambodia.

India's commitment as an important partner towards Cambodia's social and economic development has always been there and it will continue to be so.

We have proposed several more lines of credit for projects according to the requirements of government of Cambodia particularly in the areas of health, connectivity, digital connectivity.

Every year India is implementing 5 quick impact projects in Cambodia. We have decided to increase the number of these projects annually from 5 to 10. We have also established a Project Development Fund of 500 crore rupees.

This fund can be utilized for expanding industry and business and also to make the supply chain cost effective.

We are setting up a Center of Excellence in IT and IT enabled services in Cambodia.

For more than five decades India has been an active partner of Cambodia in the Indian Technology & Economic Cooperation Program.

More than 1400 Cambodian citizens have received training in capacity building through this program.

We will continue this program in the future also and we are ready to expand it further according to the requirements of Cambodia.

Friends, 

There is a deep cooperation between our two countries on the International Forum and we have reliable relationship on many regional and international forums.

Enhancing existing synergies India and Cambodia will continue to support each other on international forums.

Finally, I thank Prime Minister Hun Sen for his visit to India as an integral friend and a respected guest of India. I hope that his stay in India will be pleasant and memorable.

I also assure that India is ready to extend even more close cooperation with Cambodia in the near future so that our close and traditionally deep relations with Cambodia and its citizens can be strengthened further.

ASEAN-India: Shared values, common destiny” 

By : Shri Narendra Modi

 

Today, 1.25 billion Indians will have the honour to host 10 esteemed guests -- leaders of Asean nations -- at India's Republic Day celebrations in our capital, New Delhi.

On Thursday, I had the privilege to host the ASEAN leaders for the Commemorative Summit to mark 25 years of ASEAN-India Partnership. Their presence with us is an unprecedented gesture of goodwill from ASEAN nations. Responding to this, on a winter morning, India has come out to greet them in a warm embrace of friendship.

This is no ordinary event. It is a historic milestone in a remarkable journey that has brought India and ASEAN in a deepening partnership of great promise for their 1.9 billion people, about one-fourth of human kind.

The India-ASEAN partnership may be just 25 years old. But, India's ties with Southeast Asia stretch back more than two millennia. Forged in peace and friendship, religion and culture, art and commerce, language and literature, these enduring links are now present in every facet of the magnificent diversity of India and Southeast Asia, providing a unique envelope of comfort and familiarity between our people.

More than two decades ago, India opened itself to the world with tectonic changes. And, with instincts honed over centuries, it turned naturally to the East. Thus began a new journey of India's reintegration with the East. For India, most of our major partners and markets -- from ASEAN and East Asia to North America -- lie to the East. And, Southeast Asia and ASEAN, our neighbours by land and sea, have been the springboard of our Look East and, for the last three years, the Act East Policy.

Along the way, from dialogue partners, ASEAN and India have become strategic partners. We advance our broad-based partnership through 30 mechanisms. With each Asean member, we have growing diplomatic, economic and security partnership. We work together to keep our seas safe and secure. Our trade and investment flows have multiplied several times. ASEAN is India's fourth largest trading partner; India is ASEAN's seventh. Over 20% of India's outbound investments go to ASEAN. Led by Singapore, ASEAN is India's leading source of investments. India's free trade agreements in the region are its oldest and among the most ambitious anywhere.

Air links have expanded rapidly and we are extending highways deep into continental Southeast Asia with new urgency and priority. Growing connectivity has reinforced proximity. It has also put India among the fastest growing sources of tourism in Southeast Asia. Over a 6 million strong Indian diaspora in the region -- rooted in diversity and steeped in dynamism -- constitutes an extraordinary human bond between us.

The Prime Minister has shared his views for each of the ASEAN member nations as follows  

 

Thailand

Thailand has emerged as an important trading partner of India in Asean and is also one of the important investors in India from Asean. Bilateral trade between India and Thailand has more than doubled over the last decade. Relations between India and Thailand are extensively spread across many areas. We are important regional partners linking South and Southeast Asia. We cooperate closely in the Asean, East Asia Summit and Bimstec (the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), as also in the frameworks of Mekong Ganga Cooperation, Asia Cooperation Dialogue and Indian Ocean Rim Association. Thailand's prime minister's state visit to India in 2016 has made a long-lasting impact on bilateral relations.

The whole of India mourned with their Thai brothers and sisters the demise of the great and popular King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The people of India also join the friendly people of Thailand in praying for the long, prosperous and peaceful reign of the new king, His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun.

 

Vietnam

The traditionally close and cordial relations have their historical roots in the common struggle for liberation from foreign rule and the national struggle for independence. Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and President Hồ Chí Minh led our peoples in the heroic struggle against colonialism. During the visit of Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng to India in 2007, we signed the Strategic Partnership agreement. This strategic partnership has grown into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with my visit to Việt Nam in 2016.

India’s relations with Việt Nam are marked by growing economic and commercial engagement. Bilateral trade between India and Việt Nam has increased about 10 fold in 10 years. Defence Co-operation has emerged as a significant pillar of strategic partnership between India and Việt Nam. Science and Technology is another important area of cooperation between India and Việt Nam.

 

Myanmar

India and Myanmar share a land-border of over 1600 kms as well as a maritime boundary. Religious and cultural traditions flowing from our deep sense of kinship and our common Buddhist heritage bind us as closely as does our shared historical past. Nothing illuminates it more gloriously than the gleaming tower of Shwedagon Pagoda. The cooperation to restore Ananda Temple in Bagan with assistance of the Archaeological Survey of India also is emblematic of this shared heritage.

During the colonial period, political bonds were forged between our leaders, who displayed a great sense of hope and unity during our common struggle for independence. Gandhiji visited Yangon several times. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was deported to Yangon for many years. The clarion call of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose for India’s independence stirred the souls of many in Myanmar.


Our trade has more than doubled over the last decade. Our investment ties are also robust. Development cooperation has a significant role in India’s relations with Myanmar. This assistance portfolio is presently worth over $1.73 billion. India’s transparent development cooperation is in line with Myanmar’s national priorities and also builds synergy with the Master Plan of ASEAN Connectivity.

 

Singapore

Singapore is a window to the heritage of India's ties to the region, the progress of the present and the potential of the future. Singapore was a bridge between India and Asean.

Today, it is our gateway to the East, our leading economic partner and a major global strategic partner, which resonates in our membership in several regional and global forums. Singapore and India share a strategic partnership.

Our political relations are infused with goodwill, warmth and trust. Our defence ties are among the strongest for both.

Our economic partnership covers every area of priority for our two nations. Singapore is India's leading destination and source of investments.

Thousands of Indian companies are registered in Singapore.

Sixteen Indian cities have over 240 direct flights every week to Singapore. Indians make up the third-largest group of tourists in Singapore.

Singapore's inspirational multiculturalism and respect for talent have nurtured a vibrant and dynamic Indian community that is contributing to deeper cooperation between our nations.

 

Philippines

I had a very satisfying visit to the Philippines a little over two months ago. In addition to attending the ASEAN-India, EAS and related Summits, I had the pleasure of meeting President Duterte and we had extensive discussions on how to carry forward our warm and problem-free relationship. We are both strong in services and our growth rates are amongst the highest among major countries. Our business and trade potential holds great promise.

I laud President Duterte’s commitment to bringing about inclusive development and to fighting corruption. These are areas where both countries can work together. We are happy to share our experience with the Philippines in universal ID cards, financial inclusion, making banking accessible to all, facilitating direct transfer of benefits, and in promoting cashless transactions. Making affordable medicines available to all is another priority area for the government of the Philippines that we are ready to contribute to. From Mumbai to Marawi, terrorism knows no boundaries. We are enhancing our cooperation with the Philippines in facing this common challenge.

 

Malaysia

The contemporary relations between India and Malaysia are quite extensive and spread across many areas. Malaysia and India share s Strategic Partnership and we cooperate in a number of multilateral and regional fora. Malaysian Prime Minister’s State visit to India in 2017 has made a long-lasting impact on the bilateral relations.

 

Malaysia has emerged as the third largest trading partner of India in ASEAN and is one of the important investors in India from ASEAN. Bilateral trade between India and Malaysia has increased more than two-fold in 10 years. India and Malaysia have a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement since 2011. This Agreement is unique in the sense that both sides have offered ASEAN Plus commitments in trade in goods and have exchanged WTO Plus offers in trade in services. The Revised Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between the two countries, signed in May 2012, and the MoU on Customs Cooperation, signed in 2013 further facilitate our trade and investment cooperation.

Brunei

Bilateral trade between India and Brunei has more than doubled over the last decade. India and Brunei share common membership of UN, NAM, Commonwealth, ARF, etc., and as developing countries with strong traditional and cultural ties, Brunei and India enjoy a fair degree of commonality in their perceptions on major international issues. the visit of the Sultan of Brunei to India in May 2008 was a landmark in India-Brunei relations. Vice-President of India visited Brunei in February 2016.

Lao PDR

Relations between India and Lao PDR are extensively spread across many areas. India has been actively involved in power transmission and agricultural sectors in Lao PDR. Today, India and Lao PDR cooperate in a number of multilateral and regional fora.

 

While the trade between India and Lao PDR is still below potential, India has extended Duty Free Tariff Preference Schemes to Lao PDR, encourage exports of goods from Lao PDR to India. We also have immense opportunities in services trade that goes in building the economy of Lao PDR. Implementation of the ASEAN-India Services and Investment Agreement would help facilitate our services trade.

 

Indonesia

Separated by a mere 90 nautical miles in the Indian Ocean, India and Indonesia share a continuity of civilizational relationship that spans over two millennia.

Whether it is the annual Balijatra celebrated in Odisha or the legends of Ramayana and Mahabharata, which are visible across the entire landscape of Indonesia, these unique cultural threads umbilically bind the peoples of Asia’s

two largest democracies in a special neighbourly embrace.

 

‘Unity in Diversity’ or Bhinneka Tunggal Ika is also a key facet of the shared societal value structures that both countries celebrate, as also the common values of democracy and rule of law. Today, as Strategic Partners, our cooperation spans across the entire gamut of political, economic, defence & security, cultural and people to people fields. Indonesia continues to be our largest trading partner in ASEAN. Bilateral trade between India and Indonesia increased 2.5 times in the last ten years. President Joko Widodo’s State visit to

India in 2016 has made a long-lasting impact on the bilateral relations.

Cambodia

 

The traditional and friendly relations between India and Cambodia are deeply rooted in civilizational ties. The magnificent structure of Angkor Wat temple is a glorious testimony and grand symbol of our ancient historical, religious and cultural links. India was proud to undertake restoration and preservation of Angkor Wat temple during the difficult period from 1986-1993. India continues this valuable association in the ongoing restoration of Ta-Prohm temple. 

After the collapse of Khmer Rouge regime, India was the first country to recognize the new government in 1981. India was also associated with the Paris Peace Accord and its finalization in 1991. These traditional bonds of friendship have strengthened through regular exchange of high level visits. We have expanded our cooperation in diverse fields such as institutional capacity building, human resource development, developmental and social projects, cultural exchanges, defence cooperation, tourism and people-to- people contact.

In the ASEAN context, and on various global platforms, Cambodia is an important interlocutor and a supportive partner for India. India is committed to remain a partner in Cambodia’s economic development and looks forward to further deepen its traditional ties.

And, India and ASEAN are doing much more. Our partnership in ASEAN-led institutions like East Asia Summit, ADMM+ (the ASEAN Defence Ministerial Meeting Plus) and ARF (the ASEAN Regional Forum) are advancing peace and stability in our region. India is also an eager participant in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, seeking a comprehensive, balanced and fair agreement for all 16 participants.

The strength and resilience of partnerships come not just from arithmetic of numbers, but also from the underpinnings of the relationship. India and ASEAN nations have relations free from contests and claims. We have a common vision for the future, built on commitment to inclusion and integration, belief in sovereign equality of all nations irrespective of size, and support for free and open pathways of commerce and engagement.

The ASEAN-India partnership will continue to grow. With the gift of demography, dynamism and demand -- and with rapidly maturing economies -- India and ASEAN will build a strong economic partnership. Connectivity will increase and trade will expand. In an era of cooperative and competitive federalism in India, our states are also building productive cooperation with Southeast Asian nations. India's Northeast is on a resurgent path. Links with Southeast Asia will accelerate its progress. In turn, a connected Northeast will be a bridge to ASEAN-India ties of our dreams.

As Prime Minister, I have attended four annual ASEAN-India Summits and East Asia Summit. These have reinforced my conviction in ASEAN unity, centrality and leadership in shaping the region in this vision.

This is a year of milestones. India turned 70 last year. ASEAN reached the golden milestone of 50 years. We can each look to our future with optimism and to our partnership with confidence.

At 70, India exudes the spirit, enterprise and energy of its young population. As the fastest growing major economy in the world, India has become the new frontier of global opportunities and an anchor of stability of the global economy. With every passing day, it is easier and smoother to do business in India. I hope that ASEAN nations, as our neighbours and friends, will be an integral part of New India's transformation.

We admire ASEAN's own progress. Born when Southeast Asia was a theatre of a brutal war and a region of uncertain nations, ASEAN has united 10 countries behind a common purpose and a shared future. We have the potential to pursue higher ambitions and address the challenges of our times: from infrastructure and urbanisation to resilient agriculture and a healthy planet. We can also use the power of digital technology, innovation and connectivity to transform lives at unprecedented speed and scale.

A future of hope needs a solid bedrock of peace. This is an age of change, disruptions and shifts that comes only rarely in history. ASEAN and India have immense opportunities -- indeed, enormous responsibility -- to chart a steady course through the uncertainty and turbulence of our times to a stable and peaceful future for our region and the world.

Indians have always looked East to see the nurturing sunrise and the light of opportunities. Now, as before, the East, or the Indo-Pacific Region, will be indispensable to India's future and our common destiny. The ASEAN-India partnership will play a defining role in both. And, in Delhi, ASEAN and India renewed their pledge for the journey ahead.

Your Excellency Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong 

Your Majesty,

Excellencies,

I am delighted to welcome you all to the ASEAN India Commemorative Summit.

Though we are celebrating 25 years of our partnership, our shared voyage goes back thousands of years.

 

It is a privilege for India to host all the ASEAN Leaders for the second time in five years. Tomorrow, you will be our honoured Guests at our Republic Day celebrations. The presence of my brothers and sisters from all our ASEAN partners at this joyous celebration is unprecedented.

 

Your collective presence here has also touched the hearts of my 1.25 billion fellow Indians.

It highlights the importance of our Strategic Partnership, placing ASEAN at the centre of India’s Act East Policy.

 

Our friendship has been nurtured by our shared cultural and civilizational linkages. The Ramayana, the ancient Indian epic, continues to be a valuable shared legacy in ASEAN and the Indian subcontinent. 

 

We have organised a Ramayana Festival with troupes from ASEAN countries, to showcase our common cultural treasure through this great epic. 

 

Other major religions, including Buddhism, also bind us closely. Islam, in many parts of South East Asia has distinctive Indian connections going back several centuries.

We have also jointly released a set of commemorative stamps, to celebrate our common heritage. 

 

Your Majesty, Excellencies, 

This Summit is the grand finale of our joint year-long commemorative activities, organized in India and in ASEAN countries, which provides us a valuable opportunity to review our journey so far and chart our future path. 

This objective, in my view, is best served through free and friendly discussion among us.

 

Your Majesty, Excellencies,

Since 1992, our partnership has evolved from sectoral dialogue to strategic partnership. Today, we have thirty sectoral dialogue mechanisms and seven ministerial level interactions, in addition to annual Summit meetings. 

We have made excellent progress in implementing the objectives of the ASEAN-India Partnership for Peace, Progress and Shared Prosperity, through five year plans of action. 

 

The progress in implementing our third Action Plan for the period 2016-2020 is commendable.

 

Capacity building projects have been undertaken through the ASEAN-India Cooperation Fund, the ASEAN-India Green Fund, and ASEAN-India Science and Technology Fund. 

 

Your Majesty, Excellencies, 

India shares ASEAN’s vision of peace and prosperity through a rules-based order for the oceans and seas. Respect for international law, notably UNCLOS is critical for this.

 

We remain committed to work with ASEAN to enhance practical cooperation and collaboration in our shared maritime domain. 

 

During the Retreat Session, we had an opportunity to discuss ASEAN-India cooperation in maritime domain, as one of the key focus areas for growth and development of the Indo-Pacific region. 

 

Indeed, Maritime cooperation has been an integral part of our discourse throughout our commemorative activities, with the theme resonating in the ASEAN India Connectivity Summit, in the Workshop on Blue Economy, as well as in regular dialogue mechanisms. 

 

Humanitarian and Disaster Relief efforts, Security cooperation, and Freedom of Navigation will be key focus areas for our Maritime cooperation.

 

The Connectivity Summit was also an affirmation of the linkages that India shares with ASEAN through land, air, maritime, cultural, civilizational and people-to-people relations that date back centuries.

 

Your Majesty, Excellencies, 

Information and Communications Technology will forge new bonds of digital connectivity among us. 

 

These could include new areas of cooperation in a regional high-capacity fiber optic network, and a national rural broadband networks to digitally connect remote areas. 

 

India offers to undertake a pilot project on rural connectivity, which would create digital villages in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam. Success of this project could be replicated in other ASEAN countries.

We also offer a training programme on Telecom and Networking Technologies, to share best practices in Policy, Regulation and Technological Development for Information and Communication Technology professionals from ASEAN countries. 

 

In order to deepen our understanding and cooperation in financial matters, I propose a dialogue on digital financial inclusion and investment promotion and infrastructure.

 

Combating terror financing jointly is yet another important area where we could work collectively.

 

Your Majesty, Excellencies, 

Our 70 billion dollars trade has grown 25 times over 25 years. Investments from ASEAN and India are robust  and growing.

 

We will continue to work with ASEAN to further enhance our trade ties, and facilitate interactions among our business community.

 

The success of recent events like the Business & Investment Meet and Expo, the ASEAN India Business Council Meeting, the Biznet Conference, the Start-up Festival and Hackathon and an ICT Expo have shown encouraging results. 

 

We hope that our Project Development Fund and Quick Impact Projects will help our companies integrate into regional value chains, particularly in textiles and garments, pharmaceuticals agro-processing and electronics. 

 

Your Majesty, Excellencies, 

People to people connectivity have been the foundation of our close ties for hundreds of years.

 

The Indian Diaspora has settled far and wide in Southeast Asia. They are warmly accepted in the local community.

 

Earlier this month, the ASEAN-India Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Singapore recognised their contribution in forging closer ties between us.

 

Held at the same time in New Delhi, in the first Conference of Members of Parliament and Mayors with Indian heritage, there was a large representation from ASEAN countries.

 

To build on our historical bonds, I propose that we declare 2019 as the ASEAN-India Year of Tourism. We could set up tangible and intangible cultural heritage circuits to further promote tourism.

The Buddhist Tourism circuit could be an important part of this to attract tourists and pilgrims from our region.

 

 

Your Majesty, Excellencies, 

India has participated in restoration works to historical structures which attest our enduring civilizational bonds.

 

It was a privilege for India to play a role in conservation works of temples in Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao PDR and Vietnam.

 

A virtual knowledge portal of ASEAN India network of Museums could curate this shared heritage.

 

An important focus of our commemorative events celebrates the power of our youth, our future. 

 

The Youth Summit, the Artist Residency, the Music Festival, and the Start Up Festival for digital commerce among our youth were intended for this. We have given a boost to their spirit by giving Youth Awards on 24th January. 

 

To further empower our youth in our region, I have the pleasure to announce 1000 Fellowships to students and researchers from ASEAN countries for studying integrated PhD programmes in Indian Institutes of Technology, India’s premier institutions of imparting knowledge.

 

We would also like to offer dedicated training courses at the Indian Academy of Highway Engineers for ASEAN Highway Professionals.

 

I also propose that we set up a network of Universities to encourage greater inter-university exchanges.

 

Your Majesty, Excellencies, 

In conclusion, let me again join my people in expressing our profound appreciation to each one of you for kindly accepting my invitation and for joining us at this Commemorative Summit.

 

I now invite Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore, His Excellency Lee Hsein Loong to please deliver the Opening Remarks in Singapore’s capacity as the ASEAN Chair for 2018 and the Co-Chair for this Plenary Session.

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has hailed the article by ASEAN Chair Singapore’s PM, Mr. Lee Hsien Loong.

 

PM Said, “A wonderful article by ASEAN Chair Singapore’s PM, Mr. Lee Hsien Loong. It beautifully covers the rich history, robust cooperation and promising future of India-ASEAN relations.”

 

The Visiting Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong in an op-ed titled, “Revive a millennial partnership: Singapore has played a major role in India’s closer integration with ASEAN” published in the Times of India today writes that the age old trade, commerce and cultural linkages between India and ASEAN have played a major role in giving a boost to the ties.

 

He writes that as we commemorate 25 years of ASEAN -India relations, India’s ties with southeast Asia date back more than 2,000 years. Ancient trade between India and countries such as Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand is well-documented. Southeast Asian cultures, traditions and languages have been profoundly influenced by these early linkages. We see Indic Hindu-Buddhist influences in historical sites such as the Angkor Temple Complex near Siem Reap in Cambodia, the Borobudor and Prambanan temples near Yogyakarta in Indonesia, and the ancient candis in Kedah in Malaysia. The Ramayana is embedded in many southeast Asian cultures, including in Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand. Singapore’s Malay name is Singapura, derived from Sanskrit and meaning ‘lion city’.

The visiting premier says that Singapore has always advocated India’s inclusion in the ASEAN community. India became an ASEAN Sectoral Dialogue Partner in 1992, a full ASEAN Dialogue Partner in 1995, and participated in the East Asia Summits (EAS) from 2005. The EAS is a key component of an open, inclusive and robust regional architecture, and the region’s main strategic leaders-led forum.

He adds that ASEAN-India relations were further elevated to a strategic partner­ship in 2012, the 20th anniversary of ASEAN-India relations. Today, ASEAN and India enjoy multi-faceted cooperation across ASEAN’s political-security, economic and socio-cultural pillars. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Act East’ policy and 3-C (Commerce, Connectivity, Culture) formula for strengthening engagement with ASEAN speaks to our broad-based cooperation. We have around 30 platforms for cooperation, including an annual Leaders’ Summit and seven Ministerial Dialogues. India has participated actively in ASEAN-led platforms including the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus, and the East Asia Summit.

Talking about the tare and commerce ties, he writes that with the ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA), ASEAN-India trade has risen steadily from $2.9 billion in 1993 to $58.4 billion in 2016. On the socio-cultural front, programs like the ASEAN-India Students Exchange Programs and the annual Delhi Dialogue foster closer people-to-people relations. Through these platforms, our youth, academics and businessmen get to meet, learn and deepen ties.

To mark this Silver Jubilee of ASEAN-India relations, both sides have held many commemorative activities. The recent Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Singapore recognized the contributions of the Indian diaspora. Today’s ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit marks the culmina­tion of these celebrations. It is an honour for all the ASEAN leaders to be in New Delhi for this occasion. ASEAN leaders are also deeply honoured to be invited as chief guests at tomorrow’s 69th Republic Day Parade.

The Singapore PM writes that Major global trends are reshaping the strategic outlook, presenting both challenges and opportunities. The strategic balance is shifting. Demographic, cultural and political changes are underway in many parts of the world. The consensus on globalization and free trade is fraying, but the Asian story continues to be a positive one. We need to push on with economic integration. We must also be resolute in dealing with emerging transboundary challenges, including terrorism, cybercrime and climate change.

According to the visiting premier this geopolitical uncertainty gives new impetus to ASEAN’s cooperation with key partners like India. ASEAN and India share common interests in peace and security in the region, and an open, balanced and inclusive regional architecture. India is located strategically along major sea-lanes from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. These sea lanes are also vital trade routes for many ASEAN member states. Both sides share an interest in preserving these vital maritime conduits of trade.

Mr. Lee Hsien Loong underlines the importance and strength of ASEAN and India’s combined population of 1.8 billion which represents one quarter of the world’s population. The combined GDP exceeds $4.5 trillion. According to him, by 2025, India’s consumer market is expected to become the fifth largest in the world, while in southeast Asia middle-class house­holds will double to 163 million. Both regions are also experiencing a demographic dividend – 60% of ASEAN’s population is below 35 years old, while India is projected to be the world’s youngest country with an average age of 29 by 2020. ASEAN and India also have fast-growing internet user bases, which will help us grow the digital economy. Against this backdrop, there is still much scope to grow India-AEAN ties – India accounted for only 2.6% of ASEAN’s external trade in 2016.

The visiting premier has suggested three promising areas of mutually beneficial collaboration.

First, ASEAN and India should redouble efforts to promote trade and investment. We need to keep existing pathways up to date and relevant, including the AIFTA. We should work together to conclude a high quality Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), surpassing the existing AIFTA. This would create an integrated Asian market comprising nearly half the world’s population and a third of the world’s GDP. Stream­lining rules and regulations will stimulate investments in both directions, complement India’s ‘Act East’ policy and facilitate ‘Made in India’ exports to the region.

Second, our people will benefit greatly from greater land, air and maritime connectivity. He has appreciated India’s efforts to improve land connectivity, including the extension of the trilateral India-Myanmar-Thailand Highway, and India’s $1 billion line of credit to promote infrastructure connectivity with ASEAN. He adds that ASEAN looks forward to working closely with India to boost our physical connectivity, including by expeditiously concluding the ASEAN-India Air Transport Agreement. This will enhance people-to-people flows across the region and help both Indian and ASEAN carriers tap new and emerging markets, especially for business, investment and tourism.

Digital connectivity is another important area of cooperation, and can shape people-to-people connections for the future. India’s Aadhaar system creates many new opportunities, for instance, to harmonize India-ASEAN Fintech platforms or connect e-payment systems.

Mr. Mr. Lee Hsien Loong says that India and ASEAN continue to look for new synergies. One objective of Singapore’s chairmanship is to develop an ASEAN Smart Cities Network, and here Singapore and India are natural partners. India is rapidly urbanizing and has set itself a goal of establishing 100 smart cities. Singapore, an urbanized city-state, is ready to partner India on this journey and help develop urban solutions based on our own experience. Andhra Pradesh’s new capital city of Amaravati is one example.

The Singapore PM sums up his op-ed saying that as ASEAN chair, Singapore is committed to deepening ASEAN-India ties. If both sides use our historical and cultural links to tackle today’s challenges and build bridges for the future, our youth and next generation stand to gain the most.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today presented the National Bravery Awards to 18 children. Three of these awards were presented posthumously.
Interacting with the awardees, the Prime Minister said their deeds of bravery are discussed extensively, and also highlighted by the media. Therefore, he added, they inspire other children, and often engender a sense of self-confidence among other children.

The Prime Minister remarked that most of the awardees are from rural and humble backgrounds. He said that perhaps their daily struggles had helped instil resilience in them, to deal courageously in adverse situations.

The Prime Minister congratulated all the award winners, their parents and schoolteachers. He also appreciated those, who recorded their instances of bravery, and helped draw attention to them.

Shri Narendra Modi said that after such recognition, future expectations from the awardees become higher than usual. He wished them well in their future endeavours.

The Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Gandhi, was present on the occasion.

Honourable Heads of State and Government,

Mr. Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum,

Senior and reputable entrepreneurs, industrialists and CEOs of the world,

Friends from Media, ladies and gentlemen!

 

Namaskar,

 

I am very happy to be present in this forty-eighth annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos. First of all, I would like to appreciate Mr. Klaus Schwab for his initiative and for making the World Economic Forum a strong and a comprehensive forum. He has an ambitious agenda whose purpose is to improve the condition of the world. He has linked this agenda very firmly to economic and political thought. I also want to express my gratitude to the Government of Switzerland and its citizens for the warm welcome and hospitality extended to me.

 

Friends,


The last Prime Minister of India to have visited Davos was Shri Deve Gowda ji in 1997. In 1997, India's GDP was slightly over 400 billion dollars. Now it has increased almost 6 times after two decades. That year the subject of this forum was ""Building a Networked Society"". Today, 21 years later, the subject has become outdated considering the achievements in the field of technology in this digital age. Today we are not only a networked society, but also living in the age of big data, artificial intelligence and Cobots. In 1997, the EURO currency was not in vogue; the Asian financial crisis was not known at all, neither was BREXIT expected. In 1997, very few people had heard of Osama bin Laden and the name of Harry Potter was also unknown. At that time the chess players did not have any big fear of losing to a computer while Google was not there in cyber space and Amazon of that time meant only dense forests and river.

Tweeting that time was the task of the birds, not humans. That was the previous century.

 

Today, after two decades, our world and our society are in a complex network. In that era, Davos was ahead of its time, and this World Economic Forum was a symbol of a futuristic entity. Even today Davos is ahead of its time.
This year's theme is ""Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World"". That is, building a shared future in a world full of rifts. With newer changes, the balance of economic power and political power is changing. This shows the image of far-reaching changes in the world arena. There are new and serious challenges to peace, stability and security in front of the world.

Technology driven transformation is deeply impacting our lifestyle, work-style, dealing with issues, conversation and even international groupings, politics and economy. One of the greatest examples of the three dimensions of a Technology viz. connecting, bending and breaking -  are found in the use of social media. Today Data is the greatest asset. Both opportunities as well as the biggest challenges are being created by the global flow of data. Mountains of data are being created. There is a race to control them because it is believed that the controller of data will dominate the future.

 

Similarly, the rapidly changing technology and expansion of destructive forces in the areas of cyber security and nuclear security have become even more serious. On the one hand, the new branches of science, technology and economic progress, have the ability of showing new ways of prosperity to the humanity. On the other hand, these changes have also created fault-lines that can possibly be harmful. Many changes are creating such walls which have made the path of peace and prosperity inaccessible and difficult for the entire humanity. These fractures, these divides and these barriers are the manifestations of lack of development, of poverty, unemployment, lack of opportunities, and monopoly on natural and technical resources. In this environment we have several important questions that demand proper answers for the future of humanity and the heritage of future generations.


Is our world system promoting these fault-lines and distances? Which are those forces that promote separation over unity and promote struggle or conflicts over cooperation? And what are the tools we have? What are the paths through which we can erase these cracks and distances and fulfill the dream of a happy and a shared future?


Friends,

 

As a representative of India, Indianism and Indian heritage, the topic of this forum for me is the contemporary yet time-transcending. It is eternal because in India we have always believed in uniting human beings from time immemorial, not in breaking relations or dividing them. Thousands of years ago, the Indian thinkers said in Sanskrit texts: ""Vasudhaiva kutumbakam"", meaning that the whole world is a family. All of us are bound together as a family; our destinies connect us with a common thread. This perception of Kutumbakam is definitely more meaningful to narrow the distances today. But one of the serious challenges of this era is the lack of consensus between us to deal with these challenges. In a family, even if there are some differences and quarrels, there is a sense of harmony and cooperation; the sense of inspiration comes from the family whenever there are challenges. All the members come together and face the challenges and together they share achievements and pleasures. But one matter of concern today is that our differences have made the struggles of the mankind against these challenges even more difficult.


Friends,

The number of challenges I am pointing to is also very high and widespread. Here I will mention only three major challenges which are creating the biggest threat to human civilization. The first danger is Climate Change. Glaciers are retreating. Arctic ice is melting. Many islands have submerged or are in that process. The impact of extreme weather conditions is increasing day by day - extreme heat and extreme cold conditions; heavy rainfall and floods on one hand and droughts on the other. Under these circumstances we should have come out of our limited narrow divisions to get united. But did that happen? If not, then why? And what should we do to improve these conditions? Everyone says that carbon emission should be reduced but how many countries or people want to help out in providing the necessary resources and appropriate technology to the developing countries and communities?

 

You would have heard many times about deep synergy with nature in the Indian tradition. Thousands of years ago, in our scriptures, the mankind was told – ""Bhoomi Maata, Putro aham Prithvyaha "" i.e., we the humans are children of the Mother Earth. If we are the children of Mother Earth, then why is there a war between man and nature today? 


In the beginning of the most prominent Upanishad 'Ishopanishad', written in India thousands of years ago, the author, 'Tatvadrasta Guru' had told his disciples about the changing world:

 

‘तेन त्यक्तेन भुन्जीथा, मागृधःकस्यस्विद्धनम्।

That is, by perceiving Divine presence everywhere, renounce the unreal and enjoy the Real. Do not covet the wealth of any man. Buddha gave a prominent place to the virtue of ‘Aparigraha’ which means use according to the needs (non-greediness), in his principles. The principle of trusteeship of Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, was also the same- ‘consumption as per requirement’. He had opposed the exploitation due to greed. One should ponder over the fact that how man has reached at a point where he has started the exploitation of the nature for satiating his greed from a point where he used to sacrifice and consume only as per his needs. Is this our development or collapse? Such a poor state of mind! A horrific peek inside our self-interest! Why don’t we introspect?
There is an absolute remedy against the fierce mismanagement of the environment today - the reconciliation between ancient Indian philosophy of human and nature. Moreover, the overall understanding of Indian traditions such as Yoga and Ayurveda, born from this philosophy, can not only heal the environment and fracture between us, but also provide physical, mental and spiritual health and balance. A massive campaign has been initiated by my government to save the environment and to counter climate change. By 2022 we have to produce 175 Gigawatt renewable energy in India. In the last three years, we have achieved 60GW which is more than one-third of the target.

In 2016, India and France had jointly envisioned a new international treaty based organization. This revolutionary step has now changed into a successful experiment. As an International Solar Alliance, it is now a reality after the necessary Treaty ratification. I am happy that in March this year, French President Emmanuel Macron and leaders of the member countries of the Alliance will participate in the first summit of the Alliance on my joint invitation, in New Delhi.
 

Friends,

 

The second major challenge is terrorism. In this regard, you are well aware of the growing and changing nature of this serious threat to India and to the entire humanity in the world. I want to draw your attention to just two dimensions here. First, the artificial distinctions created between good terrorist and bad terrorist is even more dangerous.  The second serious aspect on which I want your attention is that today the educated and accomplished youth are radicalized and getting involved in terrorism. I hope that the serious challenges posed by the fault lines of terrorism and violence and the fractures generated by them, and their solutions will be discussed in the forum.

 

Friends,

The third challenge is that many societies and countries are becoming more and more self-centered. It creates an impression that globalization is shrinking. The consequences of such attitudes and wrong priorities cannot be underestimated by the threat of climate change or terrorism. Although everyone talks about the interconnected world but the glow of globalization is fading. The ideals of the United Nations are still valid. World Trade Organization is also broad-based. But do the structure, system and methodology of the world organizations formed after the Second World War still reflect the aspirations and dreams of today's humanity and today's reality?


There is a big gap between the old system of these institutions and the needs of the developing countries especially in the world today. Contrary to globalization, the forces of protectionism have emerged. Their intent is to not only avoid globalization but also to turn the trend of the natural flow of globalization. As a result, new types of tariffs and non-tariff barriers are seen. Bilateral and multilateral trade agreements and negotiations have been stalled. Cross-border financial investment has decreased in many countries. And the growth of global supply chains has also stopped. The solution to this worrisome situation against globalization is not to remain in isolation. Its solution is to understand and accept the change. It is time to make smart and flexible policies with changing times. The Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi had said, ""I do not want the walls and windows of my house closed on all the sides. I want the air of the cultures of all the countries to come to my house easily. But I don’t want this wind to destabilize my feet."" Today's India is following Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy and ideas with full confidence and fearlessness, and is welcoming lively waves from all over the world.


Friends, India's democracy is the basis of the country's stability, certainty and sustainable development. Democracy is not just a political system but a life’s philosophy, life style, with different religions, culture, language, dressing-style and variety of food. We Indians know the importance of democratic environment and freedom for the maintenance of unity in diversity very well. Democracy in India does not only sustain our diversity but also provides the necessary environment, road map and template to fulfill the hopes, aspirations, expectations and dreams of more than 125 crore Indians for their proper development.

 

Democratic value and inclusive economic development and progress have the power to bridge all the rifts. For the first time in 2014, a single political party has been given a full majority by sixty crore voters in India to form government in the center. We resolved not to develop just a single class or a few people, but everyone. My government has a motto: ""Sabka sath sabka vikas’ i.e.’collective efforts, inclusive growth.’ Our vision and mission for progress are inclusive. This inclusive philosophy is the basis of every policy of my government -  be it financial inclusion for millions of people by opening bank accounts for the first time, or bringing digital technology to the poor by direct benefit transfer or promotion of gender justice through 'Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao'.

 

We believe that progress or development can happen in true sense only when everyone walks together. These are not minor reforms that we are making in our economic and social policies, but a radical transformation. The path we have chosen is that of ‘reform, perform and transform’. Today, the way we are making the Indian economy suitable for investment, there is no match to it. Consequently, today, investing in India, traveling to India, working in India, manufacturing in India, and exporting  products and services from India to the world, everything has become much easier than before. We have tried to get rid of license-permit raj. By removing the red tape we are laying the red carpet. Almost all sectors of the economy are open for Foreign Direct Investment. More than 90 per cent of the investment from automatic route is possible. The Central and State Governments have done hundreds of reforms. We have eliminated over 1,400 old laws, which were posing as hurdle in business, in the administration, and were the cause of worry in the life of the common man.
For the first time in 70 years of independent India's history, an integrated tax system has been implemented in the form of Goods and Service Tax - GST. We are using technology to increase transparency and accountability. Our commitments to transform India and our efforts have been welcomed by the business community around the world. In India, democracy, demography and dynamism are shaping development and destiny. The decades of control had suppressed the capabilities of the people and the youth of India. But now, the bold policy decisions of our government and effective steps have changed the circumstances. In the short span of less than three and- a-half years, the long-term and major changes that have taken place in India and are happening are the successes of the 125 crore Indians' expectations, their foresight and ability to accept the change. Now the people of India, young people of India are capable of building a 5 trillion dollar economy in 2025.


Moreover, you can imagine that when they become job-givers rather than job-seekers through innovation and entrepreneurship, several avenues will be opened for the country and for your business. You all are the world’s leaders, and you are familiar with the changes in the world, the improvement in ranking and ratings of India, and our way ahead. But more importantly, the people of India have welcomed our policies and new initiatives for a changing future and these are golden signals of a good future. Voluntary giving up of subsidy and expressing their faith in our policies and reforms by democratic methods such as elections - Such evidences confirm the widespread support for these unprecedented changes in India.

 

Friends,

Looking at all these fault-lines in the world, it is imperative that we pay attention to several directions for our shared future. First of all there should be a link and cooperation between the world's greatest forces. The competition among the major countries of the world should not be a barrier against one another. To counter the shared challenges, we have to work together with a strong vision forgetting our differences and working together. Secondly, adherence to the international rules and regulations has become more important than ever at a time when we are going through a period of uncertainty due to the changing world order. The third important point is that there is a great need to improve the world's major political, economic and security related institutions. They should be promoted in accordance with the situation of participation and democratization today. The fourth important thing is that we need to accelerate the economic progress of the world. The recent signs for economic growth in the world are encouraging. Technology and digital revolution increase the likelihood of finding new solutions to age-old problems and challenges like poverty and unemployment.
 

Friends,

In such efforts, India has always extended her support. Not only from today, not from the time of its independence, but since ancient times has India been able to cooperate with everyone in facing the challenges. In the last century, when the world went through a crisis of two world wars, despite having no personal interest, economic or territorial interests, India stood for the protection of high ideals of peace and humanity. More than 1.5 lakh Indian soldiers sacrificed their lives. These are the same ideals for which India has contributed the largest number of soldiers in UN peacekeeping operations since the establishment of United Nations. These are the same ideals that motivate us to help our neighbours, allied nations and human beings during crisis and natural calamities. Whether there is an earthquake in Nepal, or floods, hurricanes, or any other natural disasters in our neighboring or friendly countries, India considers it as the  most sacred duty to help as a first responder. In Yemen, when the flames of violence started to grip the citizens of several countries, we did not only save Indians but also more than 2,000 civilians from other countries. Despite being a developing country herself, India has been collaborating in capacity building and development cooperation. Be it a country of Africa or a neighbour of India, or a country of South East Asia, or of Pacific Islands, our collaboration framework and our projects are based on the priorities and needs of those countries.

 

Friends,

India does not have any political or geographical ambitions. We do not exploit the natural resources of any country but rather develop it together for that country. The direct result of the cordial coexistence of diversity on the Indian soil for thousands of years is that we believe in multi-cultural world and in multi-polar world order. India has proved that all disputes and differences can be resolved through democracy, respect for diversity, harmony and co-ordination, cooperation and dialogue. This is India's tested recipe for peace, stability and development. Moreover, a predictable, stable, transparent and progressive India will continue to be the good news in an otherwise state of uncertainty and flux. An India where enormous diversity exists harmoniously will be a unifying and harmonizing force. The Indian sages and Munis, from the ancient times used to say, not for India specifically or the Indian psyche:  - “Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinaha Sarve Santu Niramayaha, Sarve Bhadrani Pashyantu ma kaschid dukh bhag bhavet"" meaning, ‘all should be happy, all should be healthy, be good to everyone and do not get any sorrow’ - this is the dream. And the ideal way to realize this dream is also shown:


सहनाऽवतु, सह नौ भुनक्तु सह वीर्यं करवावहे।

तेजस्विनाधीतमस्तु मा विद्विषावहे।


This thousand year old Indian prayer means that we all should work together, walk together, our talents bloom together and the feeling of jealousy should never enter within us. The great Indian poet and Nobel laureate of last century, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, had envisaged a ‘heaven of freedom’ ""where the world has not broken up in fragments by narrow domestic walls."" Let us together create such a ‘heaven of freedom’ where there is cooperation and coordination, and not rifts and fractures. Let us all together help the world get rid of these fault lines and unnecessary walls.

 

Friends,

India and Indians have considered the whole world as a family. Thirty million people of Indian origin are living in different countries. When we consider the whole world as our family, then we Indians too are the family of the world. I invite you all to work in India. If you want Wealth with Wellness, work in India; if you want Peace with Prosperity, live in India; if you want Wealth with Wholesome life, be in India. If you come to India, you will always be welcomed. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart for giving me this valuable opportunity to interact with all of you. I thank the World Economic Forum, Mr. Klaus Schwab and all of you!

                Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s departure statement prior to his visit to Davos.

“I look forward to my first visit to the World Economic Forum at Davos, at the invitation of India’s good friend and Founder of the WEF, Prof Klaus Schwab. The theme of the Forum, “Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World” is both thoughtful and apt.  

 

The existing and emerging challenges to the contemporary international system and global governance architecture deserve serious attention of leaders, governments, policy makers, corporates and civil societies around the world.  

 

In recent years, India’s engagement with the outside world has become truly and effectively multi-dimensional covering the political, economic, people to people, security and other spheres.  

 

At Davos, I look forward to sharing my vision for India’s future engagement with the international community.  

 

Apart from the events for the World Economic Forum, I look forward to my separate bilateral meetings with the President of the Swiss Confederation H. E. Mr. Alain_Berset and Prime Minister of Sweden H. E. Mr. Stefan Lofven.  

 

I am confident that these bilateral meetings would be fruitful and give a boost to our relations with these countries and further strengthen economic engagement”.

                His Excellency, इजराइल के प्रधानमंत्री श्रीमान बेंजामिन नेतन्याहू, श्रीमति सारा नेतन्‍याहू, गुजरात के मुख्‍यमंत्री श्रीमान विजय रूपाणी जी, उपमुख्‍यमंत्री श्री नितिन पटेल जी, iCrate से जुड़े हुए तमाम intellectual, innovators, research scholars, अधिकारीगण और यहां उपस्थित भाइयो और बहनों और मेरे नौजवान दोस्‍तों।

मुझे खुशी है कि आज इजराइल के प्रधानमंत्री की उपस्थि‍ति में देश के नौजवान innovators को समर्पित इस संस्‍थान का लोकार्पण हो रहा है। मैं श्री नेतन्याहू का बहुत आभारी हूं। उन्‍होंने गुजरात आने का निमंत्रण स्‍वीकार किया और परिवार के साथ आए। इस कार्यक्रम से यहां आने से पहले हम साबरमती आश्रम गए थे, जहां पूज्‍य बापू को श्रद्धांजलि देने का अवसर मिला। पंतग उड़ाने का भी अवसर मिला।

जब मैं पिछले साल इजराइल गया था, तभी ये मन बना लिया था- इस संस्‍था का इजराइल के साथ और मजबूत संबंध होना चाहिए; और तब से ही मैं मेरे मित्र श्री नेतन्याहू के भारत आने का इंतजार कर रहा था। मुझे खुशी है कि वो न सिर्फ गुजरात आए बल्कि आज हम उनकी उपस्थिति में इस संस्‍था के कैम्‍पस का लोकार्पण कर रहे हैं। मैं श्री  नेतन्याहू और उनके साथ आए delegation के अन्‍य सदस्‍यों का एक बार फिर से स्‍वागत करता हूं और उनका आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं।

आज जब हम iCreate का लोकर्पण कर रहे हैं तो मैं स्‍वर्गीय प्रोफेसर एन.वी.वसानी को याद करना चाहूंगा। मुझे बराबर याद है कि जब यहां iCreate की कल्‍पना की गई तो उसको मूर्तरूप देने की जिम्‍मेदारी प्रारंभ में प्रोफेसर वसानी के पास आई थी। लेकिन दुर्भाग्‍य से लंबे अर्से तक वे unconscious रहे, हमें छोड़कर चले गए। आज वो हमारे बीच में नहीं हैं, लेकिन प्रारंभिक काल में उनका जो प्रयास था और बाद में कारवां जुड़ता गया कि आज हम सब iCreate को इस भव्‍य रूप में देख पा रहे हैं।

किसान एक छोटा सा पौधा बोता है तो आने वाली कई पीढ़ियां उस विशाल वृक्ष के फल पाती रहती हैं और किसान की आत्‍मा जहां कहीं भी होती है, यह देखकर निश्चित रूप से आनंदित होती है। आज iCreate के लोकार्पण पर हम सबको उसी खुशी का अनुभव हो रहा है कि जो एक बीज बोया था, आज वटवृक्ष के रूप में उभर करके आया है।

किसी Institution का महत्‍व उसके जन्‍म के समय नहीं आंका जा सकता है। हम सब जानते हैं कि आज भारत ही नहीं, पूरे विश्‍व में pharmaceutical क्षेत्र में गुजरात का नाम है, गुजरातियों का नाम है। पर बहुत कम लोगों को इसका background मालूम होगा। आज से लगभग 50-60 साल पहले अहमदाबाद के कुछ visionary उद्यो‍गपतियों के प्रयास से एक pharmacy college  प्रारंभ हुई था, उसकी शुरूआत हुई थी; और वो देश का पहला pharmacy college था। और उस pharmacy college ने अहमदाबाद और पूरे गुजरात में pharmacy के क्षेत्र में एक मजबूत Eco system खड़ा कर दिया। हम सब यही अपेक्षा iCreate और यहां से निकलने वाले मेरे नौजवानों से, विद्यार्थियों से आज देश अपेक्षा रखता है कि वो innovation के क्षेत्र में भारत का नाम पूरे विश्‍व में रोशन करेंगे।

मुझे याद है जब कुछ वर्ष पहले iCreate को launch किया था तो उस समय भी मैंने कहा था कि इजराइल को iCreate से जोड़ना चाहता हूं। मेरा मकसद यही था कि इजराइल के अनुभव का फायदा, उसके Startup Environment का लाभ इस संस्‍था को, देश के नौजवानों को मिले। इजराइल की technology एवं creativity पूरे विश्‍व को प्रभावित करती है; खास करके ऐसे क्षेत्र जो भारत की आवश्‍यकताओं से जुड़े हैं, उनमें इजराइल के साथ का फायदा भारत के innovators भी उठा सकते हैं।

Water conservation, agriculture production, agriculture products का लंबे समय तक रख-रखाव, food processing, रेगिस्‍तान की ओर कम पानी वाले इलाकों में खेती, Cyber security - ऐसे कितने ही विषय हैं, जिनमें भारत और इजराइल की साझेदारी हो सकती है।

साथियो, इजराइल के लोगों ने पूरी दुनिया में साबित किया है कि देश का आकार नहीं, देशवासियों की संकल्‍प देश को आगे ले जाता है, उपर उठाता है।

मुझे एक बार इजराइल के पूर्व राष्‍ट्रपति और महान स्‍टेटमैन, श्रीमान शिमॉन पेरेज से मिलने का सौभाग्‍य प्राप्‍त हुआ था और उनकी एक बात मुझे आज भी याद है। श्रीमान शिमॉन पेरेज कहते थे, ‘We will prove that innovation has no limits and no barriers. Innovation enable dialogue between nation and between people. उनकी ये बात आज 100 प्रतिशत सच साबित हुई है। भारत और इजराइल के लोगों को और करीब लाने में innovation की बहुत बड़ी भूमिका है।

भाइयो और बहनों, श्रीमान शिमॉन पेरेज की कही एक और बात को मैं आज दोहराना चाहता हूं। वो कहते थे, “The greater the dream the more spectacular the results”. जितने बड़े सपने होंगे उतने ही बड़े नतीजे होंगे।  इजराइल की यही सोच Noble Prize के साथ उसकी Chemistry को मजबूत करती है। इजराइल के वैज्ञानिकों को अलग-अलग क्षेत्रों से मिले नोबेल पुरस्‍कार इस बात के गवाह हैं।

भाइयो और बहनों, मशहूर वैज्ञानिक अलबर्ट आइंस्‍टाइन का उतना ही मशहूर कथन है- “Imagination is more important than knowledge”. ये Imagination- ये सपने, ये कल्‍पना ही हमें नई बुलंदियों पर ले जाती है। इन सपनों को, और इन सपनों को ही कभी भी मरने नहीं देना है। इन सपनों को कभी थमने नहीं देना है। बच्‍चों की curiosity के पोषण की जिम्‍मेदारी हम सबकी है। संकोच, ये innovation का दुश्‍मन है। आप अपने आसपास छोटे बच्‍चों को ध्‍यान से देखें। यदि आप उनको कहें कि जल्‍दी सोना चाहिए, वो तुरंत पूछते हैं, क्‍यों सोना चाहिए? यदि आप उनको कहें कि मुझे ये संगीत पसंद है तो वो तुरंत पूछते हैं, आपको ये संगीत पसंद क्‍यों है? एक बार गणित की एक क्‍लास में अध्‍यापक ने समझाया कि यदि तीन फल हैं और तीन छात्रों को दिए जाएं तो प्रत्‍येक को एक फल मिलेगा, और यदि छह फल हैं और छह छात्रों को दिए जाएं, तो भी प्रत्‍येक को एक फल मिलेगा। फिर टीचर ने कहा कि मतलब जितने फल हों उतने ही छात्र हों तो प्रत्‍येक को एक फल मिलेगा। तभी एक छात्र खड़ा हुआ और उसने टीचर की आंख में आंख मिला करके उनसे पूछा कि यदि फल भी जीरो है और छात्र भी जीरो है तो भी क्‍या प्रत्‍येक छात्र को एक फल मिलेगा? यह सुन करके पूरी क्‍लास हंसने लग गई। टीचर भी उस बच्‍चे को देखने लग गए। लेकिन आपको जानकर खुशी होगी वो बच्‍चा और कोई नहीं था। कहते हैं कि वह छात्र गणित के ज्ञाता, महान ज्ञाता, श्रीनिवास रामानुजम था और उस एक प्रश्‍न ने गणित के एक महत्‍वपूर्ण सवाल को स्‍पष्‍ट किया था कि क्‍या जीरो को जीरो से divide करें तो उत्तर एक हो सकता है क्‍या?

हमारे युवाओं के पास एनर्जी भी है, enthusiasm भी है। उनको चाहिए कि थोड़ा सा encouragement, थोड़ी सी mentorship, थोड़ा सा network, थोड़ा सा institutional support. जब ये थोड़ा-थोड़ा युवाओं के innovation से मिलता है तो बड़े-बड़े परिणाम आना निश्चित होता है। आज हम देश में पूरे सिस्‍टम को innovation फ्रेंडली  बनाने की दिशा में काम कर रहे हैं। हमारा मंत्र है- curiosity से जन्‍मे Intent,  Intent की ताकत से बने Ideas,   Ideas की ताकत से हो innovation और innovation की ताकत से बने हमारा New India.

साथियो, हर व्‍यक्ति के मन में, हर नौजवान के मन में कुछ न कुछ नया करने की, innovative करने की इच्‍छा होती है। उसके मन में विचार आते हैं और चले जाते हैं। जो विचार आते हैं वो आपकी संपत्ति है। लेकिन उन विचारों का जाना, खो जाना, किसी धरातल पर नहीं उतरना; मैं समझता हूं वो समाज की, सरकार की, व्‍यवस्‍था की कमी है। मैं इसी व्‍यवस्‍था को बदल रहा हूं। नौजवानों के विचार यूं ही खत्‍म न हो जाएं,  इसे देखना हम सभी का दायित्‍व है। नौजवानों अपने सपने सच कर सकें, अपनी शक्ति का परिचय पूरे विश्‍व को दे सकें और इसके लिए मददगार संस्‍थाएं खड़ी करना, ये सरकार की और समाज की जिम्‍मेदारी है। इसी सोच के साथ इस iCreate का जन्‍म हुआ है।

मुझे खुशी है कि iCreate ने देश के नौजवानों को उनके सपने पूरे करने में, उनके innovative ideas को साकार करने में बहुत बड़ी मदद दी है। iCreate के innovative products के बारे में जब मैंने जाना, आज देखा भी, मुझे बहुत प्रसन्‍नता हो रही है। मुझे बताया गया है कि Bio scan labour अड्डा, spectrums part,  Icon जैसे अनेक innovations, iCreate की मदद से संभव हो पाए हैं और सफलता की पहली शर्त होती है- साहस। जो साहस कर सकता है वो कोई भी निर्णय ले सकता है। आप सहमत हैं न मेरी बात से? सहमत हैं ना नौजवान? अगर साहस नहीं है तो निर्णय नहीं कर पाता इंसान। iCreate के माध्‍यम से innovation कर रहे साहसी युवाओं को मैं बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूं।

Convention और innovation के बीच हमेशा खींचातानी रहती है। जब भी कोई कुछ नया करना चाहता है तो एक वर्ग उसका मजाक उड़ाता है, विरोध करता है। अधिकतर लोग कालीदास के ‘मेघदूत’ और ‘शकुन्‍तला’ के बारे में तो जानते हैं लेकिन बहुत कम लोगों को मालूम होगा कि कालीदास ने Convention और innovation के बारे में एक मजेदार बात कही है- माल विक्रागिनमित्रम्- जो उन्‍होंने लिखा है। उस माल विक्रागि मित्रम् में कालीदास जी ने कहा है- 

पुराणमित्‍येव न साधु सर्वं न च‍पि काव्‍यं नवमित्‍यवद्यम्।

सन्त: परीक्ष्‍यान्‍यतरद्भजन्‍ते मूढ़: परप्रत्‍ययनेयबुद्धि:।।

अर्थात् केवल इसलिए कोई चीज पुरानी है, आवश्‍यक नहीं है कि वो अच्‍छी होगी। इसी प्रकार कोई चीज नई है तो जरूरी नहीं कि वह बुरी होगी। बुद्धिमान व्‍यक्ति हर चीज को गुणों के आधार पर तोलता है और मूर्ख दूसरों के कहने के आधार पर अपना मन बनाता है। सदियों पहले कालीदास ये कहके गए हैं, और कितने सुदंर तरीके से कालीदास ने convention और innovation के बीच की खींचतान का समाधान दिया है।

साथियो, ये हमारे वैज्ञानिकों की क्षमता है कि जितने रुपये में Hollywood में science fiction की फिल्‍म बनती है, उससे भी कम राशि में real मंगलयान real मंगल ग्रह पर भी पहुंचा जाता है, ये हमारे वैज्ञानिकों ने सिद्ध किया है। अभी चार दिन पहले ही इसरो ने Satellite launching में सेंचुरी बनाई है, और ऐसी कामयाबी ऐसे नहीं आती है। इसके पीछे जो dedication चाहिए, परिश्रम चाहिए, जो सपनों की ऊंची उड़ान चाहिए, वो ऊर्जा भारतीय नौजवानों में कूट-कूट करके भरी हुई है और ये मैं दिन-रात अनुभव करता हूं।  

भाइयो और बहनों, आपने देखा है iCreate का जो ‘I’ है वो small letter में है। जब iCreate का नाम तय हो रहा था तो ‘I’ को छोटा क्‍यों रखा, इसके पीछे भी एक वजह है। साथियो, creativity की सबसे बड़ी रुकावट होती है ‘I’ का बड़ा होना। Creativity के साथ अगर ‘I’ capital है, बड़ा है, तो उसका मतलब है अहम् और अहंकार आड़े आ रहा है और इसलिए शुरूआत से ही इस संस्‍था को, यहां की creativity को अहम् और अहंकार से मुक्‍त रखा गया है। लेकिन इसमें एक बात और महत्‍पूर्ण थी। Creativity की शुरूआत छोटे ‘i’ से हुई लेकिन सपना बड़े ‘I’ का रखा, यानी individual  से शुरू करके I से India तक पहुंचना। हमारा लक्ष्‍य था छोटे ‘i’ से बड़े ‘I’ तक बहुत बड़ा jump लगाना। एक इंसान से शुरू करके पूरे हिन्‍दुस्‍तान तक फैल जाना।

आज आवश्‍यकता है कि हमारे युवा देश के सामने खड़ी समस्‍याओं से मुक्ति के लिए innovation करें। निर्वेज innovation होना चाहिए। सामान्‍य मानवी की quality of life को कम से कम खर्च में कैसे improve किया जा सकता है, इसके लिए innovate करें। अगर मलेरिया खतरा है तो हम innovate करें- मलेरिया से गरीब से गरीब परिवार कैसे बचें? ऐसी कौन सी व्‍यवस्‍था खड़ी करें? अगर टीबी से परेशानी है, अगर सीकल-सेल से परेशानी है, अगर गंदगी से परेशानी है। हम wastage देख रहे हैं, खाने का wastage देख रहे हैं, कृषि उत्‍पादन का wastage देख रहे हैं। मैं समझता हूं इन समस्‍याओं के समाधान के लिए innovation होने चाहिए।

आज देश में स्‍वच्‍छ भारत का एक बहुत बड़ा अभियान चल रहा है। स्‍वच्‍छता को लेकर क्‍या हम नए-नए innovation कर सकते हैं? Waste to wealth, इस एक विषय में innovation की अपार संभावनाएं हैं। देश में innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship और technology की बढ़ोत्तरी के लिए इस तरह का vision और icreate जैसी समर्पित संस्‍थाओं की देश को बहुत जरूरत है।

इसी को ध्‍यान में रखते हुए केंद्रीय स्‍तर पर Startup India, Standup India , MUDRA जैसी अनेक योजनाएं चलाई जा रही हैं।  सरकार ने Atal Innovation Mission के तहत देश भर में 2,400 से ज्‍यादा Atal tinkering labs को भी मंजूरी दी है। हमारा प्रयास है कि स्‍कूली विद्यार्थियों में भी जो innovative ideas हैं, उन्‍हें पूरा करने के लिए आधुनिक परिवेश में नए experiment करने के लिए देशभर में एक platform तैयार हो।

पिछले साल मेरी इजराइल की यात्रा के दौरान हमने 40 million US Dollar का एक फंड भी स्‍थापित किया जो भारत एवं इस्ररायल का एक joint venture होगा। इससे दोनों देशों के talent को technology innovation की दिशा में कुछ नया करने में मदद मिलेगी। इस joint venture में खाद्यान्‍न, पानी, health care तथा ऊर्जा के क्षेत्र पर विशेष ध्‍यान दिया जाएगा। हमने innovation bridge की भी परिकल्‍पना की। जिसके तहत दोनों देशों के Startup के बीच exchange होता रहे।

मुझे खुशी है इस प्रक्रिया के दौरान innovation challenge के माध्‍यम से कुछ विजेता चुने गए और आज उन्‍हें Startup award भी दिए गए हैं। अभी आपने देखा- इजराइल की टीम और भारत की टीम- दोनों यहां अभी मंच पर आए थे। India- Israel innovation bridge एक online platform है। आने वाले दिनों में दोनों देशों के Startup के बीच ये बहुत बड़े connection के रूप में उभरेगा।

दो दिन पहले जब दिल्‍ली में दोनों देशों के CEOs की बैठक हो रही थी, तब वहां भी हमने इस प्रयास को समर्थन देने को कहा था। साथियों भारत के पास अथाह सामुद्रिक शक्ति है। 7,500 किलोमीटर से ज्यादा लंबा हमारा समुद्री तट, 1,300 के करीब छोटे-बड़े द्वीप और कुछ द्वीप तो सिंगापुर से भी बड़े हैं। लगभग 25 लाख स्‍क्‍वायर किलोमीटर का exclusive economic zone - ये हमारी एक ऐसी ताकत है, जिसका कोई मुकाबला नहीं है। इस ताकत का इस्‍तेमाल देश की प्रगति में और ज्‍यादा हो सके, इसके लिए नए-नए innovation की आवश्‍यकता है। नए innovations, blue revolution के लिए नई ऊर्जा बन सकते हैं। हमारे मछुआरे भाइयों की जिंदगी बदल सकते हैं।

मैं, इजराइल के प्रधानमंत्री जी का धन्‍यवाद करता हूं कि उन्‍होंने पिछले साल मेरी यात्रा के दौरान मुझे समुद्री जल को साफ एवं उपयोग लायक बनाने वाली एक मोटरेबल मशीन दिखाई। वो खुद ड्राइव करके मुझे ले गए थे। इतना ही नहीं, वैसा एक यंत्र वो आज अपने साथ लाए, उसका live demo अभी आपने स्‍क्रीन पर देखा था। बनासकाठा जिले में, बॉर्डर के एक गांव में इस नए सिस्‍टम को काम में लगाया गया है। इससे BSF Post पर तैनात जवानों और आसपास के गांवों के लोगों को साफ पीने का पानी तो मिलेगा ही, भारत में इस तरह की technology को परखने का भी एक अवसर मिलेगा।

भाइयो और बहनों, मुझे आपको ये बताते हुए खुशी है कि इजराइल के साथ agriculture sector में सहयोग से जुड़े 28 में से 25 Centre of excellence  तैयार हो चुके हैं। इनके द्वारा capacity billing, information और genetic resource के exchange में मदद मिल रही है। इन Centre of excellence में तीन हमारे गुजरात में स्‍थापित हुए हैं। इस कार्यक्रम के बाद मैं और प्रधानमंत्री जी प्रांतीक ताल्‍लुका, साबरकंठा जिला के भदराड़  गांव जा रहे हैं। वहां भी इजराइल की मदद से agriculture sector में Centre of excellence बना है। वहीं से हम video conference  के माध्‍यम से कच्‍छ में खजूर पर जो research center चल रहा है, उसके साथ भी हम बातचीत करेंगे। भदराड सेंटर से गुजरात के किसानों को सब्जियों की नई पौंध distribute की जा रही है। इस केंद्र में 10 हजार किसानों को ट्रेनिंग दी गई है और 35 हजार से ज्‍यादा किसान इस सेंटर को देखने आ चुके हैं। यहां के कुछ लोगों को इजराइल में भी प्रशिक्षण दिया गया है। भारत और इजराइल के बीच ये सहयोग, ये परस्‍पर विकास की भावना, दोनों ही देशों के उज्‍ज्‍वल भविष्‍य के लिए बहुत ही महत्‍वपूर्ण है।

21वीं सदी में दोनों देशों का ये साथ मानवता के इतिहास में नया अध्‍याय लिखेगा। साथियो, एक-दूसरे की संस्‍कृतियों का सम्‍मान, एक-दूसरे की परम्‍पराओं का सम्‍मान हमारे संबंधों को हमेशा मजबूत करता रहेगा। भले ही कम संख्‍या में हो, लेकिन ज्‍यूज समुदाय के लोग अहमदाबाद और उसके आसपास के इलाके में सुकून के साथ अपनी जिंदगी गुजार रहे हैं। वो गुजरात के इतिहास के साथ, गुजरात की संस्‍कृति के साथ घुलमिल गए हैं। गुजरात के ज्‍यूज समुदाय ने  अपनी जगह देश के अन्‍य हिस्‍सों और इजराइल तक में बनाई है। भारत और इजराइल के संबंधों का विस्‍तार और बढ़े, और मजबूत हो, इसी कामना के साथ मैं अपनी बात समाप्‍त करता हूं और आज इस अवसर पर iCreat को साकार करने में जिन लोगों ने सहयोग दिया है, उन सभी को मैं विशेष रूप से धन्‍यवाद देता हूं।

श्री नारायण मूर्ति जी, श्री दिलीप सिंघवी जी, सहित तमाम महानुभावो ने iCreat को create करने में बड़ी भूमिका निभाई है, अपना बहुमूल्‍य समय दिया है। मैं आशा करता हूं कि इस संस्‍था में innovation का जो वातावरण बनेगा, वो पूरे देश के नौजवानों को सशक्‍त करने में बहुत बड़ी भूमिका निभाएगा। और मैं प्रधानमंत्री जी का, श्रीमती सारा जी का हृदय से आभार व्‍यक्‍त करता हूं। मेरे अच्‍छे मित्र के रूप में हमारी दोस्‍ती, दो देशों की दोस्‍ती में एक नई ताकत बनकर उभर रही है। आज उन्‍होंने भारत के लिए जो एक विशेष भेंट-सौगात लाई हैं, जिसका वीडियो अभी आपने देखा। मैं समझता हूं कि आपका ये तोहफा भारत के सामान्‍य मानवी के हृदय को छूने वाला है। और इसके लिए मैं आपका हृदय से आपका बहुत-बहुत आभार करता हूं।

मैं फिर एक बार आप सबका बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद करता हूं और iCreat को अनेक-अनेक शुभकामनाएं देता हूं। धन्‍यवाद।

                Greetings to my dear brothers and sisters who are present here in large numbers!

Two days ago the festival of Makar Sankranti was celebrated in every corner of India. The essence of evolution is associated with Makar Sankranti. Development is intrinsic in Makar Sankranti. After the festival of Makar Sankranti a major effort or an initiative, a project is going to start today from the soil of Rajasthan that will supply fuel to the whole of India. I want to congratulate Vasundhara ji and Dharmendra Pradhan Ji for organising this programme for the commencement of this work. Generally, when any government or a politician lays the foundation-stone of something then the people ask about the possible date of commencement of the actual work related to it. So after this programme, awareness will be spread across the country that the people cannot be misled just by laying the foundation-stone. When some work is actually commenced, the common man believes that. 

I am glad that I got this opportunity to be a part of this journey of development by inaugurating this programme. While the officers were providing me with the details of the project and after they felt that they had given every piece of information to the Prime Minister, I asked them about the date of inauguration. I was reassured about the date. India will be celebrating 75th year of independence in the year 2022. The heroes of India - the freedom fighters who had spent their youth behind the prisons and those who had sacrificed their lives and had raised the slogan of Vande Mataram, had dreamt of a free India, grand India and a Divine India. The country became independent. Now, India will complete 75 years of its independence in the year 2022. It is the responsibility of all of us, of every Indian and of the 125 crore citizens to build the India that was visualised by the great freedom fighters and dedicate it to them. It is time to fulfil the resolutions. Today, you have taken the resolution to start the work of this refinery by 2022. I am confident that this resolution will be fulfilled and by the time the country celebrates 75 years of independence it will start getting new energy from here. Therefore, I extend my best wishes to the Government of Rajasthan, the efforts of Government of India, to the department of Mr Dharmendra ji and to all my brothers and sisters of Rajasthan.

 

The land of Barmer is endowed with the blessings of Rawal Mallinath, Saint Tulsiram, Mother Bhatiyani, Mother Nagnechi, Saint Ishwar Das, Saint Daru ji Megh and countless such saints. Today I salute that land.

The land of Panchpadra provided the country with freedom fighters like the late Gulabchand Salecha ji who had led the Salt Satyagraha much before Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha. Gulabchand ji is remembered for his efforts in bringing drinking water, train connectivity and opening the first college in this area. I also salute this son of Panchpadra.

Brothers and sisters,

Today I want to remember Bhairon Singh Shekhawat ji on this soil. I want to mention all the great contributions made by Shri Bhairon Singh Shekhawat today who had made efforts to modernize Rajasthan, to make a crisis-free Rajasthan and who had envisaged this refinery of Barmer. Today on the land of Barmer I want to request all the people present here to pray to the almighty for the son of the soil Mr Jaswant Singh Ji so that he gets well soon and the country can avail the benefits of his experience once again. And I believe that god will listen to our prayers. 

Brothers and sisters,

Unfortunately, there is a tendency of forgetting history in our country. Recalling the sacrifices made by the freedom fighters inspires every generation to create a new history and we should keep seeking such inspiration. You must have seen that the Prime Minister of Israel has come on a visit to India. He has visited India after 14 years. I was the first Prime Minister since independence who had visited Israel. My countrymen and my heroes of Rajasthan, you all will be proud to know that even with time constraints I had visited Haifa in Israel and had offered my condolences to the soldiers who had sacrificed their lives about 100 years ago in the First World War. It was led by a brave Indian son Major Dalpat Singh ji. Major Dalpat Singh Shekhawat had liberated Haifa, leading the army in World War 1 about 100 years ago.

There is a place called Teen Murti Chowk in Delhi. It has the statues of three great heroes. As soon as the Prime Minister of Israel landed in India, both of us visited the Teen Murti Chowk. The Teen Murti Chowk was constructed in the memory of the sacrifice made by Major Dalpat Singh and this time the Prime Minister of Israel visited the place to salute him. Both of us had visited the place and the Teen Murti Chowk was renamed as Teen Murti Haifa Chowk so that the history and Major Dalpat Singh are not forgotten and the tradition of Rajasthan is always remembered. I got this opportunity to do this job two days ago. 

Brothers and sisters,

This is the land of Heroes. This is the land of martyrs. There won't be any event in the history of sacrifices in which the heroes of this land would not have shed their blood. I salute all such heroes today.

 

 

Brothers and sisters,

I used to visit Rajasthan quiet a lot. On certain occasions I came here for the work of my organisation and sometimes as the Chief Minister of the neighbouring Gujarat. I have come to this area several times. Every time I used to hear from the common man that Congress and famine were twin brothers. Wherever Congress goes, the famine follows. Under Vasundhara ji, who had got the opportunity to serve the people of Rajasthan, this barren land is receiving enough water. 

Brothers and sisters,

But we have to move even further ahead than this. We have to carry Rajasthan forward. Rajasthan's journey of development is going to provide a new strength to the development of the country.

Brothers and sisters,

Dharmendra ji and Vasundhara ji were complaining and they were right about their complaints. Is it just for the refinery of Barmer? Was the foundation-stone of such a refinery laid and photographed only here? Wasn't it an attempt to cheat people? I would like to invite all those people who are accustomed to do a little research to find out whether this has been the work culture of the Congress governments - to make tall promises and misleading the public? This matter is not limited to the refinery of Barmer. This is part of their work culture and habit.

After I became the Prime Minister I was looking at the Railway Budget. Out of my habit I asked that so many announcements were made during the Railway Budget, can you tell what happened after that? Brothers and sisters, you will be shocked to know that in a place like Parliament, which is considered as the temple of democracy, the country is being misled. Several governments were formed earlier and more than 1500 schemes were announced in the Railway Budget which do not exist in reality and are just on papers.

There are some people in Parliament who just clap when Railway projects are announced for their areas and the Railway Minister becomes satisfied. Later on, there is no one to pursue the projects further. After we came to power we decided to stop this tradition of appeasement by using railway budget. We will make only those many schemes that can be implemented in reality. We might be criticized in the beginning but gradually the country will gain the strength to do the right thing and accept the right thing and we want to work in that direction.

Moreover, if we talk of One Rank One Pension; my soldiers are sitting here; they will tell you. Wasn’t the demand for One Rank One Pension been raised for the past 40 years? Weren't the army men promised every time? Before every election tall promises were made in this regard. This is their habit. In 2014 you must have seen how they were again talking about One Rank One Pension and circulating photographs clicked with retired army men.

 

Later, when on 15 September 2013, I announced in Rewari, if our government comes to power One Rank One Pension scheme would be implemented for ex-serviceman, under a lot of pressure they hurriedly announced 500 crore rupees for One Rank One Pension in the interim budget. Much like the same way they had laid the foundation-stone of this refinery.

See, this is a kind of treachery which was just a lip service before elections. In our budget we had allocated money for one rank one pension. We ensured the implementation of one rank one pension as we had promised before the elections. We used to pursue the matter in case of delays. You will be surprised to know that even though their budget mentioned 500 crore rupees, the actual implementation of One Rank One Pension was not there. What were the eligibility criteria for one rank one pension? What would be the financial burden? You will be surprised to know that only the refinery was on papers but one rank one pension was not even on the papers. There was neither any plan nor any list but only an election promise.

Brothers and sisters,

I was committed to complete that work but it took me one-and-a-half years as it took time to compile everything on papers. Everything was in a mess. The residential addresses of the ex-servicemen could not be located. The correct figures were not available. I was astonished to see that these things, meant for the country’s soldiers who are always ready to sacrifice their lives for the country, were in a mess. I started collecting the data and after all the calculations, brothers and sisters, the figure which I had earlier thought to be 500 crores, 1000 crores, 1500 crores and 2000 crores totalled up to more than 12000 crores! The Congress Party was trying to implement this programme with just 500 crore rupees. Was it an honest initiative? Did they really want to give something to the army men? Were they really honest towards the retired Army personnel? I don't think that the Finance Minister of that time was so weak. However, they placed 500 crore rupees for the foundation stone of the refinery and marked that in the budget and ended the topic there itself.

Brothers and sisters,

As I said, the amount totalled up to 12 thousand crore rupees. So I called the representatives of the army men. I said, ""I want to give you the promised amount but there is not enough money in the government's treasury. It will be difficult for me to give the entire amount of 12 thousand crores at once. Those people were talking about 500 crores but since the amount totals up to 12 thousand crore rupees I want to give it in an honest way. So I need your help.""

The army men told me-"" Sir Prime Minister, kindly don't embarrass us. You can openly tell us how we can help you?"" I said-""well, I don't need anything. You have already contributed a lot for the country but kindly help me out. I won't be able to hand over the entire 12 thousand crores at one go. If I do that, then I will have to stop some of the welfare schemes for the poor. This will be a grave injustice to them. So just a single request, will it be okay for you all if I give the amount in four instalments?"" The brave army men of my country had been fighting for the past 40 years for One Rank One Pension. Now they had a committed Prime Minister. They could have easily said - ""Modiji, the previous governments have cheated us. We don't want to wait anymore. If possible then hand over to us the amount or else we will go our way."" They could have said that but they didn't. 

The army men of my country are still the army men from their hearts and minds even without the uniform. They will think of the welfare of the country till the last breath. Immediately they said -"" Sir Prime Minister, we have faith in your words. You may give it in four or six instalments but kindly decide this matter once for all. We will accept whatever you decide.""

Brothers and sisters,

It was the strength of the army personnel that I could arrive at a decision and till date I have given them four instalments. 10 thousand and 700 crores have been deposited in their accounts and the remaining instalments will soon reach their accounts. So, it had become their habit to lay the foundation-stones and to run the government machinery in that way.

You tell me, we have been hearing the slogan of 'Garibi hatao' (remove poverty) for the past 4 decades. You must have seen the game during the elections in which the poor are also dragged. But have you ever seen any scheme for the welfare of the poor? You won't find any. Even after 70 years of Independence they will say - go and dig the pit and take something to eat at the end of the day. If there was a real concern for them, then my country's poor would have used all their strengths to defeat poverty. 

We want to empower the poor. The banks were nationalised but remained inaccessible to the poor. After 70 years of Independence when we formed the government, a decision was made to bring the poor to the mainstream in the journey of country's development. So we brought the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. Today about 32 crore people have bank accounts under this scheme. Brothers and sisters, at that time I had also said that the poor will have the option of opening a zero balance account. The country's poor may be financially poor, but they have a rich mind-set. I have seen some wealthy people who are poor in terms of their mentality. We had given them the provision of zero balance account but the poor felt that some amount should be deposited in it. My dear brothers and sisters, I am glad and proud to inform you that the people who had opened zero balance accounts today have 72 thousand crores in their Jan Dhan accounts. Ironically, the rich wants to withdraw money from their accounts while the poor deposits the amount in the banks honestly. This is how poverty should be fought against.

Brothers and sisters,

You are aware of the fact that earlier one had to be after the MPs for six-seven months for getting a gas connection. Each MP was given 25 coupons in a year to provide gas connection to 25 families. Sometimes we could hear of cases where the MPs used to sell the coupons in black.

 

 

Brothers and sisters,

Should my poor mothers and sisters spend their lives in smoke by burning firewood even today? Is this the way how we do welfare for the poor? Those mothers and sisters are compelled to inhale the smoke from the firewood while cooking. The smoke is equivalent to smoking 400 cigarettes. Even the children of that household are seriously affected by it.

Brothers and sisters,

We have taken the responsibility. The welfare of the poor cannot be done merely by raising slogans. We need to change their lives. We came up with Ujjwala Yojana under which gas connections were provided to approximately 3 crore 30 lakh families. We have freed crores of mothers from the firewood and smoke. Now tell me, whether every such mother will shower her blessings on Narendra Modi while cooking or not? She would take the pledge to protect us because she knows that this is the right way to fight against poverty.

Brothers and sisters,

Even after 70 years of Independence, there were 18000 villages without the access to electricity. In the 21st century, those people were compelled to live in an 18th century-like situation. They might be thinking-"" are we still an independent nation? Is this the so-called democracy? I go and vote during elections. But what sort of governments are these that could not provide electricity in our villages even after 70 years of Independence? Brothers and sisters, I have taken the responsibility of providing electricity to these 18000 villages. About 2000 villages remain to be electrified. The work is going on at a rapid pace. Now they have got the opportunity to live in 21st century-like conditions.

Even after 70 years of Independence, there are 4 crore families without any access to electricity. We have taken the responsibility of providing free electricity to these 4 crore families by the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The children of those families will be able to study after that. We have to empower the poor if we want to fight against poverty. We have to move ahead with all these challenges.

Brothers and sisters,

This refinery will change the face and fate of this region. You can imagine how this big industry in such a desert will help in providing jobs to the locals. It provides jobs not only within the industry but also outside it through the chains created by it. Small industries will come up because of it, as this big industry will require a complete infrastructure - water, electricity, gas connection, optical fibre network etc. In other words, the entire economy of the area will change.

When officers and bureaucrats arrive here, automatically several new institutions of education will come up. When people will start coming here in large numbers to work from other parts of India and also from Rajasthan like Udaipur, Banswara, Bharatpur, Kota or Alwar or Ajmer, then healthcare facilities will also start developing.

Therefore brothers and sisters,

A sea change will sweep the area within 5 years; you can easily visualise that. Today the programme that I will be inaugurating here is a loss for me and for the Indian government. Had some work been done before by the previous government, then the government would have saved about 40 thousand crore rupees.

But Vasundhara ji has the samskaras (values) of the Royal family as well as of the Marwaris. She had tried to extract as much as possible from the central government. This is possible only with Bharatiya Janata Party. The Chief Minister becomes adamant to get her wish fulfilled for the welfare of her state even if the centre has the same government. I congratulate Vasundhara ji for her efforts in saving Rajasthan's money and advising the Indian government for framing the right scheme. Consequently, both Vasundhara ji and Dharmendra ji worked together to make the stalled project a reality. I congratulate both of you and best wishes to you all.

Speak along with me loudly- Victory to Mother India!!

The country will get fuel from the land of Barmer. This refinery is going to represent the energy of the entire country. I hope that this energy will start from here and reach in every corner of the country. With these wishes- khamma ghani!! (Greetings in Marwari language)

His Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel,
Business Leaders of India and Israel,

Ladies and Gentlemen.

I welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu and members of the Israeli Delegation on behalf of all my countrymen. It is an added pleasure to be with the CEOs of both countries. Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have just completed a fruitful interaction with Indian and Israeli business leaders through the bilateral CEOs Forum. I have high hopes from this interaction and partnership of CEOs, which started last year.

Friends!

I have always had a deep regard for Israel and its people. I visited Israel in 2006 as Chief Minister of Gujarat. Again last year in July, I visited Israel, the first such visit from India.

It was a very special visit. I experienced at close quarters the remarkable spirit of innovation, enterprise and perseverance that drives Israel. There is new energy and purpose that has in-vigorated our ties over the last few years. It will help take our cooperation to greater heights. We stand on the cusp of a bright new chapter in India-Israel relations driven by our people and the mutual opportunities for betterment of their lives.

The role of business and industry is crucial in the transformation of our ties. It is your combined efforts that will add real value to our interaction and produce concrete successes. Given the scale of the Indian economy and the relevance of cutting-edge Israeli technologies for us, even sky is not the limit for what we may achieve together!

Friends!

I am delighted that today we have launched the maiden call for joint R&D projects under the ‘India-Israel Industrial R&D and Technological Innovation Fund (i4F)’ which was announced during my visit to Israel last July. This Fund, to be utilized over a period of 5 years, is a welcome opportunity to combine the talent pool of the two countries in pursuit of path-breaking technological solutions that can be commercially exploited.

I strongly encourage enterprises in both countries to utilize this platform. Equally exciting is the pick up in science and technology exchanges through joint R&D projects such as in areas like ""Data Analytics” and ""Cyber Space security”.

I am happy to note that the India-Israel Innovation and Technology Conclave is going to be held in India in July 2018. I hope this Conclave will spur co--development of new technologies. In fact, the ground-work for this will be started from iCREATE day after tomorrow. We are both going to Gujarat to inaugurate this campus, which is being developed as a leading innovation hub.

Friends!

I am taking Prime Minister Netanyahu to rural areas of Gujarat because the real power of technology and innovation lies in the benefit it brings to the common man. Israel is universally known as the Start-up nation with a unique eco-system for innovation and incubation.

The credit for this goes to the Israeli entrepreneurs. You have made Israel a strong, stable and innovative economy. You have made a country of 8 million people, shine as a global power-house of technology.

Whether it is Water Tech; or Agri-Tech; whether it is food production, its processing or conservation; Israel has been a shining example with new breakthru and advances. Whether it is physical or virtual security; whether it is on land, water or space; your technology has won admiration. In fact, hailing from a water deficient state in India, I have particularly admired Israel’s water efficiency.

Friends!

In India, we have been taking steady steps over three years at both macro as well as micro-level, to make a difference. Our motto is: Reform, Perform and Transform.

The results are two-fold. On the one hand, our procedures, processes and systems are getting aligned with the best in the world. Secondly, we are able to maintain the pace of faster growth.

In spite of deep structural reforms, we are among the fastest growing major economies. FDI inflows are at an all-time high, with 40% rise. Tremendous work is being done to skill and employ the youth. 65% of our population is below 35 years of age and is hungry for technology-enabled growth.

This is our greatest opportunity as well as challenge. For this purpose, we have started the Start-up India campaign. There is vast potential for India-Israel partnership in this area. The India-Israel Innovation Bridge will act as a link between the Start-ups of the two sides. I have been saying that Indian Industries, start-ups and the academic institutions must collaborate with their Israeli counterparts to access the huge reservoir of knowledge.
 


	India has size and scale.
	Israel has sharpness and edge.

There would be many ideas and technologies that can be useful for or can be commercially scaled up in India.

Friends!

Today, we have emerged as one of the largest manufacturing nations. But we are not done yet. We are positioning India as a global manufacturing hub leveraging the energy of our youth. 

The ‘Make in India’ initiative is designed to help achieve this. Through these initiatives, combined with the new eco-system of a formal economy and a unified tax regime, we are trying to create a NEW INDIA.

We are particularly keen to develop India into a knowledge-based, skill-supported and technology-driven society. A grand beginning has already been made through Digital India and Skill India. To enable this transformation, in the last few years, my Government has undertaken substantial reforms. 

We have resolved a number of regulatory and policy issues facing the businesses and companies. We have worked sincerely on ‘ease of doing business’ in India.

The results are there to see:
 

	In the last three years, India has moved up 42 places in the index of Ease of Doing Business of World Bank;
	We have moved up 21 places on the Global Innovation Index of WIPO in two years.
	We have also moved up 32 places in last two years in the Global Competitive-
	ness Index of the World Economic Forum - the highest for any country;
	We moved 19 places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank ;
	We are among the top 10 FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD But we will not stop.

We want to do more and do better.

To enable entry of capital and technology, most of the sectors including defence, have been opened for FDI. More than 90 percent of the FDI approvals have been put on automatic route. 

We are now among the most open economies. Just a few days ago, we have allowed 100% automatic route FDI in single brand retail and construction development. We also opened up our national carrier, Air India, to foreign investors. 

Every day we are making it easier to do business in India. In taxation, we have carried out a number of historic reforms. The path breaking GST reform has been introduced successfully and smoothly.

It is by far the biggest business and economic reform India has ever done. With introduction of GST and of Financial Technologies and digital transactions, we have really moved towards a modern tax regime, which is also transparent, stable and predictable.

Friends!

Several Israeli companies have joined hands with Indian companies for Making in India. Many others, especially those with advanced water technologies and agri techniques, defence and security systems, and pharma knowledge have a foot-hold in India. Similarly, Indian companies have significant presence in several sectors in Israel like IT, Irrigation and Pharma. 

Diamond remains a strong link in our trade. There are more business joint ventures today than before. However, this is just the beginning. Our trade with Israel has grown to more than 5 billion dollars. 

But this is still well below the real potential. We must attain the full potential of our ties. This is not only a diplomatic imperative but also an economic one. I welcome your suggestions on how to unlock our combined potential. The spirit of innovation, adaptation and problem solving is inherent in both countries. 

Just to give you an example:

Imagine the environmental and economic gains if we can collaborate to save wastage and if we can add value in our fruits, vegetables and horticulture! Similar is the case with water. 

We have situations of plenty as well as scarcity of water. We have situations of food being thrown away even as there are many who go hungry.

Friends!

India’s development agenda is huge. It presents a vast economic opportunity for Israeli companies. I invite more and more Israeli people, businesses and companies to come and work in India.

Along with the Government and people, the business community of India too is keen to join hands. I wish your companies and ventures all success. I assure you of my support and that of my Government wherever it is required. And I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his continuous support in fast-tracking India-Israel trade and economic collaboration. I am confident many successes lie ahead for our partnership.

Thank You!

                Your Excellency Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,

Members of the media, 

It is a great pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on his first ever visit to India. 

येदीदीहायाकर, बरूख़िमहाबायिमलेहोदू!

(My good friend, Welcome to India!)

Your visit, Prime Minister, is a long-anticipated moment in the journey of friendship between India and Israel. 

Your visit is also a fitting climax to the comemoration of 25 years of diplomatic relations between India and Israel. 

As our first honoured guest in 2018, your visit marks a special beginning to our New Year calendar. It comes at an especially auspicious time as people all over India are rejoicing the arrival of spring, renewal, hope and harvest. The festivals of Lohri, Bihu, MakarSankranti, and Pongal celebrate the splendour of India’s diversity and unity. 

Friends,

Last year in July, I carried the greetings and friendship of 1.25 billion Indians during my momentous journey to Israel. In return, I was overwhelmed by the generous affection and warmth of the Israeli people, led by my friend, Bibi. 

In that visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu and I promised each other and our people to build a strategic partnership: of hope and trust and progress of diverse and cutting-edge cooperation, and of joint endeavours and shared successes Such a promise flows as much from the natural affinity and friendship that have linked us for centuries as it does from the compelling win-win case for engagement in almost all spheres .

And it is a measure of our shared ambition and commitment that six short months after that visit; your extraordinary visit is taking place to India.

Today and yesterday, Prime Minister Netanyahu and I reviewed the progress in our relations and renewed our conversation on the possibilities and the opportunities that beckon us and need to be seized. 

Our discussions were wide-ranging and intensive. They were marked by the desire to do more. Prime Minister, I have a reputation of being impatient in getting results. 

If I may let out an open secret, I know that so are you. 

Last year in Tel Aviv, you had expressed the intent to cut down bureaucratic red tape with a machete and forge ahead with speed. 

Prime Minister, I am happy to tell you that in India, we are well on our way to doing just that. We have imparted our shared impatience to the implemntation of our earlier decisions. 

The results are already visible on the ground. Our discussions today were marked by convergence to accelerate our engagement and to scale up our partnership.

We will pursue this in three ways: 

· First, we will strengthen the existing pillars of cooperation in areas that touch the lives of our peoples. These are agriculture, science and technology, and security.

We exchanged views on scaling up the Centers of Excellence that have been a main-stay of agricultural cooperation by bringing in advanced Israeli practices and technology.


In defence, I have invited Israeli companies to take advantage of the liberalized FDI regime to make more in India with our companies.

· Second,
we are venturing into less explored areas of cooperation, such as oil& gas, cyber security, films, and start-ups. You will find this reflected in the agreements that were just exchanged. Several of these areas are indicative of our desire to diversify and broad-base engagement.

· And third,

we are committed to facilitating the flow of people and ideas between our geographies. It requires policy facilitation, infrastructure and connectivity links and fostering constituencies of support beyond Government.

We are working with Israel to make it easier for our people to work and visit each other’s countries, including for longer work durations To bring people closer on both sides, an Indian Cultural Center will soon open in Israel.

We have also decided to start an annual exchange of bilateral visits by 100 young people from science-related educational streams.

Friends,

Thriving two-way trade and investment is an integral part of our vision for a strong partnership. Prime Minister Netanyahu and I agreed on the need to do more in this direction. After the meeting in Tel Aviv last year, we will interact for the second time with our CEOs under the bilateral Forum.

I welcome the large business component that Prime Minister Netanyahu has brought along with him. Prime Minister Netanyahu and I also exchanged perspectives on the regional and global situation. 


We reviewed our cooperation as a factor for stability and peace in our regions and the world. 


Friends,

Yesterday, as his first stop after touching Indian soil, Prime Minister Netanyahu joined me at the re-named Teen Murti Haifa Chowk to pay homage to the memory of the brave Indian soldiers who laid down their lives a century ago in the Battle of Haifa in Israel. 


We are both countries that have never forgotten our history and our heroes. And we deeply appreciate this gesture by Prime Minister Netanyahu.

As we look to the future of this exciting partnership with Israel, I am filled with hope and optimism. In Prime Minister Netanyahu, I have a counter-part who is equally committed to taking the India-Israel relationship to soaring new heights. 


Finally, I am delighted to have the chance to be with you, Prime Minister , in my home state, Gujarat, day after. 


There, we will have another opportunity to see the fulfillment of the promise, which our mutual cooperation holds in diverse areas such as agriculture, technology, and innovation.


I wish Prime Minister Netanyahu, Mrs. Netanyahu and the delegation a memorable stay in India. 

Thank you very much. Toda Rabah!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed two important events, via video-conference, on the occasion of National Youth Day. 

Addressing the Inaugural Ceremony of National Youth Festival 2018 at the Gautam Buddha University, Greater Noida, the Prime Minister began by congratulating ISRO on the successful launch of PSLV-C40. Our strides in space will help our citizens and will enhance our development journey, the Prime Minister said. 

He recalled that during Mann Ki Baat in December 2017, he had called for organising Mock Parliaments in the districts. Such Mock Parliaments will further the spirit of discussion among our youth, he added. The Prime Minister said that we are born after 1947 and thus, we did not have the honour to take part in the freedom struggle. But, he added, we have the opportunity to fulfil the dreams of the great men and women who devoted their lives for our freedom. We have to create the India that our freedom fighters dreamt of, Shri Narendra Modi asserted.

The Prime Minister said that we want to make our youth job creators. They should be youngsters who innovate, he added. The Prime Minister observed that some people say that today's youth does not have 'Dhairya' or patience. However, he feels, that in a way, this is what ignites an innovative zeal in our youth. It enables our youngsters to think out of the box and do new things, he added. The Prime Minister urged the youth to make sports a part of their lives.

Addressing a programme to mark National Youth Day and Sarva Dharma Sabha at Belagavi, Karnataka, the Prime Minister said that Swami Vivekananda emphasised on brotherhood. He believed that our well-being lies in the development of India, the Prime Minister added.

Shri Narendra Modi said that there was a lot of propaganda against India in the Western world that Swami Vivekananda proved wrong. He also raised a voice against social evils, he added.

Some people are trying to divide the nation and the youth of this country are giving a fitting answer to such elements, the Prime Minister said. Our youth will never be misled, the Prime Minister added. It is India's youth that is taking the Swachh Bharat Mission to new heights, the Prime Minister said. India has been home to several saints, seers who have served society and reformed it, he added.

The Prime Minister said Seva Bhav is a part of our culture. All over India, there are several individuals and organisations selflessly serving society, he added. The Prime Minister exhorted everyone to work towards making our nation ODF.

                    My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of birth anniversary of Vivekanand and National Youth Day. Today, having seen this incredible sight of Belagavi, this grand view, everyone here appears to have become imbibed with the spirit of Vivekanand. An all religion conference has also been organised here today. My best wishes to you for that also. 


       The kind of enthusiasm I can see, has fused everyone’s mind and  consciousness into one. Today, a world record is being created here with the invocation of consciences of thousands of people. 
       All this has become possible due to the blessings of reverend Siddhaling Maharaj ji, Yallaling Prabhu Ji and Siddh Rameshwar Mahaswami Ji. The energy of their blessings reflects on your faces. I also feel that energy and blessing. Brothers and sisters, it has always been a pleasant experience for me to visit Belagavi. One can see a grand image of Ek Bharat – Shreshtha Bharat here.  


       One seldom comes across five different languages being spoken in a small place like this in any other part of the country. I salute all of you and also the land of Belagavi. It is the land of Queen Chenamma of Kittur, it is the land of great warrior Sangoli Rayanna who took on the British. Swami Vivekanand Ji had stayed in Belagavi for ten days. He also stayed in the famous Mysore palace. From Mysore he went to Kerala and Tamil Nadu. He got a new inspiration in Kanyakumari and it was that inspiration that propelled him to Chicago and he won the affection of entire world there. 


        This year marks the completion of 125 years of Swami Vivekanand’s Chicago address. I had specially gone to Chicago on the completion of 100 years of that speech. So many years passed since he delivered that speech, every time we look for solution of some of our problems we still feel that ‘oh! Swami Vivekanand Ji had said this thing, how correct he was! We don’t have to remember Vivekanand Ji, he is always present in our thoughts. 


Vivekanand Ji had given a very powerful mantra on what an Indian should be. That mantra was the mantra of - country first. Every single line of that mantra is full of power and inspiration. He had said: ‘O India, you ought not forget that your life is not for personal pleasure. O brave, please say with pride that I’m an Indian and every Indian is my brother. You say it aloud with pride: Every Indian is my brother and India is my life, India’s land is my heaven and India’s welfare is my welfare.’  Vivekanand was like that. Vivekanand was fused with the spirit of India, he was completely one with the country. He considered India’s happiness and sorrow as his own. He fought with every evil. He demolished the wicked propaganda that projected India abroad as a country of snake charmers and jugglers. He enhanced India’s reputation in the world. He had the courage to move forward in sync with the knowledge, science, language, social reform and a progressive world.


      He had the spirit of a fighter who fought against the social evils plaguing the society like untouchability, discrimination and hypocrisy. This feeling made him the warrior ascetic. Swami Vivekanand had raised his voice against the caste based discrimination during his visit from Colombo to Almora. He said bluntly : ‘There might not be anybody as great as you are in terms of knowledge and philosophy, but there will not be anyone so mean in terms of behavior. Your behaviour of this kind is extremely condemnable.’ Nobody perhaps can muster the courage even today to say those things with as much frankness as he had said this around 100-125 years ago.


      Friends, we will have to change this atmosphere, this mentality. If we were to follow Vivekanand then we would have to get rid ourselves of caste based prejudice and discrimination, we will have to end that. In the past decades your own monastery has worked to eradicate every kind of caste based discrimination due to the inspiration from Siddhaling Maharaj Ji. You have been providing necessary assistance to the weak and marginalised sections of the society hardly bothering about the victim’s caste. People associated with your monastery have been giving relief during floods visiting from village to village. When free medicines are distributed to the poor, when free medical camps are organised and food and clothes are distributed do we bother about caste? No. 


      With great difficulty and because of the efforts made by the people over the decades the country is moving towards being free from the shackles of casteism. However, some anti-social elements have set their evil eyes on the heart of millions and millions people like you. These people have again been conspiring to divide the society in the name of caste.  However, today’s young generation has been responding to these people. India’s youth cannot be tricked by a handful of people. Such youth who have vowed to end the casteism, evil social practices and superstition from the country are like Vivekanand. They are the symbol of India’s new, brave, courageous and development oriented face. 


        Every such youth who has been pro-actively discharging his duty in nation building, who has been working for realising the solemn pledge for making a New India is a Vivekanand. Every person who has been dedicated to service of the nation in some agricultural field, in some factory or some school or some college or in some corner of your lane or your locality is a Vivekanand. 


       The one who has been taking forward the Clean India Mission, who has been providing digital literacy to people by visiting village to village is a Vivekanand. The one who has been working for the oppressed, for the persecuted, exploited and excluded person is a Vivekanand. The person who has been using his energy, ideas and innovations for the welfare of society is Vivekanand. 


      Friends, last year a programme – Smart India Hackathon was organised. In this programme more than 40,000 youth have come forward to provide digital solutions to nearly 600 problems of the country. For me all these people are like Vivekanands. Millions and millions of ordinary people, the makers of a New India by carrying the smell of India’s soil inside them are our Vivekanands of modern times. I bow down to them, I bow down to every Vivekanand present in this programme, I bow down to every Vivekanand of our country. 


       Brothers and sisters, in our country, which has a thousands of years old history, which has witnessed changes with the passage of times – changes in the individuals, changes in the society. However, some evils also crept up in the society with the passage of time. 


        This is the uniqueness of our society that whenever this kind of social evils crept in then the work of reforming the society was started by a member of the society itself. This kind of great social reformers always put the public service at the centre of their activities. They not only educated the society through their consciousness, speeches and deeds but they also gave priority to service to the people. They explained these things to the common man in his own simple language.


       It was sort of a people’s movement and the expansion of which could be seen over a period of hundreds of years.  This movement was strengthened in the south by the ideas of saints like Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, Vallabhacharya, Ramanujacharya; and in the west by the ideas of Meerabai, Eknath, Tukaram, Ramdas, Narsi Mehta; and in the north by the ideas of Ramanand, Kabirdas, Goswami Tulsidas, Surdas, Guru Nanakdev, Sant Raidas; and in the east by the ideas of Chaitnya Mahaprabhu and Shankar Dev. It’s also a unique strength of our country that these were never equated with religious movements. The balance between the three – knowledge, devotion and karma – has always been accepted in our country. In terms of knowledge these saints always searched the answer for this fundamental question ‘who I am in the end’. 


        Devotion was another name for dedication and deeds were completely based on to the duty to serve. It was the influence of several such saints that the country was able to move forward while facing a lot of difficulties. During that period, in every part of the country, in every region and in every direction, our saints tried to revive a social awakening by coming out of temples and monasteries. We can say with pride that India has such a great tradition, there have been such great saints and preachers who have used their penance and knowledge for nation building. 


       In this series there have been countless great souls like Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Jyotiba Phule, Mahatma Gandhi, Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Baba Amte, Pandurang Shashtri Athwale, Vinoba Bhave. These people made the service focal point of their activities and also carried out social reforms. Whatever solemn pledges were made by them for the society had been accomplished by them.  


      Friends, your monastery has also followed this tradtion of renunciation and service. Your monastery is also known as the monastery of unattached ascetics; unattached means free from any kind of temporal involvements. When more than 360 of your monasteries spread over different states follow the path of donating the food grain, when they feed the poor and hungry people then it is certainly the best service to the mother earth, the best service to humanity. 


       This is a good example of that ‘the god likes service to mankind’. Service has been the history of our country and to have a feeling to serve. It has been our tradition to make arrangements for providing food and shelter to the poor people. These arrangements were made by common people with the blessings of our hermits and ascetics. Even today this tradition is being kept alive in several villages and cites and it has been flourishing. 


        Brothers and sisters, India has always spread the message of humanity, democracy, good governance and non-violence in the entire world. India had not only adopted the democratic values but also included them in her administrative system centuries before the top countries and great thinkers of the world started looking at democracy as a new approach.  


        Lord Basaveswara had given the concept of democracy and equality to the world in the 12th century. He had developed a system called ‘Anubhav Mandap’ where people of all kinds, poor, oppressed, persecuted and excluded people could have aired their views. Everyone was equal there. I was also fortunate that I got the opportunity to publicly dedicate the statue of Lord Basaveswara in Britain when I visited the country in 2015. 


I still remember that at that time then Prime Minister of Britain had mentioned the Magna Carta. But, in a way, long before the Magna Carta, Lord Basweswara had introduced us to the first parliament. 
Lord Basaweswara had said: ‘When there is no exchange of ideas, when there is no debate with logic even Anubhav Goshthi does not remain relevant, and where this kind of things take place God also does not reside there.’  He had described this exchange of ideas and deliberation as powerful and as essential as God himself. Women were allowed to speak openly in the Anubhav Mandap. 


      Women from every section of society used to express their ideas. Some of them were like that who were not even expected to come in the midst of the so called civilized society of that time but even that kind of women used to come to Anubhav Mandap and express their ideas. It was a very significant attempt for women empowerment in that era. I had publicly dedicated the translation of Lord Basaveswara’s teachings in 23 languages just last year. 


      I’m hopeful that those will have been helpful in conveying the message of Lord Basaveswara to the masses. I also  salute the former Vice President of India Shri B.D. Jatti and also remember his contribution to the Basava Committee on this occasion. I would like to specially mention Shri Arvind Jatti. 


      Friends, I have been told that reverend Siddha Rameshwar Mahaswami Ji had resolved to once again start the Anubhav Mandap. He wanted to establish it in the Monastery here. It’s a matter of great pleasure that his dream is being realised under the leadership of Shri Murugha Rajendra Mahaswami. The message of equality will be spread in the country trough this Anubhav Mandap. I convey my best wishes to all of you for this event while wishing happiness for everyone by following the mantra of ‘Sarva Jan Sukhino Bhavantu’ (may everyone attain happiness). 


      Friends, when our country will celebrate 75 years of independence in 2022 then whether we will celebrate that occasion with our internal vices? No. All of us have pledged to make a New India. Your contribution will make this journey from resolution to realisation more easier. Whether you people can make a solemn pledge in the field of providing education to the daughters, or in the field of skill development of youth or in the field of cleanliness or in the field of spreading digital literacy or for promoting solar energy? 


       I am aware that you people have already been working in such areas. However, whether a pledge can be made by setting a target? For example can you make a solemn pledge that support will be provided for making two or five thousand villages open defecation free in the next two years? Can a pledge be made that in the next two years there will be LED bulbs in every household of the five thousand villages identified by you people? 


      Friends, the government has been working in all these sectors. However, you people have an important role in creating awareness and in inspiring people. I am confident that when you people will step forward then the power of millions of Vivekanands will help in realising your resolutions. 


      At present, ten thousand Vivekanands have gathered in Belagavi, then the lakhs of them will gather. Our social system will be further strengthened when your work will succeed and the dream of Ek Bharat and Shreshtha Bharat and when the dream of a strong India that Swami Vivekanand had seen will be accomplished. 


      I conclude my speech with these words. Once again I salute all the saints present on the dais. Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of National Youth Day and also for All Religion Conference. 


Thank you very much.

                First of all I wish to congratulate all the countrymen on one more important achievement of our scientists. ISRO has successfully launched PSLV-C40 sometime ago. 

PSLV has installed total 31 satellites in the space including a satellite of Cartosat-2 series. 28 satellites of the total satellites are of foreign countries. Today, ISRO has made one more record. It has scored a century of satellite launches. 

ISRO’s success today will help the country’s farmers, fishermen and scientists in getting the ground level information. This success will further pave the way for a New India. 

Once again I extend my best wishes to ISRO and its scientists who have always made the country proud and contributed in the country’s economic development. 

Our scientists have given an invaluable gift to the country in the New Year and on the occasion of birth anniversary of Vivekananda and National Youth Day. 

Friends, I really wanted to talk to you people in person, 

This mini-India that has gathered in Greater Noida, it’s presenting a grand view of Ek Bharat and Shreshtha Bharat (One India and Great India), I wanted to have an audience with this mini-India in person. 

However, due to some engagements, I am getting connected with you people through technology. 

I always make an effort to get the complete information about this kind of programmes i.e. what all happened in the programme, what issues were discussed and what was the outcome if I am not able to reach in this kind of programmes in person. I will also try to gather all the information about the issues discussed by you people here. 

Friends!National Youth Festival is getting start today. I wish, I praise all the youths and institutions who have won National Youth Awards. 

I’ve been told that a lot of programmes will be organised here in the next four days. National Youth Parliament will also be organised. This time in Mann Ki Baatprogramme I have mooted the idea of organizing a mock parliament in every district of the country. In a way, this is in series of that idea.

This is an excellent opportunity to deliberate and make pledges on the issues of a New India. This is the 22nd festival and I would expect that in your deliberations this issue should also be discussed that when the 25th youth festival will be celebrated then what will be its outline,What kind of pledges will be made? Where will we reach by preparing a roadmap? 

Similarly, when the country will celebrate 75 years of its independence in 2022,then in what way the youth festival will be celebrated. You people should also discuss this thing. I am hopeful that whatever experiences you will get in these four days that will guide you for the rest of your life, which will provide you direction for the rest of your life. 

My young friends, this time the theme for youth festival is: getting success by making pledge. You must have heard these words several times in the last 6-7 months. Sankalp Se Siddhi (Success by making pledges), what it is all about? 

It’s not a mobile App which is being downloaded, installed and it starts running. That is why today I would discuss with you people about the pledge and its realisation in great detail. 

What is ‘pledge’ all about? What is to be achieved? 

Friends, our country will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022. You would have read about the freedom struggle in books only. I myself have heard or read about the freedom struggle. There may be difference in our ages but in this regard I’m not different from you people. 

My young friends, we had not participated in the freedom struggle so it’s our responsibility to realize those dreams that were dreamt of by those freedom fighters. 

It is the responsibility of all of us to fulfill the dream of making that kind of India that our brave freedom fighters used to dream when British police used to lash them and they used to suffer all kind of tortures in those dark jail cells. When we will imagine those dreams, those concepts then we will be able to make a pledge for making the India of their dreams. What kind of India it will be, this New India will be? When you people go to the bed tonight after participating in the day long programmes today then think over them for some time. 

You should reflect on what is happening around you that you wish to change. 

What is that thing about which you always think which was not right and which must be changed. When you were coming here by train or when you were in school, college or in home or were in your locality and then you have thought that something was not right and it must be changed, you should think about that issue tonight as well. You should reflect on those issues that caught your attention but faded away, you should remember VivekanandaJi and I can say this thing with confidence that whatever you had experienced, whatever thing pained you and you had thought about changing that thing and if you are able to connect with that thing tonight then that wish will become your solemn pledge. Tonight, on the 12th of January those issues will become your solemn pledges. That thing will not become your pledge for sharing with others or for gaining any publicity but it will be your solemn pledge to yourself and it will be for starting that work once again from the tomorrow morning. 

Friends, the university campus where you are present now has been named after Gautam Buddha. 

The city where you are present – Greater Noida – it is also Gautam Buddha Nagar and therefore I will share a small story related to Gautam Buddha. It’s a small incident, not a big one. 

Once a disciple of Lord Buddha asked him, whether every disciple initiated by him, would be able to attain the salvation. Lord Buddha replied – No, only a few will get it. 

Some will not get the salvation. The disciple asked why was so? Then the Lord said only those who would properly understand his teachings will be able to attain the salvation and rest of them will keep wandering. 

Friends, you will get the same knowledge from the same teacher but how do you receive that, what kind of pledges you yourself make these things will determine your success or failure. 

Look, both Pandavas and Kauravas had the same Guru. 

Both of them got the same kind of education but how different were their personalities and deeds? It was because of the values of Kauravas and Pandavas were different.  You will meet a lot of people who will guide you in your journey of life but you alone will have to decide that after getting knowledge what path you will have to follow, what kind of pledges you will have to make. 

This is the essence of Gautam Buddha’s philosophy of AppaDeepoBhav. Become your own lamp, become your own light. Nobody will be there to make you take a pledge. 

Nobody will be there to remind you. Whatever you have to do, you will have to do that yourself. 

Brothers and sisters, Swami Vivekananda used to say that a ‘youth is who works in the direction of his future objectives without being concerned about the past’. Whatever the young people like you do today, that thing will determine the direction of the future of the country. Therefore whatever solemn pledges that you will make today, those solemn pledges after realisationwill make the country successful. 

There was a famous lyricist in Uttar Pradesh, he had written a lot in films – his name is ShrimanMazroohSultanpuri. One of his couplets is: 

‘I started off alone towards my destination but the people kept joining and it turned into a caravan.’

Friends, everybody will have to start off alone at some point of time or the other. 

 

If you have a clear conscience, if you have a clear objective and strong determination then people will automatically start getting associated with you. Today, I have the same expectation from you that you should not waver before taking your first step, you should not waver before making a new start after making a solemn pledge, and you should just make a solemn pledge and start off. 

The entire government, the entire country is by your side in every possible manner in your journey. I would like that those youth who want to do something on their own, who want to realize their dreams due to their hard work, they should get every kind of help.

When they start off then they should not worry about the bank guarantee, they should not worry about tax liability and they should not worry about the multitude of paper work. 

I expect that the youth of my country should become job creator, it should come forward for innovation and that is why continuous work is being done in this direction. 

Friends, our government has approved loans to 10 crore borrowers under the Prime Minister Mudra Scheme. A figure of 10 crore is very huge. 

These people have been provided loans worth Rs. 4 lakh crore without any bank guarantee. Just imagine, an amount of Rs. 4 lakh crore has been disbursed to these people without any bank guarantee, without asking how these loans will be repaid. 

People have started their own small businesses in villages, in towns, in cities and in rural areas. They have been realising their dreams. These people, these small and medium entrepreneurs are now becoming the employment providers. 

Brothers and sisters, there is only one basis for this massive scheme of the government – faith in you people, trust on the youth of the country. We are confident that when the youth of this country determines something then he can do wonders.These kinds of youth who are full of energy are present in every corner of the country. Someone is producing electricity from the small waterfalls in mountains, someone is producing electricity from waste and someone else is producing the construction material from the waste material, someone is providing health services in villages by using technology, and someone else has set up a food processing unit in his farm. These kinds of millions of youth have been working day and night for nation building. 

You have courage and you also have the wisdom to move in the right direction. That is why the government is making efforts to hold your hands. A little bit of support and rest you people are capable on your own. 

Friends, the government is also paying attention to this thing that people can get skill training as per the requirement of modern times. 

This is for the first time that any government has shown this kind of seriousness with regard to skill development. Otherwise earlier people used to become silent when they were asked about the difference between skill and education. 

Brothers and sisters, just reading this thing in the books that how to fly a plane and understanding it’s finer details in the book is education. However, flying a plane in real life is skill. If someone just gets the education but no skills then it’s difficult to get employment. 

That is why we have been moving ahead by focusing on skill development. It has been ensured that youths are skilled in addition to getting education. 

Millions of youths have been trained under the Skill India Mission. The government has been setting up Prime Minister Skill Development Centers across the country. India International Skill Centers have also been set up. The work is ongoing for establishing hundreds of multi-skill training institutes. This is for the first time when the financial assistance is being given to those companies which have been providing apprenticeship to youth. A part of the apprenticeship amount paid by the companies to students has been reimbursed by the government. 

Under the national apprenticeship scheme more than 7 lakh youths have been registered so far. The government has a target of providing apprenticeship training to 50 lakh youths in the next two-three years. The work to provide training to youth under the Prime Minister Youth Scheme has been done in more than three thousand institutes. 

It is the effort of the government to provide training to the youth as per the requirement of the country, as per the requirement of our industry. The skills of people are also being developed while keeping the requirement of foreign countries in the mind. 

Friends, I have full confidence in the youth of the country, I have full faith in the power of youth power, in the energy of young people of the country. If the dreams of the country reside somewhere then these are the hearts of the youth of the country. 

That is why we have focused our attention on that. 

Friends, some people say that today’s youth are impatient. But I say that precisely this thing becomes the cause of innovation in the young generation. 

There should be patience in life, impatient life is also not correct but this kind of patience is also not required that a person can’t think about new things and the life becomes stagnant. There is a lack of patience that is why today’s youth has been working at a fast pace, they are innovating and also producing results. 

Your innovations are related to social concerns be it Clean India Mission or BetiBachao-BetiPadhao project or be it Waste to Wealth. Nobody can have a better understanding than you people about the challenges and problems surrounding you. The government has started Atal Innovation Mission while keeping this capacity of you people for innovation in the mind. Emphasis has been placed on creating an eco-system for innovation in the schools and colleges of the country. Establishment of nearly 2,500 Atal Tinkering Labs across the country has been sanctioned to increase the scientific temper in the students and also to provide the right direction to their creativity. 

Atal Incubation Centers have been set up to encourage the innovation-entrepreneurship in sectors like manufacturing, transport, energy, agriculture, water and sanitation. These centers will provide financial assistance to start-ups and will also guide them in the right direction. 

Brothers and sisters, the start-up India programme is becoming the basis of start-up revolution in the country. The government has set up a start-up fund with an amount of Rs. 10,000 crore. 

Credit guarantee and tax exemptions are being given to the new start-ups. Government is providing legal assistance to them so that they can get their innovations patented. I am giving you this information because this information will help you to move ahead after you graduate from your colleges.

Today, whatever resolutions you people will make this information will help you inrealising them. No one will stop you to start your company or your start-up while you are completing your education. At that time you will get help from these initiatives of the government. 

Brothers and sisters, it is not necessary that everyone in the world will makeprogress only when they get facilities. Today so many foreign companies are being managed by the youth who went from India. They are presidents, chairman and CEOs of those companies. They have left their indelible impressions on these companies. Have they straight away reached to those positions? No. Have they straight away got those high offices on the lines of dynastic style of politics? No. They have worked hard. They have struggled. 

They had their dreams, they took risk and they had shed sweat day and night only then they had reached there. 

Indian youths have that capability that wherever they have gone they have brought laurels for the country and for themselves. You have seen that just two days ago Anchal Thakur has won the first international medal for India so far in the sports of skiing. A few days ago Manushi Chhillar had brought laurels for the country. 

I believe that those who are on social media they will be certainly taking the updates on daily basis about where those six daughters have reached who have set off to circumnavigate the world. These are different voyages of achieving successes by making solemn pledges and they have been becoming a source of inspiration for everyone.

Friends, today, I will also urge you to make sports a part of your life. 

RajyavardhanJi present on dais now and I believe that he is a minister later but first he is an Olympian, and a wonderful shooter. 

Even otherwise, our courageous, go-getter young chief minister Shriman Yogi Ji is no less a sportsperson. These days a lot of people in many states have been facing a tough time due to his work. I have seen that our Yogi Ji has been playing twitter-twitter these days and he has beaten a lot of experts in the field of twitter. Anyway, if I focus on sports onlythen sport, in a way, is a medium for getting education which not only makes the body energetic but which also revives your mind. We learn discipline from sports. 

Playground teaches us the meaning of defeat. Playgrounds teach us to work extremely hard to achieve our target. What is the meaning of team spirit, we learn this thing for the first time in a play ground. Whether we win or lose but the sportsmen spirit that we learn in the playground that remains with us throughout our lives. That is why I say that: who played, they flourished as well. You people should also play hard and flourish abundantly. 

You people should also include Yoga in your lives along with sports. I have been told that you people will do Yoga daily in this youth festival. You people should go back with this practice. You will become physically and mentally strong due to Yoga. 

My friends, please come forward, develop yourself and expand your personalities. 

In this youth festival your friends those who have come from different states, you should mingle with them, you should talk to them a lot, please understand them and their languages, understand their eating habits and their way of living. 

My experience suggests that whatever you people will learn in this youth festival, whatever relations that you will develop, these things will remain with you, will be of use to you people for the rest of your life. 

Friends, this is also a resolution that will help to achieve Ek Bharat and Shreshtha Bharat (One India and Great India). 

Friends, our respected ShrimanAtalBihari Vajpayee Ji used to say: ‘We will have to take the journey of our public life to the pinnacle of success our objectives by working shoulder to shoulder, by taking steps together and the India of future depends on our efforts and our hard work.’

Please come forward, all of us together, youth of the country by working together, and 1.25 billion people should work extremely hard together to put our energy in nation building and we should make a New India. 

While wishing all of you once again on the occasion of youth day and youth festival and while again remembering Swami Vivekananda, and also the path shown by him, the path of social harmony, the path for getting rid of the concept of superior and inferior which was shown by him, the path of living and dying for the country which was shown by him, and on the occasion of birth anniversary of such a great soul I conclude my speech with these wishes that you people march ahead with the inspiration, capability and determination of youth. 

Thank you very much.

Jai Hind.

The Prime Minister said that as maritime neighbours, there is a vast scope for cooperation between India and Indonesia on development of Blue Economy as well as in the domain of maritime security.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the inaugural session of the PIO-Parliamentarian Conference in New Delhi. 

Welcoming the delegates to the Conference, the Prime Minister said that while many people may have left India over the course of hundreds of years, India continues to have a place in their minds and hearts. He said it is not surprising that people of Indian origin have integrated themselves fully with their adopted lands. He added that while they kept the Indian-ness alive in themselves, they also imbibed the language, food, and dress of those countries.

The Prime Minister said that it appears as if a Mini World Parliament of Indian origin is gathered in Delhi today. He noted that persons of Indian origin are today Prime Ministers of Mauritius, Portugal and Ireland. He added that persons of Indian origin have also been Heads of State and Heads of Government in many other countries.

The Prime Minister said that the global impression about India has changed over the last three to four years. He said the reason for this is that India is transforming itself. He said the hopes and aspirations of India are at an all time high. He said signs of irreversible change are visible in every sector.

The Prime Minister said that PIOs are like permanent ambassadors of India, wherever they reside, and he always attempts to meet them when he is travelling abroad.

The Prime Minister praised External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj for continuously keeping an eye on issues being faced by Indian citizens abroad. In this context, he mentioned the ""MADAD"" portal for real time monitoring and response of consular grievances.

The Prime Minister said that the Government believes that NRIs are partners for India's development. He said that NRIs have an important position in the Action Agenda till 2020, drafted by the NITI Aayog.

The Prime Minister said that the values of Indian civilization and culture can provide guidance to the entire world, in an era of instability.

The Prime Minister said that India has very close ties with ASEAN countries, which will be showcased during Republic Day, a few days from now.

                My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Pravasi Bhartiya Day. In this tradition of Pravasi Divas, this first Pravasi Parliamentarian Conference is adding a new chapter today. I extend a warm welcome to all the friends who have come from North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Pacific region and also from all corners of the world. 

Welcome to India! Welcome Home!

Your ancestors, your old memories are connected to different parts of the country. Some of your ancestors went abroad for business and education. Some of them were forcibly taken out of the country while some others were taken out of the country by using allurement. They might have physically left this place but they had left a part of their soul, their mind on this land. And that is why when you land on any airport of India then those parts of their souls feel delighted by seeing you on this land. 

At that time your throat gets choked, some emotions want to express themselves in the form of tears. You people try your best to control outpouring of those emotions but you don’t succeed. Your eyes become moist due to tears but they also lit up due to your visit to India. I can understand your feelings. This affection, this love, this respect, the scent of air of this place, that smell of this land, I bow down to that part because of which it is there. We all can imagine that how happy your ancestors would be by seeing you here today. Wherever they might be, they will be the happiest to see you on this land. 

Friends, 

India never went out of the hearts of those people who went out of India during the last hundreds of year. They kept alive Indian civilization and values in whichever part of the world they settled. And it’s not surprising that wherever the people of Indian origin settled they adopted that place as their home by fully integrating with it. 

 

While on the one hand they kept alive Indian values within themselves, and on the other they fully integrated themselves with the language, with the food and attires of that country. 

People of Indian origin have left their impressions in the fields of sports, arts and cinema on global platform. If I talk about politics then I can see that how a mini-world parliament of people of Indian origin before my eyes. Today, the people of Indian origin are Prime Ministers of Mauritius, Portugal and Ireland. People of Indian origin have occupied the offices of heads of state and heads of government in several countries. It is a matter of great pride for us that the former President of Guyana Shri Bharat Jagdev ji is today present here with us. All of you distinguished people have also been playing important roles in the politics of your countries. 

Friends, 

India - the motherland of your ancestors are proud of you. Your achievements and successes are a matter of pride and respect for us. When the media reports the news of you people assuming an office or even news of filing of nomination by you people then it has a great readership and viewership in India. How you people are affecting the geo politics of entire region, how you people have been formulating the policies of your respective countries, people in India read these stories with great interest. They also discuss these developments here like: look, one of us has occupied that high office. You people deserve praise for giving us this happiness, for making us proud. 

Brothers and sisters, 

You people have been living in different countries for such a long time. You would have experienced that in the last three-four years that the approach about India has changed. There is a greater focus about India; the approach of the world towards us has been changing. The main reason behind this thing is that India itself is changing, it has been transforming itself. And in addition to the changes at economic and social levels, this change has also come about at the level of ideas as well. India has come a long way from this kind of thinking that: ‘nothing will change; it will continue to run the way it has been; nothing is going to happen.' This time the hopes and expectations of Indians are at the highest level. You will see a complete transformation in the systems; you will see the impact of an irreversible change in every sector.


	India received an unprecedented FDI of $60 billion in 2016-2017 as a result of this thing.
	Ease of Doing Business ranking has improved by 42 notches in the last 3 years. 
	We have scaled 32 notches in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index in the last 2 years. 
	Our Global Innovation Index has improved by 21 notches in the last 2 years. 
	Logistics Performance Index has improved by 19 points. 
	Today, institutions like the World Bank, IMF and Moody’s have been looking at India in a very positive manner. 
	More than half of the total investment in the sectors like construction, air transport, mining, computer – software and hardware, electrical equipments has come in the last 3 years alone. 


All these things became possible only because we have been bringing about far reaching policy reforms in every sector of Indian economy.  Our guiding principle is: ‘Reform to transform’. Our objective is to the make the entire system transparent and accountable. Our objective is to completely eradicate the corruption. 

Friends, 

We have abolished the web of hundreds of taxes in the country through the GST - Goods and Services Tax - and integrated the country economically. There is not a single sector like Mining, Fertilizers, Textiles, Aviation, Health, Defense, Construction, Real Estate, and Food Processing, in which we have not brought in reforms. 

Friends, 

Today, India is the youngest country of the world. Youth have unlimited dreams and expectations. The government has continuously been working so that they can channelize their energy in the right field, so that they can do business on their own. 

Schemes like Skill India Mission, Start up Scheme, Stand up Scheme and Mudra Scheme have been started precisely for this reason. More than 10 crore loans have been sanctioned under the Mudra scheme for self-employment. More than Rs. 4 lakh crore have been disbursed to the people without any bank guarantee. This scheme alone has provided 3 crore new entrepreneurs to the country. The government has been increasing the investment in the infrastructure and transport sectors by keeping the requirements of the India of the 21st century in mind. This thing has been given special importance in the policy that what kind of logistics India will need in future. Highways, Railways, Airways, Waterways and ports are being developed in such a manner so that they are connected to each other and can support each other.

Friends, 

Today, new railway tracks in India have been laid at twice the speed. Doubling of tracks has been taking place at more than twice the speed. National highways have been built at twice the speed. More than double new renewable energy capacity has been connected to the grid. 

While the cargo handling growth in the shipping industry was in negative earlier, in this government it has registered a growth of 11%. New employment opportunities are being generated due to all these efforts. Small scale industries are getting new work at local level. For example if we talk about Ujjwala scheme then it is not only limited to providing free gas connection to poor women. This scheme has given relief from kitchen smoke to more than three crore women. It has not only helped in making the states Kerosene free but has one more advantage also. New cooking gas dealers have been appointed and the number of gas delivery men has gone up after the launch of Ujjwala scheme. It means that that in addition to social reforms the economic empowerment of society is also taking place. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Our culture which believes that the whole world is a family has given a lot to the world. When I have gone to the United Nations for the first time then I have put forward the proposal of having an International Yoga Day before the world. All of you are aware that not only within 75 days this proposal was cleared unanimously but it was co-sponsored by 177 countries. Today, the way millions and millions of people around the world celebrate 21st June as Yoga Day, it’s a matter of pride for you and for us. 

This method of holistic living is a gift of rich traditions of India. 

Friends

I, along with the President of France, have proposed to form an International Solar Alliance at the time of Paris agreement on climate change. Now it has become reality. We have been making a global platform for solar technology and financing with the help of solar rich countries. 

This method of living by maintaining balance with the nature is also an Indian contribution for ages.  

Brothers and sisters,

When an earthquake struck Nepal or when there was a flood in Sri Lanka or when there was a shortage of water in Maldives then India reached there as the first responder. 

When there was a crisis in Yemen then we safely evacuated our 4,500 citizens, but we also evacuated 2,000 citizens of 48 other countries. 

Protecting the human values even the times of grave crisis is part of Indian tradition of considering the entire world as one family. 

Friends,

In 2018, it will be hundred year of the World War I. More than 1.5 lakh Indian soldiers have sacrificed their lives in the first and second world wars. And it was when India was not directly involved with those wars. India did not have any interest in a single inch of land of any country in both the world wars. The world will have to recognize what a great sacrifice was made by India. And this tradition has continued even after the independence. India is one among those nations which make the maximum contribution to the UN peace keeping forces. This is India’s message of sacrifice to the world for human values and peace. 

This renunciation of self-interest, this feeling of service and renunciation is our identity. 

India has a special acceptance in the world due to this human value. And along with India, the society of people of Indian origin, you people also have a special acceptance. 

 

Friends,

Whenever I visit any country then I always try to meet with the people of Indian origin living in that country. And I was fortunate to meet some of you during such visits. And the biggest reason behind my effort is that I believe that if there are any permanent ambassadors for promoting India’s relations then these are the people of Indian origin. It is our constant endeavor that we should be in regular touch with non-resident Indians and continue to solve their problems. 

Earlier there was a separate ministry for overseas Indians but we received the feedback from non-resident Indians that there was a problem of coordination with the ministry of external affairs. We merged both the ministries into one after getting feedback from you people. You would be aware that earlier there were two distinct schemes – PIO and OCI and most of the people were not even aware about the distinction between the two. We simplified the process and created one scheme by merging them. 

Our Minister of External affairs, Sushma Swaraj Ji, not only keeps an eye on the problems of Indian citizens but she also keeps an eye on the people of Indian origin 24x7, you will find her very active. Under her leadership, Minister of External affairs has created a Madad portal for real time monitoring and extending help for consular grievances. At present, Pravasi Bhartiya Day has been organised in every alternate year. In addition to this, regional Pravasi Bhartiya Days have also been organised. Sushma Ji has just come back after participating in such a conference in Singapore. 

Brothers and sisters,

Today, the building in which we all are present, this building has been dedicated to all of you – the people of Indian origin on the 2nd of October 2016. It is a matter of great happiness that in such a short span of time this centre has emerged as a hub for people of Indian origin. I will urge you people that you must visit the exhibition on the life of Mahatma Gandhi which has been organised here.

 

We have seen the result of these efforts aimed at connecting with the minds of overseas Indians in the quiz competition - Know India. More than 5,700 overseas Indian youths of over hundred countries participated in the competition. Their enthusiasm and attraction for India is very encouraging for all of us. While getting inspiration from them, this year we have been organizing the quiz even at a greater scale. 

Friends,

India also gets respect by your contribution in the development of your respective countries. And India’s progress and development result in the increased respect for overseas Indian community. We consider overseas Indians as our partners in our efforts for the development of India. Overseas Indians have been assigned a special place in the action agenda prepared for India’s development till 2020 by Niti Aayog. 

Brothers and sisters,

Overseas Indians have several ways for contributing to India’s developmental journey. India is the largest recipient of overseas remittances in the world. 

We are indebted to every Indian living abroad for making this important contribution in India’s economy. There is one more way for making investment in Indian economy. Today, if India is the most attractive destination for FDI in the world then the contribution of overseas Indians in creating awareness and facilitating this thing is immense. I think that given the importance that you people enjoy in your societies you can play the role of catalyst in this thing. In this context, the Diaspora of people of Indian origin can immensely contribute in promoting the tourism. 

Friends, 

CEOs and leaders of some of the top world companies are our overseas Indians. They fully understand India’s economy. That is why we are grateful to them for their strong confidence in India’s developmental journey. Today, every Indian settled abroad considers him a stake-holder in India’s growth. And they want to become a part in this change; they want to shoulder their responsibility. They want to see the further rise of their country on the global stage. We are aware about the importance of your experience for bringing about social and economic changes of the country. A scheme called VAJRA means Visiting Adjunct Joint Research Faculty has been started so that your experience can help India. 

You can work in Indian institutions for up to three months under this scheme. 

Today, I appeal to all of you from this platform that you should associate yourselves with this scheme and also encourage Indians in your country to get associated with it. You will also feel good when your experience will benefit young generation of India. Nobody else has the kind of capacity that you people have to introduce India’s requirements, India’s strength and uniqueness to the world. 

The values of Indian civilization and culture can guide the entire world in this chaotic environment. The concerns over the health care are on the rise in the world. And you can tell the world about your old tradition of holistic living. In such a time when the world community is getting divided in different ideologies and at different levels you can give the example of India’s inclusive philosophy of Sabka Sath – Sabka Vikas (With all, development of all) that takes along everyone.  When the concerns over extremism and radicalization are on the rise in the world then you can reiterate Indian culture’s message of ‘amity between all religions. 

Friends,

All of you are aware that in 2019 a Kumbh Fair will be organised in Prayag-Allahabad. It is also a matter of pride for all of us that recently Kumbh fair was included in the UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list. Uttar Pradesh government has started its preparation on a comprehensive scale. I’d like to urge you people that when you visit India next year then you must come prepared to pay a visit to Prayag. If you tell other people in your country about this grand event then they will also become aware about this legacy of Indian culture. 

Brothers and sisters,

The world is facing some huge challenges and in order to overcome them the ideas of Gandhi Ji are still relevant. Any dispute can be solved by following the path of non-violence and passive resistance. If there is any ideology that can counter extremism and radicalization then it is the ideology of Gandhi Ji; it’s the ideology of Indian values. 

 

Friends,

We want to move forward by joining hands with you in order to make a developed India and for realising the dream of a New India. In this conference we want to be benefit from your experience. We want to inform you about the development of a New India, we want to associate ourselves with you. Wherever you may be, in whichever country you might live, we want to become a partner in your developmental journey. 

Friends, 

The 21st century is called Asian century. And India will certainly have an important role in it. Wherever you may be living, you will feel the impact of this role, will feel the impact of rising stature of India. We will be encouraged to work even harder when your heads are held high after witnessing India’s economic growth and rising power. 

Brothers and sisters,

India is that country which has always played a positive role in the global arena. We have never assessed our policy towards any country on the scale of profit and loss but we saw it through the prism of human values. 

Our model for giving developmental aid is not based on give and take. But it depends on the requirements and priorities of recipient countries. We neither have any intention to exploit anybody’s resources nor do we covet any country’s territory. Our focus has always been on capacity building and resource development. On every platform we have made efforts to move forward by taking everyone along be it a bilateral or multilateral platform, be it commonwealth or India-Africa Forum Summit or be it Forum for India–Pacific Islands Cooperation. 

We have given a more strong shape to our already strong relations with ASEAN countries by taking forward our relations with them. The world will be able to see how strong India-ASEAN relations are in a few days from now on the occasion of Republic Day.  

 

Friends,

India has been supporter of happiness, peace, prosperity, democratic values, inclusiveness, cooperation and brotherhood in the entire world. These are the same values that connect you with your electorate as a people’s representative. This is our attempt and it is our commitment as well that India will continue to contribute for peace, progress and prosperity in the world.  

Friends,

Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to you people for accepting our invitation and for taking time out from your busy schedules to attend this conference. I am confident that this conference will be successful due to your active participation. I hope that I will get another opportunity to meet you people in the Pravasi Bhartiya Divas next year. 

Thank you very much. 

Jai Hind.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Valedictory Ceremony at the Conference of Director Generals and Inspector Generals of Police at BSF Academy at Tekanpur.

 

The Prime Minister recalled how the nature and scope of the Conference have changed since 2014, beginning with its being shifted out of Delhi. He appreciated the officers who have been instrumental in facilitating this change. The Prime Minister said that the Conference has now become more relevant, in the context of challenges and responsibilities facing the country. He said the new format of the Conference has resulted in a marked improvement in the quality of discussions. 

 

He commended the country's security apparatus for the work they are doing in securing the country. He said that the officers present in the gathering today  have  delivered  leadership, despite often having to operate in an environment of  negativity. 

 

He said that as a result of the discussions in this Conference over the last few years, now, once an objective is clearly defined for the police force, there is a lot of cohesion in the execution. He said this Conference is helping top police officers get a more holistic view of problems and challenges. He said the range of topics being discussed has become more broad-based over the last two years. This has helped give a whole new vision to senior police officers, he added. 

 

Discussing ways to add even more value to this Conference, the Prime Minister suggested that follow up should continue through working groups, all the year round. In this context, he specially emphasized the importance of involving younger officers. He said this would greatly help in improving effectiveness of the exercise. 

 

The Prime Minister mentioned the emerging global consensus towards greater information sharing on illicit financial dealings, and said India had a key role to play in achieving this. He said just as openness is getting increased acceptance worldwide, there is need for greater openness among States too, on security issues. He said that security cannot be achieved selectively, or alone. But breaking of silos and information sharing among states can help make everyone more secure. ""We are not an assembled entity, but an organic entity,"" he asserted. 

 

The Prime Minister said cyber security issues should be dealt with immediately, and should receive highest priority. In this context, he particularly mentioned the importance of social media. He said messaging should rely on local languages for greater effectiveness. On radicalization too, the Prime Minister urged the use of technology to pinpoint problem areas.  

 

The Prime Minister also presented President's Police Medals for Distinguished Service to IB officers. During his address the Prime Minister congratulated and appreciated the medal winning officers of IB, for their dedication and commitment to service. 

 

Union Home Minister Shri Raj Nath Singh, and Union Ministers of State for Home Shri Hansraj Ahir and Shri Kiren Rijiju were present on the occasion.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will attend the Annual Conference of DGPs and IGPs on 7th and 8th January at the BSF Academy at Tekanpur, Madhya Pradesh. 

DGPs Conference is an annual event in which top police officers from all over the country share and discuss security related issues. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has addressed the conference earlier in Guwahati, Assam in 2014, Dhordo, Rann of Kutch, Gujarat in 2015 and National Police Academy, Hyderabad in 2016.  

During the last meeting, issues such as cross-border terrorism and radicalization were discussed in detail. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of leadership, soft skills and collective training. He specifically mentioned the importance of technology and human interface for the police force.

Holding the Annual DGP Conference outside the national capital, is in line with Prime Minister's vision that such conferences should be held across the country, and not just confined to Delhi.

                Friends, this is the beginning of the Year 2018. My best wishes to you all! This is the first official programme in this building. It was inaugurated on 7th December 2017, but this marks the first official programme which is being organized in this building. But I am glad that this is associated with that great man whose ideas and thoughts have been discussed at global level. The significance of the on-going programme in this building increases manifold because Babasaheb had been battling for Social Justice throughout his life.

 

Our Constitution also provides a Framework for those requirements. Now Social Justice is not limited to just one social order. An area remaining backward also amounts to injustice. In such a scenario only one village or one entity does not remain backward but this injustice is being done to the people as well who are living there; as their facilities, rights, opportunities and every such thing are being compromised. Therefore, 115 districts will become a part of every effort to achieve systematic solutions of Babasaheb Ambedkar's commitment to social justice for their development. So, in that sense, I believe that the first programme in this building with this subject is an auspicious sign in itself.

 

You have been discussing and debating for the past 2 days. On the basis of my experience I can say that nothing is impossible in our country if we are determined to do something. Even after the nationalization of banks, the system remained inaccessible to about 30 crore people. But once this country is determined that whatever has happened is the story of the past and now this is not acceptable, the opening of Jan-Dhan accounts has become a mass movement so that the person in the remotest corner of the country realises that he has become a part of the mainstream. This very country, the government and the people have proved this fact and that too within the time limit.

 

We used to say that there should be toilets; programmes were being implemented; budget allocations were made; reports were prepared and progress made. We used to be satisfied on knowing that we have progressed 5 steps or 6 steps or 7 steps. We used to find easy solutions but the root cause of the problems continued to plague the system. The lack of toilets and problem of sanitation led to dropout of girls from schools. But once we were determined to come out of the problem, to sensitize everyone and to enhance our pace of work manifold than the previous average, the same team and system achieved the objective of constructing toilets in more than 4 lakh schools under real time monitoring. Everyone had uploaded photographs and anyone could verify them. This very country and this very government system had proven itself. 

 

When it came to providing electricity to 18000 villages in 1000 days, the officers said that on the normal course it would take 5 to 7 years to complete. But once they accepted this as a challenge, the same team with the same set of rules, system and techniques successfully carried out the work of electrifying 18000 villages in a time bound manner. 

 

Soil testing was a new topic and the farmer was not familiar with these things. Moreover he did not know anything about the benefits arising from this. But once they were told that soil testing must be done and soil health cards must be made and soil should be analysed, the same system, same set of people, same team decided to accomplish it. I was told that the target would be achieved before time as per one report.

 

With these examples I want to tell you all that we have immense potential. We are leading the system in the age of immense possibilities and we can give birth to a number of possibilities as well as to the number of achievements. I am gaining experience; learning and my beliefs are growing stronger. We worry about the pending things and feel that these will be accomplished. I believe that every government at some point of time would have felt the pain of having a low ‘ease of doing business’ score. Everyone might have thought how long would it continue in this manner? How long would we stay behind in the world arena? Today it is indispensable for India to position itself in the global order according to the global environment. There is no other option. The attraction towards India could be changed into an opportunity and to her benefit.

 

With that belief the hurdles on the way of ease of doing business were identified and new paths were charted. A small workshop was organised systematically and the chief ministers and chief executives were called and sensitized. The department came up with new solutions; a lot of homework was done and rolled out. Consequently, no other country than India got the opportunity to make such a big leap in the rankings of ease of doing business. In the year 2014 our rank was 142 which improved to 100 in 2017. We moved ahead by 42 ranks. How was this possible? It was not because of an editorial page or because of a politician’s photograph on TV or because of a splendid speech by a politician. This was possible only because of your efforts, hard work and dedication; by you I mean the team of my country. Therefore my belief has strengthened and I believe that we can find solutions to the problems if the root cause of the problems can be identified. Things that are imposed can also be accomplished, but with half-hearted efforts. The things done with half-hearted efforts are lifeless and neither have any identity nor do you get any results. 

 

You are those people who have gone through the same circumstances; you are the decision makers today but a gap of 15, 20 or 25 years has been created. Today the world has transformed, the aspirations of the people have changed; the thinking process has changed and the system has changed. You know this very well because you have gone through the same situations. What should I do? Will I not be able to fulfil those dreams which I had taken to Mussoorie at that time? 5 or 7 years later such responsibilities may change and I may not be in a position to fulfil them.

 

Today this is one of the greatest opportunities. What do you think? What does your experience say? How can your experience be prioritised while creating a roadmap? I could see all these features in your presentation. I can feel that the person is well aware of the fact that everything else is fine, the budget is fine but the root cause of the problem is somewhere else. If someone solves this problem then a new pathway can be opened up. 

 

Today I could feel the clarity of thought in your presentation. I could feel the faith and conviction in your presentation and your self-confidence was well reflected in the way you were talking with conviction. I was not only looking at the person who was making the presentation, but also paying attention to the slides and the audience. I could see a spark in the eyes of everyone. I could see the 'New India'.

 

Therefore it is a collective sentiment which could be carried forward with everyone's efforts. It is human nature to finish the easier tasks beforehand. I have worked in public life and I have spent several years of my life working for my organisation.

 

Even in our schools our teacher used to tell us to attempt easy questions first in a three hour examination and attempt the difficult ones later. As a result we have developed that mind-set of doing easier things first. In this process could not reach and face the challenge and became sick by the time we reached there. Therefore, we tend to live in our comfort zone. If a department feels the need of showing some work, to achieve some all India target in agriculture or MSME or any industry, some sincere people are selected who are pushed to work and the average of the department becomes good. Thus, a strategy is set wherein some people who work are overburdened with work and the national level goals and figures are maintained in this manner.

 

When I was the Chief Minister, initially I did not get any benefits. When the Planning Commission existed our turn used to come at the end. But I had learnt this technique. So I used to be conscious in the month of January as to which departments had not utilized the budget. I used to identify the departments that were struggling to use their allocated budget amount. I used to send the officers to identify the gaps. I noticed that whatever I didn't achieve in the beginning was achieved later and that too in greater quantity. This is because the people, who have the habit of performing, perform well wherever there is good governance in place. We should come out of the old mind-set. Adding two teaspoon of sugar to a sweet tea won't make much of a difference as sugar will anyway be consumed; but if sugar is added to a sugarless tea, it will be a sweet experience indeed. Therefore, in our attempt to focus on 115 districts, efforts are being made to select at least one district from each state. Even in a well-developed state, one or the other district may remain backward. As a result even psychologically it affects. For example, if an officer gets appointed in a backward district, everyone else starts pointing out, “Oh! You got this district!” Consequently the person becomes demotivated to work. Such a district can never grab opportunities. Officers and teachers pass time and try to move out of that place. The government too keeps quiet and accepts the way things are moving. It avoids taking action or punishing. A psychology of merely passing the time develops. Consequently, the districts remain in the same place without any improvement. The experts of development sciences know that the state which is developing looks good initially but gradually after a point such regions start pulling down the not-so-developed regions. In that case, it becomes difficult to control the situation which may take 5 to 7 years. One should not let this saturation point to be reached when it becomes extremely difficult for the backward regions to catch up with the developed ones as that state can never develop in that case.

 

One way to change this situation was to come out of some of these problems. Now you have formed many strategies. Problems of every district are not the same. India is full of diversity. Each one has its unique issues. Each one also has its own opportunities. Is it possible to achieve the targets by focussing upon low hanging fruits based on five or six parameters? This is important because as per the experience, you might have experienced by and large in these regions that even if you are extremely enthusiastic, committed and dedicated, you will find some people in your office to demotivate you by saying – ‘there is no point working here, nothing will change, you are wasting your time, you are new so are unaware’. They will shower you with such knowledge. Therefore, to change the psychology, there needs to be a success story. Success stories build up their confidence - yes this is possible! Your foremost strategy should be to turn the pessimistic mind-set to an optimistic system. What can be the ways to achieve this? Like, I have suggested one way of achieving the low hanging fruits immediately. You only will do the work and achieve the targets which can prove to be encouraging. 

 

The second task is not so easy - mass movement. Initiating a mass movement is not an easy task. By and large, there is always a sparking point for possibilities of a mass movement in a negative way; but to create a mass movement in a positive way requires educating the core team. 'Meeting of mind' is extremely important. Gradually a single layer, then double layers, and multiple layers will develop to create a team and a system where your ideas will become the ideas of your team. Ultimately what was the purpose of this two-day workshop? This was it. There should be a perfect alignment of the ideas and thoughts of the people of the Indian government and you all. A meeting point has to be decided by negotiating. 'Meeting of mind' needs to be created only then will it click between both the parties.

 

This two-day exercise was not to throw knowledge at you or to show that you don't know anything and only these people sitting here know everything. It was also not that they were here to teach you everything. They also wanted to incorporate the experiences that you all have in the policy making exercise. Therefore, this workshop has its own greatness. Can you carve out a tehsil in your district? Can a district be chalked out? This programme churns that kind of thinking. What can happen? What are our capabilities? What are our limitations? But if adopt a casual attitude then possibly you won't be able to convince people about your ideas. They might not find it interesting and may not show interest in associating with it. 

 

Suppose there is a person locked inside a room. He takes his hands out through a small hole made on the door. People outside are asked to shake hands with that person. People are standing in a queue to shake hands with a person they are not aware of. You tell me what will happen? Try to imagine. There is a person locked inside a room with only the hands out through a hole on a door and you have to stand in a queue to shake hands. You can imagine what will happen. But if you are told that the person inside the locked room is Sachin Tendulkar, the scenario will suddenly change. The way of shaking hands will also change. Just look at the power of information. If the people you want to involve in your work are well informed, there will be a better cooperation. You can imagine how your third generation will feel proud of it. They will start associating themselves with it.

 

Public participation- it is not possible unless you prepare a systematic scheme to connect people. Swachh Bharat Mission - media has played a very positive role with visible impacts. The team has made efforts to involve itself from top to bottom. It has made a natural impact and consequently everyone is contributing in his or her way and feeling proud of it. You must have seen that children are in the core of success of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. They have turned out to be Ambassadors of the programme. Even in their homes the children stop their grandfathers from littering. They say ‘Modi ji has prohibited that act’. This strength of messaging brings the change. Is it appropriate to say about ‘malnutrition’ or shall we say about ‘nutrition’? Shall we call it a backward district or an aspirational district? This is because it leaves an impact on the psychology.

 

We should make our vocabulary positive. This too is a cause for developing a positive mind-set. You can automatically notice the impact of this activity in your surroundings. I clearly remember one of my friends living in Mumbai. He had this typical habit. He was elder to me. Now the people of Gujarat in particular and the country in general have this habit of inquiring about a person's well-being on meeting. So if someone used to enquire about his health while meeting he used to retort - ‘I have problems with my sleep....’ So on and so forth. In a way it used to give him pleasure by talking like that. Those of us who knew him well once decided in a practical way that whenever we would meet him we should start our conversation in a positive way: ' wow! You look great! Looks like you are in your best of health!' Suddenly there used to be a glow on his face. The situation changed. His pessimistic attitude had totally gone. Our conversations should be laden with positivity. Which one will work: malnutrition or nutrition? You yourself will find the right direction. For example, the word ASHA worker in itself is laden with so much strength and positivity. That lady is working there. Whatever she does, the people become hopeful of positive outcomes.

 

Such narratives will be different for different languages. A single word is not used in every region of the country but locals should develop these things. Secondly, talking of malnutrition, can we have a poetry competition on nutrition? Now you all may feel that how will Modi's poetry competition lead to nutrition? But see, in schools the teachers will encourage poetry writing. Can we have drama programmes organized on nutrition? I clearly remember, once I had attended a 15 minute programme conducted by children of Anganwadi. One child played the role of a tomato, another of a carrot and yet another of a cabbage and delivered their dialogues - like I am a carrot and these are my benefits. In this way, all the children came to know about the benefits of carrots and were encouraged to consume carrots. Earlier the child never touched carrots even after repeated insistence of mother. But after the programme the child himself started demanding carrots -' Mother I will eat carrots'. What I mean to say is that can we connect people to such mass movements through slogan competitions? In the beginning the results of Nutrition may not be visible but gradually it will gain momentum. 

 

Now suppose we meet some influential people of an area and ask them to cook meal and serve it to the children of Anganwadis on some special occasions like birthday, marriage anniversary or death anniversary, you will get 70-80 days in a year to get involved here. They will be satisfied to have engaged with Anganwadi children. You can see a positive change in the environment.

 

If we talk of school dropouts, sometimes tour programmes are organized for the kids. What type of activities is organized? They are sometimes taken to temples or to the banks of a river and sometimes to a garden. Can these children be taken to a nearby primary school? These kids will see the school students playing in the ground and themselves will play with them. They can have the midday meal with the school students. The children of Anganwadi will start developing the interest of going to school. 'I want to attend this school. It is a good school, big school with a nice playground.' It is a small thing but change begins from here.

 

You might be aware that I had started a small programme. Whenever I am invited to a convocation ceremony I request the university to allow 50 special guests as well to be seated in the front rows. Well, no one can refuse the request made by a Prime Minister. They are under the impression that those guests will be from BJP. It is natural to think that way as this is the convention. Then I reveal that 50 poor students from government school should also be invited as special guests as I talk to them after the convocation. Whenever these children look at the students wearing gowns and the special caps receiving their degrees, aspirations arise in their minds to be on the same platform one day. This cannot be achieved even with a long lecture. It is essential for the people of aspirational districts to have aspirations in them. We shall identify the aspirations. I am not asking to develop new aspirations but to channelize those already existing. In this way we can accomplish tasks by public participation.

 

Every school conducts assembly in the morning. Every day one student can talk on some topic for 10 minutes regarding our target of 2022, be it help or nutrition and so on. In this way the subjects start spreading. What I mean to say is that unless we connect these things to the masses we will not be able to achieve the results. 

 

Secondly, suppose we have some 6 target points. We can achieve One Target properly then move on to the second one to accomplish it successfully. Can we develop these 6, 10 or 15 things as models within 3 to 4 months? Then this will set an example for the people of other districts. People will feel that this is possible even in their districts or villages. If we go by this tradition then I believe the targets set for the 115 districts will also be achieved.

 

Another issue is that of infrastructure. It is true that there is a demand for construction of roads and sometimes there is a constraint of budget but if a condition is imposed on the masses to plant trees on both sides of the roads as a prerequisite for the construction of the road, automatically a sense of responsibility will develop in the villagers. They will start planting trees immediately and later the road can be constructed through MGNREGA and contractors will arrive. The aspirations of the people should merge with the schemes of the government with public participation. Simplicity increases with public participation. There is one more problem. A few officers are really creative and dynamic. He comes up with new ideas and initiatives but wants those things to end with his tenure. Unfortunately, in most of the states there is a lack of stability. Sometimes the officers are transferred within one or 1.5 years which is a cause of concern. Anyway, with outcomes new paths will be discovered. But if we form a team, even without any leadership if the team is a robust one, with division of labour, clear roadmap, monitoring system, and a fixed time frame, results can be automatically obtained. I believe we should make efforts in that direction. You can very well accomplish that with the enthusiasm and excitement that I could see. You don't know but these 115 districts of the society that have become a burden on them will soon lift their heads up and will never stop after that. 

 

You must have seen some places in India that later developed due to one or two main reasons. You will find 50 to 100 such areas in India that have suddenly developed. With a single breakthrough, things will start developing. Can imagine that even if these 115 districts move ahead by ten steps then how much this country is going to transform? Even the government will start focusing on those areas and prioritising them.

 

It is human nature to wish for a window seat in a train. Similarly a person would wish for a comfortable seat to obtain more leg space while travelling in an aeroplane. This is human nature and I don't consider that as bad. While getting posted we all know that some districts of every state are good and some are backward and undesirable. If someone is posted in a backward district, his friends will also say- 'Man, you are stuck now! But don't worry it's just a matter of 6-8 months'. This psychology begins from there only. I believe that the developed districts will by and large suit them. But the young officer can never improve his life there. He jumps into that road and continues with his hunky dory life. But the person, who rides onto a difficult terrain, bears the suffering in a posting which is a bad one in the eyes of some of the colleagues, will one day realise that even though it was a difficult phase of life, it made him a stronger person.

 

You will see that whenever you talk to an officer of a high stature, he would have worked hard, passed exam, completed his training in Mussoorie and entered the service but there would be hidden struggles in his life that had pushed him to work with dedication. He would tell you all that had happened while he was working as a Deputy Director and how one incident had changed his life. All the people of high stature usually have had faced a lot of hardships while those who were born with a golden spoon in their mouths, may get a good posting with a big bungalow of 2 acre area; but that person faces hurdles later in life even though in the earlier phase he leads an easy-going life.

I believe that those who have been given the responsibility of looking after the 115 districts are fortunate because they can feel satisfied in their life. Nobody notices the good initiatives in the already developed areas. There is nothing to be satisfied about even for you. It was the same and will remain the same. But if someone plants a single sapling in a desert, that is more satisfying as we can give life to something. You are those who have got this opportunity to deal with the challenges and you have the power to change the situation. You can evaluate yourself - the way you have progressed from your initial position. Challenges have their own strength and I don't consider those people who have never faced any challenge in their lives as fortunate. Only those who are capable of facing challenges can actually live a fruitful life. These help a person in his journey of life. I can feel the positivity in this room that is reflecting from your willingness and dedication. I believe that this is a great strength in itself and we should move ahead with this strength. This is the month of January and Babasaheb’s birth anniversary is on 14th April. Can we prepare a timetable till 14th April to monitor the progress of 115 districts? I wish to visit the district that will be making a rapid progress and spend time with the team to understand its modus operandi. I will try to learn that myself. There is nothing new in what we will be doing in these 3 months; the system is in place but we have to instil new energy and new strength by also incorporating public participation and other new experiments. After that I would like to make it a routine in my work. 

I believe that the country should move forward and make big strides. The country should change and the lives of the common man should change. It usually begins with the change in a small unit. This has a cumulative effect and the changes are visible in the country as a whole. It acts like a catalyst and you are like the change agents that lead the country. I believe that this vision, strength and possibilities will work like catalyst to accomplish the objectives by the year 2022 that marks 75 years of India's independence. In the bureaucratic world we usually hear the contributions made by the great officers who once worked with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel or some other officer who might have worked with some other great personality in that period. We often hear the discussions regarding officers of high stature and seek inspirations from their contributions; the way they provided a new direction and history is a witness to their contributions. But very few things are highlighted at the district level. There had to be an officer even at that level who might have spent his youth in some work that could be at the root of that change. For the past 70 years we have heard of the contributions made by high level officers, took inspiration from them and would continue to be inspired by them. But it's high time a voice was raised from the district. It should produce a success story. We should now get to hear of success stories of the officers at district level too.

I was quite active on social media since the beginning but now I do not get enough time for it. But at that time I was quite involved. Two days back I was surfing the internet. I came across a tweet from a lady IAS officer which was quite interesting. Now she is a senior officer. Her photograph was also displayed but I am forgetting her name. She had written - “it is a moment of great satisfaction in my life. Why?” She continued - “I was a junior officer at that time. Once I was traveling by a car when I came across a child who was grazing his cattle outside a school. I had stopped my car, called the teacher of that school and asked them to admit the child. I rebuked the child and compelled him to join the school. After 27 long years, a head constable saluted me during one of my visits and asked me –‘Madam, could you recognize me? I am the one who was once grazing his cattle and you had sent me to school. Today I have reached here just because of you’.” The officer tweeted further that how a small thing can bring about a sea change. We have opportunities in our lives which we should not let go.

The country has several expectations from us. If something goes wrong, then the people of the country blame the Almighty. No other country has such a good fortune as India, because even today the people blame their fate or the Almighty; but never the government. No one can get a greater public support and faith. If we fail to identify this then probably there will be a day when we would not have answers for ourselves. Therefore friends, the job of transforming the fate of 115 districts would also become the fate of the country. We can form a strong foundation for our new India from that work that has been entrusted to you. My best wishes to you all. Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today interacted with Collectors and Officers-in-charge of aspirational districts, at a Conference organized by NITI Aayog at the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre in New Delhi.

This event is in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Transforming India by 2022. The Union Government has embarked upon a major policy initiative for the rapid transformation of 115 districts that are lagging on specific development parameters.

Six groups of officers made presentations on the themes of nutrition, education, basic infrastructure, agriculture and water resources, eradication of Left Wing Extremism and financial inclusion and skill development.

Addressing the gathering, which also included many Union Ministers and senior Union Government officers, the Prime Minister said this is the first official programme at the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre, and therefore has a special significance.

He said that relative backwardness of some regions is an injustice to the people of those regions. In that context, he added, this effort to develop 115 backward districts, is in keeping with the vision of Dr. Ambedkar, who worked for the upliftment of the under-privileged.

Giving the examples of the Jan Dhan Yojana, the construction of toilets, and rural electrification, the Prime Minister said nothing is impossible in our country if we have a firm resolve. He also gave examples of success that is being achieved in entirely new initiatives such as soil testing.

He emphasized that there is limitless potential, limitless possibilities, and limitless opportunities now in India. In this context, he mentioned the improvement in ease of doing business. He credited officials of the Government - and Team India - for this success.

The Prime Minister said that top-down solutions do not yield results. Therefore, the effort is that people on the field contribute to solutions. In this context, he appreciated the clarity of thought, and faith in conviction, in the presentations today.

The Prime Minister said that regional imbalances should not be allowed to increase indefinitely. Therefore, the development of backward districts is imperative. He said that success stories are vital to change the negative psyche and mindset in these areas. The first step is to convert this mindset of pessimism into one of optimism, he explained.

The Prime Minister said that public movements for development require a meeting of minds in the core team. In this context he suggested brainstorming at the district level. There need to be systematic arrangements to involve people, he said, giving the example of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. He emphasized the importance of building positive narratives and optimism in the achievement of development targets.

We need to recognise and channelize the aspirations of the people of the aspirational districts, the Prime Minister said. He said public participation should lead to a matching of the aspirations of people, with schemes of Governments. He said the Collectors of the 115 aspirational districts have the opportunity to earn lasting satisfaction, by delivering on development objectives. He said challenges are the path to achieving success in life, and these Collectors have the opportunity for that. He called for a concerted effort to achieve visible results in three months, till Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary on April 14th. He said he wishes to personally visit one such well-performing district in the month of April. He said these 115 districts can become the foundation for developing New India.

Today it’s an extremely good opportunity when we have been remembering a great son of the country who had sacrificed his life for the country. This is a passion to work tirelessly, to sacrifice ourselves for the country that brings us together in this manner that is beyond the concerns about the date, time and period of the day.    

I convey my best wishes to all of you, particularly the scientific community on the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Acharya Satyendra Nath Bose. 

Friends, I have had the pleasure of interacting with renowned Scientists in the beginning of every year. I am glad that today, an auspicious opportunity allows me to share some thoughts with you.

Today, we open a year-long celebration of the 125th year of Acharya Satyendra Nath Bose, who was born on this day in 1894. I have learnt a great deal about his accomplishments that were far ahead of his times and society.

Friends, Deshbandhu Chitranjan Das had mentioned this thing in one of his poetries - 

“There is an eternal truth inherent in the water and soil of Bengal.”

This is that truth that takes the thinking and deliberations of the people of Bengal to that level which is difficult to attain. This is that truth because of which Bengal became the pivot of the country and held it together for centuries.

Be it freedom movement or be it literature or science or be it sports, in every sphere the impact of water and soil of Bengal is clearly reflected. Swami Ram Krishna Paramhans, Swami Vivekanand, Guruwar Ravindranath Tagore, Subhash Chandra Bose, Shyama  Prasad Mukherjee, Bankim Chandra, Sharad Chandra, Satyajit Ray, you name any field and one of the stars of Bengal will be shining there. 

It’s a matter of pride for India that this land has given several top scientists to the world. Besides Acharya S.N. Bose, there have been several names like J.C. Bose, Meghnad Saha and countless such names who have provided a very strong foundation of modern science to the country. 

They have served the people through their ideas and inventions despite very limited resources and extreme hardships. Even today we have been learning from their commitment and creativity. 

Friends, we have a lot to learn from the life and works of Acharya S. N. Bose. He was a self-taught scholar. He succeeded despite many constraints. These included the lack of formal research education, and little connectivity with the global scientific community. His path-breaking work in 1924 was due to his single-minded devotion to uncharted science.

It laid the foundations of Quantum Statistics and a basis for modern Atomic Theory. Einstein's biographer Abraham Pace regarded his work as one of the last four revolutionary papers on old Quantum Theory. The name of Satyendra Nath Bose has been immortalized in the history of science by concepts and terms, like Bose Statistics, Bose Einstein Condensation and Higgs Boson.

The fundamental importance of his work may be gauged from the fact that several Nobel Prizes in Physics have been awarded subsequently to researchers carrying forward his ideas to diverse physical applications.

Professor Bose was a crusader for teaching of science in vernacular languages. He started the Bengali science magazine Gyan-o-Bigyan.

To promote understanding and love of science in our youth, it is vital that we promote science communication in a big way. Language should not be a barrier but a facilitator in this task.

Friends, India’s scientific research eco-system has traditionally been very strong. There is no paucity of talent, or of hard work or of objective.  

India has emerged at a very rapid pace in the field of science and technology in the last few decades. Be it IT sector or space technology or missile technology, India has left its mark on the entire world. These successes of our scientists and technology experts are a matter of pride for the entire country. 

The entire world watches in awe when more than 100 satellites have been launched in the space by a single rocket of ISRO. At that time we Indians rejoice on this prowess of our scientists by holding our heads high. 

Friends, it will be a great injustice with you people and also with the country if the hard work done by you people in the labs and the sacrifice made by you people remain confined within the labs. Your hard work for boosting the scientific capabilities of the country will be even more fruitful if you people are able to provide benefits to common man of the country by adapting it to modern times. 

That is why today it is extremely essential that the final outcome of our research and our innovations is clearly laid out. Whether your research is making a poor person’s life easier, whether it is able to alleviate the problems of middle class? 

 

When the basis for our scientific experiment will be to find the solution for our social-economic problem then it will be easier for you people to set the final outcome, to decide the target for yourself. 

I believe that the scientists of our country will continue to provide the country such creative technology solutions due to their out of box thinking that will benefit the ordinary people and which will make their life even more easier. 

I’ve been told that various scientific institutions have started their research and development projects while keeping in the mind subjects like solar power, clean energy, water conservation and waste management. It is our collective responsibility that this kind of products and results don’t remain confined to laboratories. 

Distinguished Scientists and Students, You all have studied and are probably also experts of Quantum Mechanics. I have not studied it. But I understand that there are many lessons that Physics can teach us in day to day life. A classical particle cannot escape easily from inside a deep well. But a quantum particle can!

For one reason or another, we have confined ourselves into isolation. We hardly cooperate, collaborate and share our experiences with fellow scientists of other Institutions and National Laboratories.

To reach our true potential and to take Indian science to its rightful glory, we should be like a quantum particle that escapes its confinement. This is even more important today, as Science becomes hugely multi-disciplinary and requires concerted efforts.

I have been talking about the need for greater sharing of physical and research infrastructure, which is expensive and has an increasingly short lifetime.

I am told that our science departments are now working on a multipronged approach. I understand that a portal is being developed for sharing of scientific infrastructure that would allow transparent and efficient tagging and sharing of resources.

A mechanism is being put up for strong collaborations between academic and R&D institutions. City based R&D Clusters are being created to bring together all Science and Technology partners from Academia to Institutes, to Industries to Startups.

The success of this effort will depend on our ability to bring all institutions and labs under this strategy. It requires whole-hearted support from each of us. The mechanism should ensure that a scientist from the remotest corner of the country has seamless access to resources in, say, IIT Delhi, or say, a CSIR Lab in Dehradun. Our aim should be to ensure that the whole of our efforts and actions is always greater than the sum of the various parts.

Friends, science and technology works like an extraordinary engine for development, growth and transformation. Once again, I would like to appeal to you people, to the scientific community of the country to decide the direction of your innovations by keeping in mind our socio-economic challenges. 

You are aware that millions of people in our country, particularly thousands of children in the tribal community are being affected by sickle cell anemia. For decades research has been conducted on this thing but can we make a pledge that we will provide a cost effective simple solution of this disease to the world?  

Can we develop new varieties of our pulses that are cheaper and have more protein to tackle the problem of malnutrition? Can we further improve the quality of our grains and vegetables? Can we speed up the process of development of new technologies for cleaning our rivers, for cleansing the rivers of outgrowth of undesirable vegetation and for making our rivers pollution free?  

Can we develop new medicines, new vaccines for controlling the spread of diseases like malaria, tuberculosis and Japanese encephalitis? Can we identify those areas where we can blend our traditional knowledge with modern science in a creative manner? 

Friends, for various reasons, we missed the first Industrial revolution. We cannot miss similar opportunities today. Upcoming sectors such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Cyber-physical systems, Genomics, and Electric Vehicles are new challenges that require your attention. Please ensure, that as a country, we keep pace with these emerging technologies and innovations.

The way our scientific community tackles these challenges, will determine our success in smart manufacturing, smart cities, Industry 4.0, and the Internet-of-Things. Our scientific ecosystem must connect directly with innovators and entrepreneurs to cultivate, channelize and empower them.

Friends, the strength of our demographic dividend can be source of envy for the entire world. The government has been running programmes like stand-up India, start-up India, skill development mission and Pradhanmantri Mudra Scheme while keeping this thing in mind. In this series, we have been trying to develop 20 such institutions in the country that can leave their mark on the world, which are recognised as world class institutions. 

The government itself has been inviting the private and public sector institutions working in the field of higher education to join the Institutes of Eminence Mission. We have modified the rules and amended the laws. The institutes of public sector which will be selected they will be given a financial assistance of Rs. 1,000 crore within a stipulated time.   

I call upon SN Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences and other such institutes that they should plan and work in the direction of making their institute a part of top ranking institute.

Today, I will urge you people for one more thing that you should create this kind of eco-system in your institutes that further motivates the students and youth for research.

If a scientist spares some of his or her time for increasing the inclination of just one child for studying the science and for research then it can make the future of lakhs of students of this country. This will be the biggest tribute to Acharya S.N. Bose on his 125th birth anniversary.  

Friends, in 2017, all of us, all 1.25 billion Indians have collectively made a solemn pledge. This solemn pledge is for making a New India. This is a pledge for getting rid of internal vices of our country by 2022. This is a pledge for making of that India which was a dream of our freedom fighters.   

The year of 2018 is very important for realisation of this solemn pledge. This is the year when we have to focus our entire energy, our entire strength for realisation of this solemn pledge. 

Every individual of the country, every family, every institution, every department and every ministry has to contribute on its own for this thing. As a train when it leaves a station then within 5-10 minutes it attains its top speed, similarly this year of 2018 is meant to attain our top speed. 

The scientific community of the country too and also every person associated with science and technology will have to concentrate the focus of their innovation and research for making a New India.

Your innovations will strengthen the poor and middle class people of the country, they will strengthen the country. Be it Aadhaar or be it direct transfer of benefits or be it soil health card or be it monitoring of schemes through satellite or drones, all these facilities have been created by you people only.

 

Scientific institutions can make a big contribution in determining that what else can be done to boost the job-oriented economic growth. Your role is extremely important particularly in development of technology as per the requirements of rural areas and in providing such technology to villages. 

Friends, new innovations have been waiting for you people in the several fields like housing, drinking water, power, railways, rivers, roads, airports, irrigation, communications and digital infrastructure.   

The government is with you, resources are with you and in terms of capabilities you people are second to none therefore the success will be yours in any case. And the country will succeed when you people will succeed. The solemn pledges of country will be materialised when your pledges will be realised.  

Friends, inaugurations serve a purpose, only if you have a follow-up plan of action. I am happy to learn that this one has exciting and important follow-up events lined up.

I am told that over 100 outreach lectures in Schools and Colleges are planned. Several national and international conferences, and competitions on 125 solutions to scientifically challenging problems are also on the agenda.

Brilliant ideas retain their relevance far beyond the time that they were mooted. Even today, the work of Acharya Bose continues to inspire scientists.

I wish you all the very best, in your endeavour to succeed in the emerging frontiers of scientific research. I feel confident that through your tireless efforts, the Nation will have an ever better and brighter future.

I wish you all a very fulfilling and creative New Year.

Jai Hind!

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Cadre review of Group 'A' Executive Cadre of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).  It provides for creation of 25 posts of various ranks from Assistant Commandant to Additional Director General ranks to enhance the supervisory staff in Senior Duty posts of CISF. 

The restructuring of the CISF Cadre will result in increase of Group 'A' posts from 1252 to 1277 with increase of 2 posts of Additional Director General, 7 posts of Inspector General, 8 posts of Deputy Inspector General and 8 posts of Commandant.

Impact:

After creation of these Group 'A' posts in CISF, the supervisory efficiency and capacity building of the Force would be enhanced. Timely creation of proposed posts in the Cadre Review of Group 'A' posts in the Force will enhance its supervisory as well as administrative capabilities.

Background:

The CISF came into existence through the CISF Act 1968 amended in 1983 declaring the Force as Armed Force of the Union. The original charter of CISF was to provide protection and security to the property of Public Sector Undertakings. The Act was further amended in 1989, 1999 and 2009 to enlarge the charter of duties and security cover to Private Sector Units and other duties that may be entrusted by the Central Government.

The CISF came into existence in 1969 with a sanctioned strength of only three Battalions. The CISF does not have a Battalion pattern like other CAPFs, except 12 Reserve Battalions and HQRs. Currently, the Force is providing security cover to 336 Industrial Undertaking (including 59 Airports) spread all over the country.  The Force, which had made a beginning with a sanctioned strength of 3192 in 1969, has grown to a strength of 1,49,088 as on 30.06.2017. The CISF has its Headquarters at Delhi. The Organization is headed by the DG which is an Ex-cadre post.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal to amend Section 4(1) and Section 5(1) of the National Trust for the Welfare of Person with Autism, Cerebral Plasy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act, 1999 to fix the term of the Chairperson and Members of the Board of National Trust for three years.

Section 4(1) of the National Trust   Act, 1999   provides that the Chairperson or a Member of the Board of National Trust would continue in office beyond the prescribed term of three years   until   his   successor   shall   have   been   duly   appointed. In case of resignation of the Chairperson, section 5(1) of the Act provides for him to continue in office until his successor is duly appointed by the Government.   The wording of the above provisions of the Act in its present form has resulted in continuation of a Chairman for an indefinite period as no suitable successor could be found eligible for appointment. The proposed amendments in these provisions of the Act seek to avoid such a    situation and will thus eliminate any chance of prolonged continuation in the same post by any incumbent.

	100% FDI under automatic route for Single Brand Retail Trading 



	100% FDI under automatic route in Construction Development
	Foreign airlines allowed to invest up to 49% under approval route in Air India
	FIIs/FPIs allowed to invest in Power Exchanges through primary market
	Definition of ‘medical devices’ amended in the FDI Policy


 

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval to a number of amendments in the FDI Policy. These are intended to liberalise and simplify the FDI policy so as to provide ease of doing business in the country. In turn, it will lead to larger FDI inflows contributing to growth of investment, income and employment. 

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a major driver of economic growth and a source of non-debt finance for the economic development of the country. Government has put in place an investor friendly policy on FDI, under which FDI up to 100%, is permitted on the automatic route in most sectors/ activities. In the recent past, the Government has brought FDI policy reforms in a number of sectors viz. Defence, Construction Development, Insurance, Pension, Other Financial Services, Asset reconstruction Companies, Broadcasting, Civil Aviation, Pharmaceuticals, Trading etc.

Measures undertaken by the Government have resulted in increased FDI inflows in to the country. During the year 2014-15, total FDI inflows received were US $ 45.15 billion as against US $ 36.05 billion in 2013-14. During 2015-16, country received total FDI of US $ 55.46 billion. In the financial year 2016-17, total FDI of US $ 60.08 billion has been received, which is an all-time high. 

It has been felt that the country has potential to attract far more foreign investment which can be achieved by further liberalizing and simplifying the FDI regime. Accordingly, the Government has decided to introduce a number of amendments in the FDI Policy. 

Details:

Government approval no longer required for FDI in Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT)


	Extant FDI policy on SBRT allows 49% FDI under automatic route, and FDI beyond 49% and up to 100% through Government approval route. It has now been decided to permit 100% FDI under automatic route for SBRT. 
	It has been decided to permit single brand retail trading entity to set off its incremental sourcing of goods from India for global operations during initial 5 years, beginning 1st April of the year of the opening of first store against the mandatory sourcing requirement of 30% of purchases from India. For this purpose, incremental sourcing will mean the increase in terms of value of such global sourcing from India for that single brand (in INR terms) in a particular financial year over the preceding financial year, by the non-resident entities undertaking single brand retail trading entity, either directly or through their group companies. After completion of this 5 year period, the SBRT entity shall be required to meet the 30% sourcing norms directly towards its India’s operation, on an annual basis.
	A non-resident entity or entities, whether owner of the brand or otherwise, is permitted to undertake ‘single brand’ product retail trading in the country for the specific brand, either directly by the brand owner or through a legally tenable agreement executed between the Indian entity undertaking single brand retail trading and the brand owner.


Civil Aviation

As per the extant policy, foreign airlines are allowed to invest under Government approval route in the capital of Indian companies operating scheduled and non-scheduled air transport services, up to the limit of 49% of their paid-up capital. However, this provision was presently not applicable to Air India, thereby implying that foreign airlines could not invest in Air India. It has now been decided to do away with this restriction and allow foreign airlines to invest up to 49% under approval route in Air India subject to the conditions that:


	Foreign investment(s) in Air India including that of foreign Airline(s) shall not exceed 49% either directly or indirectly
	Substantial ownership and effective control of Air India shall continue to be vested in Indian National.


Construction Development: Townships, Housing, Built-up Infrastructure and Real Estate Broking Services

It has been decided to clarify that real-estate broking service does not amount to real estate business and is therefore, eligible for 100% FDI under automatic route.

Power Exchanges

Extant policy provides for 49% FDI under automatic route in Power Exchanges registered under the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Power Market) Regulations, 2010. However, FII/FPI purchases were restricted to secondary market only. It has now been decided to do away with this provision, thereby allowing FIIs/FPIs to invest in Power Exchanges through primary market as well.

Other Approval Requirements under FDI Policy:


	As per the extant FDI policy, issue of equity shares against non-cash considerations like pre-incorporation expenses, import of machinery etc. is permitted under Government approval route. It has now been decided that issue of shares against non-cash considerations like pre-incorporation expenses, import of machinery etc. shall be permitted under automatic route in case of sectors under automatic route. 
	Foreign investment into an Indian company, engaged only in the activity of investing in the capital of other Indian company/ies/ LLP and in the Core Investing Companies is presently allowed upto 100% with prior Government approval. It has now been decided to align FDI policy on these sectors with FDI policy provisions on Other Financial Services. Thus, if the above activities are regulated by any financial sector regulator, then foreign investment upto 100% under automatic route shall be allowed; and, if they are not regulated by any Financial Sector Regulator or where only part is regulated or where there is doubt regarding the regulatory oversight, foreign investment up to 100% will be allowed under Government approval route, subject to conditions including minimum capitalization requirement, as may be decided by the Government. 


Competent Authority for examining FDI proposals from countries of concern

As per the existing procedures, FDI applications involving investments from Countries of Concern, requiring security clearance as per the extant FEMA 20, FDI Policy and security guidelines, amended from time to time, are to be processed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for investments falling under automatic route sectors/activities, while cases pertaining to government approval route sectors/activities requiring security clearance are to be processed by the respective Administrative Ministries/Departments, as the case may be. It has now been decided that for investments in automatic route sectors, requiring approval only on the matter of investment being from country of concern, FDI applications would be processed by Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) for Government approval. Cases under the government approval route, also requiring security clearance with respect to countries of concern, will continue to be processed by concerned Administrative Department/Ministry.

Pharmaceuticals:

FDI policy on Pharmaceuticals sector inter-alia provides that definition of medical device as contained in the FDI Policy would be subject to amendment in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. As the definition as contained in the policy is complete in itself, it has been decided to drop the reference to Drugs and Cosmetics Act from FDI policy. Further, it has also been decided to amend the definition of ‘medical devices’ as contained in the FDI Policy.

Prohibition of restrictive conditions regarding audit firms:

The extant FDI policy does not have any provisions in respect of specification of auditors that can be appointed by the Indian investee companies receiving foreign investments. It has been decided to provide in the FDI policy that wherever the foreign investor wishes to specify a particular auditor/audit firm having international network for the Indian investee company, then audit of such investee companies should be carried out as joint audit wherein one of the auditors should not be part of the same network.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to the Note submitted by the Department of Commerce and approved the approach to be adopted by India at the Eleventh Ministerial Conference of the WTO held in Buenos Aires, Argentina in December 2017.

The mandate exercised and approach adopted at the Conference was aimed at protecting India’s interests, priorities and concerns during the Ministerial Conference.

Background

In the run-up to the Conference, decisions were expected on a permanent solution on the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes as per the Bali/Nairobi mandate and other agriculture issues. Some WTO member countries were seeking outcomes on domestic regulations in services, disciplines on fisheries subsidies, E-commerce, Investment Facilitation and Micro, Medium and Small Enterprises (MSMEs).

However, ultimately, there was no outcome on public stockholding for food security purposes or on other agriculture issues due to an absence of consensus.

The Bali Ministerial Decision together with the General Council Decision of November 2014, which was reaffirmed at the Tenth Ministerial Conference of the WTO in December 2015 protects India through availability of an interim mechanism on public stockholding for food security purposes, till a permanent solution is agreed and adopted by the WTO.  Thus, India’s foodgrain procurement programmes at Minimum Support Prices remain protected.

Ministerial decisions taken during the Conference include a Work Programme on disciplines on Fisheries Subsidies with a view to arriving at a decision by the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of the WTO, in 2019. It was also decided to continue with the non-negotiating mandate of the existing Work Programme on E-Commerce, as proposed by India. As was done in previous Ministerial Conferences, an existing moratorium on imposing customs duties on electronic transmission was expanded for two years. Another moratorium on TRIPS non-violation companies was maintained, which prevents ‘ever-greening’ of patents in the pharmaceuticals sector, thereby ensuring accessibility and affordability of generic medicines.

Ministerial decisions on new issues like Investment Facilitation, MSMEs, gender and trade, which lacked a mandate or consensus, were not taken forward.

As there were wide differences among members, with a few members not supporting acknowledgment and reiteration of key underlying principles guiding the WTO and varied agreed mandates, Ministers could not arrive at an agreed Ministerial Declaration. India did not support the draft Ministerial Declaration as it excluded or failed to adequately cover important issues such as multilateralism, the Doha Development Agenda and special and differential treatment of developing countries.

However, wide support was expressed for the multilateral trading system and the commitment to move forward on various areas of work in the WTO. It is also noteworthy that even in the absence of a Ministerial Declaration, the existing mandates and decisions ensure that work will go forward and Members will continue to work on issues such as the permanent solution on public stockholding for food security purposes, an agricultural Special Safeguard Mechanism, agricultural subsidies and other issues.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Agreement between India and Myanmar on Land Border Crossing.

The Agreement will facilitate regulation and harmonization of already existing free movement rights for people ordinarily residing in the border areas of both countries. It will also facilitate movement of people on the basis of valid passports and visas which will enhance economic and social interaction between the two countries.

The Agreement is an enabling arrangement for movement of people across India-Myanmar border. It is expected to provide connectivity and enhance interaction of the people of North Eastern States of India with the people of Myanmar.

The Agreement would give a boost to the economy of the North East and allow us to leverage our geographical connections with Myanmar to boost trade and people to people ties.

The Agreement will safeguard the traditional rights of the largely tribal communities residing along the border which are accustomed to free movement across the land border.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the signing and implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ministry of Road Transport & Highways and ‘Transport for London’, a statutory body established under the Greater London Authority Act, 1999 (UK) to improve Public Transport in India.

The MoU will help to improve the overall public transport system in the country, improve passenger services and promote the use of high capacity buses in India. It will go a long way in strengthening ties and promoting bilateral relations between India and United Kingdom.

The MoU will help in strengthening the integrated public transport for all. This will help people from poorer strata of the society to have access to a quality public transport system.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved amendments in the Model Concession Agreement (MCA) to make the  Port Projects more investor-friendly and make investment climate in the Port Sector more attractive.  

Salient features:

The amendments in the MCA envisage constitution of the Society for Affordable Redressal of Disputes - Ports (SAROD-PORTS) as dispute resolution mechanism similar to provision available in Highway Sector.

The other salient features of the revised MCA include the following:-

 


	Providing exit route to developers by way of divesting their equity upto 100% after completion of 2 years from the Commercial Operation Date(COD). This is now similar to the MCA provisions of Highway Sector.
	Under provision of additional land to the Concessionaire, land rent has been reduced from 200% to 120% of the applicable scale of rates for the proposed additional land.
	Concessionaire would pay Royalty on ""per MT of cargo/TEU handled"" basis which would be indexed to the variations in the WPI annually. This will replace the present procedure of charging royalty which is equal to the percentage of Gross revenue, quoted during bidding, calculated on the basis of upfront normative tariff ceiling prescribed by Tariff Authority for Major Ports (TAMP). This will help to resolve the long pending grievances of Public Private Participation (PPP) operators that Revenue share is payable on ceiling tariff and price discounts are ignored. The problems associated with fixing storage charges by TAMP and collection of Revenue share on storage charges which has plagued many projects will also get eliminated.
	Concessionaire would be free to deploy higher capacity equipment/facilities/technology and carry out value engineering for higher productivity and improved utilization and/or cost saving of Project assets.
	""Actual Project Cost"" would be replaced by ""Total Project Cost"".
	The new definition of ""Change in Law"" will also include 



	imposition of standards and conditions arising out of TAMP guidelines/orders, Environmental Law & Labour Laws and 
	increase and imposition of new taxes, duties, etc. for compensating the Concessionaire. Since the viability of the project was affected, concessionaire will now be compensated for the increase and imposition of new taxes, duties etc. except in respect of imposition/increase of a  direct tax,   both  by  Central  &  State Government.



	vii. Provision for commencement of operations before COD. This will lead to better utilization of assets provided by the Port in many projects before the formal completion certificate.



	Provision regarding refinancing is aimed at facilitating availability of low cost long term funds to Concessionaire so as to improve the financial viability of the projects.
	Extending the provision of SAROD-PORTS for redressal of disputes to the existing Concessionaires also by introducing the Supplementary Agreement to be signed between the Concessionaire and the Concessioning Authority.
	Introduction of Complaint Portal for the use of port users.
	A   Monitoring  Arrangement  has   been   introduced  for  keeping periodical status report of the project.


 

The amendments have been proposed keeping in view the experience gained in managing PPP projects in port sector during the last twenty years and to obviate the problems being faced on account of certain provisions in the existing MCA. The amendments in the MCA have been finalized after extensive consultation with the stakeholders.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for mandatory packaging of foodgrains and sugar in the jute material for the Jute Year 2017-18.  The decision would sustain the core demand for the jute sector and support the livelihood of the workers and farmers dependent on the sector.   The Jute Year 2017-18 period is from 1st July 2017 to 30th June, 2018.

Features:


	The CCEA has extended the mandatory packaging norms under the Jute Packaging Material (JPM) Act, 1987.   
	The approval mandates that 90% of the food grains and 20% of the sugar products shall be mandatorily packed in jute bags. 
	The decision also mandates, in the first instance, the entire requirement for packing of food grains would be placed in jute bags thus, making a provision for 100% packing of food grains in jute bags subject to the ability of the jute industry to meet the requirement.


Impact:

The decision will benefit farmers and workers located in the Eastern and North Eastern regions of the country particularly in West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya and Tripura.

Measures taken by Government to give a boost to Jute industry:

Jute industry is predominantly dependent on Government sector which purchases jute products more than Rs. 5,500 crore every year.  Considering that nearly 3.7 lakh workers and approximately 40 lakh farmers are dependent for their livelihood on the jute sectors, the government has been making concerted efforts for the development of jute sector; increasing the quality and productivity of raw jute, diversification of jute sector and also boosting and sustaining demand for jute products.  These include-


	With a view to boosting demand in the jute sector, Government of India has imposed Definitive Anti Dumping Duty on import of jute goods from Bangladesh and Nepal with effect from 5th January, 2017. As a result of these measures, 13 Twine mills in Andhra Pradesh had resumed operation, benefitting 20000 workers. Further, imposition of Definitive Anti Dumping Duty has provided scope for an additional demand of 2 lakh MT of jute goods in the domestic market for the Indian jute industry.


 


	In order to improve the productivity and quality of raw jute through a carefully designed intervention, called the Jute ICARE, the Government has been supporting close to one lakh jute farmers by disseminating improved agronomic practices such as line sowing using seed drills, weed management by using wheel-hoeing and nail-weeders, distribution of quality certified seeds and also providing microbial assisted retting. These interventions have resulted in enhancing the quality and productivity of raw jute and increasing income of jute farmers by Rs. 10,000 per hectare.


 


	In order to support jute farmers, Jute Corporation of India (JCI) has been given a grant of Rs. 204 crore for 4 years starting from 2014-15 to enable JCI to conduct MSP operations and ensure price stabilization in the jute sector.


 


	With a view to supporting diversification of jute sector, the National Jute Board has collaborated with National Institute of Design and a Jute Design Cell has been opened at Gandhinagar.


 


	Promotion of Jute Geo Textiles and Agro-Textiles has been taken up with the state governments particularly those in the North Eastern region and also with departments such as Ministry of Road Transport and Ministry of Water Resources.


 


	In order to promote transparency in jute sector, Jute SMART an e-govt initiative was launched in December, 2016, providing an integrated platform for procurement of B-Twill sacking by Government agencies. Further, the JCI is transferring 100% funds to jute farmers online on the jute procurement under MSP and commercial operations.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval to the construction, operation and maintenance of 2-lane bi-directional Zojila Tunnel with Parallel Escape (Egress) Tunnel excluding approaches on Srinagar-Leh section connecting NH-1A at Km 95.00 and at Km 118.00 in Jammu & Kashmir on Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) mode. The construction of this tunnel will provide all weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh and will bring about all round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions. The project has strategic and socio-economic importance and shall be an instrument for the development of the economically backward districts in Jammu & Kashmir.

Project Details:


	The construction period of the project is seven years which shall be reckoned from the date of commencement of construction. 
	The civil construction cost of the project is Rs 4899.42 crore. 
	The total capital cost of the project is Rs 6808.69 crore.  It includes the cost towards Land Acquisition, Resettlement & Rehabilitation and other pre-construction activities as well as Maintenance and Operation cost of tunnel for four years.
	The Project aims at construction of 14.150 km long two lane bidirectional single tube tunnel with a parallel 14.200 km long egress tunnel excluding approaches between Baltal & Minamarg in the State of J&K. 
	The construction of approaches of this tunnel is being undertaken separately.
	The project will be implemented by Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRT&H) through National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL).


 

Impact:

 


	The main objective of the project is to provide all whether connectivity to strategically important Leh region in Jammu & Kashmir which at the moment is limited to at best 6 months because of snow on the passes and threat of avalanches. 
	This project alongwith other ongoing projects like 6.5 km long Z-Morh tunnel at Gagangir would ensure safe, fast and cheap connectivity between the two regions of Kashmir and Ladakh. 
	It will further increase the employment potential for the local labourers for the project activities. 
	The project, on completion, would lead to enormous boost in employment as local businesses get linked to National market and the beautiful region is able to receive round the year tourist traffic. 
	These sectors will generate employment at multiple levels.

                The export of Ayurvedic products takes place under the Indian Trade Classification based on Harmonized System of Coding (ITCHS) through two HS codes-30039011 for medicants and 30049011 for medicaments.  As such individual Ayurvedic products are not given separate HS codes to track the top Ayurvedic drugs being exported. And it is also a fact that the nomenclature of Ayurvedic products as drugs is prevailing in India and in some other countries where Ayurveda is recognized as a system of medicine. Export of above two categories of Ayurvedic products under the two ITCHS codes during the financial year 2016-17 is estimated to be to the tune of USD 243 million as per information provided by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence & Statistics (DGCIS), Department of Commerce. Most of the Ayurvedic products are suitably modified for their intended use in the international market in accordance with the importing country’s classification and acceptance and are exported as nutraceuticals, health supplements and dietary supplements.

                Misleading claims and advertisements of all kinds of drugs including herbal medicines/products are regulated under the provisions of Drugs & Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 and Rules thereunder. The legal provisions on this account are enforced by the State Governments for prohibiting advertisements, which directly or indirectly give a false impression regarding the true character of the drugs; or  make  false claims for the drugs or  otherwise false or misleading in any material particular.   Ministry of AYUSH has signed an MoU with Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) on 20th January, 2017 for suo-moto monitoring and tracking down the AYUSH related advertisements appearing in print and TV media and directing the advertisers to rectify or withdraw the inappropriate advertisements within the stipulated timeframe.  Instances of non-compliance of ASCI directions are forwarded to the concerned regulators for necessary action in accordance with the legal provisions.  Penal provisions for the instances of contravention of advertisement norms are prescribed in the Drugs & Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954. Ministry of Information & Broadcasting has issued advisory to all TV Channels to ensure strict compliance of the provisions of Drugs & Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 and Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules thereunder. Also, TV Channels have been advised to advertise only licensed AYUSH products.  Department of Consumer Affairs is maintaining a portal of Grievances Against Misleading Advertisements (GAMA) for online registration of complaints related to misleading advertisements inter alia of AYUSH products & services. 

There is no exclusive definition of herbal medicines in the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules thereunder but there are Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani drugs as defined in Section 3 (a) and (h) of the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940, many of which are made from plant ingredients or herbs.

                The regulatory framework for Ayurvedic medicines is by and large modeled on the lines for allopathic medicines. Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules thereunder have exclusive provisions for regulation and quality control of Ayurvedic medicines. Regulatory Officers are appointed in the Central and State Governments to oversee the enforcement of legal provisions for Ayurvedic medicines. Manufacturing of Ayurvedic medicines need license from the concerned State Government as well as compliance to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and the standards prescribed in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia. Proof of safety and effectiveness is required for licensing of various categories of Ayurvedic medicines. Central Government has the powers to frame and amend the regulatory provisions and issue direction to the State Governments for their enforcement. In this regard, the Central Government is advised by the Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani Drugs Technical Advisory Board (ASUDTAB) and Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani Drugs Consultative Committee (ASUDCC), which are statutory bodies under the provisions of Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940, in the regulatory matters and enforcement issues respectively pertaining to Ayurvedic medicines. Pharmacopoeia Commission of Indian Medicine & Homoeopathy and Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia Committee are in place to develop the quality standards and Standard Operating Procedures for Ayurvedic medicines, which are mandatory for the manufacturers to comply with. Central and State Governments have established Drug Testing Laboratories for Ayurvedic medicines and their raw materials and 55 laboratories so far are approved or licensed in the country in accordance with the Drugs & Cosmetics Rules, 1945 for quality testing of Ayurvedic drugs. Quality certification schemes for Ayurvedic medicines are also administered as per WHO Guidelines and International Standards by Central Drug Standards Control Organization (CDSCO) and Quality Council of India (QCI) respectively. Like allopathic medicines Ayurvedic medicines are also covered under the provisions of Drugs & Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 and Rules thereunder. Central Government has initiated pharmacovigilance system for safety monitoring of Ayurvedic medicines etc and grant in aid is provided through National AYUSH Mission to strengthen quality control activities in the states. 

Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules thereunder as on date do not have explicit provisions for the clinical trials of Ayurvedic medicines. Rule 158-B of the Drugs & Cosmetics Rules, 1945 does provide the requirement of pilot study to generate proof of safety & effectiveness of certain categories of Ayurvedic medicines. Ministry of AYUSH has published Good Clinical Practice Guidelines for conduct of clinical trials on Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani medicines on voluntary basis.

Dr Jitendra Singh complimented the new Chairman for taking over the charge of ISRO at a time when the Team ISRO, through its commendable work, has placed India as a frontline nation in the community of world nations. With a series of achievements registered in last few years, it is time to consolidate the gains of recent achievements and to share them for the benefit of the people of the region and the entire world community in general added the Minister.

 Dr Jitendra Singh also said that one of the major achievements during the Modi Government was that the Space technology had been made applicable to a wide range of infrastructural development and flagship programmes including roads, railways, agriculture health care etc. One of the latest applications, he said, would be the development of Lithium batteries for use of Electric vehicles. These batteries will not only be cost - effective but will also offer the option of Electric vehicle transport with no risk of environmental pollution or noise pollution.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh delivered the Keynote address at the International Space Conference of “Geospatial World Forum” in Hyderabad today.  Addressing the conference he complemented Team ISRO for having placed India as a front-line leader in the community of world nations while in the last three years, the use of diverse applications of space technology to carry forward the Modi Government's infrastructural and transformational programmes has brought space technology to the doorstep of every Indian household.

The minister said that  it is primarily the personal indulgence, intervention and patronage provided by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi which has made space technology an essential part of Modi’s “Transforming India” mission, which will finally culminate in the building of “New India”. It was at the behest of Prime Minister that perhaps, the first-of-its-kind, extended brain-storming interaction was held between space scientists and the representatives of different Ministries and Departments in Government of India, in order to understand the areas where space technology could be put into use.

In the last 3 years, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Team ISRO and the Department of Space have finalised effective MoUs with a host of Ministries, including Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare etc. Space Technology today is playing a crucial role in carrying forward a number of flagship programmes of the Modi Government, including Smart City programme, Urban and Housing schemes, guarding of unmanned railway crossings, Geo-tagging of MNREGA, procurement of Utilization Certificates of roads and other projects, agricultural soil testing, he added.

The new year began with the January 12th launching of 28 foreign satellites which, Dr Jitendra Singh said, has vindicated the dream of our founding father Vikram Sarabhai and evidently proved that even those nations of the world which began their space programme several years before us have  reposed their faith and trust in us to launch their satellites. The last year set some world records like launching of 104 satellites in a single go, launching of South Asia satellite and completion of 3 years of Mangalyaan in the orbit, he added.

Referring to the Geospatial World Forum meet, currently being held, Dr Jitendra Singh said, this event highlights India’s intent of expanding its space programmes for wider application and with wider participation of other partners as well. The presence of representatives and CEOs of some of the leading industrial houses of the world, he said, signifies the keen desire of the world industrial players to collaborate with India to benefit as well as to supplement the applications of space technology for the common goal of the future growth of a global world.

                       ISRO’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, in its forty second flight, successfully launched the 710 kg Cartosat-2 Series Remote Sensing Satellite along with 30 co-passenger satellites today from Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota. This flight is designated as PSLV-C40.

      The lift-off of PSLV-C40 occurred at 0929 hrs (9:29 am) IST from the First Launch Pad. After a flight lasting 16 minutes 37 seconds, the satellites achieved the polar Sun Synchronous Orbit of 503 km inclined at an angle of 97.55 degree to the equator. In the succeeding seven minutes, Cartosat-2 series satellite, INS-1C and 28 customer satellites successfully separated from the PSLV in a predetermined sequence. The fourth stage of PSLV-C40 fired twice for short durations to achieve a polar orbit of 365 km height in which India’s Microsat successfully separated.

   After separation, the two solar arrays of Cartosat-2 series satellite deployed automatically and ISRO's Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) at Bengaluru took over the control of the satellite. In the coming days, the satellite will be brought to its final operational configuration following which it will begin to provide remote sensing data using its panchromatic (black and white) and multispectral (colour) cameras.

        The 11 kg INS-1C and the 100 kg class Microsat, the two Indian co-passenger satellites of Cartosat-2, are also being monitored and controlled from ISTRAC, Bengaluru. The 28 international customer satellites belong to Canada, Finland, France, Republic of Korea, UK and the USA.

      So far, PSLV has successfully launched 51 Indian satellites and 237 customer satellites from abroad.

                In the recent years ISRO has achieved major milestones as below:


	In April 2016, seven  satellite  constellation for  Navigation system   NavIC   was established.
	            In August 2016, first experimental mission of Scramjet engine towards  realisation of Air Breathing system was successfully tested.
	            In February 2017, 104 satellites were placed in a single launch.
	            In May 2017, South Asia satellite was launched, which was a gift to neighbouring countries.
	            In June 2017, GSLV Mk-III was launched successfully carrying GSAT 19   communication satellite.
	            In June 2017, Cartosat satellite was launched successfully by PSLV C-38


 

Indian  Space  Programme has placed  Astrosat, a multi-wavelength observatory in August 2015.  It observes universe in optical, Ultraviolet, low and high energy X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum,  whereas most other scientific satellites are capable of observing a narrow range of wavelength band. 

            Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) is designed to orbit Mars. It is functioning well since its positioning in Mars orbit in September 24, 2014. The designed mission life of MOM was six months but has successfully completed more than three years and is expected to function further.  All scientific payloads continue to perform well.

This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.

                The success of the first developmental flight of GSLV Mark III will enable indigenous launching up to 4 tonne class of communication satellites in the future.

ISRO has been providing commercial launch services for earth observation satellites and small satellites onboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) through Antrix Corporation Limited since 1999. The successful launch of GSLV Mark III is a step ahead in building credibility in launching.

ISRO has just completed one launch of GSLV-MK III. Next developmental launch is in first half of 2018. Some more launches of GSLV-MK III will be needed before GSLV MK III gets recognised internationally as a vehicle for transportation to space.

                The Government has provided fuel from both indigenous and imported sources in required quantities for operation of nuclear power reactors at their rated power.

 As per the vision plan prepared, in order to fulfil the requirement of Uranium to fuel nuclear power plants, Department of Atomic Energy will achieve nearly ten-fold rise in uranium production in next 15 years (by 2031-2032). The uranium mining projects have been planned in three phases. On completion of the projects in first phase, it is expected to produce 3.5 times of existing uranium production by the 12th year. On completion of the projects in second phase, uranium production is expected to achieve seven times of existing production. With the completion of phase three projects uranium production of the country is expected to record ten-fold increase by 2031-32.

 

The above is subject to obtaining all statutory clearances and external constraints.

 

            Consequent upon the Civil Nuclear cooperation, DAE has been importing Uranium to meet the fuel requirements of IAEA Safeguarded Nuclear Power Plants. The details of quantities of Uranium imported so far since the year 2009 and the anticipated supplies during the year 2017-18 is as follows:-

                As per International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), India presently ranks third in number of reactors under construction after China and Russian Federation (based on the placement of first pour of concrete) and seventh in number of reactors in operation.         

Some of the suppliers / contractors of Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) had reported financial difficulties, as a result of which there was a delay in supplies of equipment and execution of Kakrapar Atomic Power Project (KAPP) 3&4 (2X700 MW) and Rajasthan Atomic Power Project (RAPP) 7&8 (2X700 MW) projects. The issue of financial difficulty of vendors / contractors was appropriately addressed by NPCIL.           

There are presently 59 reactors under construction in 17 countries with an aggregate capacity of 60,366 MW in the world as reported by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The decisions on addition of nuclear power capacity are country specific and depend on factors like the country’s nuclear and energy policies, requirements, availability of various energy options, market conditions etc.

This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.

                Kudankulam Units 1&2 (2x1000 MW) set up in cooperation with the Russian Federation are VVER 1000 type Light Water Reactors.  These units have the distinction of being the highest capacity units in the country.  The VVER 1000 is a safe and robust technology and VVERs are in safe operation in several countries like Russian Federation, Ukraine, China, Iran, etc.  They have advanced, state of the art safety features like four safety trains, Passive Heat Removal system, Core catcher etc. 

The first unit was shutdown in June 2015 for refueling for the first time after generating about 6875 Million Units of electricity.  During the first refueling shutdown, in parallel with refueling, detailed inspections, surveillance tests, mandatory checks and routine maintenance works were carried out.  Thereafter the unit was reconnected to the grid in January 2016.  Apart from the long refueling shutdown of Unit-1, there have been some instances of unit trips.  Each of the instances have been investigated, the root cause determined and necessary measures taken in consultation with the Russian experts and the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB).  In none of these instances the safety of plants was challenged. 

The Kudankulam Units 1&2 are each of capacity 1000 MW (rated electrical output).  This is corresponding to the rated reactor power.  Even as the unit operates at the rated reactor power, the electrical output may at times exceed 1000 MW on account of enhanced efficiency due to favourable environmental conditions (like cooling water temperature), condenser vacuum etc. 

          

Nuclear power plants are operated strictly in line with laid down procedures and technical specifications approved by the AERB and in no case the rated reactor power has been exceeded.  On November 28, 2017, at no point the reactor power exceeded the rated power. 

Periodic safety audit of all atomic power plants in India is carried out by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB).  All Nuclear Power Projects (NPP) undergo an elaborate in-depth safety review during all stages, viz. siting, construction, commissioning and operation.  After satisfactory review during project state, AERB issues operating license to the NPP for a period of five years.  During the project stage of a power plant, quarterly regulatory inspections and during operation of a power plant, regulatory inspections are carried out by AERB once every six months.  A consolidated safety assessment of the plant is undertaken while renewing the operating license after every five years.  Further, all plants are required to undergo a comprehensive Periodic Safety Review (PSR) as per the established guidelines, where the safety of the plant is assessed considering cumulative effects of ageing, plant modifications, operating experience as well as comparison with the current safety standards/practices.  The recommendations made in all these reviews are appropriately addressed. 

 

This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.

                            The Election Commission of India celebrated the 8th National Voters Day in New Delhi today. Hon’ble President of India, Sh. Ram Nath Kovind graced the National function as the Chief Guest along with Minister of Law & Justice, Sh. Ravi Shankar Prasad in New Delhi. This year’s celebrations revolved around the theme ‘Accessible Elections’, which expressed ECI’s pursuit of working towards making the electoral process more inclusive and friendly for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs). 

            Addressing the gathering President Kovind said that we have been celebrating National Voters Day on January 25 every year since 2011. The aim is to encourage our voters to participate enthusiastically in the democratic process. And that is why the relevance of this day is even more pronounced on the eve of Republic Day. The President congratulated young voters who have just turned 18 and got the right to vote for the first time. “Our Constitution empowers an independent Election Commission. And our election process makes every vote important, with the right to equality and freedom. As such Indian democracy is known through the world for its maturity and stability.” He reminded that Developed Countries took many years to hand over the suffrage right to its citizens whereas the Indian Constitution empowered the Indian citizens in one stroke. 

            Speaking on the occasion the newly appointed Chief Election Commissioner Sh O P Rawat informed that the Commission has taken several initiatives in its continued endeavour to encourage and enhance inclusive, informed and ethical electoral participation from all categories of voters, with special focus on PwDs. The initiatives integrate technology and media including social media for efficiency and efficacy of connect with the voters down to the polling station level in consonance with our motto ‘No voter to be left behind’.  

            CEC added that keeping in line with the theme ‘Accessible Elections’ for the year 2018, an international Conference was organised yesterday on ‘Inclusion of the Persons with Disabilities in the Electoral Processes’. “Guidelines are already in place on the subject. We intend to consolidate our efforts on accessible elections based on the insights of this Conference’, he said.

            The President also inaugurated the first edition of VoICE India – a biannual magazine which brings forth best practices, innovations and knowledge derived from practical experience and success stories of the election machinery that exists in every corner of India. The NVD function also officially marked the launch of Electoral Literacy Clubs in the nation. With the aim of introducing electoral literacy in the future voters falling in the age group of 14-17 years, around 60 thousand ELCs are planned to be set up with 36 thousand in Schools, around 16 thousand in Communities and 7 thousand in Colleges and Universities in the coming two months. 

            NVD is celebrated all over the country right from the national level to the far and remote corners of our country down to each Polling Station location where new voters were felicitated with a badge carrying the logo ‘Proud to be a Voter- Ready to Vote’, administered the Pledge and handed over their Elector Photo Identity Cards (EPICs). This is a unique electoral participation exercise across the democracies of the world. This year 60 thousand ‘Millennium Voters’ were felicitated across the nation in functions similar to the event in New Delhi. These Millennium Voters are young adults, who were born on 1 January 2000 and qualified as eligible voters on 1st January this year. Six such Millennium Voters from Delhi were felicitated at the National function. 

 

            It may be recalled that the Election Commission of India was constituted on 25th January 1950. Thus 25th January every year is now observed as the National Voters Day.

                Flagging off the 8th National Voters Day Celebrations scheduled to be held on 25th January 2018, Election Commission of India (ECI) today hosted a one-day International Conference on the subject ‘Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in the Election Process’ in New Delhi. Delegates at the Conference included Chairpersons/Commissioners / Senior Officials of five Election Management Bodies (EMBs) viz. Australia, Bhutan, Guinea, Moldova & Zambia and Heads of two International Organisations viz. International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) and International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA). 



Chief Election Commissioner Sh. O. P. Rawat while addressing the conference

In his Inaugural Address, Chief Election Commissioner of India Mr. O.P.Rawat, reiterated ECI’s resolve to uphold the sanctity of free, fair and peaceful elections in keeping with the rich democratic traditions of India.  He stated that ECI is committed to the objective that the Persons with Disabilities (PwD) have the right to full electoral participation, on the basis of equality and shall not be discriminated against on any ground. He pointed out that it was high time to move away from tokenism and ensure participation of PwDs in exercising their franchise. He highlighted the major initiatives taken by the ECI to ensure provision of basic facilities at the polling stations making them conducive for Persons with Disabilities to exercise their right to vote. He expressed the hope that today’s Conference would provide useful takeaways for all stakeholders in this endeavour. 

 In his address, Election Commissioner Mr. Sunil Arora mentioned that while Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the principal and universal legal instrument that lays the foundation of universal adult suffrage, the 2006 UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities specifically recognized the rights of PwDs. These international treaties and our Constitution lay down the broad inclusive policy framework for ECI. He cited the inspiring cases of Mr. Stephen Hawking, the famous author and physicist as well as Dr. Alim Chandani from the US for their pioneering work related to the inclusion of PwDs in the society at large.

 Addressing the gathering, Election Commissioner Mr. Ashok Lavasa mentioned that elections provide unique opportunity to enhance participation and mould public perceptions about the potential of PwDs, include their voice as equal citizens and set the stage for their social and economic integration. He quoted the famous words of Mr. Stephen Hawking “We have a moral duty to remove the barriers to participation, and to invest sufficient funding and expertise to unlock the vast potential of people with disabilities”. He further stated that impressive campaigns through attractive communication strategies for connecting with the PwD voters have been developed and adopted by many countries. This conference would result in a robust interaction and sharing of experiences from the participants which would result in useful learning from each other.

 Welcoming the delegates, Mr. Umesh Sinha, Senior Deputy Election Commissioner highlighted the significance of the National Voters’ Day celebrated every year on 25th January. He stated that the Conference is part of ECI’s initiative to make elections and electoral processes accessible to all. ‘Accessible Elections’ has been selected as central theme of this year’s ‘National Voter’s Day’ celebration. The theme, that seamlessly integrates into the underlying philosophy of universal adult suffrage and the concept of ‘No voter to be left behind.’ In his presentation titled ‘Crossing the Barriers: Making Elections Friendly and Accessible for PwDs in India’, he briefed the delegates on the major barriers and challenges faced by the PwDs and the initiatives taken by the ECI in ensuring their inclusion in the electoral process.

There were three sessions during the Conference where senior delegates from EMBs and International Organisations participated. International delegates included Heads / Senior officials of several EMBs. Head of IFES and International IDEA gave their presentations and shared their experiences, best practices and initiatives aimed at electoral engagement, enrolment and active participation in ballot exercise by PwDs in various countries.

On the occasion, the Election Commission of India also launched its Social Media Hub today, comprising Facebook and Youtube as part of its outreach programme for public at large.

On the sidelines of the Conference, ECI signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for cooperation in the field of election management with National Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) of Guinea; with Central Election Commission of Moldova and also with International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.

The MoUs provide for an institutional framework and aim for promotion of exchanges of knowledge and experience in the field of organizational and technical development, with a view to strengthening the administration of electoral processes; exchange of information, material, expertise and technical know how relating to electoral processes and systems; training of personnel and organizational development and capacity building.

Election Commission of India has so far signed MOUs with more than twenty Election Management Bodies (EMBs) and international organizations across the world for cooperation in election administration and management.

The Conference has been organized under the VoICE.NET platform the global knowledge network which has membership from more than 25 Election Management Bodies and International Organisations. The International Conference has been organised with the purpose of sharing the experience of different EMB’s, International Institutions and Experts with regard to analysis of barriers, policy interventions, strategies, programmes, good practices and technological innovation for inclusion of PwD’s in electoral processes. 

The quarterly magazine issued under the VoICE.NET – ‘VoICE International’ had its third issue dedicated to the cause of the PwD’s. The Issue carries rich experience for knowledge sharing on inclusion PwD’s across the world of democracies. 

The international delegates will also be attending the National Voters Day Celebrations in New Delhi tomorrow besides visiting the upcoming campus of the India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM) at Dwarka, New Delhi on 25th January 2018.

No. 437/TA-LA/1/2018/Communication Dated: 23rd January, 2018

ORDER

 

At the time of General Elections to the Lok Sabha in 1998, a new initiative for State funding of recognized political parties through free use of the State owned Television and Radio was introduced under directions of the Commission vide its Order, dated 16th January, 1998. The said scheme was subsequently extended in all the General Elections to the State Assemblies held after 1998 and General Elections to the Lok Sabha in 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014.

 

With the amendments to the Representation of People Act, 1951 vide ""Election and Other Related Laws (Amendment) Act, 2003"" and the rules notified thereunder, equitable time sharing for campaigning by recognized political parties on electronic media now has statutory basis. In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (a) of the Explanation below section 39A of the Representation of People Act, 1951, the Central Government has notified all such broadcasting media which are owned or controlled or financed wholly or substantially by funds provided to them by the Central Government as the electronic media for the purposes of that section. Therefore, the Commission has decided to extend the said scheme of equitable time sharing on electronic media through Prasar Bharati Corporation to the ensuing General Election to the State Legislative Assembly of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura -2018.

 

The facilities of use of broadcast time and telecast time will be available only to ‘National Parties’. There is no ‘Recognized State Parties’ in respect of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura.

	A base time of 45 minutes will be given to each National Party and Recognized State Party (recognized in respect of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura) uniformly on the Regional Kendras of Doordarshan network and All India Radio network in the above mentioned States.


 


	The additional time to be allotted to the parties has been decided on the basis of the poll performance of the parties in the last assembly election in the above mentioned States concerned.


 


	In a single session of broadcast, no party will be allocated more than 15 minutes.


 

Date of Telecast/Broadcast:

 


	The period of broadcast and telecast will be between the last date of filing the nominations and two days before the date of poll in the above mentioned States.

While reporting on the actual campaign, a newspaper may not leave out any important point raised by a candidate and make an attack on his or her opponent.

The Commission has directed that these four VFPs shall be prominently displayed at each polling booth in the poll-going State.

 

(e)  Voter Assistance Booths (VAB)

Voter Assistance Booths shall be set up for every polling station location, having a team of BLO/officials with the objective of facilitating the voters to locate their polling booth number and serial number of that voter in the electoral roll of that concerned polling booth. The VABs will be set up with prominent signage and at a conspicuous place in the premise of the polling stations so that voters are able to seek required facilitation on the poll day. 

 

(f) Increased Height of Standardized Voting Compartment to ensure Secrecy of Voting

In order to maintain the secrecy of vote at the time of poll and uniformity in use of voting compartments, the Commission has issued revised instructions to increase the height of the Voting Compartments from existing 24 inches to 30 inches. It has been, further, directed that the Voting Compartment should be placed on a table whose height shall be 30 inches and only corrugated plastic sheet (flex-board) of steel-grey colour, which is completely opaque and reusable, shall be used for making the voting compartments.

 (4)      All Women Managed Polling Station

As part of its firm commitment towards gender equality and greater constructive participation of women in the electoral process, the Commission has also directed that, to the extent possible, ‘All- women Managed Polling Stations’ be set up in one polling station for each Assembly Constituency where the entire polling staff, including the police and security personnel, shall be women. 

 

(5) Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT)

EVMs & VVPATs shall be used in all the polling stations of all the three States of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura to enhance the transparency and credibility of the election. The Commission has already made arrangements to ensure availability of adequate number of EVMs and VVPATs for the smooth conduct of election. The First Level Check of EVMs and VVPATs has been completed in the presence of representatives of political parties. A two-stage randomization of EVMs and VVPATs will also be done. In the first stage, all the EVMs and VVPATs stored in the district EVM warehouse will be randomized by the District Election Officer (DEO) in the presence of the representatives of the recognized political parties for Assembly Constituency-wise allocation. Second randomization of EVMs and VVPATs will be done at RO level before candidate setting of EVMs and VVPATs for polling station-wise allocation. This is done in the presence of General Observer of Election Commission of India, contesting candidates/their agents. This process will be carried out after finalization of the contesting candidates. At this stage also, candidates or their agents/representatives will be allowed to check and satisfy themselves in every manner about the error-free functionality of the EVMs and VVPATs. On a pilot basis, VVPAT from One (1) Polling Station in each Assembly Constituency will be randomly selected by the Returning Officer by Draw of Lot in presence of all candidates to count VVPAT paper slips for verification of the result obtained from the Control Unit. Thus, paper slip for one polling station in each Assembly Constituency will be counted in Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura. 

 

(a)      None Of The Above (NOTA) In EVMs and VVPATs 

On the Balloting Unit, below the name of the last candidate, there will be a button for NOTA option so that electors who do not want to vote for any of the candidates can exercise their option by pressing the button against NOTA.   The Commission has provided a new symbol for the NOTA option, which was designed by Institute of Design (NID). This new symbol will facilitate the voters in casting of their votes.

 



NOTA Symbol

 

The Commission is taking steps to bring this to the knowledge of voters and all other stakeholders and to train all field level officials including the polling personnel about the provision of NOTA and its symbol.

 

(b)   Photographs of Candidates on EVM Ballot Paper

In order to facilitate the electors in identifying the candidates, the Commission has prescribed an additional measure by way of adding provision for printing the photograph of candidate also on the ballot to be displayed on the EVM (Ballot Unit) and on Postal Ballot Papers. This will also take care to avoid likely confusion when candidates with same or similar names contest from the same constituency. For this purpose, the candidates are required to submit to the Returning Officer, their recent Stamp Size photograph as per the specifications laid down by the Commission. The poll-bound States will be using the photograph of the candidates on the ballot papers for the first time. Instructions have also been issued to ensure necessary publicity of this instruction.

In the second stage, from this trained manpower, actual polling parties as required shall be formed by random selection software in the presence of General Observers. In the third randomization, the polling stations will be allocated randomly to these polling parties just before the polling party’s departure. There shall be such randomization for Police personnel and Home Guards also, who are deployed at the polling stations on the poll day.

 (12)     Law and Order, Security Arrangements and Deployment of Forces

Conduct of elections involves elaborate security management, which includes not just the security of polling personnel, polling stations and polling materials, but also the overall security of the election process. Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) are deployed to supplement the local police force in ensuring a peaceful and conducive atmosphere for the smooth conduct of elections in a free, fair and credible manner. In view of the same, the very preparation of poll schedule, sequencing of multi-phase elections and choice of constituencies for each phase had to follow the logic of force availability and force management.

 

The Commission has taken various measures to ensure free and fair elections by creating a conducive atmosphere in which each elector is able to access the polling station and cast his vote without being obstructed or being unduly influenced/ intimidated by anybody.

Based on the assessment of the ground situation, Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and State Armed Police (SAP) drawn from other States will be deployed during these elections. The CAPFs shall be deployed well in advance for area domination, route marches in vulnerable pockets, joint patrolling and other confidence building measures to re-assure and build faith in the minds of the voters, especially those belonging to the weaker sections, minorities etc. In the insurgency-affected areas, CAPFs shall be inducted well in time for undertaking area familiarization and hand-holding with local forces and all other standard security protocols for movement, enforcement activities etc. in these areas will be strictly adhered to. The CAPFs/SAP shall also be deployed in the Expenditure Sensitive Constituencies and other vulnerable areas and critical polling stations as per the assessment of ground realities by the CEO of the State, in consultation with the various stakeholders. On the Poll-eve, the CAPFs/SAP shall take position in and control of the respective polling stations and will be responsible for safeguarding the polling stations and for providing security to the electors and polling personnel on the poll day. Besides, these forces will be used for securing the strong rooms where the EVMs and VVPATs are stored and for securing the counting centers and for other purposes, as required.

 

The CEOs and State Police Nodal Officer will ensure a day-to-day monitoring of the activities and deployment of the CAPFs/SAP in the State to optimize the usage and effectiveness of these forces for conducting peaceful and transparent elections and inform the Commission periodically. Further, the entire force deployment in the Assemblies segments shall be under the oversight of the Police Observers deputed by the Commission.

                Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh today launched the Rapid Detection Kits for Adulterants in Fresh Fish, developed by Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT), Kochi. Ammonia helps in preventing ice from melting and use of formaldehyde increases the shelf life of fish therefore many people in the fisheries sector are using these chemicals. The kit helps in detecting both the chemicals in the fish. Shri Singh informed that continuous ingestion of ammonia and formaldehyde can lead to many health issues including abdominal pain, vomiting, unconsciousness, and sometimes even cause death. Union Agriculture Minister said it today at the launch of kit in New Delhi.

Shri Singh said that fish consumption is beneficial for health. Since fresh fish is highly perishable in nature, so fish don’t have a long shelf life. India’s domestic fish market is reported to be selling formaldehyde-adulterated fish, especially in markets located far away from landing centres or production sites. According to Indian and International regulations, the fresh fish and shellfish should be preserved only by means of ice and use of substances other than ice to maintain quality is a fraudulent practice

Union Agriculture Minister said that continuous monitoring of these contaminants in a laboratory is time-consuming and requires expertise but some people use toxic chemicals in the form of contaminated substances. Today's consumer is conscious about the food quality and safety issues and they need rapid, sensitive, and portable screening methods. Taking these aspects into consideration, ICAR-CIFT has developed two rapid detection kits for checking adulteration of fresh fish with formaldehyde and ammonia. The kits are handy and consist of simple paper strips, reagent solution, and standard chart for comparing results. Formaldehyde is potential cancer-inducing chemical, which is a major health concern, therefore, its use needs to be curbed. For handling, processing, storage, transportation, and display for sale of fish and fish products only cold chain should be used.

                Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the Coconut Development Board’s (CDB) major schemes are focusing on coconut production, productivity, processing for coconut products, value addition, marketing, and export promotion in Bihar. The Minister said this today on the occasion of the inauguration of the Farmers’ Training Centre cum Regional Office Building of Coconut Development Board in Patna.

The Minister said that India is leading in the global coconut production and productivity. He said that the annual coconut production is 2395 crore from 20.82 lakh hectare and the productivity is 11505 coconuts/hectare. Coconut contributes to about Rs.27900 crore to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the year 2016-17, coconut products worth of Rs.2084 crore were exported. More than one crore population depends on coconut cultivation for their livelihood. The aim of the CDB is to assist the coconut farmers in coconut production, processing, marketing and export of value-added coconut products thereby to make India the global leader in coconut production, productivity, processing, and export.

Shri Singh said that the country has witnessed an increase in coconut export. During the period 2013 -15, coconut production was 42,104 million nuts whereas 44,405 million nuts were produced during the period of 2015-17. The export value of coconut products has increased from Rs.3017.30 crore during 2011-14 to Rs. 4846.36 crore, which is 60.62% more, which is an achievement. In the year 2016, we started exporting coconut oil to Malaysia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka, the countries from where we were importing earlier. For the first time, desiccated coconut is being exported to the US and Europe in large quantities from India.

The Minister said that the coconut cultivation can be taken up even in homesteads in Bihar with proper management. Currently, 14,900 hectare is under coconut cultivation. As per the Board’s estimation, a nearly 50,000-hectare area in Bihar is suitable for coconut cultivation under irrigated condition. Consider this, the farmers who train at the Farmers Training Centre can consider coconut cultivation. In addition, an increase in coconut production will lead to employment generation. More people will get employment through the production of various coconut based products like coconut chips, coconut milk, coconut sugar, coconut water, tender coconut water, coconut honey, coconut jaggery, coconut milkshake, coconut snacks, virgin coconut oil, coconut natural cream, more nee cookies and other products.

Shri Singh informed that CDB had sanctioned Rs.409.01 lakh for the implementation of coconut related schemes in Bihar for the year 2014 to 2017. To increase the area under coconut cultivation in Bihar, the focus is on ‘Expansion of area under coconut’ scheme and financial assistance is being provided under the scheme for the new plantations. For the demonstration of the scientific coconut cultivation, Rs. 46.25 lakh has been allocated for the scheme ‘Laying out of Demonstration Plot’ for the period of 2017-18.

                NCOF launched waste decomposer culture in 2015 which is proving as miracle all over the country. It is used for quick composting from organic waste, soil health improvement and as plant protection agent. It is a consortium of micro organism extracted from desi cow dung. As on date waste decomposer is solid in a bottle of 30 gms costing Rs. 20/- per bottle directly through NCOF and RCOF to 1 lakh farmers. The waste decomposer is also validated by ICAR. 

How to prepare waste decomposer?


	Take 2 kg jiggery and mixed it in a plastic drum containing 200 liters water.
	Now take 1 bottle of waste decomposer and pour all its contents in a plastic drum containing jiggery drum.
	Mix it properly with a wooden stick for uniform distribution of waste decomposer in a drum.
	Cover the drum with a paper or cardboard and stir it every day once or twice.
	After 5 days the solution of drum turns creamy.


Note 1: Farmers could prepare the waste decomposer solution again and again from the above formed solution. For this, 20 liter of waste decomposer solution is added to a drum with 2 kg of jiggery and 20 liter water added. 

Note 2: Farmers can prepare continuously this solution from this waste decomposer for lifetime. 

USES:


	Waste decomposer application 1000 liter per acre changes biological and physical properties of all type of soil (acidic, and alkaline) within 21 days of application and it helps to generate earthworm population in the soil upto 4 lakh in 1 acre land in just six months.

                Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries has initiated a number of schemes with the objective of doubling the dairy farmers’ income by 2022.  The government of India has taken several initiatives to increase the milk production by raising the productivity of milch animals. The Minister said it today while addressing a farmers’ conference, organised by the Deshratan Dr. Rajendra Prasad Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh, in Ratanman, Babhangama, Begusarai.

The minister said that since last 20 years, India continues to be the largest milk producer in the world and the credit goes to the Government initiatives and implementing various schemes to increase the productivity of milch animals.  Milk production, which was around 17-22 million tonnes in the 1960s, increased to 165.4 million tonnes during 2016-17.  Particularly, it has increased by 20.12% during 2016-17 in comparison to 2013-14.  Similarly, per capita availability has increased from 307 grams in 2013-14 to 355 grams in 2016-17, registering 15.6% growth. Moreover, income of milk producers increased by 23.77% during 2014-17 as compared to 2011-14.  In the last 3 years, with the annual growth rate of 6.3%, India has outpaced global milk production where it has grown by 2.1%. 

The Minister said that factors such as increased consumer interest in high protein diets and increasing awareness & availability of value-added dairy products through organised retail chains are also driving its demand. During the last 15 years, Milk Cooperatives have converted about 20% of milk procured into traditional and value-added products that offer about 20% higher revenue. This share of value-added products is estimated to increase to 30% by 2021-22.

He said that for the first time our government started a new initiative called Rashtriya Gokul Mission in December 2014 for the conservation and development of indigenous breeds.  Under this scheme, so far proposals worth Rs.1,348 crore from 28 states have been approved and Rs.503 crore has been released. Among other initiatives, Rashritya Gokul Mission also includes setting up of Gokul Gram.  These Gokul Grams will act as Centres for development of indigenous breeds and a dependable source for supply of high genetic breeding. Currently, 18 Gokul Grams are being set up in 12 different states.

He further added that for the conservation of indigenous breeds two National Kamdhenu Breeding Centres in – one in Chintaladevi, Nellore in the Southern region and one in Itarsi, Hoshangabad in the Northern region of India are being set up. In these centres, 41 cattle and 13 buffalo breeds would be conserved. The Breeding Centre in Andhra Pradesh is ready.

The Minister said that Under Rashtriya Gokul Mission, a Rs. 825 crore National Bovine Productivity Mission was initiated in November 2016 with an objective to make the dairy business profitable by increasing the milk production and productivity.  Similarly, for the first time, an e-Pashuhaat portal was created under National Bovine Productivity Mission, which plays an important role in linking milk producers with breeders.

He also said the World Bank funded National Dairy Plan Phase I is being implemented by NDDB in coordination with the respective state governments and Cooperative Institutions/State Dairy Federations. Under this scheme, 29 sub-projects for Bihar with a total grant of Rs.64.46 crore have been approved and Rs.37.04 crore was released until December 2017. These sub-projects have been targeted to benefit 1,50,000 dairy farmers in 2,928 villages.

The Minister was speaking at release function of coffee table book on Mass embryo transfer by Department Of Animal Husbandry, Dairy, and Fisheries (DADF) in Krishi Bhawan, New Delhi.

 

The Minister also launched software to collect data for 20th livestock Census and said as the part of Hon’ble Prime Minister’s Digital India initiative, computer tablets will be used for 20th Livestock Census. This software will have all the tools to prepare analytical reports and real-time monitoring of census operation. 

 

He said that central government has set the target of doubling farmers’ income in the next 5 years and dairy sector will play a significant role in achieving the same.  DADF has prepared an Action Plan on Dairy Development to achieve this target.  A Vision 2022 document, prepared on the basis of National Action Plan, was also launched by the Minister. The document includes an outline for dairy development, recommends measures to double the farmers’ income, and also focuses on ways and means of making milk and milk products pure and safe.

 

The Minister said that for the conservation and enhancement, a new scheme called Rashtriya Gokul Mission was launched in December 2014. Also, National Mission on Bovine Productivity was started in November 2016 to increase production and productivity of bovine population in the country. He said DADF started many collective schemes for the growth of Indigenous breeds under Rashtriya Gokul Mission.

 

He stated that among them Estrus Synchronization, which started in October 2016, was important. For the first time in the country, 1,24,000 animals were inseminated with high-quality semen of indigenous breeds through Estrus Synchronization. These animals were identified by UID and were registered on Information Network for Animal Productivity & Health (INAPH). Accordingly, to the reports received from the states, 41,353 male-female calves were produced through Estrus Synchronization.

 

The agriculture minister said on October 2-10, 2017, DADH in co-operation with 12 States undertook a Mass Embryo Transfer programme in Indigenous Breeds under the scheme, National Gokul Mission. Under this programme, embryos of higher genetic merit indigenous bovines such as Sahiwal, Gir, Red Sindhi, Ongole, Deoni, and Vechur were transferred into surrogate cows. These cows were identified by UID and are under observation. 

The superior quality calves will be used for semen production at semen centres. The Minister said through the use of Embryo transfer technology (ETT), a farmer can get a 5-6 fold increase in the number of offspring, which will be free from diseases. 50 embryo transferred technology labs are being established under Rashtriya Gokul Mission. These labs will provide a new direction for the conservation and preservation of indigenous breeds.

                Union Minister of State for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is leading the Indian delegation to 10th Global Forum for Food & Agriculture from 18-20 January, 2018 which includes the 10th Berlin Agriculture Ministers’ Conference. 

 

The theme of this year’s event is “Shaping the future of livestock – sustainably, responsibly, efficiently”. The discussions will focus on sustainable and productive animal production among other issues. 

 

Bilateral meetings with counterparts of Germany, Uzbekistan and Argentina are proposed on the sideline of GFFA to discuss issues to further enhance cooperation in agriculture and allied sectors. 

 

About Global Forum for Food and Agriculture (GFFA)

The Global Forum for Food and Agriculture (GFFA) is an international conference that focuses on central questions concerning the future of the global agri-food industry. It is held during International Green Week (IGW) and will be taking place in its current shape for the eighth time. The forum gives representatives from the worlds of politics, business, science and civil society an opportunity to share ideas and enhance understanding on a selected topic of current agricultural policy. The GFFA is organised by the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMEL) in cooperation with GFFA Berlin e.V., the Senate of Berlin and Messe Berlin GmbH.

 

Specific aspects of the GFFA’s main theme will be explored in more detail in different event formats. The opening event in 2018 will outline the key issue and explain how it will be addressed by the various GFFA events. The main events are the Berlin Agriculture Ministers’ Conference hosted by the BMEL, and the International Business Panel Discussion hosted by GFFA Berlin e.V.

 

The Agriculture Ministers will convene in the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy for the Berlin Agriculture Ministers’ Conference (not public). With almost 90 ministers at the last conference, this is the world’s largest conference of agriculture ministers. A final communiqué representing the common position of the ministers is incorporated into the ongoing international discourse on agricultural policy.

 

The preliminary work for the main events is done on the preceding day in High Level Panels hosted by international organisations. The results of these meetings are incorporated into the final communiqué.

 

In expert panel discussions hosted by various organisers, the main theme is discussed from specific topical and regional perspectives. This ensures that the GFFA is closely meshed with current scientific thinking.

 

During the GFFA there will be a Cooperation Market where associations, companies, universities and the BMEL will showcase their activities in the agri-food sector. This – along with the Business Lounge – provides all the GFFA participants with an opportunity to withdraw from the bustle and conduct bilateral talks in a more relaxed atmosphere.

It gives me immense pleasure to welcome the Hon’ble Agriculture Ministers and the Senior Government Officers and dignitaries of ASEAN Member Countries and express my happiness to be amongst our ASEAN friends today and address you on this momentous occasion. India has always been keen to working closely with ASEAN and I am confident that we can build upon the progress achieved in the past years and realise the full potential of our partnership in bringing greater peace, progress and prosperity to the people of the region. 


	India’s vision for the region, which places ASEAN at the core of India's Act East Policy, has been shared with the ASEAN leaders by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India on a number of occasions. During his recent visit to Manila to participate in the 15th India ASEAN summit he reaffirmed India’s commitment to work closely with the ASEAN countries to realize our common goals and objectives. In the words of our Prime Minister “ASEAN began in times of a great global divide, but today as it celebrates its Golden Jubilee, it shines as a beacon of hope; a symbol of peace and prosperity. The 1.35 billion people of India are keen to welcome the ASEAN Leaders as our Chief Guests at India's 69th Republic Day Celebrations”. India is committed to work with ASEAN countries to develop rural areas and eradicate poverty in line with the implementation of the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We look forward to a closer cross-sectoral collaboration with ASEAN bodies on rural development and poverty eradication, agriculture, social welfare and development and health, among others, to ensure sustainable and inclusive development in the region. 


Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,


	Agriculture and food security remain among the prime areas of focus of the Government of India with the key objective of ensuring food and nutrition security at affordable price in an eco-friendly environment. Agriculture is particularly important in the context of our region as majority of our population is still dependent upon it to earn their livelihood. Growth in Agriculture also plays pivotal role in supplying raw material to our booming manufacturing sector. Agriculture sector in India provides employment to more than 58% for rural people/youth as their principle means of livelihood besides providing entrepreneurship opportunity. India has made great strides in the field of agriculture and allied sectors. 
	During the past decades, India experienced Green Revolution and the White Revolution which paved the way for self-sufficiency in food and milk production. Moving beyond mere self-sufficiency in food and milk, we have also done very well in horticulture, fisheries and pulse production, and are working towards improving post-harvest management and development of cold chain infrastructure. Our programmes and policies are targeted to develop agricultural technologies and package of practices ensuring food and nutritional security to all our fellow citizens, to ensure livelihood security among the farming community and towards doubling farmers, incomes by 2022. 
	Agriculture is equally important for ASEAN as the majority of ASEAN countries, like India, are agrarian economies. ASEAN and India also face similar challenges such as climate change, shrinking land base, dwindling water resources, shortage of farm labour, and increasing costs and uncertainties associated with volatility in national and international markets. Diversification towards higher value crops and livestock would be the answer which will not only improve farm incomes but also to reduce stress on the scarce natural resources. Transboundary diseases also remain yet another important areas of attention which requires urgent focus and collaborative efforts. This calls for close cooperation between our countries to tackle them. 


Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen;


	Ever since India became a Sectoral Partner of the ASEAN in 1992, the India-ASEAN partnership has grown commensurate with the increase in our collective capacities and our growing economic integration. Today there are 30 annual dialogue mechanisms between India and ASEAN member states, including a Summit and six other Ministerial level meetings in key sectors, besides Agriculture. Cooperation in agriculture and forestry remains an important part of this collaborative agenda between ASEAN and India. 
	Our officials have been exchanging views through the ASEAN-India Working Group on Agriculture established in 2011. The first Ministerial Meeting on Agriculture and Forestry also took place in 2011 in Jakarta which endorsed a Medium-Term Plan of Action for ASEAN-India Cooperation in Agriculture and Forestry for the period 2011-2015. Our Ministers have already met thrice before this ASEAN-India Agriculture Ministers Meeting. We have been engaged in several projects of mutual interest and our experts, farmers, agricultural scientists and officials meet regularly to take forward our collaborative agenda. 
	In view of our common interests and potential opportunities for cooperation in agriculture and forestry between India and the ASEAN member countries, a comprehensive ASEAN- India work plan for strengthening Cooperation in Food, Agriculture and Forestry (AIWGAF) 2016-2020 is already in operation. 
	I would request that all ASEAN Embassies based in New Delhi and our new Resident Mission to ASEAN in Jakarta with a full-time Ambassador as well as those in different ASEAN nations to fully involve themselves in the process of enhancing cooperation and effective implementation of our collaborative agenda in the agriculture and food sector to benefit our people.
	I would conclude by saying that our relationship holds significant promise and potential. I am sure we will use this opportunity to further build upon our collaborations in the areas of food safety and security, agricultural technology, food processing, value chains, agricultural marketing and capacity building and take them to newer heights. As we continue to grow at a decent rate, Asian region is fast emerging as the main driving force for the global economy. While we may take comfort and satisfaction from the road we have covered so far, the journey ahead offers limitless opportunities. With our collective will, determination, and sincere endeavour, we can achieve far greater heights in our relationship.


I thank you for your kind attention.

                We, the ASEAN Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry and the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Government of India, held our Fourth ASEAN-India Ministerial Meeting on Agriculture and Forestry (AIMMAF) on 12 January 2018 in New Delhi, India. The Meeting was Co-chaired by H.E. Mr. GrisadaBoonrach, Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Thailand and H. E. Shri RadhaMohan Singh, Union Minister of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare, Government of India.

We were satisfied with the progress made in the implementation of the ASEAN – India Plan of Action (POA) 2011-2015 to implement the ASEAN-India Partnership for Peace, Progress and Shared Prosperity. We task our senior officials for the full implementation of the POA, which would help further deepen and enhance the ASEAN-India cooperation in food, agriculture including animal husbandry and fisheries, and forestry as well as contribute towards the achievement of the post 2015 Sustainable Development Goals, and the related goals of the UN Zero Hunger Challenge.

In particular, under the Action Programmeon “Promote Capacity Building, Technology Transfer, and R&D as Mutually Agreed for Global Competence in Agriculture”, four capacity building activities were implemented during the 2013–2015, on (i) IT Application for Agricultural Extension (e-Extension), (ii) National seed quality control system, (iii) Organic certification for fruit and vegetables and (iv) Conventional and molecular techniques for diagnosis of trans-boundary animal diseases. We also noted that training on Buffalo production using reproductive biotechnology was conducted. We look forward to the implementation of more capacity building programmes in 2018 on the Empowerment of ASEAN and Indian women through cooperatives, and Managing food security and price volatility. 

We supported the prioritization of joint collaborative projects in the areas of (i) Agroforestry interventions for livelihood opportunities, (ii)  Demonstration   and  exchange  of  farm  implement  and  machinery,  and  (iii)  Genetic improvement of parental lines and development of heterotic rice hybrids.

We noted the endorsement of theMedium Term Plan of Action for ASEAN-India Cooperation in Agriculture and Forestry for 2016–2020 by the SOM AMAF and India. In this connection, we underscore the importance of addressing Climate Change as it negatively impacts food security, and lookforward to cooperation on exchanging expertise as to promote enhanced resilience of natural systems, and improve the adaptive capacities of people to cope with environmental hazards.  

We look forward to the implementation of the 3rd Exchange visit for Farmers between ASEAN and India in order to provide opportunities for ASEAN and Indian farmers and fishers, including  young and women farmers, to learn  and  develop  more  efficient  farming  practices  and management skills through information sharing.

We agreed to meet again at the 5th ASEAN-India Ministerial Meeting on Agriculture and Forestry to be held in Brunei Darussalam in 2019.

We express our sincere appreciation to the Government and People of India for the warm hospitality and excellent arrangements made for the Meeting.

                Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said breed registration is an important step in documenting the vast animal genetic resource and related knowledge and information and that this process will lead to preparation of an inventory of our genetic resources so that systematic efforts can be made for genetic improvement, conservation and sustainable utilization of these resources. Shri Singh said it today at the ceremony for Award of all Animal Breed Registration Certificates, organised in, New Delhi.

Shri Singh said that a large number of livestock and poultry breeds have evolved in India due to the fact that, they have diverse use and utility and found in varied climate and ecological zones. Currently, India has 512 million livestock and 729 million poultry heads. At present, there are 169 registered breeds of livestock and poultry in India, which include 41 breeds of cattle, 13 breeds of buffalo, 42 breeds of the sheep, 28 breeds of goat, 7 breeds each of pig and horse, 9 breeds of camel, one breed each of yak and donkey among livestock; and 18 breeds of chicken and one breed each of duck and geese among poultry group. It is important that for the first time, the breeds of Yak, Duck, and Geese have also been registered.

Union Agriculture Minister said that with the advent of era of national sovereignty on genetic resources under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), a new approach is required to catalogue and describe the animal breeds. There is a need to protect our native animal genetic diversity in the light of the global scenario after World Trade Organization (WTO) and Intellectual Property Rights. Understanding the diversity, distribution, basic characteristics, comparative performance, and current status of each country's animal genetic resources is essential for their efficient and sustainable use, improvement, and conservation. Effective management of diversity of our native animals requires complete National List and periodic monitoring of the trends and associated risks. I feel that in the absence of such information, some animal breeds may fall significantly in population or even become extinct.

On the occasion Shri Singh also mentioned that understanding the need for an authentic national documentation system of valuable sovereign animal genetic resources along with known characteristics, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) introduced a process for the registration of ""Livestock and Poultry Breeds"" through National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR), Karnal, in 2007. This system is the only recognized process for registration of ""animal genetic resources"" at national level. Once registered, these genetic materials are included in the public sector, so that we can prepare an inventory for genetic improvement, conservation, and sustainable use of these resources. This type of documenting process helps to create a sense of awareness and ownership among local communities, policy makers, and research and development organizations.

Shri Singh also said that at the beginning of breed registration process, a total of 129 indigenous breeds of livestock and poultry present in the country were registered together. After this, many new breeds were registered. Today this number has increased to 169. But, even today 54% of the country's livestock population is yet to be identified in the form of breeds. New livestock breeds are being recorded from remote and inaccessible areas of the country. Agriculture Minister said that he is happy to share that this time, 5 out of 9 newly registered breeds are from North-Eastern states. Still, there is a possibility of more breeds in these areas, which would be in pure form. Similarly, there may be still more new breeds of India's major livestock resources - cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, and pigs. It is also expected there should be unique and stable lesser-known population in other species like mule, yak, mithun, duck, quail, etc. which are yet to be identified.

Agriculture Minister said that it is a matter of great pleasure that like previous year ICAR is organizing such a program this year also, in which we are going to honour breed applicants for registration of different breeds. Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that such programs will encourage the farmers and the animal stakeholders of the country.

                The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has released the Advance Estimate (AEs) of GDP and GVA for the country’s economy for the year 2017-18.  Further GVAs for the economy’s sectors including agriculture have been increased.  The GVA of ‘Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing’ for the year 2017-18 has been estimated at 2.1 per cent compared to 4.9 per cent in the preceeding year 2016-17.  

The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare (MoAFW) has had a quick deliberation on the growth rate for the Agriculture sector to strategize on ensuring that the year 2017-18 ends up with a much higher growth rate.  

The components of the economic activity ‘Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing’ and their respective approximate GVA shares are as below:


	
	
		Crops   - 60 per cent
		Livestock – 20 per cent
		Forestry & logging- 8.5 per cent
		Fishing and aquaculture – 5.5 per cent
	
	


 

Further, crop sector includes both agriculture and horticulture, of which foodgrains are pre-dominant.

The Advance Estimate released by CSO are based on the data on crop coverage and estimated production shared by the Directorate of Economics & Statistics (DES), Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare.  The DES has shared data on area coverage and production for the Kharif 2017-18 in respect of foodgrains, oilseeds and commercial crops, based on their compilation by the month of August, 2017.  These Estimate by DES are largely eye Estimate by state governments.

In respect of horticultural crops, another important component of the crop sector the data relating to area coverage and production Estimate was shared by the Horticulture Advisor, Ministry of Agriculture with the CSO.

It would help to know, that the area coverage under different crops in Kharif as of August, 2017 was below that of the previous year on account of delay in onset of monsoons in some parts of the country.  However, good rainfall thereafter helped the Ministry in increasing the area coverage in accordance with kharif targets.  Despite delay in onset of monsoons and relatively poorer rainfall vis-à-vis the previous year, the area coverage under kharif finally rose to 106.55 million ha. against the five year average of 105.86 million ha.  

In case of horticulture, similar positive trend in respect of both area coverage and production is seen as of December, 2017.  The area coverage as per first advance Estimate under fruits & vegetables stands at 24.92 million ha., as against the previous year final of 24.85 million ha.  Concomitantly, the horticulture output as per first advance Estimate is 305.4 million tonnes compared to 300.6 million tonnes in the previous year (2016-17).  

Since crop sector inclusive of foodgrains, oilseeds, commercial crops and horticulture account for more than 60 per cent in the weightage of the economic activity, namely, ’Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing’, the value in respect of crops is bound to influence overall sectoral GVA Estimate either positively or negatively.  It is, hence logical, that the computation based on area coverage under crops as in August 2017 had a negative impact on the Advance Estimate for the overall Agriculture sector.  The GVA estimate is bound to get corrected upwards, if increased area coverage by December 2017 and concomitant production Estimate in case of foodgrains, oilseeds and commercial crops, in particular are taken into account.  These three account for higher percentage of share than horticulture in the GVA computation.  And horticulture is showing a higher productivity Estimate.

The Ministry of Agriculture is of the opinion, that the lower coverage of area by August, 2017 on account of delayed onset of monsoons has caused a poor reflection compared to the actual positive field situation by December, 2017.  The Estimate also indicate that despite a lower or negative share of crop sector in the GVA computation of Agriculture, based on August 2017 status the growth rate still worked out to 2.1 per cent.  This is a manifestation of higher growth rates in livestock and fishery sectors, the other two components.  As seen thus, even by August, 2017 the estimated production of livestock and fishery was very positive and by December, crop the dominant sector has bounced back. If this amended and actual field situation are taken into account in computation of the GVA for Agriculture sector as a whole, its growth rate can be estimated to be much higher than the Advance Estimate of 2.1 per cent.

The Ministry is optimistic about achieving a high growth rate because the Rabi, 2017 is showing a very good performance in addition to good Kharif, 2017.  By 5th January, 2018 the area coverage under Rabi is 58.6 million ha., which is a very good progress. Considering that the Rabi sowing continues upto first week of February, the total area under crops and resultant production will be very good.

In totality, the crop segment in 2017-18 is expected to compare more favourably than the five year average of area coverage.  Further, the Ministry expects to consolidate the record production achieved during the year 2016-17, by focusing on realizing higher productivity.  The credit made available for the year 2017-18 is as high as Rs.10 lakh crore compared to Rs.9 lakh crore in the year 2016-17.  The Ministry has been pursing with all the state governments to enhance the availability of credit to the farmers which is a critical input for achieving higher productivity.

It is also important to note that the Advance Estimate for the year 2017-18 comes on the back of a very robust GVA of 4.9 per cent in the previous year.  Considering that crop segment constitutes a dominant component of the GVA computation, its performance is very critical.  However, with inelasticity of land where there exists little scope for increase in the average coverage, productivity enhancement assumes importance.  Crops in particular and agriculture in general are highly dependent on monsoons and overall status of weather.  Even small variations in weather tend to influence agriculture adversely, as seen for example, in the area coverage by August 2017.  The Ministry has, therefore, been focusing on achieving higher productivity in all the segments including crops.  It is confident that its initiatives including soil health card, NFSM, MIDH, PMKSY, PMFBY, e-NAM, higher credit basket and management of all other inputs including fertilizers, besides a robust PMFBY for crop risk cover will help in achieving higher productivity.  Many states have already made requests for procurement of Kharif produce, inclusive of pulses & oilseeds.  The requests have come from various states, namely, Gujarat, Maharashtra, U.P., Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh etc.  The Ministry has already approved procurement proposals worth 22 lakh metric tonnes.  This far exceeds the last year’s procurement.  In addition, Madhya Pradesh is undertaking its own operations under Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana.  Further, requests for Tur (Arhar) procurements will start pouring in from Karnataka, Telangana etc.  where the crop growth is highly robust and high productivity is expected.  Such high demands from states for procurement is indicative of high productivity being realized during Kharif 2017.

The Agriculture sector can, therefore, be expected to register a much higher GVA for the year 2017-18, when final estimate figures are released.

                Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh addressed a gathering at the North-East Regional Agriculture Fair 2018 organised by the ICAR Research Complex for North Eastern Hill (NEH) Region, Umiam, Meghalaya.

He said ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Umiam, since its inception has done many basic, strategic and applied research specific to the farming problems of the NEH Region. It developed 32 location specific farming system and agro-forestry models, including viable alternatives to shifting cultivation, release of 56 crop varieties, which includes 37 rice varieties, identifying high yielding livestock and fish species/breeds, packaging of practices for field and horticultural crops including production technology for 32 crops on cropping system basis, livestock and fish farming practices, crop and livestock production measures etc. are some of the salient research achievements of the institute. Recognising the need for the skilled human resource in the development of agriculture, the Central Agricultural University, Imphal, has been strengthened. Before the Modi Government, there were only seven colleges in the eastern states, which has been increased to 13 in the last three-and-a-half-year and it includes a horticulture college and an agricultural college in Badapani, Meghalaya. Earlier, there were 5 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) in Meghalaya and now the state has seven.

The Minister appreciated ICAR, NEH Region, Umiam, for launching the programme to double the income of the farmers on a pilot basis in the villages adopted by them in the next 5 years.  He said 90 per cent assistance is given to North-East states and Meghalaya should accelerate the implementation of these schemes.

Hon’ble Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh said the Government has initiated different flagship programmes for the welfare of the people living in rural areas, especially farming communities by improving the current farming systems and thereby doubling their income from agriculture and allied sectors. The Minister said this at the North Eastern Regional Agriculture Fair 2018 organised by the ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Umiam.

In the changing global competitiveness, there is a tremendous scope for improvement in agricultural in the North-East region, including Meghalaya. Continuous employment generation in farming sectors through location-specific technologies in a profitable manner in partnership with different stakeholders are the driving forces to attract and retain youth in agriculture. The cooperation and convergence among the states, public, private and other stakeholders in the state and sharing of information, technology, knowledge and resources can play a key role in mutual development by saving of precious natural resources and time.

The Minister said that through the adoption of improved technologies, the productivity and farmers’ income can be increased. The superior quality horticultural crops such as orange, pineapple, flowers, etc. can be produced in the region and the surplus can be marketed with the effective supply chain management, a key area that needs intervention. The farmers can increase their income by adopting technologies like crop rotation, integrated farming, organic farming, double/triple cropping system by the farmers instead of relying on traditional farming.

To boost the agriculture sector, the Indian government has set up an ambitious goal to double farmers’ income by 2022. For this, the government has started various schemes - from irrigation, soil health management, organic farming to crop insurance. The government of Meghalaya should utilise the amount allocated under Prime Minister's Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana. The state government has failed to spend the funds amounting to over Rs. 50 lakh allotted for micro-irrigation under Per Drop More Crop scheme. It is lying unused for four years. In FY 2015-16, Rs 1.44 crores was given for water management and water harvesting, the government could not spend the amount in that year.

Even in the year 2016-17, it was unable to spend Rs 32 lakhs and for the year 2017-18, the state has Rs 2.2 crores and according to the information, the expenditure report has not been submitted to the Government of India. In FY 2015-17, Rs 44 lakhs was allocated to the Meghalaya government for Soil Health Card (SHC) and as per the information available, so far 2,09,000 Soil Health Cards have been distributed. And this year Rs 53 lakh has been allocated for SHC.

Meghalaya is organic by default and a new scheme was launched after Modi government came to the power and allocated funds to the state. The utility certificate of Rs 1.59 crorea allocated in FY 2016-17 has not yet been sent to the Government of India. The funds allocated by the Modi government in the last four years under oilseeds and oil palm mission wasn’t utilised between 2014-15 and 2015-16. In FY 2016-17, only Rs 57 lakh has been spent.

The Government allocated Rs 1.5 crores in FY 2017-18, and out of that Rs 80 lakhs has already been released. So far, we don’t have any report of expenditure. I would like to tell the state government to speed up implementation of the schemes started by the Modi Government to increase the income of the farmers.

                 Government has taken several measures to increase institutional credit flow and to bring more and more farmers including small and marginal farmers within the institutional credit fold.  These measures, inter alia, include the following major steps to provide hassle free crop loans to farmers including small and marginal farmers:-

i).         Under the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS)Short Term Crop loans upto Rs.3 lakh are extended to farmers at a subvented interest rate of 7% per annum for a period up to one year. In case of prompt repayment, the farmers can avail a prompt repayment incentive of 3% per annum and thus the effective rate of interest on such loans is only 4%. 

ii).        The ISS also provides for post harvest loans for up to 6 months at the same rate of interest as Short Term Crop loans to Kisan Credit Card holding Small and Marginal Farmers, to encourage them not to resort to distress sale and instead store their produce in Warehouses accredited with Warehousing Development Regulatory Authority (WDRA) against Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWR).

iii).       Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued Priority Sector Lending Guidelines (PSL), which mandate all Domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks to earmark 18% of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposure (OBE), whichever is higher, as on the corresponding date of the previous year, for lending to Agriculture. Within the 18 percent target for agriculture, a sub-target of 8 % for small and marginal farmers has been fixed to help in increasing the flow of credit to small and marginal farmers.

iv).       As per PSL guidelines loans to distressed farmers to repay non-institutional lenders are eligible under priority sector. Besides loans to stressed persons (other than farmers) not exceeding Rs. 1,00,000/- per borrower to repay their debt to non-institutional lender are also eligible for the purpose of priority sector lending by banks. 

v).        The Government implements the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme aimed at providing adequate and timely credit support from the banking system under a single window to the farmers for their cultivation and other needs. In terms of master circular dated July 03, 2017 of RBI, tenant farmers, oral lessees or share croppers are also covered under the KCC Scheme.  The Scheme provides for sanction of the limit for 5 years with simplified renewal every year. All the banks have been advised to implement the scheme. The issue of smart–cum debit card, mandated under the revised guidelines, is enabling the farmers to access multiple delivery channels. 

vi).       To bring small, marginal, tenant farmers, oral lessees, etc. taking up farm activities, off-farm activities and non-farm activities, into the fold of institutional credit, Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) have been promoted by banks. The announcement of Union Budget for 2014-15 for financing of 5 lakh JLGs of ‘Bhoomi Heen Kisan’ (landless farmers) has given further credence to efforts of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) in innovating and reaching out to the landless farmers through JLG scheme of financing. 

vii).      Banks have been advised by RBI to waive margin/security requirements of agricultural loans upto Rs.1,00,000/-, vide RBI’s circular dated 18th June, 2010.

viii).       RBI has issued  directions for Relief Measures to be provided by respective lending institutions in areas affected by natural calamities which, inter alia, include, restructuring/rescheduling of existing crop loans and term loans, extending fresh loans, relaxed security and margin norms, moratorium, etc. These directions have been so designed that the moment calamity is declared by the concerned District Authorities they are automatically set in motion without any intervention, thus saving precious time. The benchmark for initiating relief measures by banks has also been reduced to 33% crop loss in line with the National Disaster Management Framework. 

As on 31st March, 2017, cumulatively 24.53 lakh Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) have been provided Rs.26,848.13 crore loan by banks across the country.  In Andhra Pradesh, 1,82,375 JLGs have availed loans of Rs.1,618.05 crore and in Telangana, 35,748 JLGs have availed bank loans aggregating to Rs.620.94 crore, as on 31st March, 2017.  The details of small and marginal farmers availing loan through JLG mode of financing is not maintained separately.

                Shri Parshottam Rupala and Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare presided the meeting on 21.12.2017 to discuss the issue of adulteration of milk and milk products with the State Cooperative Milk Federations, National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and State Food Safety Department representatives. MOSs advised the stakeholders to identify the unscrupulous agents who indulge in adulteration of milk as their business.  Directions have been issued by Secretary (ADF) to all Chief Secretaries and Food Commissioners of States/UTs to conduct 500 random sampling of milk every month at village level for detecting adulteration particularly of edible oil, sucrose and detergents. This drive will be started immediately and 50,000 samples will be taken countrywide. FSAAI has been advised to follow up on this. States have also been advised to install milk Adulteration testing equipments at village level for detection of adulteration by various adulterants. Assistance for this will be provided by DADF under the National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD). Rs.100 crores have been set apart for this. ICAR was directed to enable quick testing methods for testing chemicals which are not detected by the existing testing machines. Uttar Pradesh is being assisted to install 390 milk adulteration testing equipments in 2017-18 at village/District level. Other States are also being encouraged like Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu etc. The FSAAI has also been directed to develop standards for Honey testing as fructose adulteration malpractice is rampant. NDDB is setting up a National Honey Testing Laboratory for the purpose with Central Government assistance.

                Secretary, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare taken a meeting on 21st December, 2017, all the country’s major cooperatives such as Gujarat (AMUL), Karnataka (Nandini), Bihar (Sudha), Haryana (Vita), Punjab (Verka), Uttar Pradesh (PCDF-Parag) were directed to ensure that the milk being brought by farmers to the cooperative dairies should be purchased without discrimination. Already, the milk procurement by the cooperatives during November 2017 has recorded an increase of 20.4% in milk procurement as compared to the last year. The Procurement Price of milk during November 2017 is also higher by 4.7% when compared to last year. The stock of Skimmed Milk Powder (SMP) is at 1,16,946 MT due to higher conversion and expected to be upto 2,00,000 MT by the end of March 2018. Domestic price of Skimmed Milk Powder (SMP) and Ghee is higher by about 9% and 19% respectively during November’2017 when compared to last year.

Secretary (ADF) directed that a target of 255 MMT of Milk Production by 2022 has been set by the Department so as to double the farmers’ income in line with achieving the Prime Minister’s vision of doubling the farmers’ income. The total share of milk procurement by cooperatives is to be increased from existing 10% to 20% of milk production by 2022. This will ensure better returns to dairy farmers. The States and Cooperatives are to prepare their plans accordingly. Rs.10,881 crore of financial assistance is being provided under Dairy Processing Infrastructure Fund (DIDF) to Milk Federations/Unions for the purpose.

Further, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries has issued an advisory on 15.12.2017 to States to include milk in the Mid-day Meal Scheme, Anganwadi Scheme etc. Department of Food and Public Distribution were requested to consider inclusion of milk in the PDS system. Ministry of Women and Child Development was requested to include milk in the Nutrition Mission like Anganwadi Scheme. This will increase the consumption of milk and subsequently better returns to dairy farmers even in flush season as well.

The cooperatives have also been advised to set a target 2% share in the World Trade by 2020. National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) will prepare an action plan in coordination with the States to achieve the export target.

                Minister of State for Planning (IC) and Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Rao Inderjit Singh, in a written reply to a question on innovative solutions taken by the Government to cut urea consumption, in Lok Sabha today, informed that with the objective of encouraging balanced use of fertilizers, Department of Fertilizers has made it mandatory for all the domestic producers of urea to produce 100% as Neem Coated Urea (NCU). Entire quantity of both indigenously produced urea and imported urea is being neem coated w.e.f 1st September, 2015 and 1st December, 2015 respectively. 

One of the primary benefits of Neem coating is the slow release of urea, which results in increased Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE). Due to NUE, the consumption of Neem Coated Urea reduces as compared to normal urea, the Minister added. 

Shri Singh also informed that in the light of increased effectiveness of NCU, Government of India vide notification dated 4th September, 2017, has decided to introduce 45 Kg bag of urea in place of existing 50 Kg bags and a period of six months have been given to urea units as lead time to ensure smooth implementation of the policy. 

Further, the Minister stated that since farmers mostly assess the requirement of urea in terms of bags for agriculture purpose, it is estimated that the availability of urea in 45 Kg bags instead of 50 Kg bag may bring down consumption of Urea by 10%. The All India consumption of urea for the last 3 years is given below: 

 



	
		
			
			S. No.
			
			
			Year
			
			
			Urea Consumption (LMT)
			
		
		
			
			
				 
			
			
			
			2014-15
			
			
			306.10

			2016-17 (NCU Consumption)
			
			
			296.14
			
		
	



 

The Minister added that the import of urea is based on demand supply gap dynamics. The Government of India has allocated Rs. 14,000 Crore for Imported Urea in the Budgetary Estimates (BE) 2017-18.

                Sh Ashok Gajapati Raju, Minister of Civil Aviation has informed that key revisions in Scheme under 2nd Round of RCS-UDAN covering Priority areas, operational flexibility, Helicopter operations, etc have been made. Addressing the media persons here today, he informed that, “In pursuance of the Government policy relating to “Ease of Doing Business” and “UDAN- facilitating regional air connectivity by making it affordable for masses”, the following key policy initiatives have been taken under UDAN-2. Sh Jayant Sinha, |MOS, Civil Aviation, Sh Rajiv Nayan Choubey, Secretary and senior officials were also present on the occasion. 

Key policy initiatives under UDAN-2: 


	  Focusing Priority Areas to expand the Remote Area connectivity 



	Priority Area(s)’ shall mean the States of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh & Uttarakhand, North Eastern Region, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep Islands.
	‘Priority RCS Route’ shall mean an RCS Route in which at least one of the origin and destination airport is an RCS Airport located in Priority Area(s). RCS Airport satisfies definition of Underserved Airport or Unserved Airport under the Scheme. ‘Underserved Airport’ shall mean any airport which has no more than fourteen (14) scheduled commercial flight departures per week as per the latest flight schedule published by the DGCA on its website.
	Maximum Number of Flights for Priority RCS Routes: Number of RCS Flights/week with VGF, shall be   a minimum of three (3) and a maximum of fourteen (14) departures per week from the same RCS Airport. RCS Flights are operated on at least three (3) days of the week.
	Operations through Category-1A aircraft (with passenger seats less than 9) will be permitted only for Priority RCS Routes.  
	Enhanced VGF Caps for operations through Category-1 A and Category-1 Fixed-wing aircraft for Priority RCS Routes. Further, the Airfare caps and VGF Caps have been specified for stage lengths less than 151 Km and Priority RCS Routes / Category 1A aircraft.



	 Providing impetus to Helicopter services   



	Helicopter operations under the Scheme are allowed in Priority Areas (intra). 



	VGF Caps for helicopter operations enhanced: Upto 10% of the estimated annual inflows in the RCF shall be earmarked for operations through helicopters. 



	Methodology for computing the Flight duration revised as per Recommendation of Expert Committee.
	100% RCS seats for Helicopters with RCS Flight capacity of 13 seats or less. For more than 13 seats, number of RCS Seats in an RCS Flight shall be capped at 13 passenger seats.
	RCS Flights take Off


On 27th April, 2017 Hon’ble PM flagged off the first UDAN flight under RCS on Shimla-Delhi sector. Simultaneously Hon’ble PM also flagged off the inaugural UDAN flights on Kadapa – Hyderabad and Nanded-Hyderabad sectors through video-link. Since then Flights under UDAN-1 have commenced from 16 RCS airports namely, Agra, Bhatinda, Gwalior, Kadapa, Kandla, Ludhiana, Mysore, Nanded, Pondicherry, Porbandar, Ozar (Nasik), Shimla, Vidyanagar, Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Jalgaon.


	Routes awarded under RCS – UDAN during the 2nd Round of Bidding  


Airports Authority of India (AAI), the implementing agency, has issued Letter of Awards for 90 proposals received under RCS-UDAN after completion of the Second round of bidding. Key features of the proposals awarded by AAI include:


	Airports to be connected: Total 78 airports i.e., 36 currently served airports, 13 currently Underserved Airports and 29 currently Unserved Airports (25 distinct airports after removing the 4 overlapping airports from UDAN-1) will be connected. In addition, 31 helipads/ heliports will be connected through Helicopters in the Priority areas.
	Viability Gap Funding (VGF) Outflow: These proposals will required  VGF estimated at Rs. 487 crores per annum for Fixed wing operations and Rs.130 crores per annum for Helicopter operations in the Priority areas.
	Region wise allocation of Annual VGF outflow in respect of Fixed wing aircrafts operation in UDAN-2 is expected to be as follows;

*   Excluding the VGF for Helicopters which is Rs.130 crores per annum in the priority areas.


	It is expected that the Fixed wing aircrafts proposals will provide around 26.5 lakh RCS seats per annum of which will be covered by airfare cap of Rs. 2500 for approximately one hour of flying.  In addition, around 2 lakhs RCS seats per annum are expected to be provided through Helicopter operations.
	UDAN is a key component of the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) which was released by the Ministry on 15th June 2016. Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme in October, 2016 with prime objective to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable for masses. After the 1st Round of successful bidding under RCS-UDAN, MoCA had launched the 2nd Round on 24th August, 2017.
	Extensive consultation to improve the Scheme


RCS- UDAN is very innovative and based on a unique business model formulated for the first time at Government framework level. The operation of the Scheme is  through a market mechanism where operators will assess demand on routes, submit proposals for operating / providing connectivity on such route(s), seek VGF, if any, while committing to certain minimum operating conditions and the same shall be finalized in interaction with other market participants as provided for in this Scheme. The Scheme has been implemented with extensive Stakeholders’ consultation in a transparent manner. In pursuance to the vision of Government to provide impetus to the RCS-UDAN, MoCA had organized several interactive events to further widen the consultative process with the Stakeholders. Stakeholders were encouraged to share their views / suggestions along with justification / rationale for the proposed changes to enable MoCA / AAI make informed decisions on various matters.


	Key UDAN features


The passenger airfare for one hour journey of 500 km on a fixed wing aircraft or for a 30 minute journey on a helicopter would be capped at Rs. 2,500, with proportionate pricing for routes of different stage lengths / flight duration. The selected airline operator would have to provide 50% of the flight capacity (subject to a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 40) as RCS Seats for operations through fixed wing aircraft and a maximum of 13 RCS Seats on the RCS Flights for operations through helicopters. Where the fixed wing aircraft has less than 9 passenger seats, then all such seats would be RCS seats. Selected Airline operator would be given a three years exclusivity of operations. To reduce the cost of operations of airlines on flying such routes, a financial stimulus in the form of concessions from Central and State government, airport operators and the Viability Gap Funding to the interested airlines would be provided to kick-off operations from such airports, so that the passenger fares are kept affordable. State Government will provide a certain share of VGF (20% for States other than North-East States where the ratio will be 10% of VGF determined). In this regard, till now 29 States and UTs have signed MoU.

                Ministry of Civil Aviation welcomes the Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism & Culture’s 256th Report on “Issues Related to Improving Consumers’ Satisfaction of Airlines”.  The Committee’s report has highlighted, among other matters, consumer service issues and the matter of higher prices for last minute travel purchases.

The Ministry and the entire aviation ecosystem have been working pro-actively to offer passengers the highest levels of service and address consumer grievances. The Ministry partnered with all key stakeholders to establish the innovative AirSewa platform and other modes of offering assistance to passengers.  It is heartening to note that of the around 12 crore passengers that have flown domestically in calendar year 2017, we have received less than 10,000 complaints overall.  On many other consumer service issues like fog-related SOPs, the Ministry and the industry have been working proactively. The Ministry also proposes to issue an explicit and easy-to-understand Air Passenger Bill of Rights. We will be undertaking extensive public consultations to finalize the same.

With the repeal of Air Corporation Act in March, 1994 the provision of tariff approval was dispensed with by the Government. Under the prevailing regulations (sub-rule (1) of Rule 135 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937), every air transport undertaking engaged in scheduled air services are required to establish tariff having regard to all relevant factors, including the cost of operation, characteristics of services, reasonable profit and the generally prevailing tariff. The fares so established, are required to be displayed by the airlines on their websites in compliance of sub-rule (2) of Rule 135 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937. Airlines remain compliant to the regulations as long as the fare charged by them does not exceeds the fare structure displayed on their website. Any instance of predatory tariffs can be brought to the attention of the Director General of Civil Aviation so that action can be taken under sub-rule (4) of Rule 135 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937. Anti-competitive practices are also within the purview and regulation of the Competition Commission of India. 

Pricing deregulation has allowed competition to bring down prices dramatically in India, making it one of the lowest-fare markets in the world.  Indian airlines follow globally accepted dynamic pricing practices. Please note that only between 1% and 2% of tickets are transacted at the highest fare basket.  A capping of fares could raise prices for the 98-99% of the passengers. The government is cognizant of emergencies or natural calamities, which cause a sudden surge in aviation demand.  In such cases, the Ministry works with airlines to create more supply by re-routing aircraft to the affected areas and ensuring stable prices.

                Enabling provisions have been made in the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 for allocation of coal mines by way of auction and allotment for the sale of coal. The methodology for allotment of coal mines under the provisions of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 to Central / State Public Sector Undertakings for sale of coal has been approved by the Government.  

Further, to prepare the modalities for allocation of coal mines through auction for sale of coal by private companies, a discussion paper on auction of coal mines for commercial mining was prepared for seeking comments of public and stakeholders concerned and was placed in the public domain. The views of the public are largely related to the proposed eligibility conditions, auction methodology, basis of calculating revenue sharing, land acquisition etc. and general observations which inter alia included market scenario, existing legal regimes in the country’s coal market, pricing, upfront payment as well as suggestions as a way forward. The methodology for auction of coal mines / blocks for sale of coal under the provisions of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 is under consideration of the Government.

                Coal imports have fallen from 217.78 Mte in 2014-15 to 203.95 Mte. in 2015-16 and further to 190.95 Mte. in 2016-17. The trend of fall in import of coal has continued in 2017-18. As per the statistics released by Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence & Statistics (DGCI&S),during April-October, 2017-18, 118.86 Mte. (Provisional) of coal was imported as compared to 121.14 Mte. in the corresponding period of 2016-17 showing a decline of 1.9%.  

As per the current import policy, coal is kept under Open General License (OGL) and consumers are free to import coal from the source of their choice as per their contractual prices on payment of applicable duty. 

Coal India Ltd. (CIL) has also taken various steps for promotion of import substitution through source rationalization with part supply from higher grade coal sources.  Coal from various sources including higher grade were offered through various types of e-auction including special forward e-auction with ease-of-business initiatives like flexi tenure of lifting, reduction of Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) and floor price to cater to requirement of various consumers including Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) not having Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) with CIL sources.

Further, CIL has prepared a provisional calendar for e-auction from August 2017 to March 2018, in which 832.3 Lakh Tonne of coal has been put on offer under Spot, Special Forward and exclusive e-auction. 

 

Next schedule of Linkage Auction (Tentative) is given below:

 


	Non-Regulated Sector- Tranche IV is planned to commence from March 2018 onward.
	Linkage Auction for power producers / IPPs without PPAs that are either commissioned or to be commissioned, is planned to be conducted by end of January 2018. The process has been initiated.

                Coal India Limited (CIL) has envisaged to enhance its coal production to the level of 1 Billion Tonne (BT) by 2019-20 from current level production of 554.14 MT in 2016-17. CIL has identified mines with production capacity of 908 MT so far. In the Annual Plan of CIL for 2017-18, the production target has been pegged at 600.00 MT. In 2017-18, CIL has produced 385.61 MT till 01.01.2018, thus achieving 94% of the target of 408.62 MT. As per Annual Plan proposal for 2018-19, the production target of CIL has been kept at 630 MT with 5% growth over the target of 2017-18.

 

Considering the demand of coal from various segments/sectors, while finalizing the Annual Plan of 2017-18, CIL was given the off take target of 600 MT by Ministry of Coal. In the period 01.04.2017 to 31.12.2017, off take of 421.41 MT (provisionally) has been achieved. In order to achieve the annual target, CIL is required to ramp up its daily production to more than 2 MT during the remaining days of the fiscal.

                Ash content of coal produced in the country is generally 25 to 45 % whereas average ash content of imported coal varies from 10 to 20 %. Indian Coal has comparatively higher ash content than imported coal due to drift theory of formation of coal deposits in India. Coal seams formed due to drift theory contains higher ash as compared to in-situ theory of formation. 

As per Ministry of Environment and Forest & Climate Change (MOEF&CC) stipulation, coal based thermal power plant (situated beyond 500 km from the pit-head) be supplied with, and shall use, raw or blended or beneficiated coal with ash content not exceeding thirty-four percent, on quarterly average basis.  Coal Companies are supplying coal to their customers maintaining ash percentage below 34% on quarterly average basis as per the aforesaid MOEF&CC stipulation.

Coal India Limited has taken following steps to adopt international standards in Coal Mining:


	Deployment of surface miners (during 2016-17 around 46% of total production achieved using surface miner) for selective mining;
	Deployment of high capacity Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) i.e. up to 240 Te dumpers and up to 42 Cu.m bucket capacity shovels;
	Replacement of manual method of underground mining by mechanized and semi-mechanized mining method.


 

As per the current import policy, coal is kept under Open General License (OGL) and consumers are free to import coal from the source of their choice as per their contractual prices on payment of applicable duty.

In view of the buoyant production and adequate availability of domestic coal, it has been an endeavor to reduce the import of coal by power plants and to substitute it with domestic coal supply. In this regard, Coal India Limited (CIL) has taken the following steps for promotion of substituting imported coal with indigenous coal:

 


	Rationalization of sources by part of coal supply coming from sources of higher grade coal. 
	Offering coal from various sources including higher grades through various types of e-auction schemes including special forward e-auction for power sector.
	Taking intuitive like flexible tenure of coal lifting, reductions of EMD and of floor price in coal auction for power sector consumers.
	Sanction of coal linkages under SHAKTI policy.


 

However, the gap between demand and supply of coal cannot be bridged completely as there is insufficient domestic availability of coking coal and power plants designed on imported coal will continue to import coal for their production.

                The following measures are normally taken to stop /prevent underground fire in coal mines:


	Ensuring proper ventilation.
	Adoption of panel system working.
	Provision of gas detecting apparatus.
	Sealing off of worked out / depillared panels.
	Extraction of highly susceptible or thick coal seams in conjunction with sand stowing.
	Monitoring ambient mine environment conditions by sampling and analysis on regular basis.
	Stone dusting.
	Removal of spalled fallen coal regularly from workings, which are not sealed-off.
	Regular inspection of old workings.


The main reason of fire in underground coal mines is spontaneous combustion of coal which is the process of self-heating of coal when exposed to air. If the rate of dissipation of heat is relatively slow as compared to the progress of heat by oxidation, there is a gradual build-up of heat and coal bed temperature reaches to the ignition point of coal thereby causing fire. Such fire can be prevented by nitrogen flushing in fire affected areas and use of quick setting materials for construction of isolation stopping.

This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of Railways and Coal Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on 03.01.2018 (Wednesday).

                             Government e Marketplace (GeM), has been envisaged by Government of India as the National Procurement Portal of India. GeM strives to keep pace with ever-evolving technological challenges and stake holder aspirations and in line with this endeavour, GeM is coming up with a scaled up third version. The GeM 2.0 was launched as a pilot in August 2016 and its success led to this massive transformation program - GeM 3.0 which would offer standardised and enriched catalogue management, powerful search engine, real time price comparison, template-based Bid and RA creation, demand aggregation, e-EMD, e-PBG, user rating, advanced MIS and analytics and more.

Some of the notable enhancements in the 3.0 version:


	Market Based generic requirements across all government agencies
	Standardisation of specifications of both products and services enabling empirical price comparability 
	Completely transparent transactions across all ranges
	Generic standards established through universal service levels and cost comparison enabled
	Open and dynamic market place with rating based on performance of user on website


National Sellers On-boarding Campaign

Coinciding with the migration to the 3.0 version, National Sellers On-boarding Campaign has been launched to train sellers/ service providers for transition from GeM 2.0 to GeM 3.0. All MoU signed 20 State Capitals will be trained by GeM MSP trainers along with Business Groups – CII, ASSOCHAM and PHDCII. Senior Officers from GeM will visit these states to facilitate the transition. 

More than 200 people were trained and supported in registering during the walk-in Training cum Registration Centre organised on 27th and 28th in GeM Office (Delhi) from 10am to 6pm.  The officers of GeM and training team guided the sellers in registration on the new portal and listing of products. The GeM Contact Centre is also fully functioning during to handle any queries from the sellers.

Commenting on the campaign, Smt. Radha S. Chauhan, IAS, CEO, GeM said, “We are proud to launch this campaign on a day of national importance. Redefining purchase/procurement; enhanced GeM 3.0 platform, delivered and to be operated by Intellect Design Arena Ltd – Managed Services Provider (MSP) and its consortium partners will further the Digital India vision of transparency, openness and fairness. GeM 3.0 has undergone a digital transformation with superior technology and ability to scale from the previous version. This will bring together many sellers and service providers for products and services across the country under one roof, truly making it a digital tool of empowerment and entrepreneurship. This initiative gives a huge uplift for growth of MSME’s, manufacturers & service providers. As Digital India aims to bring in maximum transparency by minimising Government’s human transactional interface, the launch of the Sellers On-boarding Campaign will streamline the procurement of goods and services making it an easy, go-to portal for sellers and service providers”.

Textiles and apparel sector has made a significant contribution by providing both direct and indirect employment to almost 35 and 50million Indians respectively, making it the largest employment sector after agriculture. This makes Khadi an important segment for concentrating towards export promotion.A round table discussion on taking KHADI:local to global was organized by Indian Institute of Foreign Trade on 30th Jan 2018 with support from KVIC and UDAANSKILL. The event focused on connecting the global demand and supply of Khadi, identifying newer markets and product diversification; developing promotional strategies to enter newer markets, inputs on trade policy, market access at WTO front, compliances, design interventions and possibilities of CSR interventions from corporates and PSUs. 

Shri Suresh Prabhu, Hon’ble Minister for Commerce and Industry said that “The export prospects of Khadi is rest assured with world moving towards natural and Eco-friendly Products. More and more people are becoming conscious of responsibility towards the environment and ecology and greater demand is being generated for bio-degradable and Eco-friendly products. It is for this reason the new MEIS 2015-20 policy also emphasizes on export incentives on eco-friendly textiles giving it a 34% growth last years from 52,000 crore to 70,000 crore turn over” 

 The minister further added that this round table discussion on “Khadi exports” is pertinent considering  the fact that while textile sector being the largest source of employment generation in the country contributing to country’s 15% exports; share of Khadi sector is very low (less than 0.22%) in total textile sector.  Hence focus on exports of this sector becomes important.End to end marketing strategy with support from trading houses and academic institutes like IIFT is the need of the hour, he said. 

Shri. V.K.Saxena, Chairman, KHADI AND Village Industries Commission who was the Guest of honour explained about the diversity of efforts made by KVIC towards promotion of Khadi right from meeting the issues on raw material procurement, wage levels of rural artisans, technological and design interventions and making it a sustainable and export worthy segment. “Its export worthiness also comes from the fact that Indian Khadi earns a lot of water and carbon foot print since it requires only 3 litres of water as compared to 56 liters in other fabrics” said Mr. Saxena. 

Apart from the supply side constraints for raw material procurement and production, there is also a strong need for establishing a strong demand in global markets. This will require the innovation in terms of diversification in product and market. Lack of product diversification is quite visible through limited export basket of Khadi which currently includes silk and muslin, readymade garments, textile-based Khadi and charkha. IIFT with a strong research capability can contribute towards establishing a market intelligence and give inputs on appropriate policy instruments and contribute towards cluster development said Prof. Manoj Pant, Director, IIFT. “Giving boost to export startups, KITTES, IIFT incubation cell would aim at developing new startups working towards Khadi exports” said Dr. TamannaChaturvedi, Co-ordinator, KITTES. 

Event was attended by Foreign Embassies; corporates including Raymonds, Future group, Aditya Birla, Hero, Maruti Suzuki India Limited; PSUS including LIC, NHPC, HPCL etc, EXIM bank, Amazon India, FICCIrepresentatives of ICHR etc.

                The Government has recently entrusted the task of integrated development of Logistics sector in the country to the Department of Commerce. To fulfil this a MoU with Confederation of Indian Industry has been signed today in the presence of the Minister for Commerce & Industry Shri Suresh Prabhu in New Delhi. The Government has decided to reduce the Logistics cost in the country from the present 14% of GDP to less than 10% by 2022. On this occasion the Minister congratulated Logistics division of DoC and CII for this initiative and urged them to work together for taking Logistics sector to global levels both in terms of efficiency and cost.

The Minister has given the roadmap for modernizing the Logistics sector in India and bring it at par with the global best. For this purpose, a concerted effort in collaboration with Central line Ministries as well as State Governments has been initiated for simplifying the regulatory processes in both domestic and EXIM logistics. Logistics division headed by a Special Secretary of the DoC, Government of India, is working on a comprehensive action plan to reduce the cost of EXIM and domestic Logistics in the country by making it more efficient through easing of processes, induction of Information Technology and co-ordinated enhancement of Logistics infrastructure in the country. The Government has recently granted infrastructure status to a number of Logistics activities, which shall enable them to avail cheaper and long term commercial loans.

Work has also been initiated on an integrated Logistics portal that will be a transactional e-marketplace connecting buyers with logistics service providers with all the Government agencies such as Customs, PGAs, Port Community Systems, Sea and Air Port terminals, Shipping lines, Railways etc.   In order to establish linkages with the Government agencies, industry and academia, for developing a detailed action plan, Logistics division has planned to enter into formal partnership with all the stakeholders. The following is the road map:


	To establish Logistics Working group with representatives from DoC and Industry to examine issues related to logistics and recommend solutions 
	To foster focused engagement with the industry 
	To collaborate with the concerned agencies including state Govts and other related agencies 
	To undertake mutually agreed focused studies on logistics 
	To promote Govt’s policies on logistics

                The Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM), Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), in collaboration with ASSOCHAM and ERICSSON India, has launched a one of its kind Intellectual Property (IP) Competition ‘IPrism’ for college and university students. 

This competition invites students to submit films on piracy & counterfeiting under two categories of 30 and 60 seconds. Another category in the competition is for a mobile gaming app on IP. The last date for receiving entries is 31st March, 2018. Cash prizes worth INR 4 lacs will be given to the winning teams along with mementos, certificates and recognition on the official CIPAM website (www.cipam.gov.in). The competition aims to foster a culture of innovation and creativity in the younger generation. It will provide young creators a unique opportunity to see their creations recognized on a national platform.

Counterfeiting and Piracy cause significant loss to the industry and pose serious safety threats to the consumers. Generating awareness can help in tackling such crimes since limited knowledge about their adverse social and economic impact leads to circulation and consumption of pirated content and fake goods.

You may visit www.iprism.co.in or follow CIPAM on Twitter at @CIPAM_India or Facebook at CIPAM India for complete details and regular updates on the competition.

As it may be recalled, the National IPR Policy was adopted on 12th May, 2016 to create a vibrant IP ecosystem in the country. Creating IPR Awareness through outreach and promotional activities is the first and foremost objective of the Policy. CIPAM, a professional body under DIPP, has been actively involved in many activities including a nation-wide IPR awareness campaign.

	FIIs/FPIs allowed to invest in Power Exchanges through primary market
	Definition of ‘medical devices’ amended in the FDI Policy


 

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval to a number of amendments in the FDI Policy.  These are intended to liberalise and simplify the FDI policy so as to provide ease of doing business in the country.  In turn, it will lead to larger FDI inflows contributing to growth of investment, income and employment. 

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a major driver of economic growth and a source of non-debt finance for the economic development of the country. Government has put in place an investor friendly policy on FDI, under which FDI up to 100%, is permitted on the automatic route in most sectors/ activities. In the recent past, the Government has brought FDI policy reforms in a number of sectors viz. Defence, Construction Development, Insurance, Pension, Other Financial Services, Asset reconstruction Companies, Broadcasting, Civil Aviation, Pharmaceuticals, Trading etc.

Measures undertaken by the Government have resulted in increased FDI inflows in to the country. During the year 2014-15, total FDI inflows received were US $ 45.15 billion as against US $ 36.05 billion in 2013-14. During 2015-16, country received total FDI of US $ 55.46 billion. In the financial year 2016-17, total FDI of US $ 60.08 billion has been received, which is an all-time high. 

It has been felt that the country has potential to attract far more foreign investment which can be achieved by further liberalizing and simplifying the FDI regime. Accordingly, the Government has decided to introduce a number of amendments in the FDI Policy.  

Details:

Government approval no longer required for FDI in Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT)

(i)      Extant FDI policy on SBRT allows 49% FDI under automatic route, and FDI beyond 49% and up to 100% through Government approval route. It has now been decided to permit 100% FDI under automatic route for SBRT. 

(ii)      It has been decided to permit single brand retail trading entity to set off its incremental sourcing of goods from India for global operations during initial 5 years, beginning 1st April of the year of the opening of first store against the mandatory sourcing requirement of 30% of purchases from India. For this purpose, incremental sourcing will mean the increase in terms of value of such global sourcing from India for that single brand (in INR terms) in a particular financial year over the preceding financial year, by the non-resident entities undertaking single brand retail trading entity, either directly or through their group companies. After completion of this 5 year period, the SBRT entity shall be required to meet the 30% sourcing norms directly towards its India’s operation, on an annual basis.

(iii)     A non-resident entity or entities, whether owner of the brand or otherwise, is permitted to undertake ‘single brand’ product retail trading in the country for the specific brand, either directly by the brand owner or through a legally tenable agreement executed between the Indian entity undertaking single brand retail trading and the brand owner.

Civil Aviation

As per the extant policy, foreign airlines are allowed to invest under Government approval route in the capital of Indian companies operating scheduled and non-scheduled air transport services, up to the limit of 49% of their paid-up capital. However, this provision was presently not applicable to Air India, thereby implying that foreign airlines could not invest in Air India. It has now been decided to do away with this restriction and allow foreign airlines to invest up to 49% under approval route in Air India subject to the conditions that:


	Foreign investment(s) in Air India including that of foreign Airline(s) shall not exceed 49% either directly or indirectly
	Substantial ownership and effective control of Air India shall continue to be vested in Indian National.


Construction Development: Townships, Housing, Built-up Infrastructure and Real Estate Broking Services

It has been decided to clarify that real-estate broking service does not amount to real estate business and is therefore, eligible for 100% FDI under automatic route.

Power Exchanges

          Extant policy provides for 49% FDI under automatic route in Power Exchanges registered under the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Power Market) Regulations, 2010. However, FII/FPI purchases were restricted to secondary market only. It has now been decided to do away with this provision, thereby allowing FIIs/FPIs to invest in Power Exchanges through primary market as well.

Other Approval Requirements under FDI Policy:

(i)      As per the extant FDI policy, issue of equity shares against non-cash considerations like pre-incorporation expenses, import of machinery etc. is permitted under Government approval route. It has now been decided that issue of shares against non-cash considerations like pre-incorporation expenses, import of machinery etc. shall be permitted under automatic route in case of sectors under automatic route. 

(ii)      Foreign investment into an Indian company, engaged only in the activity of investing in the capital of other Indian company/ies/ LLP and in the Core Investing Companies is presently allowed upto 100% with prior Government approval. It has now been decided to align FDI policy on these sectors with FDI policy provisions on Other Financial Services. Thus, if the above activities are regulated by any  financial sector regulator, then foreign investment upto 100% under automatic route shall be allowed; and, if they are not regulated by any Financial Sector Regulator or where only part is regulated or where there is doubt regarding the regulatory oversight, foreign investment up to 100% will be allowed under Government approval route, subject to conditions including minimum capitalization requirement, as may be decided by the Government. 

Competent Authority for examining FDI proposals from countries of concern

          As per the existing procedures, FDI applications involving investments from Countries of Concern, requiring security clearance as per the extant FEMA 20, FDI Policy and security guidelines, amended from time to time, are to be processed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for investments falling under automatic route sectors/activities, while cases pertaining to government approval route sectors/activities requiring security clearance are  to be processed by the respective Administrative Ministries/Departments, as the case may be. It has now been decided that for investments in automatic route sectors, requiring approval only on the matter of investment being from country of concern, FDI applications would be processed by Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) for Government approval. Cases under the government approval route, also requiring security clearance with respect to countries of concern, will continue to be processed by concerned Administrative Department/Ministry.

Pharmaceuticals:

          FDI policy on Pharmaceuticals sector inter-alia provides that definition of medical device as contained in the FDI Policy would be subject to amendment in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. As the definition as contained in the policy is complete in itself, it has been decided to drop the reference to Drugs and Cosmetics Act from FDI policy. Further, it has also been decided to amend the definition of ‘medical devices’ as contained in the FDI Policy.

Prohibition of restrictive conditions regarding audit firms:

        The extant FDI policy does not have any provisions in respect of specification of auditors that can be appointed by the Indian investee companies receiving foreign investments. It has been decided to provide in the FDI policy that wherever the foreign investor wishes to specify a particular auditor/audit firm having international network for the Indian investee company, then audit of such investee companies should be carried out as joint audit wherein one of the auditors should not be part of the same network.

                The growth of different sectors of an economy depends on a number of factors, including structural, external, fiscal and monetary factors (which is partly reflected by demonetisation). Therefore, it is not possible to pinpoint the impact of demonetization and GST on sectoral outputs.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to the Note submitted by the Department of Commerce and approved the approach to be adopted by India at the Eleventh Ministerial Conference of the WTO held in Buenos Aires, Argentina in December 2017.

 The mandate exercised and approach adopted at the Conference was aimed at protecting India’s interests, priorities and concerns during the Ministerial Conference.

 

Background

In the run-up to the Conference, decisions were expected on a permanent solution on the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes as per the Bali/Nairobi mandate and other agriculture issues. Some WTO member countries were seeking outcomes on domestic regulations in services, disciplines on fisheries subsidies, E-commerce, Investment Facilitation and Micro, Medium and Small Enterprises (MSMEs).

However, ultimately, there was no outcome on public stockholding for food security purposes or on other agriculture issues due to an absence of consensus.

The Bali Ministerial Decision together with the General Council Decision of November 2014, which was reaffirmed at the Tenth Ministerial Conference of the WTO in December 2015 protects India through availability of an interim mechanism on public stockholding for food security purposes, till a permanent solution is agreed and adopted by the WTO.  Thus, India’s foodgrain procurement programmes at Minimum Support Prices remain protected.

Ministerial decisions taken during the Conference include a Work Programme on disciplines on Fisheries Subsidies with a view to arriving at a decision by the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of the WTO, in 2019. It was also decided to continue with the non-negotiating mandate of the existing Work Programme on E-Commerce, as proposed by India. As was done in previous Ministerial Conferences, an existing moratorium on imposing customs duties on electronic transmission was expanded for two years. Another moratorium on TRIPS non-violation companies was maintained, which prevents ‘ever-greening’ of patents in the pharmaceuticals sector, thereby ensuring accessibility and affordability of generic medicines. 

Ministerial decisions on new issues like Investment Facilitation, MSMEs, gender and trade, which lacked a mandate or consensus, were not taken forward.

As there were wide differences among members, with a few members not supporting acknowledgment and reiteration of key underlying principles guiding the WTO and varied agreed mandates, Ministers could not arrive at an agreed Ministerial Declaration. India did not support the draft Ministerial Declaration as it excluded or failed to adequately cover important issues such as multilateralism, the Doha Development Agenda and special and differential treatment of developing countries.

However, wide support was expressed for the multilateral trading system and the commitment to move forward on various areas of work in the WTO. It is also noteworthy that even in the absence of a Ministerial Declaration, the existing mandates and decisions ensure that work will go forward and Members will continue to work on issues such as the permanent solution on public stockholding for food security purposes, an agricultural Special Safeguard Mechanism, agricultural subsidies and other issues.

                The Department of Posts has redesigned the uniform for Postmen (both male and female) and MTS cadre in consultation with National Institute of Fashion Technology, Delhi (NIFT). The uniform has been redesigned keeping in view the functionality, comfort and durability. The uniform will provide a strong brand identity of the Department of Posts as it provides for easy identification of postmen staff. 

        The Department enjoys credibility and respect through the field operatives that is the postmen. He is the face of the Department as he delivers letters and parcels to every door. Therefore, it is important that the uniform he wears, which identifies him with the Department should be such that he stands out. Khadi being indigenous to our culture and comfortable in all climatic zones of the country was found suitable for the postmen.  

        As per the recommendation of 7th CPC, the Government has decided to provide Rs. 5,000/- as dress allowance per year. Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) under the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises has agreed to provide dresses for the postmen from its outlets in each district of the country. The Postmen can purchase dresses from outlets of KVIC from the dress allowances provided to them.  

Hon’ble Minister of Communications, Shri Manoj Sinha launched the redesigned uniform for postmen/postwomen and MTS in New Delhi in the august presence of Hon’ble Minister of State (I/C), MSME, Shri Giriraj Singh. The 90,000 postmen/postwomen, Mail Guard, Multi Tasking Staff will get benefitted by the redesigned uniform.

                Government has achieved a significant milestone under the BharatNet by completing Phase-1 of the project by connecting over one lakh Gram Panchayats (GP) across the country with high speed optical fibre network as per the declared deadline of 31 Dec 2017.  BharatNet network built under Phase 1 envisages delivery of high-speed broadband services in over 2.5 lakh villages benefitting more than 200 million rural Indians. 

At a function held here, Union Minister for Communications Shri Manoj Sinha said that the vision and the mission of the country is to connect India to realise the goal of Prime Minister’s Digital India by bridging the digital divide. Describing the BharatNet as the world’s largest rural broadband project created on the mantra of Create, Collaborate and Conquer, Shri Sinha said that the project will generate massive employment opportunities both direct and indirect in the country in days to come. He underlined the need to complete the 2nd phase of the BharatNet well before the target of March, 2019 to usher in a rural digital revolution by connecting 2 lakh and 50,000 Gram Panchayats with broadband network. The Minister asked the officials to include and enforce the clause of financial incentive for speedy execution of Phase-2 of the project and said that the infrastructure created under BharatNet will be a national asset, accessible on a non-discriminatory basis to the service providers. The project aims to provide affordable broadband services to citizens and institutions in rural and remote areas, in partnership with States and the private sector.  

Under Phase 1 of the project, till 31st May 2014 the work had been started in 4,918 GPs and 358 km Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) was pulled and only 59 GPs were made service ready.  Till 30th June 2016 work had been started in 84,834 GPs and 1,24,817 km OFC pulled covering 53,557 GPs with 7,229 GPs made Service Ready. As on 31st Dec 2017, 2,54,895 km OFC has been laid covering 1,09,926 GPs out of which 1,01,370 GPs have been made Service Ready.

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, Department of Telecom Ms Aruna Sundararajan said that to complete the Phase-1 of BharatNet, the entire eco-system of the department responded to the call of the Hon’ble Minister Shri Manoj Sinha. She said that it has given boost to Make-in-India as the key highlight of the project is that the telecom equipment deployed in it has been fully designed, developed and manufactured in India.  She said that the project also achieved a global record of laying of 800 kilometres of optical fibre per day. She said that the BharatNet infrastructure is expected to catalyse digital delivery of services for the rural poor – viz. health, education, livelihood, skills, e-agriculture and e-commerce.  The tariff for BharatNet was also revised to attract more Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) to use the infrastructure to provide high-speed broadband services in the rural areas through Wi-Fi, FTTH, and for developing utilisation models by TSPs and Common Service Centres (CSC). 

 The Department of Telecom felicitated the key performers and stakeholders who significantly contributed to achieve the target.  Shri Manoj Sinha gave away the awards for the Best Performing States, States which covered all the GPs, Best Utilisation of BharatNet, Best performing implementation partners, Best performing equipment supply partners, Best performing OFC supply partners, Best technology partners, and significant individual contributors.

                With 1.5 lakh Post Offices, the Department of Posts has the most widely distributed postal network in the world. India Post had launched a Postinfo Mobile App on 11.05.2015, which is updated from time to time. Postinfo – the Citizens’ centric android Mobile application of Department of Posts was developed by the Centre for Excellence in Postal Technology. This app has a number of features like tracking consignments, Post Office search, postage calculator, insurance premium calculator and interest calculator. This App of India Post can be downloaded in Android and Windows mobile phones. Five lakh customers have already downloaded the Postinfo App. 

The feature of tracking of complaints registered by the customers online on Computerised Customer Care Centres has been introduced in the Postinfo App of India Post last month. This aims at facilitating the complainants to track their complaints on their mobile phones. 

In addition to the above, the Department of Posts has reviewed and revised its Citizens’ Charter in December 2017, which is a tool for facilitating the delivery of services to citizens with specified standards, quality and time frame etc. with commitment from the organisation to its customers. The short version of the Citizens’ Charter is displayed in the post offices and the detailed version is available on the website of the Department of Posts i.e. www.indiapost.gov.in.

                Despite higher production and lower sugar prices in the current season as compared to previous sugar season, the cane price arrears are relatively lower than the previous season as a consequence of various measures taken by the Government of India and efforts of the State Governments.  As on date, cane price arrears in current season on SAP basis is at Rs 7826 Crore in comparison to Rs.8982 Crore during the corresponding period of last sugar season.  Even the cane price arrears for sugar season 2016-17 have been reduced to only Rs.52 Crores (on FRP basis) and Rs.1076 Crores (on SAP basis) against cane dues payable of Rs. 57,608 Crore.  Thus, about 99.9% of cane dues (on FRP basis) in respect of sugar season 2016-17 have been cleared.  Even in respect of 2015-16 sugar season, only Rs. 122 Crores (on FRP basis) and Rs. 710 Crore (on SAP basis) are pending and payments for earlier year arrears are in process.

2.         The crushing of sugar cane during the current season is in full swing and the mills will be able to liquidate their cane dues by the sale of sugar and their by-products in coming days.

                Cash transfer of food subsidy scheme is being implemented in Union Territories of Chandigarh, Puducherry and urban areas of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. This scheme is implemented as per provisions of the Cash Transfer of Food Subsidy Rules, 2015, which inter alia provides that the cash transfer scheme can be taken up in identified areas, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions regarding preparedness to implement the scheme. Identified area is defined under the Rules as State or Union territory or any specified area within the State or Union territory for which there is a written consent of the State Government for implementation of the scheme. It is therefore optional for the States/UTs to implement the cash transfer scheme or continue with distribution of foodgrains as per provisions of NFSA through fair price shops. 

This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution Shri C.R. Chaudhary today in Rajya Sabha.

                Some instances of high handling of bags by labourers during rake loading, unloading and procurement operations process were noticed in FCI. Accordingly, the matter was investigated and disciplinary action has been taken against concerned erring officials. 

Further, payment of high incentives was also noticed in some of the FCI depots. This was due to incentives norms and was taking place especially during loading and unloading of rakes when the volume of operation increases multifold. Consequently labourers have had to handle more bags than the norm prevalent at that time. The rationalization of labour in pursuant to exemption notification dated 06.07.2016 and revision of incentives norms has considerably reduced incidence of high incentives. 

Further, preventive measures like installation of CCTV cameras, biometric attendance have been put in place to avoid possible use of any proxy labour.

The total payment towards labour charges made by FCI during last three years was as under:

                The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), provides for coverage of 75% of the rural and 50% of the urban population for receiving foodgrains at highly subsidized prices of Rs.1/2/3 per kg for coarse grains/wheat/rice respectively. Coverage under the Act is under two categories- households covered under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and remaining households as priority households. AAY is therefore a part of NFSA.

The Act is being implemented in all the States/Union Territories (UTs) and foodgrains as per provisions of the Act, are being allocated for 80.72 crore persons identified by State Governments/ UT Administrations for coverage under the Act. This includes 2.36 crore families belonging to AAY category. The State/UT-wise details of number of persons covered under NFSA are given below in the table

Under NFSA, there is no provision for any Commission at the national level or District level. The Act provides for State Food Commission (SFC) in every State/UT, for the purpose of monitoring and review of implementation of the Act. The total expenditure on SFC depends on terms and conditions of appointment of Chairperson and Members of the Commission as determined by the State Government, the staff support to the Commission, other expenditure etc. and therefore differs from State to State. Central Government provides one time Central assistance of upto Rs.50 lakh for non-building assets for the State Food Commission.

                Shri Injeti Srinivas, Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, said, “The challenge before India is to figure out a way to internalise Corporate Governance. Corporate Governance is in the interests of companies as it enhances their image, acceptability and profitability.”

Shri Sriniwas said this at a Cooperation Agreement signing ceremony between the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) at the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, New Delhi today. DG & CEO, IICA & Joint Secretary, MCA Shri Gyaneshwar Kumar Singh and Mr Jun Zhang, Country Head, IFC were the signatories.

Presiding over the signing ceremony, Shri Injeti Srinivas, Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs said, “Good governance is the key to sustainability of any initiative, be it companies or the Government.”

He said currently India is the 6th largest economy in the world and in the next decade India will be in the three largest economies of the world. He said that companies will compete for ratings in Corporate Governance if the Corporate Governance norms play an important role in their value.

 

Shri Gyaneshwar Kumar Singh, Joint Secretary, MCA and DG & CEO, IICA welcomed the house and spoke on the collaborative framework of the Cooperation Agreement covering many areas. He flagged the importance of the National Voluntary Guidelines on social, environmental and economic responsibilities of business. Corporate Governance is important because there are so many companies but not enough time to track them all. Corporate governance can become the basis of indexing companies and also to ensure compliance.

 Mr Jun Zhang, Country Head, IFC, shared that India is IFC’s strongest partner in terms of investment. He also underlined the fact that Corporate Governance is the most critical factor to know if the investment is a success or a failure.

 Ms Preeti Malhotra, Member, Board of Governance, IICA, said proper implementation of the laws is the key to good Corporate Governance.

 Ms Vladislava Ryabota, Lead CG, IFC – World Bank briefed the house on IFC’s past collaborations with IICA, covering training as well as major conferences. IFC looks forward to continuing the engagement under the present agreement. She also emphasised on the need for training of board members to work as a team.

 Earlier, Dr Niraj Gupta, Head, School of Corporate Governance and Public Policy, IICA, welcomed the house. Vote of thanks was extended by Ms Geeta Singh Rathore, Chief Administrative Officer, IICA.

 IICA-IFC Collaboration Framework

IICA - IFC Cooperation Agreement covers two years duration. The programme to be pursued under the agreement is committed to strengthen the corporate affairs and Corporate Governance practices in India by enhancing the capabilities of key professionals engaged in the process. The focus of the programme will be to strengthen the institution of Independent Directors, Women Directors and other Corporate Governance Professionals. The programme also aims at supporting IICA and Ministry of Corporate Affairs in instituting a Corporate Governance Index for monitoring the improvements in compliance and governance practices of public as well as private sector yearly. The indexing of the practice is likely to provide a competitive and enabling environment for constant improvements in tune with the reform process of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

                Government of India is committed to achieve a position in the top 50 countries for “Doing Business” as per the rankings published annually by the World Bank. During the past 3 years. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has contributed significantly towards improvement of ranking in Ease of Doing Business in the country, but there is a lot more scope to further improve, especially with respect to starting a business.

The feedback provided by various stakeholders on the effectiveness of the implementation of initiatives taken by Government of India is considered as a major input during the survey conducted by the World Bank. During the last assessment year, this Ministry had undertaken major initiatives such as establishing the “Central Registration Centre (CRC)” for delivering speedy incorporation related services and near real time issuance of PAN & TAN through a single on-line process. This was achieved by the launch of the Simplified Proforma for Incorporating Company Electronically (SPICe) which delivers five services by two different Ministries through a single form filed on the MCA21 Portal. 

 This year, on the occasion of 69th Republic Day, the Ministry is launching the following Government Process Re-engineering (GPR) initiatives for making the Incorporation Process Speedy, Smooth, Simple and reducing the number of procedures involved for starting a Business.

(i)         Introduction of “RUN – Reserve Unique Name” Web service for name reservation, which will be launched on 26.01.2018.

(ii)        Zero fee for incorporation of all companies with authorized capital upto Rs. 10 lakh.

(iii)       Re-engineering the process of allotment of DIN by allotting it through the combined SPICe form only at the time of an individual’s appointment as Director (in case he/she doesn’t have a DIN).



It is expected that the above initiatives will significantly enhance the “Ease of Doing Business –Starting a Business” in the Country and benefit a large number of Stakeholders.

                The Union Minister of State for Ministry of Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs, Shri P.P. Chaudhary said that Independent Directors are watchpersons of Corporate entities. The MOS (Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs), Shri Chaudhary was delivering the Inaugural Address after inaugurating the two-day Orientation Programme for newly appointed Independent Directors of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) at the campus of Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) at Manesar in District Gurugram (Haryana) today. Addressing the newly appointed Independent Directors of PSBs and PSUs, Shri Chaudhary said, “It is high time to conduct such orientation programmes for Independent Directors (IDs) on a regular basis on various provisions, eventually leading to better accountability. The role of IICA is huge due to the large economic infrastructure in the country. He said that IDs impart balanced view along with transparency and credibility. The two most important functions of IDs are in advisory and monitoring capacity. They are systemically crucial in monitoring internal financial controls.” The MoS Shri Chaudhary appreciated the spirit behind organising the Conference aimed at capacity development of Independent Directors, since they play a crucial advisory role to ensure integrity and professional conduct in companies. Referring to the Section 150 of the Indian Companies Act, 2013, he shared the Central Government is seriously considering to develop a data base of Independent Directors at IICA.

On this occasion, Shri Gopal Krishan Agrawal, Member, Board of Governors, IICA, said that Independent Directors bring their experience of diverse fields to a company’s Board. However, appropriate knowledge and skills through such Capacity Development Programmes are vital. What is important is that the IDs have to set-up policy and systems.

Earlier, Shri Gyaneshawar Kumar Singh, Joint Secretary, MCA and DG & CEO, IICA welcomed the house and spoke on the crucial role of Independent Directors as independent advisors as they protect the shareholders’ interest. As such, IDs are institutions inside the Board. Therefore, the current initiative that aims at up-gradation of knowledge and skills of IDs will go a long way in strengthening corporate governance in the country.

Shri Madhhukar Gupta, Additional Secretary, Department of Public Enterprise, Govt. of India, highlighted the fact that the IDs have to contribute to the effective functioning of the Board and therefore, have crucial role and importance for the renewed focus on Corporate Governance.

Ms Vladislava Ryabota, Lead CG, IFC – World Bank, while referring to international best practices, underlined the need that the laws work effectively only if training and knowledge development accompany them.

Earlier, Dr Niraj Gupta, Head, School of Corporate Governance and Public Policy, IICA, welcomed the house. Vote of thanks was extended by Dr Naveen Sirohi, Head, School of Finance, IICA.

The Two day Orientation program will train 40 newly appointed IDs of PSBs and PSUs. The Program will have the presence of expert speakers and trainers from MCA, SEBI, Department of Public Enterprises, BSE, CII, IFC-world bank, UN Global Compact Network, GRI, International Integrated Reporting Council, Corporate sector, Banks, Media and Academia among others.

Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) and India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) signed here today an Agreement. Under the Agreement, IICA has been entrusted with the key responsibility of capacity building of IPPB through training of its officials/employees besides providing research support by instituting Research Chairs in the emerging area of payment banking.

In his Presiding Remarks, Shri Injeti Srinivas, Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) remarked that “after green and white revolution, a Financial Revolution in India is all set to transform the rural economy”. “With massive network of post offices, IPPB can very effectively remedy the lack of financial inclusion in India” said Shri Injeti Srinivas, Secretary, MCA, while speaking on the occasion of Agreement Signing Ceremony between Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) and India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) in New Delhi today. Senior officials from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and Department of Posts, Faculty and officials from IICA and other invited guests participated in the ceremony.

On this occasion, Secretary, Department of Posts, Shri AN Nanda highlighted that mobilization of household savings – a sound pillar giving strength to Indian economy – has been facilitated by Department of Posts since long. He emphasized that IPPB shall be adding further strength to Jandhan Yojana of the Government of India by facilitating ‘ease of transaction’. 

IPPB is a flagship ""financial inclusion"" initiative of Government of India to cover major portion of the country's population that is outside the ambit of formal banking.

Shri Gyaneshawar Kumar Singh, Joint Secretary, MCA and DG & CEO, IICA presented the framework of the collaboration to the house, and said that the services provided by the IPPB will be at the doorstep which will include third party transfer and Direct Benefit Transfer. He said that the policy of last 60 years will become reality in the next 5-6 years. “We want to leverage the trust held by the Post Office and the Postman. The trust that the people repose in Postmen will help immensely in delivering of financial services. This is a rural-centric initiative as city has abundant financial services.”

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Suresh Sethi, MD & CEO, IPPB, said that this is the largest financial literacy mission in the world. India Post Payments Bank can reach 6 times from the 50,000 branches currently. The rural banking infrastructure has the potential of increasing 10-fold. The India Post Payments Bank infrastructure will connect with the bigger banking infrastructure and provide inclusive banking services in the rural area. Training takes a central role as it impacts the operational efficiency as well proper utilisation of available technology. It will be agents’ and bankers’ understanding and initiative that will alleviate the fear of technology. Service orientation is also another critically important component. Shri Sethi remarked that standing on the principles of accessibility and affordability, IPPB is in the process of not only offering last mile delivery of financial services but also connect with larger financial ecosystem. IPPB is going to be the largest financial literacy programme anywhere in the world, he added.

                The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has amended (i) the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016, and (ii) the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Fast Track Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2017 on 31stDecember, 2017.

According to the Regulations, a Resolution Plan needs to identify specific sources of funds to be used for paying the liquidation value due to dissenting creditors. For this purpose, the ‘Dissenting Financial Creditor’, according to amended Regulations, means a financial creditor who voted against the Resolution Plan or abstained from voting for the Resolution Plan, approved by the Committee of Creditors.

As per the Amendments, it is not necessary to disclose ‘liquidation value’ in the Information Memorandum. After the receipt of Resolution Plan(s) in accordance with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code) and the Regulations, the Resolution Professional shall provide the liquidation value to every member of the Committee of Creditors after obtaining an undertaking from the member to the effect that such member shall maintain confidentiality of the liquidation value and shall not use such value to cause an undue gain or undue loss to itself or any other person. Also, the Interim Resolution Professional or the Resolution Professional, as the case may be, shall maintain confidentiality of the liquidation value.

According to the Amendments, a Resolution Applicant shall submit the resolution plan(s) to the resolution professional within the time given in the invitation for the Resolution Plans in accordance with the provisions of the Code. This will enable the Committee of Creditors to close a resolution process as early as possible subject to provisions in the Code and the Regulations.

The Amendments have come into force from today on their publication in the Gazette of India. The Amendments are available at www.mca.gov.in and www.ibbi.gov.in.

A person seeking to become a “valuer” requires to clear valuation examination in the respective area. These courses shall be delivered by Registered Valuers Organisations in not less than 50 hours.

Notifications to this effect were issued by the Government of India under the Companies Act, 2013, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. A person currently rendering valuation services under the Companies Act, 2013, may continue without a certificate of registration up to 31st March 2018.

 The IBBI had earlier on 27th December 2017 recognised two Registered Valuers Organisations, “the Institution of Estate Managers and Appraisers” in the asset class of “land and building” and “the IOV Registered Valuers Foundation” in all three asset classes of “land and building”, “plant and machinery” and “securities or financial assets”.

 It is a pre-requisite before registering with the IBBI that the valuer must fulfil four pre-requisite conditions of:

 a.      Must have necessary qualification and experience

b.      Enrolled as a valuer member with a Registered Valuer Organisation (RVO)

c.      Complete a recognised educational course conducted by the RVO

d.      Pass valuation examination conducted by IBBI

                The Lalit Kala Akademi’s National Exhibition of Art is held every year to exhibit the works of brilliance and to give appreciation and recognition to outstanding artists. Minister of State for Culture (Independent Charge), Dr. Mahesh Sharma inaugurated The 59th National Exhibition of Art at Lalit Kala Gallery in New Delhi today. The exhibition covers artworks from extensive series of mediums like paintings, sculptures, graphics, photographs, drawings, installation and multimedia.  The Exhibition is being visited by art practitioners, artists, art collectors, art lovers and critics from all over the country. The catalogue for the 59th National Exhibition of Art has also been released by Dr Mahesh Sharma. 

Culture Minister Dr. Mahesh Sharma said, a person who does physical toil is a laborer, a person who utilizes his brain to work can be an engineer but it is only an artist who works with all his heart. Let us help all these artists to get a platform to display their art and creativity.

 

The inauguration ceremony was attended by eminent artists like Adwaita Gadanayak, Vijay Kumar, Kathrine Kumar,  Pravesh Khanna, Mukul Pawar, Gogi Saroj Pal, Ananda Moy Bannerji. Amit Dutt , an awardee from the age group above 50 years was also present. 

As quoted by Maurice Denis “One needs to Remember, that a picture, before it is a picture of a battle horse, a nude woman, or some story, is essentially a flat surface covered in colours arranged in a certain order.”  Contemporary art is reaching out to a larger audience and globally evolving. The artists have been experimenting with newer mediums and are responding to the environment around them. The artworks highlight the signature style of each artist, depicting the current cultural and global influences on Indian art, thus creating a deeper interest in art today., Administrator Lalit Kala Akademi Sh. C. S. Krishna Setty said.

Six languages i.e. Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia have been given status of classical languages. The Criteria adopted by the Government to determine the eligibility of a language for granting classical language status, are as under: 

 


	High antiquity of its early texts/ recorded history over a period of 1500-2000 years;
	A body of ancient literature/ texts, which is considered a valuable heritage by generations of speakers;
	The literary tradition be original and not borrowed from another speech community;
	The classical language and literature being distinct from modern, there may also be a discontinuity between the classical language and its later forms or its offshoots. 


 

A proposal for granting of classical status to Marathi language has been received from Marathi Language Department, Government of Maharashtra. The said proposal was placed before the Committee of Linguistic Experts for its consideration.  The said Committee recommended the grant of classical status to Marathi language and the said recommendations are under consideration of the Ministry. However, in the light of several Writ Petitions filed by Shri R. Gandhi in the High Court of Judicature at Madras on the subject, it was decided to wait for the outcome of the said Writ Petitions. The Hon’ble High Court of Judicature at Madras has disposed of the Writ Petitions vide common order dated 08.08.2016 declining to interfere in the matter and disposed of all the petitions. Consequently, the proposal for grant of classical status to Marathi language is again under active consideration of this Ministry.

                The third Scorpene class submarine constructed by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited for the Indian Navy, was launched today, 31 January 2018 by Mrs Reena Lanba, President Navy Wives Welfare Association after the recitation of Sanskrit shlokas from the Atharva Veda and traditional ceremonies associated with the launch of naval platforms. She also named this submarine as ‘Karanj’ and wished her good fortune.

Admiral Sunil Lanba, Chief of the Naval Staff was the chief guest on the occasion. VAdm Girish Luthra, FOC-in-C, Western Naval Command and VAdm D M Deshpande, Controller Warship Production & Acquisition (CWP&A), Rear Admiral Guillame de Garidel, Head of Asia Pacific, DGA France and other senior officers and dignitaries from MoD, MDL and state government were also present during the ceremony. This historic event reaffirms the giant strides taken by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd (MDL) in the ongoing ‘Make In India’ programme, which is being actively implemented by the Department of Defence Production (MoD).

The submarine was then towed to Mumbai Port Trust, for separation from the pontoon. Karanj will now undergo rigorous trials and tests, both in harbour and at sea before it is commissioned into the Navy.

The contract for the construction and Transfer-of-Technology for six Scorpene submarines in series, has M/s Naval Group (formerly DCNS) of France as ‘Collaborator’ and are being built by MDL.

During his address, Admiral Sunil Lanba, CNS, said that the launch of Karanj marked a significant departure from the manning and training philosophy that was adopted for the first two submarines and added that from third submarine onwards the Navy would be fully self reliant in training and certification processes. He also mentioned that the old Karanj had served the nation for 34 years from 1969 to 2003 including participation in 1971 war.

 

The state-of- the-art technology utilised for construction of the Scorpene class submarines has ensured superior stealth features such as advanced acoustic silencing techniques, low radiated noise levels, hydro-dynamically optimized shape and the ability to launch a crippling attack on the enemy using precision guided weapons. The attack can be launched with both torpedoes and tube launched anti-ship missiles, whilst underwater or on surface. The stealth of this potent platform is enhanced by the special attention given to various signatures. These stealth features give it an invulnerability, unmatched by most submarines.

 

 

Scorpene submarines can undertake multifarious types of missions i.e Anti-Surface warfare, Anti-Submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, mine laying, area surveillance etc. The submarine is designed to operate in all theatres, with means provided to ensure interoperability with other components of a Naval Task Force. It is a potent platform, marking a generational shift in submarine operations.

 

Last year, on 14 December 2017, INS Kalvari, the first Scorpene class submarine was commissioned into the Indian Navy, by Hon’ble Prime Minister. Khanderi, the second Scorpene class submarine was launched in January 2017, and is currently undergoing the rigorous phase of sea trials and is also scheduled to be delivered shortly.

                This year, Indian tunes will be the flavour of ‘Beating the Retreat’ ceremony, here tomorrow. As many as 26 performances on the historic Vijay Chowk will enthral the spectators with captivating and foot-tapping music of the bands from the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the State Police and Central Armed Police Force (CAPF). Out of the 26 performances, 25 tunes have been composed by Indian musicians, which are ‘Indian Soldiers’, ‘Jhelum’, ‘Aj Diya Rati’, ‘Herana Herana’, ‘Nritya Sarita’, ‘Kundan Singa’, ‘Mayur Nritya’, ‘Manohar’, ‘Natraj’, ‘Battle of the Sky’, ‘Sitare Hind’, ‘Mushkoh Valley’, ‘Giri Raj’, ‘Tejas’, ‘Gagan Shakti’, ‘The Great Marshal’, ‘The Brave Warriors’, ‘INS Nilgiri’, ‘Namaste India’, ‘Jai Bharti’, ‘Amrit Wani’, ‘Veer Gorkha’ and ‘Shere-E-Jawan’, while ‘Power of Sound’ and ‘Kingdom of Heaven’ are two new compositions. The only western tune will be ‘Abide with me’. The event will come to a close with the ever-popular tune of ‘Sare Jahan se Acha’.    

The ceremony at the Vijay Chowk on January 29th every year marks the culmination of the four-day-long Republic Day celebrations. This year, 18 Military Bands, 15 Pipes and Drums Bands from Regimental Centres and Battalions are participating in Beating the Retreat ceremony. Besides one each of Indian Navy and Indian Air Force band will also form part of the event. Another band of the State Police and CAPF comprising Central Industrial Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force and Delhi Police will also take part.

The principal conductor of Beating the Retreat ceremony will be Maj Ashok Kumar while Army Military bands conductor will be Sub Maj SK Sharma and the Navy and Air Force band conductors will be Master Chief Petty Officer (Musician-I) Ramesh Chand and Junior Warrant Officer Ashok Kumar respectively. The conductor of the State Police and CAPF bands will be Constable Bhim Singh. Buglers will perform under the leadership of Sub Jagdish Giri and pipes and drums bands will play under the instructions of Sub Maj Num Bahadur Gurung.

‘Beating the Retreat’ has emerged as an event of national pride when the Colours and Standards are paraded. The ceremony traces its origins to the early 1950s when Major Roberts of the Indian Army indigenously developed the unique ceremony of display by the massed bands. ‘Beating Retreat’ marks a centuries old military tradition, when the troops ceased fighting, sheathed their arms and withdrew from the battlefield and returned to the camps at sunset at the sounding of the Retreat. Colours and Standards are cased and flags lowered. The ceremony creates nostalgia for the times gone by.

In Jun 2017, the Chhattisgarh Police and CRPF had launched ""Operation Prahar"", a major joint operation against Naxalites in Sukma district. Anti Naxal Task Force (ANTF) was involved in large scale troop induction missions and was on hot stand-by at Sukma and Jagdalpur. On
24 Jun 17, a heavy exchange of fire took place between CRPF and the Naxals at Tondamarka located 20 km south of Chintagufa in Sukma, in which five jawans of the Special Task Force (STF) of Chhattisgarh Police were critically injured. Since it was impossible to move the casualties to any nearby helipad, the IAF agreed to evacuate the casualties from the encounter area itself. Sqn Ldr Kamal Sharma Flying (Pilot), an experienced Helicopter Combat Leader was tasked to proceed immediately to Sukma.

           Sqn Ldr Sharma assessed the complete situation and took an operational update from SP Sukma. On receiving the go ahead from Task Force Commander, he immediately proceeded to the dangerous conflict zone to land at a designated unprepared landing zone as captain of the lead aircraft, with another helicopter providing overhead escort protection. The weather was inclement and the encounter zone was in thick jungles in an unfamiliar area where the security forces had never ventured earlier. Judiciously avoiding known threat zones and in a display of courage, he safely landed in a small clearing in the encounter zone in the thick jungle and picked up the five casualties. While taking off, the helicopter was fired upon by the Naxalities. There were bullet hits in the cargo compartment and a rotor blade. Notwithstanding the firing on the helicopter, he remained undeterred. He displayed exceptional courage and situational awareness, in maneuvering the helicopter from the firing zone as the safety of the casualties, his crew and the aircraft was paramount in his mind. After ascertaining the aircraft's airworthiness by getting it visually inspected by the escort helicopter, he carried out a safe landing at Sukma. He further ensured that the casualties were promptly moved in the other helicopter to Raipur. By willingly accepting and executing a very high risk mission, saving precious lives and the helicopter, Sqn Ldr Sharma displayed exceptional courage which has special significance not only for the IAF but also for the troops involved in these operations.

For his act of exceptional courage and fortitude in the conduct of a daring mission in Operation Triveni, Squadron Leader Kamal Sharma has been awarded Vayu Sena Medal (Gallantry).

On Saturday, 11 Mar 17 at 0630 h the Unit of  Wing Commander Anshul Saxena Flying (Pilot) was tasked for a casualty evacuation of an ITBP personnel from Zursar post, situated at a height of 17,000 feet on the Indo-China border. The patient had suffered a major heart attack and needed immediate evacuation to survive. Wing Commander Anshul Saxena  took stock of the situation and immediately activated the necessary services for launching the rescue effort. On the day of the planned evacuation the weather in the sector was marginal with poor visibility, strong winds and clouding which added to the extreme challenges of high altitude faced by the pilots, Wg Cdr Saxena took the responsibility to lead a two helicopter formation himself for the rescue in the marginal weather. Quick reaction and exemplary planning by him ensured that the mission was underway in the shortest possible time. The risk and challenges faced in such a high altitude evacuation whilst negotiating poor visibility and heavy turbulence are of a very high order. He has more than 4400 hours of accident/incident free flying over varied and extremely challenging terrain.

 Another risk faced by the officer was the proximity of the rescue site to the International border with China and obstructions near the helipad which demanded extremely skillful handling of the helicopter at the limits of flight envelope. While approaching the helipad at an altitude of more than 17,000 feet, the weather deteriorated further and visibility dropped to barely 500 m. Wg Cdr Saxena quickly and correctly assessed the situation. He had the option to turn back as a slight misjudgment could have resulted in an adverse situation. He displayed exceptional courage and took a conscious decision to evacuate the seriously ill ITBP personnel. He advised the other member of the formation to hold clear in the valley while he landed to pick up the casualty. While on short finals to land at the unprepared (kutcha) helipad, there was very limited oxygen, varying winds, turbulence and snow bowl which grossly increased the danger of landing in a high altitude helipad. Displaying courage and superior flying skills in the face of adversity, Wg Cdr Saxena executed a safe landing. After picking up the casualty, he again successfully negotiated marginal weather en-route to land at Loma, where he personally undertook a quick turn-around servicing of the aircraft to continue further flight to Leh. He landed safely at the 153 General Hospital at Leh with the casualty on board. He therefore, kept the highest traditions of IAF and set an example for his subordinates by saving the life of the ill personnel.

 For this courageous act of professionalism and undeterred valour in which a

precious life was saved by timely evacuation of a combatant from an extremely challenging helipad, Wing Commander Anshul Saxena has been awarded Vayu Sena Medal (Gallantry).

Corporal Devendra Mehta was attached for active counter insurgency operations with 13 Rashtriya Rifles Battalion under the aegis of 'Op Rakshak' in Jammu & Kashmir. On 18 Nov 17, based on specific tech intelligence, an offensive was launched jointly by the Garud detachment and 13 RR in Chanderger village of Bandipora district in J&K. The Garud detachment covertly approached the target house where the suspected terrorists were hiding and laid a close quarter ambush. Corporal Mehta was assigned the role of buddy of LMG man. He exhibited exceptional situational awareness and effective combat skills while deployed in the cordon. He helped establish a speculative and deadly field of fire with his buddy, thereby sealing the likely escape routes of the terrorists. While the detachment laid in wait, six terrorists hiding in the house, rushed out, shooting and lobbing grenades at the Garuds. Corporal Mehta demonstrated indomitable courage by retaliating with effective, accurate lethal fire and gunned down one category 'A' terrorist named Abu Qital (LeT front man in North Kashmir). To counter other advancing terrorists, he readjusted his arc of fire and provided cover to the LMG man, being fully aware of the risk of being exposed to automatic gunfire. Cpl Mehta disregarding personal safety, displayed indomitable courage while assisting in the evacuation of his buddy Corporal Nirala who was critically injured in the gun fight and took over the LMG to retaliate in order to neutralise the six terrorists.

 

           For this act of gallantry, Corporal Devendra Mehta has been awarded Shaurya Chakra.

                918203 Corporal Jyoti Prakash Nirala Indian Air Force (Security) was on posted strength of a Garud Special Forces Unit, a detachment of which was attached to a Rashtriya Rifles Battalion under aegis of ‘Op Rakshak’ in Jammu & Kashmir. 



 

On 18 November, 2017, based on specific tech intelligence, an offensive was launched jointly by the Garud detachment and Rashtriya Rifles Battalion in Chanderger village of Bandipora district in J&K. The Garud detachment covertly approached the target house where the suspected terrorists were hiding and laid a close quarter ambush. Cpl Nirala, displaying exceptional battle craft, positioned himself close to the approach of the hideout, thus cutting off all possibilities of an escape by the terrorists. Laying this ambush itself at such close quarters demanded a very high degree of courage and professional acumen. 

 

While the detachment laid in wait, six terrorists hiding in the house, rushed out, shooting and lobbing grenades at the Garuds. Cpl Nirala, disregarding personal safety and displaying indomitable courage, retaliated with effective lethal fire and gunned down  two category ‘A’ terrorists and injured two others. In this violent exchange of fire, Cpl Nirala was hit by a volley of small arms fire. Despite being critically injured, the Corporal continued retaliatory fire. Subsequently, he succumbed to fatal gunshot wounds received in the fierce encounter, which resulted in the killing of all six dreaded terrorists.

 

Corporal Jyoti Prakash Nirala exhibited most conspicuous gallantry in fighting with terrorists and made supreme sacrifice.

         Corporal Jyoti Prakash Nirala was a specialist weapon operator in the IAF Special Forces Detachment. He was attached with 13 Rashtriya Rifles Battalion, under the aegis of 'Op Rakshak' in Jammu & Kashmir for active counter insurgency operations. On 18 Nov 17, based on specific tech intelligence, an offensive was launched jointly by the Garud detachment and 13 RR in Chanderger village of Bandipora district in J&K. The Garud detachment covertly approached the target house where the suspected terrorists were hiding and laid a close quarter ambush. Cpl Nirala, displaying exceptional battle craft, positioned himself close to the approach of the hideout, thus cutting off all possibilities of an escape by the insurgents. Laying this ambush itself at such close quarters demanded a very high degree of courage and professional acumen.

While the detachment laid in wait, six terrorists hiding in the house, rushed out, shooting and lobbing grenades at the Garuds. Cpl Nirala, disregarding personal safety and displaying indomitable courage, retaliated with effective lethal fire and gunned down a category 'A' terrorist named Ubaid Alias Osama Jungi (nephew of LeT commander Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi). Readjusting his position to protect his colleagues and preventing other terrorists from escaping, Cpl Nirala killed one more category `A+' terrorist, named Mehmud Bhai (LeT North Kashmir commander) and injured two others. In this violent exchange of fire, Cpl Nirala was hit by a volley of small arms fire. Despite being critically injured, the Corporal continued retaliatory fire. Subsequently, he succumbed to fatal gunshot wounds received in the fierce encounter, which resulted in the killing of alI six dreaded terrorists.

 

For this act of most conspicuous bravery, pre-eminent valour and supreme sacrifice, Corporal Jyoti Prakash Nirala has been awarded Ashok Chakra (Posthumous).

                Though remote control car keys are very common nowadays, invitees/spectators carrying them used to face inconvenience, as the same is not allowed inside the seating enclosures due to security reasons during Republic Day Parade. 

The issue of making arrangements outside the seating enclosures for deposit of remote car keys brought by invitees, has been raised from time to time. 

For the convenience of the invitees, arrangements for deposit of remote car keys brought by them have been made in each Parking Area during Republic Day Parade -2018.

Two such remote car key deposit booths, one on the South side of Rajpath and another on the North of Rajpath, will also be set up during Beating Retreat Ceremony-2018 and the shows on 27th & 28th January, 2018.

                Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman visited NCC Republic Day Camp 2018 today and conferred Raksha Mantri Padak and Commendation Cards to NCC Cadets for their exemplary performance and devotion to duty at an impressive 'Investiture Ceremony' held at Cariappa Parade Ground, Delhi Cantt.

 

In her address, the Raksha Mantri complimented the NCC for doing exceptional work towards Swachhata Abhiyan. She complimented the NCC fraternity for making an invaluable contribution towards National integration and Nation Building through multifarious activities of NCC. Speaking on the occasion, Smt Sitharaman said, “The youth of independent India are extremely fortunate that such an organisation exists in our country which devotes vast amount of resources towards their personality development. The NCC infuses and nurtures qualities like leadership, secularism, patriotism, selfless service, discipline, hard work and other character building qualities in the youth of the country.” 

 

She said that the NCC is doing a yeoman service to the nation by transforming the ‘Youth of the Nation’, which has the largest and youngest population profile in the world. A Contingent of smartly turned out NCC cadets drawn from the three wings namely the Army, Navy and the Air Force presented an impressive Guard of Honour to the Raksha Mantri. 

 

Raksha Mantri Padak was instituted in 1989 and since then it is awarded to the most deserving cadet every year for bravery or exceptional service of highest order. This year the Raksha Mantri Padak has been awarded to Cadet Priya  of Uttar Pradesh Directorate, Raksha Mantri Commendation Cards have been awarded to CWO Bhuvnesh Rathore of Rajasthan Directorate, Capt Arundati J Patel of Andhra Pradesh & Telangana Directorate and Cadet Soumarjit Ghosh of West Bengal & Sikkim Directorate.

These achievements will no doubt attract large number of young and enthusiastic students to join the NCC. I am sure these young achievers would bring laurels to our country in the times to come.”

 

The Raksha Mantri also inspected the well-laid out Flag Area, prepared by the cadets from all 17 NCC Directorates, depicting various social awareness themes.  She was given a crisp brief by the cadets on their respective models. Raksha Mantri also visited the ‘Hall of Fame’, a proud possession of NCC with display of rich archival collection of alumni photographs, models and other achievements of the NCC.

                INSV Tarini entered Port Stanley (Falkland islands) today during it’s maiden voyage to circumnavigate the globe. This is the first-ever Indian circumnavigation of the globe by an all-women crew. The vessel is skippered by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi, and the crew comprises Lieutenant Commanders Pratibha Jamwal, P Swathi, and Lieutenants S Vijaya Devi, B Aishwarya and Payal Gupta.

 

Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, Hon’ble Raksha Mantri had flagged-off INSV Tarini from Goa on 10 September 17. The vessel has covered approximately 15000 Nautical miles from Goa, crossing the Equator on 25 September 17, Cape Leeuwin on 09 November 17 and Cape Horn on 18 January 18.

 

The vessel and the crew experienced rough weather and stormy winds during the passage across the Pacific ocean that spanned 41 days. This coupled with the extremely cold climatic conditions prevailing in the region, proved to be a daunting task to overcome for the Indian Navy crew. Winds in excess of 60 knots and waves upto 7 meters were experienced on this leg of the passage.

 

The indigenously-built INSV Tarini is a 56-foot sailing vessel, which was inducted in the Indian Navy earlier this year, and showcases the ‘Make in India’ initiative on the International forum.

 

The expedition titled ‘Navika Sagar Parikrama’, is in consonance with the National policy to empower women to attain their full potential. It also aims to showcase ‘Nari Shakti’ on the world platform and help revolutionise societal attitudes and mindset towards women in India by raising visibility of their participation in challenging environs.

  

The vessel is scheduled to return to Goa in April 2018, on completion of the voyage. The expedition is being covered in five legs, with stop-overs at four ports: Fremantle (Australia), Lyttleton (New Zealand), Port Stanley (Falklands), and Cape Town (South Africa). Presently, the vessel has covered three of the five legs of the voyage, with the first port halt at Fremantle (Australia) in October and the second at Lyttelton (New Zealand) in November last year.

 

The crew has also been collating and updating meteorological, ocean and wave data on a regular basis for accurate weather forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD), as also monitoring marine pollution on the high seas. They would interact extensively with the local populace, especially children, during the port halt to promote Ocean sailing and the spirit of adventure.

 

The vessel is likely to depart Port Stanley on 4 Feb 18.

            Yesterday,
The Siachen Pioneers- 114 HU based at Leh, carried out a daring casevac mission
from the far flung reaches of the Zanskar valley in the Ladakh sector. The
casualty was part of the “Chadar Trek” organised over the frozen Zanskar river.
Inspite of the short notice, the crew got airborne in 40’ of receipt of message.
The mission being in highly inaccessible area called for a two helicopter
mission. This way if one helicopter went down, the other was available for
support. As the coordinates for the site were not available due to poor
communication, the aircrew were faced with the daunting task of searching for
the casualty in the icy mountains and crevices of the Zanskar Valley. Once they
located the casualty  the Capt – Wg Cdr Khan realised that the landing would be
an arduous and dangerous  task due to the terrain in the narrow valley on an
unprepared surface.

 

Undeterred
and in keeping with the motto of the unit-“We do the difficult as routine, the
impossible only takes a little longer”, the crew displayed exceptional skill in
maneuvering the aircraft in an extremely tight space and landed the helicopter
on a rocky outcrop next to a river in between the steep mountains. All this
while the #2 helicopter gave airborne support to his #1. The casualty was
successfully evacuated and brought to Leh- another life saved by the helicopter
of IAF.

                            Eighteen children, including seven girls have been selected for the National Bravery Awards 2017. Three of the bravehearts are being awarded posthumously. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will award these future leaders of the society at a function in New Delhi on January 24, 2018. They would then participate in the Republic Day Parade 2018 at the Rajpath, where they would be one of the main attractions of the event. 

The coveted Bharat Award is being conferred on 18 year old Km. Nazia of Uttar Pradesh who raised her voice against the illegal gambling and betting, which have been rampant for decades in her neighbourhood. She courageously faced and endured threats to her life but did not give up her fight.

The prestigious Geeta Chopra Award is being conferred on 14 year old Late Km. Netravati M. Chavan of Karnataka who sacrificed her life in an attempt to save two boys from drowning.

The Sanjay Chopra Award is being given to 17½ year old Master Karanbeer Singh of Punjab who rescued several precious lives from death with his tireless efforts and indomitable courage.

Master Betshwajohn Peinlang (14 years) of Meghalaya, Km. Mamata Dalai (7 ½ years) of Odisha, and Master Sebastian Vincent (13½ years) of Kerala are being given the Bapu Gaidhani Awards. Betshwajohn with his fearless act of bravery saved his brother from being burned alive. Mamata Dalai dragged her friend from a crocodile's jaws with her valourous and bold action. Sebastian bravely and fearlessly saved his friend's life from an inevitable mishap on a railway track.

The other recipients are Km. Laxmi Yadav (Chhattisgarh), Km. Mansha N, Master N. Shangpon Konyak, Master Yoaknei, Master Chingai Wangsa (all from Nagaland), Km. Samridhi Sushil Sharma (Gujarat), Master Zonuntluanga, Late Master F. Lalchhandama (both from Mizoram), Master Pankaj Semwal (Uttarakhand), Master Nadaf Ejaj Abdul Rauf (Maharashtra), Late Km. Loukrakpam Rajeshwori Chanu (Manipur) and Master Pankaj Kumar Mahanta (Odisha).

The selection was made by a high-powered committee comprising representatives of various Ministries/Departments, Non-Governmental Organisations as well as office bearers of Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW).

President of India Shri Ram Nath Kovind and several other dignitaries will host receptions in their honour. Several States too are organising functions to honour them at the State level.

The National Bravery Award Scheme was initiated by the Indian Council for Child Welfare to give due recognition to the children who distinguish themselves by performing outstanding deeds of bravery and meritorious service and to inspire other children to emulate their example.

It was in 1957 that two children - a boy and a girl - were first rewarded for their presence of mind and courage. Since then ICCW decided to confer national awards on children every year.

In 1987-88 ICCW instituted the Bharat Award for an exceptionally outstanding, meritorious and gallant deed. The other special awards include the Geeta Chopra and Sanjay Chopra awards (instituted by ICCW in 1978) and the Bapu Gaidhani Awards (instituted in 1988-89).

The awardees receive a medal, certificate and cash. Eligible awardees will be granted financial assistance until they complete their schooling. Some State Governments also provide financial assistance to them. In addition, ICCW provides financial assistance under its Indira Gandhi Scholarship Scheme to those undertaking professional courses such as engineering and medicine. For the others, this assistance is provided till they complete their graduation. The Government of India has reserved some seats for the awardees in medical and engineering colleges and polytechnics.

Since the inception of the scheme in 1957, ICCW has given awards to 963 brave children - 680 boys and 283 girls.

            The historic affiliation ceremony commenced with an inspection of the Tri-Service Guard of Honour by the senior officers of the three services. The gathering was then addressed by the Rear Admiral RB Pandit, the Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet. In his welcome address, Admiral RB Pandit spoke of the importance of the affiliation and its relevance in the present day. The Admiral highlighted that the idea behind the affiliation was to foster espirit-de-corps and friendship between the three units that would lead to greater synergy and jointmanship between the three services and would also promote interaction between personnel of the three services and their families.

            The formal association between the three units commenced with the reading of the ‘Charter of Affiliation’. The aims of the affiliation and the association that the affiliated units were to maintain were listed in the ‘Charter of Affiliation’. Thereafter, the ‘Charter of Affiliation’ was signed by the Commanding Officers of the three units and by senior officers from respective services representing the unit. This was followed by an exchange of mementoes between the three units. The highlight of the event was an impressive flypast by aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm. The flypast was led by a formation of Chetak helicopters followed by formation of MiG-29K fighters of the INAS 303 squadron from the Goa based Naval Air Station, INS Hansa.

            The ‘raison d’etre’ of affiliation between units of fighting forces is to act as a force multiplier by promoting better understanding of each other’s strengths and ultimately serves to maximise the combat potential of the Indian Armed Forces at the time of reckoning. It also fosters a deep understanding of each other’s service ethos, customs, traditions and sharing of new operational concepts and the same is aptly described in the affiliation motto ‘Victory through Jointness’.

            The affiliation involved a host of activities over 17 and 18 Jan including a formal dinner, affiliation ceremony and organized visits for the visiting personnel. The event culminated with a grand Barakhana organised onboard INS Vikramaditya for all the participating personne

                 As a major boost to ‘Make in India’ in Defence, the Defence Acquisition Council, chaired by Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, in its meeting on 16 January 2018, has cleared a simplified ‘Make-II’ procedure which will enable greater participation of industry in acquisition of defence equipment. This process will greatly help import substitution and promote innovative solutions. This simplified ‘Make-II’ procedure will amend the existing ‘Make Procedure’ in Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP)-2016.

The revised procedure has been finalized after a series of consultations held with industry. The salient features of the new ‘Make-II’ procedure include the following:

 


	The industry can suggest projects, especially among those items which are currently being imported. Start-ups or individuals can also suggest proposals. Service Headquarters will also list out a series of projects which can be undertaken as ‘Make-II’ projects under the new procedure.


 


	The potential ‘Make-II’ projects will be approved by a collegiate comprising of DRDO, HQ (IDS), Department of Defence under a committee chaired by Secretary (Defence Production). Based on the in-principle approval agreed by this committee, the projects will be hosted on Ministry of Defence/Department of Defence Production’s website inviting industry to participate.


 


	There will be no limit to the number of industry who may respond to the EoI for development of the prototype subject to meeting the minimum qualification criteria. The design and development time of 12 to 30 weeks is granted to industry to offer the prototypes. 


 


	There is no limit to the number of industry players who may show interest and offer prototype.  


 


	After this period, a commercial RFP will be issued. Once the RFP is issued, it shall not be retracted. The industry who wins the bid, is assured of an order. 


 


	Service Headquarter (SHQ) will constitute a Project Facilitation Team for facilitating the process under this procedure.


 


	The case will be progressed even if there is single entity offering an innovative solution.


 


	The industry who develops the product will retain the title and ownership and all other rights in intellectual property. However, for some specified reasons like National Security, Government shall have ‘March-in’ rights.


 


	Normally, there shall be no negotiations by Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC) in multi-vendor contracts.


 


	‘Make-II’ procedure reduces the total time from in-principle approval to placing of order by 50 percent. The estimated time to finish the whole process has come down to 69 to 103 weeks.


 


	Projects involving developmental cost of less than three crores will be reserved for MSME.

                After her recent visit to INS Vikramaditya, the aircraft carrier of the Indian Navy, Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, on her visit to Air Force Station Jodhpur, took to the skies in the formidable Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft of 31 Squadron. In her 45 minutes of sortie, she was demonstrated some of the unique characteristics and strengths of this mighty twin engine Air Superiority Fighter (ASF).  She is the first woman Defence Minister of India to fly a sortie in an IAF Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft.

 

To gauge the operational capability and preparedness of the defence forces, the Raksha Mantri has been visiting various establishments of the Armed Forces. These visits go a long way in enhancing the motivation of the defence personnel as they get an opportunity to personally interact with the RM herself.

 

After her sortie on the multirole ASF, she addressed and interacted with the Air Warriors of Air Force Station, Jodhpur and congratulated them on their professionalism, high state of morale and motivation. During the visit, she was also briefed on employment of Air Power in the defence of our country.

 

Owing to its versatile capabilities, Su-30 MKI forms an integral and the most potent component of our nation’s Air Power.  Recently, ‘BrahMos’ Supersonic Air Launched Cruise Missile and ‘Astra’ Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile, was integrated and successfully fired from this platform. With these advancements, the reach with air-to-air refueling and standoff performance, Su-30 MKI is a truly potent platform and is bolstering IAF’s strategic capabilities.

                The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, met today and simplified ‘Make II’ procedure, which prescribes guidelines to be followed to develop and manufacture defence equipment through Indian Industry. The DAC also cleared procurement of 72,400 assault rifles and 93,895 carbines on fast track basis for Rs 3,547 crore to enable the Defence Forces to meet their immediate requirement for the troops deployed on the borders. 

To encourage participation of private sector in defence design and production and to give a boost to ‘Make in India’ programme, the Council today introduced significant changes in the ‘Make II’ category of the Defence Procurement Procedure. Considering that no government funding is involved in ‘Make II’ project, the DAC simplified the procedure to make it industry friendly, with minimal government control. The salient aspects of the revised procedure will now allow Ministry of Defence to accept suo-motu proposals from the industry and also allows start-ups to develop equipment for Indian Armed Forces. The minimum qualification criteria to participate in ‘Make II’ projects has also been relaxed by removing conditions related to credit rating and reducing financial net worth criteria. 

As per the earlier ‘Make II’ procedure, only two vendors were shortlisted to develop prototype equipment. Now, all vendors meeting the relaxed eligibility criteria will be allowed to participate in the prototype development process. The vendor will not be required to submit Detailed Project Report. After accord of approval of the ‘Make II’ project by the council, all clearances will be accorded at Service HQ (SHQ) level.              

To hand-hold industry and start-ups, SHQs will now setup project facilitation teams to act as the primary interface between the SHQ and the industry during the design and development stage. These teams would provide technical inputs, trial infrastructure and other facilities as required by the vendor. Even if a single individual or firm offers innovative solutions, the SHQ will now have the option to accept and process the vendor’s development initiative. SHQs will be allowed to hire domain experts/consultants from private sector to increase outreach and enhance awareness among the industry. 

            Most importantly, there will be no foreclosure of project after the project is sanctioned, except on default by the vendor, to ensure that the successful vendor has assured orders.

                A High Level Meeting between Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and Japan Coast Guard (JCG) was held at Coast Guard Headquarters, New Delhi on January 15, 2018 under the provisions of the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) signed between the two agencies in 2006. 

The Indian delegation was led by ICG Director General Shri Rajendra Singh while KCG was led by its Commandant Admiral Satoshi Nakajima in the meeting. It focused on augmenting the operational level interaction and capacity building in areas of search and rescue, pollution response and maritime law enforcement.

Relations between the two Coast Guards go back a long way with ICG ships calling on ports in Japan for professional interactions since 2000. This meeting and visit is in continuation of the efforts by the governments of the two countries to enhance cooperation between the two Coast Guards in the field of maritime safety and security at sea.

During the meeting, both sides agreed to strengthen the mutual cooperation in accordance with the provisions of the MoC. Sharing of best management practices and continuation of personnel exchange were agreed upon during the meeting.

Japan Coast Guard Ship Tsugaru has arrived at Chennai on 12 January for participating in the joint exercise that is scheduled on 17 January. Both the DG ICG and the Commander JCG will be travelling to Chennai to oversee the Joint exercise.

The meeting was significant in providing added impetus to the already existing professional relationship between the Coast Guards of India and Japan.

                On the occasion of the Army Day 2018, I extend my felicitations and best wishes to all Officers,  Junior Commissioned Officers, Non Commissioned Officers and Other ranks of the Army,  the Civilian employees,  our    Veer Naris,  Veterans and families.

On this occasion,  we remain committed as a force capable of meeting the challenges,  that may confront  us,  with each soldier dedicated to uphold the dignity of our Service.  I wish to also pay homage  to our brave martyrs,  whose courage and sacrifice, in the line of duty  shall continue to inspire us  to rededicate ourselves with renewed fervour.

As we introspect and reflect on the year gone by,  take stock of the security situation and plan for the challenges that lie ahead; 2017 has seen the Indian Army actively involved in operations  both on the borders and in the hinterland.  Our soldiers  have given a befitting response to the adversary along  the borders. Our conduct in Counter Terrorist operations has been  professional, whilst at the same time,  upholding the values associated with Human Rights.  The improved security situation in J&K and the  North East is result of continued selfless commitment of our rank and file  in difficult and challenging situations. Our response in providing succour to our countrymen has been prompt,  resulting in saving  valuable lives.  I can say with conviction that the Nation is proud of their Army  and have always encouraged us in accomplishing our objectives with honour and pride.

While operational effectiveness   to meet future challenges will remain our primary focus,  contribution to nation building initiatives remains an abiding theme.  Indian Army’s bilateral engagements with other armies of the world are increasing and so is military diplomacy gaining ground.  Our contribution to international peace in UN missions  continues to earn international appreciation.

The future challenges    continue to demand greater commitment from the Indian Army. While we focus towards infusion of technology for better capabilities in our weapon systems,    we should continue to upgrade the required training benchmarks  for optimal exploitation of these systems. Jointmanship and integration of available resources   would remain to be the fundamentals for success on the battlefield.

The Indian Army prides itself  in upholding core national values and ethos.  I am confident  that we shall live up to the trust reposed in us and continue to meet the aspirations of an emerging India.

As worthy soldiers of this Great Nation,  let us rededicate ourselves and strengthen our resolve  in the service of our nation. 

        JAI HIND

I can say it with conviction that it is only due to our formidable Armed Forces, each and every citizen of ‘INDIA’, today is brimming with unstinted faith and confidence to face the world with pride.” The RRM assured the veterans the whole country appreciate their sacrifices towards the Nation and said, “I can assure you all that your sacrifice in service to the motherland though is un-parallel and cannot be compensated at any cost, but we shall strive to put in our best to ensure that we stand with you at all times.”

The CBRN Training Manuals and Military Explosives Handling Guidelines were also released. Hiranyagarbha - the Terrabit Transport Cross Connect, a trusted network router & Army Air Defence Deployment Simulator System (A2D2S2) were also unveiled. 

Dr Shashi Bala Singh, Director General (Life Sciences) at DRDO in her welcome address highlighted the contributions of DRDO to the National CBRN Defence Preparedness and Capacity Building and said that more than 68 developed products related to CBRN by DRDO are already inducted and 25 more have been realised and ready for induction. She further said that this has been made possible due to a large participation of private sector with more than 50 industry partners.

The aim of the workshop is to further enhance the level of preparedness and strengthen the partnership among the stakeholders. Besides DRDO, the workshop has the participation from the three Services, Ordnance Factory Board, National Disaster Management Authority, National Disaster Response Force, Min of Home Affairs, Central Armed Police Forces, SPG, National Security Guard and several other government/security agencies, etc. The event provides an opportunity for the stakeholders to interact and understand the requirements of each other and respond in a way to bring coherence in the system that will eventually strengthen their partnerships and enhance the National preparedness level.

                Government had acquired private land measuring 2,412 acres 15 guntas 7 anas, located in 13 vilages of TalukasKarwar and Ankola, Uttar Kannada District in Karnataka for the purpose of creating a naval base. At the time of acquisition of land from 1988 to 2000, a sum of Rs. 22.55 crore was paid to the ex-land owners towards compensation. Over and above this, as per extant law, Rs. 126 crore towards rehabilitation packages to the project affected families was also released to the State Government.

Some land owners who were not satisfied with quantum of compensation awarded by Special Land Acquisition Officer (SLAO), had filed references u/s 18 of Land Acquisition (LA) Act 1894, following which the Reference Courts awarded enhanced compensation at the rate of Rs. 4.60 lakh per acre, which was confirmed by the Supreme Court on September 13, 2012.

Accordingly, in compliance of the court orders, Ministry of Defence (MoD)from 2004-05 to till date has already paid Rs. 377.12 crore as enhanced compensation in respect of 997 such cases, of which Rs. 163.03 crore was released during 2017-18 and Rs.214.09 crore was released earlier upto 2016-17. This amount has already been deposited with SLAO, Karwar for onward disbursal to land owners through the Execution Courts. 

Payment for 12 clear cases under Section 18 of LA Act, 1894 is   expected to be made by January 31, 2018 by the MoD with SLAO, Karwar.

As regards applications filed by ex-land owners u/s 28-A of LA Act, another Rs. 10.51 crore has been deposited by the Ministry with SLAO on January 10, 2018. Documentation in respect of remaining applications has also been fast tracked to enable early release of compensation amount. In these remaining cases, subject to the competent authorities giving clearance at the State level, the Ministry will be clearing these proposals by February 2018.

                An expert team of IAF mountaineers had successfully scaled highest peaks of six different continents earlier and had recently embarked upon its culminating expedition to Mt Vinson in Antarctica to complete Mission Seven Summits. A five member team led by Gp Capt RC Tripathi VM(G) was flagged off by Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa PVSM AVSM YSM VM ADC, Chief of Air Staff, on   08 Dec 17. 

The team, now has returned successfully after proudly flying the Tricolour and IAF flag on the highest peak of Antarctica on 25 Dec 2017 at 1845 hrs and thus created yet another glorious moment for the IAF. On 11 Jan 2018, in a ceremonial function, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa , CAS, flagged-in the team by receiving the Ice Axe and the Tricolour from the Team Leader Gp Capt RC Tripathi. The CAS felicitated and complimented the team for braving the challenge and fighting the elements encountered during the expeditions. He also congratulated the team for this historic accomplishment of flying the Tricolour on the highest mountains of all the continents. With this, Indian Air Force becomes the first organisation in India to have completed ‘Seven Summits’, indeed a rare feat to achieve.

 Indian Air Force has always been at the forefront in its pursuit to endure challenging ventures. ‘IAF Mission Seven Summits’ has been one of such unique trysts by IAF, undertaken with an aim to hoist the National Tricolour on the highest mountains of all seven continents. After creating history in 2005, by summiting Mt Everest, IAF launched an unprecedented series of mountaineering expeditions ‘Mission Seven Summits’ in 2008.

 IAF has been promoting adventure and sports for its personnel on regular basis and finds it immensely important to keep the Air Warriors fighting fit. Engaging in adventurous pursuits during peace, keeps the forces robust and enhances development of traits like leadership, camaraderie and effective decision making. IAF with such ventures lives truly to its motto ‘Touch the Sky with Glory’.

                25th Raising Day of Army Air Defence was celebrated on 10th January 2018.  On the occasion, Lt Gen Ashwani Kumar, Adjutant General & Senior Colonel Commandant AAD along with Lt Gen P S Jaggi and veterans laid the wreaths and paid homage to the braves in a solemn ceremony organised at the ‘Amar Jawan Jyoti’.  On this day, all ranks of Army Air Defence, rededicated themselves selflessly towards the service of the Nation and their motto, ‘AKASHE SHATRUN JAHI’.

          The Corps of Army Air Defence was raised on 10 Jan 1994 and since then has grown in stature and has proved its mettle in all major conflicts of the past. The Corps is now going through a transformative period of modernization with induction of new weapon systems and upgradation of existing weapon systems.  The raising of the Akash Regiments and planned induction of MRSAM have been game changers in Battle of Skies providing the ground forces with more freedom, maneuverability and security.  In the next few years, Army Air Defence Corps will transform into a technologically advanced combat force.

                Raksha Mantri (RM) Smt Nirmala Sitharaman presided over India's show of Naval might on 08 and 09 January 2018. More than ten warships from the Indian Navy including the aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya, three submarines and various naval aircraft participated in operational manoeuvres conducted off the western coast of India.

The RM initially embarked INS Kolkata, the first of the indigenously built Kolkata Class destroyers and then spent the night at sea on-board INS Vikramaditya. To assess the performance of the carrier in real conditions, the RM 'transited' through a simulated 'multi-threat' environment on-board along with her 'escorts' during the night of 08 January.

Reviewing the maritime prowess of the Indian Navy over the two days, Smt Sitharaman presided over a multiple complex naval operations including air interceptions, missile, gun and rocket firings, ship-to-ship replenishment, night flying and anti­submarine operations. The Western Fleet of the Indian Navy undertook these major naval manoeuvres off the western seaboard of India to showcase operational excellence and combat capabilities.

The RM commented on the battle readiness of the Indian Navy. ""Having witnessed first-hand the prowess of the Western Fleet, I am confident that the Indian Navy is fully capable of defending the nation against any form of threat”, she stated. 

Continuing  the  effort  to  collect  feedback  from  Armed  Forces  Personnel  at  all operational levels of the military, Smt Sitharaman interacted closely and had open discussions with the sailors on-board the warships.

Finally, the RM disembarked the ship by naval helicopter to INS Hansa, Goa, today.

                Vice President Shri Venkaiah Naidu formally inaugurated the National Cadet Corps (NCC) Republic Day Camp (RDC) 2018 here today. In his address, the Vice President complimented the efforts of National Cadet Corps, the largest uniformed youth organisation of the world in grooming the youth of the country and its contribution towards ‘Nation Building’.

Speaking about the RDC that highlights essence of universal brotherhood transcending through national and international boundaries, the Vice President said, “The very ambience of this camp fosters the feeling of camaraderie and patriotism. This Camp will be a memorable motivating and learning experience for each one of you.  It will give you an opportunity to interact with cadets not only from other parts of the country, but also from friendly foreign countries who will be arriving during the course of this camp. This will be a unique opportunity not only to understand your country better, but also to widen your horizon and foster lasting friendship with fellow cadets from other nations.”

He also mentioned that NCC is and would be in the vanguard of all activities helping to channelise our youth into a creative force to usher in social changes through a wide spectrum of activities. Shri Naidu said NCC is a shining example of National Integration and called the cadets the pillars of the Nation.  He expressed his happiness that cadets have been contributing immensely towards Swachhta Abhiyan with almost 10 Lakh cadets participating in various related events since its inception.

He also appreciated the impressive turnout of the ‘Guard of Honour’. He urged the NCC cadets to avail the best of NCC training and be more responsible and empowered citizens of the country. Earlier, the Vice President was received by the DG NCC Lt Gen BS Sahrawat on his arrival.

In all 2,070 cadets, including 695 girls drawn from 29 States and seven Union Territories (UT) of the country are participating in this camp that culminates into the Prime Minister’s Rally on January 28, 2018. The cadets attending the camp would be participating in a number of activities, like cultural programmes, national integration awareness and institutional training competitions.           

A contingent of smartly turned out NCC cadets drawn from all the three wings of the Army, Navy and Air Force, presented a ‘Guard of Honour’ to Shri Naidu on his arrival. He also visited the Flag Area where he was briefed by the young cadets about their respective States and regions on themes contributing towards national awareness and integration. He appreciated the efforts displayed in the Flag Area. A spectacular ‘cultural programme’ by the talented cadets was also organised in the NCC auditorium later.

                Ministry of Defence has approved the procurement of P-8I Training Solution and Low Intensity Conflict Electronic Warfare System (LICEWS), at a total cost of Rs 2419.32 crore. These contract proposals were approved by Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman.

The P-8I Training Solution, along with 10-year comprehensive maintenance service, will be brought from M/s Boeing for Rs 1949.32 crore. This training solution accurately simulates P-8I aircraft and mission systems. It will help Indian Navy train and realistically rehearse for sophisticated missions involving P-8I aircraft, at a fraction of the cost of live aircraft training.

The first P-8I aircraft was inducted in Indian Navy in 2013 and as of date, eight aircraft, based at INS Rajali, have been fully integrated into Indian Naval operations. In 2016, the MoD placed a follow-on order for four additional P-8I, the delivery of which will begin in 2020.

The P-8I aircraft is equipped for long range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in support of broad area, maritime and littoral operations. Its communication and sensor suite includes indigenous equipment developed by defence PSUs and private manufacturers. The aircraft is capable of thrusting a punitive response and maintaining a watch over India's immediate and extended areas of interest.

The second proposal cleared was for procurement of LICEWS from M/s Bharat Electronics Limited for Rs 470 crore. This system will equip Indian Army with upgraded communications infrastructure to effectively deal with advanced communications systems being used by terrorist groups.

                Recruitment in the Armed Forces is based on merit and is open to all citizens irrespective of class, caste, community, region or religion.  As such the record of data of recruitment in the Armed Forces on the basis of caste, community, region or religion is not maintained.

Various actions are taken to attract more applicants to join the Armed Forces.  These include sustained image projection, participation in career fairs and exhibitions and publicity campaign to create awareness among the youth on the advantages of taking up a challenging and satisfying career.  Further, Government has taken various steps to make Armed Forces’ jobs attractive including improvement in promotion prospects in the Armed Forces.

Further, to compensate for the unique aspects of defence service including the extreme conditions in which defence personnel are required to operate, Military Service Pay (MSP) has been provided for upto the level of Brigadier and equivalent. Consequently, while the pay on initial induction of a civilian employee at the lowest pay level (in Level-1) is Rs.18,000/-, the pay on initial induction of a defence force personnel, who gets inducted at their lowest pay level which is Level-3, inclusive of MSP will be Rs.26,900/-.  Similarly, while the pay for a civilian Officer inducted in Level-10 would be Rs.56,100/-, the pay for a defence service officer inducted in level-10, inclusive of MSP will be Rs.71,600/-.

Compensation by way of allowances is also paid for the unique Risk and Hardship borne by defence personnel.  Further, benefits in cash and kind are also admissible to Defence Service Personnel including (i) Free rations or Ration Money Allowance in lieu of free rations (ii) tax concessions available in Canteen Stores Depot (iii) Concession vouchers for travel in Railway and by Air.

                            Threats to the security of the country through the sea route are assessed at regular intervals.  Monitoring, review and assessment of the coastal security construct is an ongoing process and is undertaken on a periodic basis.  National Committee on Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security (NCSMCS) monitors the progress in respect of coastal security initiatives, any shortfall encountered, and decides on measures to plug the gaps.  A coastal security ring all along our coast is provided by Marine Police, Indian Coast Guard and Indian Navy.  Other measures include improving surveillance mechanism, enhanced patrolling and joint operational exercises conducted on regular basis among Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard, Marine Police, Customs and others.  Installation of radars covering the country’s entire coastline and islands is also an essential part of this process.

                The details of new achievements / initiatives of the Government in Defence Sector during the last three years are given below.

Reform Measures:  Based on the recommendations of the Shekatkar Committee, the Government has decided to restructure posts of different corps of Army. This will free up approximately 57,000 positions of Officers/JCO’s/OR’s and civilians which will be redeployed to improve the “teeth to tail” ratio of the Indian Army in future. Further, seven Military Farms have been closed and the cattle of these Farms have been transferred to other Military Farms. Further, the closure of six Military Farms is in progress.

Decentralisation in decision making:   To empower the Armed Forces as also to reduce the time taken in decision making a number of powers exercised hitherto by the Ministry of Defence have been delegated to the Armed Forces. These include powers relating to procurement of critical Ammunition/Spares; post-contract management of capital acquisition contracts as well as revenue expenditure; full powers in respect of revenue and capital account with respect to perimeter security etc.

Strategic Partnership:  Government’s policy on Strategic Partnership in the Defence Sector has been finalised. It is intended to institutionalise    a transparent, objective and functional mechanism to encourage broader participation of the private sector in manufacture of major defence platforms and equipment. 

Capital Acquisition for the Armed Forces:  During the last three years and current year, 119 contracts involving Rs. 1,16,522.89 crore have been signed with Indian vendors and 68 contracts involving Rs. 1,24,291.33 crore have been signed with foreign vendors for capital procurements of defence equipment. 

Policy initiatives in respect of Defence Production:  ‘Make in India’ in defence sector is primarily driven by providing preference to procurement from Indian vendors under the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), promoting indigenous design, development and manufacture of defence equipment, and other policy measures such as liberalization of the licensing regime & FDI policy by raising the cap on FDI in the defence sector, simplification of export procedure, streamlining of defence offset guidelines etc.

Major Achievements by Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs):


	Goa Shipyard Limited delivered Naval Offshore Patrol Vessels, Damage Control Simulator, Fuel Barge, Fast Patrol Vessel for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard.
	The Bharat Dynamics Limited developed Akash Weapon System for Army, Long Range Surface to Air Missile for the Indian Navy and test fired the Anti-Tank Guided Missile.
	The Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited launched the Visakhapatnam Class Destroyers and commissioned the INS Kalvari, the Scorpene class Submarine.
	During the period the Light Combat Helicopter attained initial operational clearance, first technical flight of Light Utility Helicopter was undertaken and Brahmos Integration with    SU-30MKI Aircraft was undertaken by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).
	Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) commissioned the secure CDMA Cellular Network at Srinagar.
	Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Limited delivered the Anti Submarines Warfare Corvette, Offshore Patrol Vessel, Water Jet Fast Attack Aircraft and Landing Craft Utility during the period.


Research & Development in Defence Sector: A number of major products has been developed for defence and civilian use by the DRDO. These include the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas; Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) System;  155 mm / 52 Calibre Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS); Weapon Locating Radar (WLR) Swati; High Speed Heavy Weight Ship Launched Torpedo (Varunastra); Arudhra-Medium Power Radar;  Akash Weapon System;  Abhay Sonar;  Hull Mounted Sonar (HUMSA); Advanced Indigenous Distress Sonar System (AIDSS); various types of Ammunition for MBT Arjun; Anti Torpedo Decoys; Electro-Optical Fire Control System for Naval Ships; Electro-Optical Sensors for Airborne Platforms; Mountain Foot Bridge; Sub-munition warheads for Pinaka; Terrain Assessment System for Trans-border Deserts etc.

One Rank One Pension (OROP):  The Government has implemented the One Rank One Pension (OROP) for Defence Forces Personnel.

Facilitating servicemen to register and vote from their place of posting: Government has already introduced e-Postal Ballot System in October 2016 to facilitate participation of service voters. The Election Commission of India (ECI) directed to undertake the process of de-novo registration of Service Voters.  As per ECI data, 13.37 lakh service voter requests from Armed Forces (Indian Army, Indian Air Force, Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard) have been registered with ECI. 

Army Battle Casualties Welfare Fund:  A Fund namely, ‘Army Battle Casualties Welfare Fund’ has been set up w.e.f. 1.1.2016. Under this fund, assistance of Rs. 2.00 Lakh is provided to the army battle casualties which are fatal, 60% and above disability and battle casualties invalided out due to disability and Rs. 1.00 Lakh to disability less than 60%. This will be in addition to other admissible dues.

Some of the new initiatives taken during the last three years, as mentioned above, are long gestating by their nature and will bear fruit in the medium / long term.

HAL produced fighter / trainer / transport aircraft, helicopter and associated systems & sub-systems do not fall under the category of weapons / arms / ammunition.

 

In order to fast track the production of  LCA from existing 8 aircraft to 16 aircraft per annum Government of India has approved an investment of Rs.1,381.04 Crores, against which HAL has already started the development activities.  Su-30 MKI programme is on the verge of completion; hence, there is no plan to augment the production facilities for this platform.

 

The following steps have been taken by HAL to ensure timely and enhanced production of LCA aircraft.

 

•          Establishment of second line for structural and equipping activities at Aircraft Division, HAL.

•          Reduction in manufacturing cycle time through improved supply chain management, learning and augmentation of manpower.

•          Established contracts for outsourcing of major modules namely Front fuselage, Centre fuselage, Rear fuselage, Wing and various sub-assemblies to private partners.

                The service life of a ship / submarine varies between 25 to 30 years depending on the class, type and size of platform.  Various factors govern the operation of ships / submarines beyond their life span such as force level requirements, utility of the platform, planned replacements of ships / submarines and their induction schedule, status of hull machinery, weapons, sensors as well as equipment and material upgrades and life extension under taken.  The submarines periodically undergo extensive overhaul, which significantly enhances their combat-worthiness.  Further, Major Refit with Life Certification (MRLC) of vintage conventional submarines are planned.  All units of Indian Navy follow a comprehensive Operational cum Refit cycle.  The Government of India had approved a 30 year Long Term Submarine Building Plan which entails indigenous construction of modern Conventional Submarines by 2030.

                            The capital procurement process for defence including issues relating to Request For Information (RFI), Request For Proposal (RFP) and Transfer of Technology (ToT) is governed by Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP). RFI process has been elaborated in detail as the first step of the acquisition process and its objectives have been clearly defined in the extant DPP-2016. Further in the procurement cases involving ToT, the Request for Proposal (RFP) includes the requirement for indigenous manufacturing.

               DPP-2016 contains the following provisions to cut down the procurement cycle and also to make it simpler and user friendly:-


	Broad timeframe for completing procurement activities has been reduced from 80-117 weeks to 70-94 weeks in multi-vendor cases and from 92-137 weeks to 82-114 weeks in resultant Single Vendor cases.


 


	Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) validity has been reduced to six months (from one year) for ‘Buy’ cases and to one year (from two years) for ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ cases.


 


	Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) has to accompany Statement of Case (SoC) for AoN.


 

• Guidelines for Change of Name of Vendor have been incorporated and Guidelines for Handling of Complaints have been notified to address avoidable delays on this account.

                In view of the recent stampede at Elphinstone Road Railway Station at Mumbai, there was an urgent need to address enhancement of infrastructure in terms of construction of additional Foot Over Bridges at selected railway stations in Mumbai.  Accordingly, under the provisions of ‘Instructions on Aid to the Civil Authorities by the Armed Forces, 1970’, Indian Army Engineers have been entrusted with construction of three foot-over-bridges at Elphinstone Road Railway Station, Curry Road Railway Station and Ambivili Railway Station.

The cost of the assistance provided by the Army is recoverable from the concerned Civil Authority, in terms of the provisions of ‘Instructions on Aid to the Civil Authorities by the Armed Forces, 1970’.

                A National Integration Tour for 27 students from Assam & Arunachal Pradesh accompanied by two teachers, today met and interacted with the COAS, Gen Bipin Rawat. The COAS brought out the importance of national integration and shared his experiences from the North Eastern region with the students and motivated them to work hard and contribute actively in the nation building process. He exhorted them to join the Indian Armed Forces and serve the cause of the Nation. 

The tour was flagged off from Joypur, Assam on 26 December 17 and during the course of the tour, participants have visited various cultural and historical places in Delhi, Agra and Jaipur. This initiative exposes them to various career options and allows them to interact with prominent personalities.

The National Integration Tours are organised as part of the Indian Army’s ongoing outreach programme to foster the spirit of Nation First.

                Majority of the ammunition for Indian Army is procured domestically, primarily from Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), Defence Public Sector Undertakings and other Public Sector Undertakings.  On an average, approximately two-third of the ammunition is sourced indigenously and the remaining through imports.  Presently, the Indian private industry supplies only raw materials and some components of the ammunition and have not yet manufactured finished ammunition products.  As of now, the Government has presently approved a proposal for manufacturing of eight types of ammunition for Indian Army by Indian Industry.

Majority of the ammunition is already being procured from the sources within the country.

                The Chinese Overseas Base at Djibouti was operationalized in August 2017 to provide Operational Turn Around (OTR) facilities for ships on anti-piracy operations.  At present, there is no information to suggest that China is exercising freedom of navigation operations in IOR.  China largely depends on the oil imports transiting through the Indian Ocean.  It would be in China’s interest that shipping lanes and traffic in the Indian Ocean remain secure.  The Indian Navy maintains regular presence and surveillance in the maritime areas of interest. Since August 2017, Indian Navy deployments in the IOR have been further structured under the Mission Based Deployment (MBD) concept.

                The status regarding time-bound promotion for non-commissioned officers of armed forces to the rank of Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) and its equivalent in Army, Navy and Air Force is indicated as under:-

Army: No Proposal for granting time bound promotion to non-commissioned officers to the rank of JCOs is presently under consideration.  The Junior Commissioned Officer (JCOs) / Other Ranks (ORs) of Indian Army are given three financial upgradation under the MACP scheme on completion of 8, 16 and 24 years of service as per recommendations of the VI and VII Central Pay Commission.  On receipt of such financial upgradation, the individual receives next higher pay level.  The MACP / ACP scheme is applicable since 1st September, 2008.

In addition to above, as per existing policy a sepoy who does not receive any promotion in his service and retires at 17/19 years of service is appointed as Lance Naik and given time scale rank of Naik prior to retirement.  Thus the interest of JCOs / ORs is taken care of.

Air Force:  Time bound promotions are provided upto the rank of sergeant.  Promotion to the rank of Junior Warrant Officer (JWO) and above are selection based.

Navy:  Time bound promotion is undertaken in first two ranks i.e. for promotion from Sea II to Seaman 1st Class and from Seaman 1st Class to Leading Seaman.  There is no proposal to implement time bound promotions for other non-commissioned officers in Indian Navy.

The scheme of MACP providing for financial upgradation on completion of 8,    16 & 24 years of service is also applicable for non-commissioned officers in Air Force and Indian Navy also.

                Government vide Press Note No.5 (2016 Series) dated 24.06.2016 has notified revised FDI policy in defence sector, according to which FDI upto 49% is allowed under automatic route and beyond 49% through Government route wherever it is likely to result in access to modern technology or for other reasons to be recorded.  Further defence industry is subjected to Industrial License under Industries (Development & Regulation) Act, 1951 and manufacturing of Small Arms and Ammunition under the Arms Act, 1959.

Since the revision of FDI policy in defence sector, beyond 49% under government route, so far, no foreign proposal on technology development has been received.

                Post 26/11, the Government has taken several initiatives to strengthen coastal security.  A Coastal security mechanism in the form of a three-tiered cover comprising Indian Navy (IN), Indian Coast Guard (ICG), and State Marine Police with demarcated areas of responsibility has been put in place.  The Indian Navy coordinates deployment of surface and air assets with the ICG for conduct of the patrols / surveillance.  State wise Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for coordination among several agencies on coastal security issues have also been instituted to handle various types of situations.  In addition to patrolling by surface and air assets, electronic surveillance of the maritime zones is undertaken using chain of coastal / offshore radars, National Automatic Identification System (NAIS) chain and Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) System.  In addition, other stakeholders also contribute to improving maritime surveillance and information to prevent possible infiltrations from the sea route.  Measures relating to coastal security are undertaken by the Centre as well as by coastal States.

                The Government has approved a proposal for manufacturing of ammunition for Indian Army by Indian Industry.  Request for Proposal (RFP) under Open Tender Enquiry for the said proposal has been issued on 25th & 27th March 2017.

Consequent to the uploading of the RFPs, a large number of queries and requests were received from the Industry regarding the various provisions of the RFPs.  A pre-bid meeting has also been held on 08.05.2017.  The feedback on the pre-bid meeting as well as queries raised by vendors have been examined in consultation with all stakeholders and a corrigendum to RFPs has been recently approved.

*However, connectivity has been achieved in 23 out of these 34 roads. 

There are delays in execution of some of the 61 ICBRs entrusted to BRO mainly due to the following reasons:-


	Delay in Forest/Wildlife clearance 
	Hard rock stretches. 
	Limited working season.
	Difficulties in availability of construction material.
	Delay in land acquisition.
	Damages due to natural disasters.


The Government has taken following measures to expedite the construction of border roads:-

 


	States of Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have constituted the Empowered Committee to resolve the issues pertaining to BRO.
	Outsourcing has been allowed to augment the capacity of BRO.
	Enhanced financial and administrative powers have been given to the executives of BRO.

                The geo-strategic importance of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has seen  a gradual increase in the recent past.  Indian Navy closely monitors the maritime areas of our interest and regularly deploys ships for Presence and Surveillance Missions (PSM), off critical choke points / sea lanes in the IOR.  Since August 2017, Indian Navy deployments in the IOR have been further structured under the Mission Based Deployment (MBD) concept.

                The combined amount of tuition fee and hostel charges for the children of martyrs or those disabled in action has been capped at Rs.10,000/- p.m. in accordance with the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission (7th CPC) as accepted by the Government.  The allowance shall go up by 25 percent each time DA rises by 50 percent.

Approximately 250 students have been reported to be affected during current financial year.  The figure is subject to change on yearly basis.

Keeping in view that both the number of students and the tuition / hostel fee are open-ended, no fixed / uniform amount of savings can be indicated.  Out of total reported 2679 students during the year 2017-18 (upto 27th December, 2017) 193 students have been reported to be drawing more than the capped amount of tuition / hostel fee and savings have been reported to be Rs.3.20 crore (Approximately).  The highest amount drawn has been reported to be Rs.18.95 lakh per annum per student.  If all the enrolled students start drawing more than the admissible amount, the saving will also increase, accordingly.

Representations have been received asking for removal of cap of Rs.10,000/-pm on combined amount of tuition fee and hostel charges.  The reply has been sent stating that the combined amount of tuition fee and hostel charges has been capped at Rs.10,000/-pm in accordance with the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission  (7th CPC) as accepted by the Government.

                National Cadet Corps (NCC) Republic Day Camp (RDC) 2018 commenced at the Cariappa Parade Ground, Delhi Cantt on January 1, 2018. Director General National Cadet Corps (DG NCC) Lt Gen B S Sahrawat addressed the cadets and officials on the occasion and called upon all to derive a deep sense of purpose from each activity in the camp which is unique with no parallel.

In all 2,070 cadets, including 695 girl cadets drawn from all 29 States and 07 Union Territories of the country, are taking part in this one month long camp. This also includes 102 cadets from Jammu and Kashmir and 162 cadets from North Eastern Region (NER). The cadets are selected through a tough selection process.

The camp will be visited by a large number of dignitaries including the Vice President, Prime Minister, Raksha Mantri, Raksha Rajya Mantri, Chief Minister of Delhi and the Chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force.

The aim of the RDC is to enhance the self confidence of cadets, deepen their value systems and provide an exposure to the rich culture and traditions of our nation and the important events that take place in the National Capital during the run up for Republic Day. Projection of cherished ideals and capabilities of the cadets of the NCC is intrinsic. The camp portrays the reflection of ‘Mini India’.

While speaking to the media, Lt Gen Sahrawat highlighted the major achievements of the NCC in youth and nation building, social awareness campaigns, community development, environment protection, sports and adventure.

The cadets also carry out cleanliness drives and safe sanitation awareness campaigns under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. In the field of sports, the NCC has feather in the cap by reaching the finals of the prestigious Subroto Cup football tournament in the Junior Girls’ Category in 2017. He also apprised that in 2017, NCC conducted two mountaineering expeditions to Mt Ladakhi and Mt Jogin-111.

He reiterated that NCC is dedicated to nation building by its untiring efforts and praised the efforts of all the cadets and staff for their dedication.

                 A delegation of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, led by its National President Shri Anil Khaitan and Senior National Vice President Shri Rajeev Talwar, called on Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and held a meeting to discuss the Northeast industry prospects.  

Dr Jitendra Singh updated the members of the delegation about the various steps taken in last three years to bring in ease of business and to exploit the unexplored potential of the region. He regretted that, in the past, nearly 40% of the fruit in the region went waste because of lack of storage and transportation facilities. However, he said, with improvement in connectivity and a network of road and railway being spread across all the North Eastern States, this constraint could be overcome to a great extent, he added.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh also referred to the introduction of  “Venture fund”  by the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) for young Start-Ups. This initiation, he said, has received enthusiastic response from new entrepreneur.

 

In order to further expose the world community to the vast business potential of North East India, Dr Jitendra Singh said, a mega Business Summit, possibly the first of its kind, is being held at Guwahati on 3rd of February.

 

The members of the delegation briefed Dr Jitendra Singh about a series of seminars organised by them on the subject of “Multiplying farmers' income : Opportunities in Animal Husbandry – potential for export----Focus North East”. Such seminars were held at Guwahati (Assam), Shillong (Meghalaya) and Agartala (Tripura). Among the recommendations put forward was the suggestion that farmers in the North Eastern region should follow the strategies of North and South Indian farmers who generate additional income through different activities on the farm like cattle and goat  rearing, fish farming etc. New scientific techniques could be adopted and Government could open a facilitation centre for prospective entrepreneurs.

 

The PHD Chambers leaders also informed the Minister about a series of events planned by them in near future which include a seminar on “Mega food Processing” at Imphal, a seminar on technologies for developing food processing at Aizawl, and a seminar on developing young entrepreneurs at Itanagar.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh assured all facilitatory support for these initiatives from the Ministry of DoNER. He said, the officials in the DoNER Ministry will coordinate with all the eight states of the region so as to seek maximum gainful outcomes from these initiatives .

                Manipur Central University, Imphal will host the prestigious 105th Indian Science Congress from March 18 to 22 this year. 

This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, after a meeting with the Governor of Manipur, Dr. Najma Heptulla here today to discuss the arrangements for the upcoming conference.

While assuring Dr. Heptulla that the Ministry of DoNER will work out the feasibility and the extent of possible support from the DoNER Ministry for organizing the conference, Dr. Jitendra Singh congratulated the Governor for the first-ever such meet being organized in Manipur.

Dr. Jitendra Singh also shared with the Governor the details of the proposed Sports University near Imphal, which will be the first-of-its-kind in the region. He said the land has already been acquired for the purpose and effort is being made to seek time from the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for laying the foundation stone which will carry a special significance because the announcement for such a University was made by the Prime Minister himself, considering the need to groom the huge talent for sports and athletics in the region.

In another significant development, Dr. Jitendra Singh informed the Governor that an exclusive ""Hill Area Development Programme"" has been approved to ensure equitable development of all the districts and the pilot project will be undertaken in Manipur. The work on setting up of a double broad-gauge rail track in the State is also being expedited, he added.

The Governor thanked Dr. Jitendra Singh for his constant cooperation and follow-up of different State related issues and said she would soon be sending some more proposals for his perusal in the Ministry of DoNER.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said the Government has given a big push to a diverse range of infrastructure projects in the region.

Briefing the media after releasing the Calendar for the year 2018 of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Dr Jitendra Singh said the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has laid emphasis on improving rail, road, air and inland waterways connectivity in the NER and with a host of power projects, the region is already on course to turning power surplus.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Aizawl, Mizoram on December 16, 2017 the Centre is committed to put all the state capitals of the northeast on the rail map and is executing 15 new projects of 1,385 km length, at a cost of over Rs 47,000 crore in the region. 

With the dedication of the 60-MW Tuirial hydropower project at the hands of the Prime Minister, Mizoram became the third power- surplus state in the north-east after Sikkim and Tripura. The Tuirial project, which was announced and cleared in 1998 by the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, is the first major central project to be successfully commissioned in Mizoram, the Prime Minister said.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has taken initiatives to strengthen regional air connectivity in the North Eastern States. A new terminal building is being constructed with an estimated expenditure of Rs 500 crore at Agartala Airport and the AAI would spend Rs 2,500 crore in North East States in next three years, AAI Chairman Shri Guruprasad Mohapatra said at Agartala on Dec.15, 2017. As many as 92 air routes connecting state capitals in the region are being planned as part of the Centre’s Udaan scheme.

Reflecting the improving regional connectivity and tourism potential, over 1.6 lakh foreign and 77 lakh domestic tourists visited Assam and the other Northeastern states during 2016, registering a 5.2 per cent increase over the previous year. Last year, the region registered a significant quantum jump of more than 15.8 per cent.

 

In a major boost to the Inland Waterway Transport System in the northeast, Union Shipping Minister Shri Nitin Gadkari on December 29, 2017 flagged off cargo movement on the Pandu-Dhubri route of the Brahmaputra river. Transportation of cargo on the National Waterway 2 -- from Pandu in Guwahati to Dhubri along the Assam-Bengal border would reduce logistics cost and save 300-km road travel. The 891-km stretch of the Brahmaputra river between Sadiya in the easternmost part of upper Assam and Dhubri was declared the National Waterway-2 in 1988.

Five bridges would be constructed on the river to ease transportation. The bridges would connect Jorhat with Nematighat, Disangmukh with Tekeliphuta, Louit with Khablu, Numaligarh with Gohpur and North Guwahati with Guwahati, the union minister said at the flagging-off ceremony in Majuli Island in Assam. Another roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) ferry service to transfer passengers and vehicles in large numbers will start here soon,  Shri Gadkari said.

Dr Jitendra Singh said the Northeast is all set to get India’s first-ever ""Air Dispensary"" based in a helicopter and the DoNER Ministry has already contributed Rs. 25 crore as part of the initial funding for this initiative. The proposal put forward by the Ministry of DoNER, he said, has been accepted and is in the final stages of process in the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation.

Dr Jitendra Singh said Arunachal Pradesh welcomed the New Year by keeping its promise of making the state Open Defecation Free. It has become the second state in North-East after Sikkim to achieve ODF status. Arunachal Pradesh has managed to do this before the deadline of October 2, 2019. The state government had cut short the national ODF target by one year and ten months ahead of the national target and set 31 December, 2017, as the final target to achieve ODF status in Arunachal Pradesh. The project undertaken under Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) saw the light of day only after the State Government extended an incentive of Rs 8,000 per toilet. This is in addition to the Centres support of Rs 12,000, raising the grant for constructing a toilet to Rs 20,000.

                The Swachh Bharat Mission is the largest behaviour change programme in the world. Through mobilization of rural communities, the SBM (Gramin) has truly turned into a jan andolan, a people’s movement. As per a progress update shared in the capital today, over 6 crore toilets have been built across rural India under the Mission. Two independent surveys by the Quality Council of India in 2017, and National Sample Survey Organization in 2016, have pegged the usage of these toilets at 91% and 95% respectively. As an outcome, over 3 lakh villages and 300 districts have been declared Open Defecation Free (ODF), across ten States and Union Territories, namely, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh and Daman & Diu.

The progress update was shared by the Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer today during a technical briefing given to the media in New Delhi. 

Terming this a “Sanitation Revolution in Rural India”, Shri Iyer said that 15 States/UTs are expected to be declared ODF by March 2018, and with this accelerating progress, the Mission is on track to achieve an ODF India by October 2019. He also shared some studies done by international agencies that estimate the health and economic impact of sanitation on a rural family. UNICEF estimates that the lack of sanitation is responsible for the deaths of over 100,000 children in India annually. A Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation study estimates that households in ODF villages in India have significantly better health indicators.

Another UNICEF study estimates that a household in an ODF village in India saves Rs.50,000 every year by way of disease treatment costs averted, saving of livelihood by not falling ill, etc. At the macro level, a 2007 World Bank study estimated that lack of sanitation costs India over 6% of our GDP. 

Shri Iyer announced that the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation will be launching a mass media campaign to promote the twin pit toilet soon. A twin pit toilet is a toilet model that is economical, safe, easy to clean, eco-friendly, and is effectively a self-contained waste treatment plant that does not harm the ground water beneath the toilet. 

Speaking on the issue of solid and liquid waste, he said that there was a paradigm shift underway in the way the Mission looks at this issue. He said that the Mission is moving from seeing it as a Solid Liquid Waste Management issue to seeing it as Solid and Liquid Resource Management, because waste is a resource that can be tapped and converted to wealth and energy.

Speaking on the issue of drinking water in rural India, he said that there have been a number of initiatives to reform the National Rural Drinking Water Programme. He enumerated several steps to improve the speed and quality of implementation of the Programme, especially targeting arsenic and fluoride-affected habitations. 

Shri Iyer also shared some stories of champions of Swachh Bharat from the field, including women, children, differently abled and senior citizens, who have contributed immensely to the sanitation mission through their dedication to cleanliness. These champions have gone beyond their call of duty to make Swachh Bharat a true jan andolan.

The participants focused on a variety of issues related to SBM(G), including progress so far, way forward, with a particular focus on IEC (Information Education Communication) efforts underway in the States.

With the SBM entering its pre-final year of implementation, the States shared their plans on achieving an Open Defecation Free status in 2018, with a strong focus on behaviour change communication, delivered through a mixture of targeted inter-personal communication and mass communication. The States shared their plans for sustaining their ODF status after achievement, by ensuring that the toilets constructed under the Mission are used by all members of every household in a village. The State IEC plans for 2018 were presented and discussed with the Ministry. 

The Ministry also held special sessions on resolving issues faced by the States on a case-to-case basis, with a special focus on the States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha. Young professionals, deployed as Zila Swachh Bharat Preraks in districts, also attended the workshop and interacted with Ministry officials to share the work being done by them at the grassroots and were assured of consistent support by the senior officers of the Ministry in their role as valuable resource persons for the districts and States. Entrepreneurs in the sanitation sector were also invited to make presentations to the States on innovative toilet technologies developed by them that can help scale up the design and production of toilets, and help design toilets that are easier for use by senior citizens and the differently- abled persons .

The Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation Shri Parameswaran Iyer in his inaugural address at the workshop, spoke about the long way that the Mission had come since its launch. He shared that 3 lakh villages, 300 districts and 10 States/Union Territories have been declared Open Defecation Free, and that the rural sanitation coverage today stands at over 76%, up from 39% at the time of the launch of the Mission in October 2014. He also expressed confidence that, with the sustained and focused implementation that the Mission was receiving by the State governments, the Prime Minister's vision of a Swachh Bharat by October 2, 2019 would be realized.

Secretary, Department of Financial Services, Shri Rajeev Kumar, and Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer held a joint video conference today with all public sector banks and public sector financial institutions to ramp up lending in the rural sanitation sector. The credit institutions committed to strive for trebling the lending to households, SHGs, MSMEs, SMEs, etc. in the rural sanitation sector. 

All public sector banks and financial institution branches also committed to provide access to clean toilets for customers across all branches in the country as their contribution to the Swachh Bharat Mission. Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and Department of Financial Services will jointly institute Swachh Bank / Financial Institution awards to recognize exemplary contribution in this initiative through a competitive process.

In another landmark development, the institutions also agreed to dedicate a large part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to the Swachh Bharat Mission in FY 2018-19. This is likely to infuse significant capital into sanitation initiatives across the country.

                To fulfil the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide thrust to good quality technical and higher education in the backward areas of the country, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has recruited more than 1200 highly qualified and motivated graduates from including IITs and NITs to teach in Engineering Colleges in States/UTs like Andaman & Nicobar, Assam, Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Tripura, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand etc. This is the first time that such a measure has been taken to improve the quality of education. 

While addressing a press conference Union Minister for Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar said that these bright minds will bring with them the openness to innovation, new methods of teaching and enthusiasm to serve and act as agents of change. He further said that this initiative will help meet the aspirations of youth in the backward areas and fulfil the vision of Prime Minister. He hoped that these teachers would contribute to the entire educational eco-system of the backward areas, apart from promoting a start-up culture among students.

A public appeal was given to the MTech and PhD students from the premier institutions to express interest to work in these backward areas and serve the nation. There was an overwhelming response to the call, and more than 5000 highly qualified persons applied. The interviews were conducted in 20 NITs by constituting expert teams. 

The entire process of giving a call and selection has been completed through a competitive and rigorous process of selection done through NITs in a record 2-month period. Finally, 1225 candidates were selected and they have joined 53 colleges in these states. The new faculty will train the youngsters in host of technical institutions for the next 3-years.

Each of the new faculty will be paid Rs. 70,000 per month and the Government is planning to spend about Rs. 375 Cr in 3-year period on this initiative. With this measure, more than 1 lakh engineering students in the most backward areas would be benefited with better quality education. 

The reason for backwardness was essentially because of lack of quality teachers in these areas. In many of these institutions have vacancies of teaching faculty (some of them have 40% vacancies), The States have requested Ministry of HRD to help to find teaching support.  

TEQIP project 

MHRD started the Technical Education Quality Improvement Project (TEQIP-III) for improving the quality of engineering graduates at a cost of Rs. 2,300 Cr to be implemented in 3-year period till 2020. The focus is on the most-backward states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, North-East, Rajasthan, MP etc. 

Under this project, all the Government engineering colleges are selected for direct intervention, and all private engineering colleges are selected for indirect intervention.

The measures include: 


	Institution based: accreditation of the courses through NBA, governance reforms, improving the processes, digital initiatives, securing autonomy for the colleges.
	Student based: improving the quality of teaching, teacher training, equipping the class rooms, revision of syllabus, industry interaction, compulsory internships for students, training the students in industry-relevant skills, preparing them for the GATE exam etc.


 

Profile of the teachers selected 

 


	86% of the teachers are from premier institutions like IITs/NITs/IISERs/IIITs 
	24% of them are PhDs (in most of these institutions, so far, there are NO PhD teachers) 
	Due to PAN India selection, the selected faculty are coming from 369 districts of 26 states, bringing an All India character to these backward colleges.
	(115) of these best faculty are going to (7) Aspiring Districts.

Speaking on the occasion Shri Prakash Javadekar informed that there is an increase in overall enrolment from 27.5 million in 2010-11 to 35.7 million in 2016-17 and improvement in Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) which is a ratio of enrolment in higher education to population in the eligible age group (18-23) years, from 19.4% in 2010-11 to 25.2 in 2016-17 which is a significant achievement. He expressed the hope that the GER ratio of 30% would be achieved by the year 2022. 

He further informed that Gender Parity Index (GPI), a ratio of proportional representation of female and male, has improved from 0.86 to 0.94 to the corresponding period. To give a further boost to girl-students, the Minister announced that a supernumerary quota in IITs will be increased.

Shri Javadekar informed that the number of institutions of higher education listed on AISHE portal has also increased significantly – from 621 universities in 2010-11 to 864 in 2016-17 and from 32,974 colleges in 2010-11 to 40,026 colleges in 2016-17. 

He said that the government’s vision for the higher education is based on three important aspects namely Quality, Autonomy, Research & Innovation. Stating that for successful planning and implementation of any policy we need correct information and real time survey, the Minister commended the officials involved in this task.

The Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, Dr. Satya Pal Singh and Shri R. Subrahmanyam, Special Secretary, Department of Higher Education were also present on the occasion.

The Survey was initiated in the year 2011 to prepare a robust data-base on higher education. Keeping in view the usefulness of data collected during the very first year, Ministry decided to make this survey an annual exercise of data collection in higher education sector. So far, survey has been completed for the years 2010-11 to 2016-17 and all the reports of AISHE are available on the website of the Ministry (www.hrd.gov.in) under the menu `Statistics’.

The survey covers almost all the Higher Education institutions (HEIs) in the country including Universities, Colleges and Stand-Alone institutions. Identified nodal officers from each institution are primarily responsible for collecting and uploading the data on AISHE portal in a secured environment. It needs a lot of efforts in a survey of this scale to bring out the correct and complete picture of the system so that relevant statistics are available to the Central Government as well as State Governments, in order to devise future policies.

The survey is also unique in the sense that it is a participatory effort between State Governments, Regulatory Statutory Authorities and the Ministries of the Government of India.  The Survey compiles and manages statistics directly online from respondent institutions. The main items of data collection under survey are Basic details, Programme details, Teaching & Non-Teaching Staff, Student Enrolment, Examination Result, Infrastructure, Scholarships and Foreign students etc. The AISHE data is the main source of information for `Know Your College’ portal. 

With the launching of the portal based survey, the time-lag in bringing out the reports has been reduced to bare minimum. All the institutions located in the country are requested to participate in the Survey and provide relevant data.

In the AISHE 2016-17, efforts have been made for the first time to collect the details of teachers to be used in the portal `Gurujan’ specifically dedicated to teacher information. The portal is in the process of development.

                Department of School Education & Literacy is implementing the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) at elementary level and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) at secondary level, whereby provision is made for inclusive education of children with special needs (CWSN), besides other components.

The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan is the main programme for universalising elementary education for all children between 6-14 years of age. Its overall goals include universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning levels of children. SSA focuses on providing inclusive education to CWSN, wherein children with and without disabilities participate and learn together in the same class. The major interventions for the education of CWSN are identification, functional and formal assessment, appropriate educational placement, preparation of Individualized Education Plan, provision of free aids and appliances, transport and/or escort support, teacher training, appointment of resource teachers, therapeutical support and barrier free access. 

Under SSA, during the year 2017-18, 3762 assessment camps have been conducted, 65596 CWSN provided assistive devices, 16731 visually impaired children provided Braille Books and 37741 low vision children have been provided large print books, till 30.09.2017. Further, transport and escort support has been provided to 92539 and 75889 CWSN respectively. Therapeutical support has been provided to 137507 CWSN and 222602 teachers have been given training on curricular adaptations. 

SSA provides approval @Rs. 3000/- per child per annum, of which at least Rs. 1000/- per child can be earmarked for engaging resource teachers exclusively for CWSN. SSA also has a provision of engagement of two resource persons per Block Resource Centre for CWSN. 18,934 such resource persons and resource teachers are currently engaged under SSA. These resource persons/teachers are technically qualified to teach CWSN. 

The National Council of Educational Research & Training has developed exemplar material on curricular adaptations, inclusive teaching and how to adopt flexibility in evaluation for children with disabilities in inclusive classrooms. These handbooks, meant for primary and upper primary level teachers, cover all disabilities, including cognitive and intellectual disabilities, and have been disseminated to all States and UTs. 

Under SSA, a series of five training modules has also been developed in collaboration with the World Bank. These modules aim to prepare teachers to work with children of all disabilities including children with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Deaf blindness and hearing impairment in mainstream inclusive environments.

At the secondary level, the Ministry is implementing the scheme of Inclusive Education for Disabled at Secondary Stage (IEDSS) as part of RMSA with an objective to provide all students with disabilities an opportunity to complete four years of secondary schooling (Class IX to XII) in an inclusive and enabling environment. Under IEDSS component, central assistance is provided for student oriented assistance @  3000/- per child per annum, besides support for engagement of special teachers, equipping resource room, making school barrier free, orientation of parents, administrators, educationists etc.

Pursuant to the Budget Announcements 2014-15 and 2015-16, six new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) have been established at Palakkad (Kerela), Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh), Jammu (J&K), Bhilai (Chhattisgarh), Dharwad (Karnataka) and Goa. The Academic Session of IITs at Palakkad and Tirupati started in 2015-16 and that of remaining four in 2016-17 from their temporary campuses. As on date, an amount of Rs. 563.00 crore has been released to these Institutes to meet their recurring and non-recurring expenditure.    

Considering the increasing demand of the country for highly skilled manpower as well as to remove regional imbalance in access to the Quality Technical Education, it is imperative that expansion of Technical Education is carried out gradually. IITs not only impart world class Science and Engineering Education but also provide an excellent ecosystem for Research in diverse disciplines. With vibrant Industry-Academia Collaborations, they develop cost effective technological solutions, which strengthen indigenous manufacturing and spur economic growth. Therefore, expansion on the Institutions has immense long-term benefits to the country.  

This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satyapal Singh today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.

                Union Minister for Earth Science, Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has urged scientists and researchers to strengthen fundamental science and move towards solution science.  Dedicating to the nation, the High Performance Computer (HPC) System named ‘Mihir’ (meaning ‘Sun’) at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) at Noida today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that with this facility, India’s capacity in weather forecasting will improve.  The Minister said that the HPC facility will be India’s largest HPC facility in terms of peak capacity and performance and will propel India’s ranking from the 368th position to around the top 30 in the Top 500 list of HPC facilities in the world.   He also pointed out that India will now also be ranked 4th, after Japan, UK and USA for dedicated HPC resources for weather/climate community.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan expressed confidence that soon India will be able to match the capacities of these four nations.  Stating that India’s scientific research capabilities can be compared to the best in the world, he pointed out that Government sponsored National Laboratories top the institutions contribute most in terms of number of research papers in the field of Earth Sciences.  

Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that the Ministry, in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is providing district-level agro meteorological advisories to farmers through 130 agromet field units. “Presently about 24 million farmers receive these advisories with information of weather forecasts on district level. These services will now be extended to block level (for about 6500 blocks) by establishing district centres (630 centres) with the help of ICAR KrishiVigyanKendras. It is planned to reach out to about 45 million farmers by July 2018”, he said. In this regard, the Minister also referred to the Union Cabinet’s approval to the National Monsoon Mission.  Recounting some of the other achievements of Ministry of Earth Science, Dr. Harsh Vardhan referred to a Rs. 500 crore project in Koyna for putting in place an earthquake warning system.  

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, MoES, Dr M. Rajeevan said that at present, forecasts are being made for the district level, but efforts are being made to take it down to the block level.  

The new HPC facility is expected to improve the following services: 


	Weather forecasts at block level over India which can predict extreme weather events. 
	High resolution seasonal/extended range forecasts of active/break spells of Monsoon. 
	Very high resolution coupled models for prediction of cyclones with more accuracy and lead time. 
	Ocean state forecasts including marine water quality forecasts at very high resolution.
	Tsunami forecasts with greater lead time. 
	Air quality forecasts for various cities 
	Climate projections at very high resolution.


This new HPC facility will not only help in meeting the operational requirements of the MoES but also support the research and development activities in MoES and other academic institutions working on various problems related to Earth Science. The Ministry of Earth Science has developed several services for societal benefits catering to a variety of sectors of economy by building state-of-the-art systems for multi-hazard risk reduction from cyclones, floods/droughts, heat/cold waves, earthquakes and tsunamis.  The Ministry has acquired the HPC facility of 6.8 Peta Flops (PF) and has been installed at two of its constituent units: 4.0 Peta Flops HPC facility at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune and 2.8 Peta Flops facility at NCMRWF, Noida. The HPC facility ‘Pratyush’ at IITM was dedicated to the nation on January 8, 2018.  This facility is part of Ministry’s continuous endeavor to provide world class forecast services to the citizens of India through its various operational and research and development activities.  

The Ministry holistically addresses all aspects related to the Earth System Science for providing weather, climate, ocean, coastal state, hydrological and seismological services. The services include forecasts and warnings for various natural disasters. In addition, the ministry also has the mandate to undertake ocean surveys for living and non-living resources and exploration of all the three poles (Arctic, Antarctic and Himalayas). The services provided by the Ministry are being effectively used by different agencies and state governments for saving human lives and minimizing damages due to natural disasters. 

 

REPORT ON BIBLIOMETRICS ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH IN EARTH SCIENCE RELEASED

 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also released the report titled “Bibliometrics analysis of research in the field of Earth System Science” on the occasion.    He emphasized that on an average, Indian researchers contribute about 5% of papers in Earth Sciences published worldwide and Indian researchers contribute about 7% of highly cited papers published in Earth Sciences worldwide.

After releasing the report, the Minister said that India’s scholarly output has shown a growth of 11.8% (Compound Annual Growth Rate) during 2006-2015, registering a sharp increase from 5.6% (1995 to 2005).  The Minister underlined that in terms of number of research papers during the recent decade (2006-2015), India stands 1st in Himalayan Research, 9th in Atmospheric Sciences, 9th in Geosciences, 15th in Ocean sciences, 16th in Antarctic Research and 25th in the field of Arctic Research.  The Minister also stated that institutes that top in various fields include - NGRI, Hyderabad in Geosciences, IITM Pune in Atmospheric Sciences, NIO Goa in Ocean Science, NCAOR Goa in Antarctic and Arctic Sciences and Wadia Institute Dehradun in Himalayan Science.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan also pointed out that some universities come very close to the top positions and cited Annamalai University in Ocean Sciences and IIT Kharagpur in Geosciences as examples.

Expert analysis of global research outputs is an essential prerequisite to understand global structure and dynamics of research and development and integrate it into policy documents. Latest tools and techniques of Bibliometrics and Scientometrics are routinely used for such analysis.  Understanding the importance of this activity, a project was taken up for the first time in the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) to carry out intensive analysis of research landscape of Earth System Science in India and the world, in two time periods: 1996-2005 and 2006-2015. Publication of the report titled “Bibliometrics analysis of research in the field of Earth System Science” is the outcome towards that end. The report will help us to understand research development scenario in Earth System Science, and the position of India in international landscape.

The Study was performed on the following six topics which are of relevance to the Ministry of Earth Sciences, in two time periods, 1996 to 2005 and 2006 to 2015.


	Antarctic Research 
	Arctic Research
	Himalayan Research
	Atmospheric Science & Technology
	Geo-science and Technology (Geo Research) and 
	Ocean Science and Technology (Ocean Research).  


 

Some other key findings:  


	Global research in Earth System Science published 340,905 papers between 1996 and 2005 and 571,616 papers between 2006 and 2015, a nearly 70% increase between the two decades.  Annual research output in all subject areas increased in the 20-year period.
	The proportion of internationally collaborative papers also increased from 27.6% to 36.7%. Between 1996-2005 and 2006-2015, the level of international collaboration increased in the most recent period in all six subject areas.
	On an average 20-30% of research papers published by Indian researchers come from international collaborations.
	Among the funding agencies in research, DST, MOES and CSIR contribute maximum number of research papers.  


 

Director, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Dr. K.J Ramesh, the Head of NCMRWF, Dr. E.N Rajgopal, Project Director, Dr. Praveen Kumar, Joint Secretary, MoES, Dr. Vipin Chandra were among those in the gathering.

                A total eclipse of the moon will occur on January 31, 2018.  This is the first eclipse of the year, with a rare coincidence of a blue moon and a super full moon. The full moon on that day happens to be the second full moon of the calendar month of January, termed as a blue moon.  Further, the moon will be at perigee on January 30, as such the full moon will occur when the moon is near the closest to earth in its orbit. Hence, this full moon will be a little bigger and brighter than the regular full moon, popularly referred to as a super moon.

During totality, the moon will completely enter the earth’s umbral shadow and may look reddish. The sunlight, comprising of seven colours, fall on the earth’s atmosphere. The blue, violet and green portion of it are scattered most and are filtered out, the red and orange portion of it are scattered less, get bent by refraction in the earth’s atmosphere, fall on the moon’s surface during totality making it reddish in colour to look from the earth.

The eclipse will begin as a partial eclipse from h. 17-18 IST and will continue up to h. 20-42 IST. The total eclipse will start from h. 18-21 IST and will end at h. 19-38 IST. The duration of the eclipse will be 3 h 24 mts and the duration of totality will be 1 hr 17 mts.  The ending of the total and partial phases of the eclipse will be visible from all places of India. However the entire eclipse, from beginning to end of the partial and total phases, will be visible only from north eastern part of the country including Kolkata. The beginning of the partial phase will not be visible from the rest part of the country, as the partial eclipse will start before the moonrise timings of the most of the places of India. Similarly, the beginning of the totality phases of the eclipse will not be visible from the places along the extreme western coast of the country including Mumbai.

            The eclipse will be visible in the region covering North America except the eastern part, western South America, Asia including India, Australia, the Middle East, northern Scandinavia, eastern Europe and eastern Africa.

            The next eclipse of the Moon will occur on July 27-28, 2018, which will be a total lunar eclipse and will be visible in India.

A table of phases of eclipse visible from different places of India is attached.

                Government has undertaken many research studies to analyze the impact of global warming and climate change on rainfall pattern in India. The analyses were made using observed rainfall data from more than 3000 rain-gauge stations spread over the country for 115 years (1901-2015). The major inferences from these studies based on the 115 years of rainfall data are as follows: 


	
	
		The analysis of 115 years of monsoon rainfall data suggests that there is no long term change or trend in the monsoon rainfall averaged over the country. 
		Even though, there are no changes in the all-India rainfall, there are significant changes in annual rainfall in some meteorological sub-divisions. Rainfall over Kerala, East Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura (NMMT) show decreasing trends. However, rainfall over coastal Karnataka, Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir show an increasing trend.
		There is a general tendency of increasing frequency of extreme rainfall (heavy rainfall events) over India, especially over the central parts of India during the southwest (June- September) monsoon season. 
		There is no evidence of global warming on the observed changes in annual or seasonal rainfall over India. However, there is growing evidence suggesting that increasing frequency of extreme rainfall is due to global warming. 
		The climate change assessment made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that in future, frequency of extreme rainfall may increase over India due to increase in global warming.
		However, there are NO other long term changes/trends in rainfall over India which can be attributed to global warming. The Indian Monsoon is found to be a stable system. 
	
	


India Meteorological Department (IMD) issues three types of forecasts during the monsoon season i.e., seasonal forecast (for the whole season), extended range forecast (10- 30 days), short-medium range forecast (0-10 days). These forecasts are issued based on dynamical and statistical models.

IMD has one of the best forecasting mechanisms for predicting tropical cyclones using high resolution advanced mathematical models and a suite of quality observations from Satellites and Radars. 

Under the 'National Monsoon Mission' (NMM) a state-of-the-art dynamical prediction model for a) improved prediction of monsoon rainfall on extended range to seasonal time scale (16 days to one season) and b) improved prediction of temperature, rainfall and extreme weather events on short to medium range time scale (up to 15 days) has been developed and is being used operationally by IMD. An improved suite of prediction models has been implemented operationally at India Meteorological Department (IMD) for enhanced short range weather forecasting capability through assimilation of all available conventional and satellite data.

IMD operates 24X7 monitoring of satellite and Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) based weather monitoring over the potential cyclogenic zones of the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea for monitoring and forecasting of tropical cyclones.

                  Under the National Monsoon Mission initiative, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad and National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), NOIDA have embarked upon to build a state-of-the-art coupled ocean atmospheric model for a) improved prediction of monsoon rainfall on extended range to seasonal time scale (16 days to one season) and b) improved prediction of temperature, rainfall and extreme weather events on short to medium range time scale (up to 15 days) so that forecast skill gets quantitatively improved further for operational services of India Meteorological Department (IMD). For the first time, India Meteorological Department used the Monsoon Mission dynamical model to prepare operational seasonal forecast of 2017 monsoon rainfall over India.

IMD in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) provides district level agro meteorological advisories to farmers through 130 agromet field units. Currently, about 22 million farmers are receiving crop specific agro-meteorological advisories in vernacular languages. These advisories are used for critical farm operations Viz. (i) Management of sowing (Delayed onset of rains); (ii) Changing crop variety (Delay in rainfall); (iii) Spraying Pesticides for disease control (occurrence of rainfall); (iv) Managing Irrigation (Heavy rainfall Forecast).

India Meteorological Department (IMD) provides meteorological support to the Central Water Commission (CWC) for issuing flood warnings. The allocation for the Monsoon Mission for the period 2012-17 was Rs. 400.00 crores and for the period 2017-20 is Rs 151 crores.

The estimate of epicenter parameters and magnitude of earthquake events shall be more precise with increase in number of seismological records by establishing more observatories. 

                     After installation of 32 new observatories, the strength of National seismological Network (NSN) shall be assessed and accordingly plan for setting of new observatories in gap area shall be planned. 

This information was given by Minister of State for Ministry of Science & Technology and Ministry of Earth Sciences Shri Y.S.Chowdary in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                Recognizing the need to strengthen the cybersecurity ecosystem in India, and in alignment with the Honourable Prime Minister’s vision for a ‘Digital India’, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), announced the Cyber Surakshit Bharat initiative in association with National e-Governance Division (NeGD) and industry partners at an inaugural event in Delhi today. Shri K J Alphons, Honourable Minister of State for Electronics & Information Technology and Tourism (Independent Charge), inaugurated the initiative in the presence of Shri Ajay Prakash Sawhney, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Shri Suresh Chandra, Secretary, Ministry of Law & Justice, Shri Sanjeev Gupta, President & CEO, Digital India Corporation, Shri Anant Maheshwari, President – Microsoft India, Ms. Debjani Ghosh, President Designate, NASSCOM, Shri Rakesh Maheshwari, Group Coordinator (Cyber Security), MeitY, Shri Jayesh Warrier, India Practice Head (CRS), Wipro and Shri Raghuvir HR, Sales Director, Dimension Data, India.

 

Conceptualized with the mission to spread awareness about cybercrime and building capacity for safety measures for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and frontline IT staff across all government departments, Cyber Surakshit Bharat will be operated on the three principles of Awareness, Education and Enablement. It will include an awareness program on the importance of cybersecurity; a series of workshops on best practices and enablement of the officials with cybersecurity health tool kits to manage and mitigate cyber threats.  Cyber Surakshit Bharat is the first public-private partnership of its kind and will leverage the expertise of the IT industry in cybersecurity. The founding partners of the consortium are leading IT companies Microsoft, Intel, WIPRO, Redhat and Dimension Data. Additionally, knowledge partners include Cert-In, NIC, NASSCOM and the FIDO Alliance and premier consultancy firms Deloitte and EY.

 

Speaking at the event Minister Shri K J Alphons, Honourable Minister of State for Electronics & Information Technology and Tourism (Independent Charge) said, “Securing the nation’s cyberspace is vital for achieving the Honourable Prime Minister’s vision of a Digital India. The fruits of development must reach the last man out there. The Digital India has led to a rapid transformation in the governance system. To ensure good governance, the private corporate sector must come forward.”

 

“Today, India is home to over 118 crore Aadhaar accounts, providing people with a unique identity. We have opened 30 crore bank accounts for the poor and underprivileged section of the society and linked those with Aadhaar. So far the Government has transferred subsidies worth 2.40 lakh crore to the Jan Dhan accounts linked with Aaddaar, thereby saving over 60,000 crore, which would earlier go to the middlemen. As we are moving towards that ecosystem, we also must ensure that our systems are protected and our data is secured. Keeping this concern in mind, the government has launched the Cyber Surakshit Bharat, with a primary objective to keep our data safe and protected. The best brains in both the government and corporate sector must come together to ensure a safe a secure cyberspace. I am happy that today we have CISOs in many institutions, we have them in as many as 60 ministries and departments of the government of India; 230 banks and 45 other financial institutions have CISOs to protect their data and systems. We must not forget that there is a bunch of smart individuals out there who are trying to steal our data, and to outsmart them we all have to work together towards building a robust cyber security system that keeps all these confidential information protected.” Added Shri. Alphons.

 

Shri Ajay Prakash Sawhney, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology said, “With a billion plus mobile phone linked with a billion plus Aadhaar connections and a billion plus bank accounts, we are definitely going to face billions and billions of threats, which are growing and becoming more and more sophisticated. The only way, we hope to counter these threats is at least to come together, of which this particular initiate ""Cyber Sukarkshit Bharat"" is a classic example of how industry association , with top entities in the industry and various players from Govt in both central & state are joining hands and coming together. I believe, we have done a fair amount of work in cyber security. Many of our organisations are active, they are not only organisation within the central govt, but number of partner organisations and all the major IIT's, IISC's many branches, many centers of C-Dec and many research teams in academic institutions and elsewhere are contributing tremendously. We are coming up with tools and made efforts to reach out law & enforcement agencies, great amount of capacity building is happening among the law enforcement agencies across the countries. We are happy that we are participating in it.

 

“The role of CISO is possibly a challenging role in any organisation. Now we have put CISO in place in ministries, organisations, various dept, financial sectors, in telecom and many key areas and trying to put in all efforts to equip them, give them the tools, organisational strength to perform their goals better. To begin with 5-6 companies have come forward for some big role. I believe that the consortium approach is a great way to move forward and I hope that more & more of large and very capable companies will join hands & help us in this endeavor."" Added Shri Sawhney.

 

In his opening remarks, Shri. Sanjeev Gupta, President & CEO, Digital India Corporation emphasized on the increasing importance of identifying roles of the CIOs and CISOs in both government and private institutions. He stressed on the need of an integrated effort of private and public to handle emerging cyber security threats.

 

MeitY had earlier issued a directive to all Central Government ministries to appoint a Chief Security Officer (CSO) to ensure Cyber safety, in addition to issuing an RFP to all empanelled auditors to conduct a cybersecurity audit for government departments.

 

The inaugural ceremony was followed by the first national workshop for Central and State government CISOs. Conducted by security experts of the consortium partners, the daylong orientation provided comprehensive guidance on topics ranging from the fundamental building blocks of a secure critical infrastructure to the role of a CISO in IT risk management to analyzing a department’s cyberhealth. The sessions also covered management of identity, devices and apps; OS (operating system) level security practices as well as attack methods and vulnerabilities.

 

Speaking of the initiative, Anant Maheshwari, President – Microsoft India, said, “Cyber Surakshit Bharat is a significant initiative. I congratulate the Government and our industry partners for coming together to launch it. Security and data privacy is the highest priority for Microsoft. We invest over a billion dollars every year globally in this area. Here in India, we launched our Cybersecurity Engagement Center in October 2016 to build local capabilities and are now proud to be part of this important initiative. As part of this initiative we will bring the best experts to help train and create capability to deal with the latest cybersecurity challenges.”

 

Cyber Surakshit Bharat aims to conduct a series of training programs in the next six months across Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai. The audience will include CISOs and technical officials from:

·         The central government

                The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEIT) on yesterday organized a day long workshop on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications for good governance. Held under the chairmanship of Hon’ Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Over 30 representatives from the industry and academia took part in the workshop. These include AI experts from the IITes at Kharagpur, Madras, Hyderabad and Patna. Industry representatives included Microsoft, Google, IBM, Accenture, NVIDIA. NASSCOM and IIIT Hyderabad also gave their views on the strategy to take advantage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technology. 

Union Minister of Electronics & Information Technology and Law & Justice, SH. Ravi Shankar Prasad has called upon industry and academia engaged in the development and use of AI to join hands in developing AI model which is capable of addressing complex problems in the field of health, education, agriculture and governance. Speaking at the workshop held here to exchange ideas on the use of AI for good governance, he said the government was keen to support such initiative as its development model is based on inclusive growth. He went on to add that AI had the potential to leapfrog India to its true potential of being a world leader in the digital space. 

Acknowledging, the work that has already been done in the field by the US and China, the Minister added that India’s model of uptake and scale-up of AI will be one that is indigenous to India and is built on the principle of augmenting intelligence and not the displacement of jobs. He underscored his government’s commitment to retraining and skilling people such that they are able to adapt, adopt and thrive in the dynamically changing society.  The Minister also emphasized the need for taking a multi-stakeholder approach to developing the ecosystem for AI in India, committing that the government to its end would help facilitate interactions between the industry, government and academia and will come up with a robust legal framework for the same. 

The industry and academia present in the workshop were unanimous in seeking support for getting clean data for evolving effective solutions through the application of AI. They also opined that the government should define policy priorities in the application of AI. This would facilitate them in pursuing a strategy that would benefit the country most. Data has to be available for innovation and India being a country with large number of languages and dialects need to translate data in a usable format. Country has all ingredients to be a hub center for data analysis. 

During the discussions that followed the presentations made by various stakeholders, there was unanimous agreement amongst the participants that India should focus its AI initiative to solving complex development challenges. The participants suggested that AI applications had a potential to help improve food and water security for the country, help improve traffic management and also help expedite particular types of cases in the judiciary. Responding to a query raised by one of the participants, the Minister said that data privacy is an important tenet of an individual’s rights, but also stressed on the point that innovation cannot be curbed under the garb of privacy. The Minister also mentioned that the country is well set to bring out a comprehensive policy on Data Protection and a committee under Justice (retd.) Sri Krishna will shortly finalize its recommendations.

                Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has denied the media report published in The Tribune titled “Rs 500, 10 minutes, and you have access to billion Aadhaar details” and has said that it is a case of misreporting. UIDAI assured that there has not been any Aadhaar data breach. The Aadhaar data including biometric information is fully safe and secure.

 

In a statement issued today UIDAI said that UIDAI has given the said search facility for the purpose of grievance redressal to the designated personnel and state government officials to help residents only by entering their Aadhaar number/EID. UIDAI maintains complete log and traceability of the facility and any misuse can be traced and appropriate action taken. The reported case appears to be instance of misuse of the grievance redressal search facility. As UIDAI maintains complete log and traceability of the facility, the legal action including lodging of FIR against the persons involved in the instant case is being done. 

 

UIDAI reiterates that the grievance redressal search facility gives only limited access to name and other details and has no access to biometric details. UIDAI reassures that there has not been any data breach of biometric database which remains fully safe and secure with highest encryption at UIDAI and mere display of demographic information cannot be misused without biometrics.

 

Further, the Aadhaar number is not a secret number. It is to be shared with authorized agencies whenever an Aadhaar holder wishes to avail certain service or benefit of government welfare scheme/s or other services. But that does not mean that the proper use of Aadhaar number poses a security or financial threat. Also, mere availability of Aadhaar number will not be a security threat or will not lead to financial/other fraud, as for a successful authentication fingerprint or iris of individual is also required. 

 

Claims of bypassing or duping the Aadhaar enrolment system are totally unfounded. Aadhaar data is fully safe and secure and has robust uncompromised security. The UIDAI Data Centres are infrastructure of critical importance and is protected accordingly with high technology conforming to the best standards of security and also by legal provisions.

                Union Environment Ministry has taken up a new strategy for conservation and rejuvenation of major river water systems. The new strategy takes into account the entire river basin, which is contributing its flow to the particular river stretch for conservation.  The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Science & Technology, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, in New Delhi today.

“The present strategy for conservation of rivers is limited only to tackling pollution load from domestic wastewater and regulation of industrial pollution,” Dr. Harsh Vardhan said. “The new approach is a holistic one for rejuvenation of rivers, wherein water management and environment management are taken together for implementation to restore the lost ecology of the polluted stretches of the rivers”, he added.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also took a decision to call a meeting of all five states at the earliest and work out an implementation plan for Ganga river basin at the earliest and also rope in the resources from CAMPA fund. 

The Central Pollution Control Board had identified 302 river stretches on 275 rivers in the country as polluted, based on Bio-Chemical Oxygen Demand, a critical parameter of water quality. 

The Minister said that a tentative action plan has been drawn up, “To begin with, we need to try it out on a few stretches in the country covering sub-basin or catchment area of river”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated.   He pointed out that independent institutions like IITs will be entrusted with the study for preparation and finalisation of river basin management and rejuvenation plan for nine selected stretches. 

Since sewage into the selected river stretches is the most significant polluter, projects to treat it will be taken up immediately.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan emphasized that under the conservation plans, sewage treatment will be made mandatory along the identified stretches. Since enforcement of provisions of the Water Act and Environment (Protection) Act comes under the local bodies in respective states, the Environment Ministry plans to set up a sewage management system with private participation.

Some of the other actions include watershed management, construction of small check-dams along the catchment area, scientific assessment of quantum of environmental flow in each stretch, rejuvenation of lakes and wetlands along the river basin and protection of floodplains from encroachment.

A detailed presentation on DPR on Forestry Interventions for Ganga was made by Director, Forest Research Institute.  Appreciating the efforts of the FRI, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that it is a comprehensive document covering all aspects of forestry interventions required, including past and present status of Ganga river and its environmental peculiarities.  The project report prepared by FRI for Catchment area Treatment of Ganga river covers five states – Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal has an estimated cost of Rs. 2500 crore approximately. The need of the hour is to prepare a project for the catchments of  all  important  rivers of the country and implement the same over a period of next 10 years. The ultimate mission is to make all the rivers clean and ensure adequate water in the river to flow.

The meeting was attended by Director General (Forest) and Special Secretary, Dr. Siddhant Das, Additional Secretary, MoEF&CC, Shri A.K Mehta and other senior officers of the Ministry.

                The Government has decided to install super-efficient air-conditioners in 2, 500 of its buildings for the first time in the country. Launching the replacement of conventional lights with LED lights in East Delhi yesterday, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that one lakh conventional air conditioners will be replaced by super-efficient ACs that will consume 30% less power and will be environment-friendly. He said that India will adhere to its commitment made in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.   Dr. Harsh Vardhan also said that all automobiles will be converted to electric vehicles, keeping in view the government’s commitment to shift to electric mobility by the year 2030. 

“Over 88 crore LED bulbs have been distributed across India, both by government and private agencies under the Mission Innovation scheme of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. The procurement cost of these bulbs was Rs. 310/- in 2014, whereas it is procured at Rs. 70/- now,” the Minister said. 

In East Delhi, the municipal agency will replace one lakh street lights and 2, 800 High Mast Lights with LED lights at “Zero cost”, thereby saving energy to the tune of 77.97% in comparison to the existing energy bills.

India has committed to install 175 GW of solar, wind and biomass electricity by 2022, reduce emission intensity by 33-35% from its 2005 levels by 2030, create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 though additional forest and tree cover and produce 40% electricity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030.

                Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has urged the scientists and senior officers of Ministries of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Science & Technology, Earth Sciences, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and Department of Biotechnology to identify 10 priority areas and ensure ground-level implementation that result in time-bound and measurable results.  The Minister said that such an approach will pool and converge latest scientific and technical knowhow, financial and human and infrastructural resources to maximize outcomes and outputs in sectors such as water management, air quality management, soil management, waste management, climate change, marine & coastal biodiversity, disruptive technologies, skill development & upgradation and international conventions/ agreements.

It was decided at a meeting in New Delhi, chaired by Dr Harsh Vardhan, to set up a Joint Working Group (JWG) for functional synergy of achieving time-bound goals in these areas. The JWG will be empowered to take decisions and nodal officers from all departments will meet every month, while the Minister will chair its quarterly meetings of such JWG. 

“The focus of the JWG has to be not only creating technology, but look at the entire delivery chain, where we are able to prove the technology and then scale it up”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said. “This requires convergence between one who has the technology and the other who needs the technology”, he added. 

  The Minister also suggested drawing up a plan for the 115 least developed districts that have been identified by NITI Aayog under the guidance of the Prime Minister and urged the 5 Ministries/Departments to ensure time-bound implementation.

                A one-day National Conference on Welfare of Laboratory Animals was organised by CPCSEA, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, with the theme of “Implementation of 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) while using animals in academic research and regulatory testing in India”, here today.  The conference deliberated upon elaborating the understanding of animal use in academics, as well as regulatory testing and evaluating the use of alternatives, wherever animals can be exempted from testing. The conference also included brainstorming sessions in the form of panel discussions, which had eminent scientists working with animals, versus those working in the field of alternatives. 

The conference laid emphasis on the issue of ethical use of animals in academics and regulatory testing in India. The discussions were focussed on evaluating the possibilities of exemption of animal experiments in academics and regulatory testing. Eminent speakers who disseminated valuable information regarding the ethical use of animals were Director, National Institute of Animal Biotechnology (NIAB), Dr. Subeer Majumdar, Professor, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Dr. K. Muralidhar, Professor and Head, Department of Pharmacology, AIIMS, Dr. Y.K Gupta and Director, Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Dr. Alok Dhawan,. The conference was also attended by representatives from animal welfare organisations like PFA, and PETA India, to encourage exchange of views between the stakeholders.

The Conference was attended by 200 participants from all over the country from various research establishments. The inaugural session of the Conference was chaired by Additional Secretary, MoEF&CC, Shri A.K Jain and Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), Dr. G. N. Singh.  

The CPCSEA is mandated to alleviate pain & suffering to the laboratory animals before, during or after the performance of experiments on them. CPCSEA is trying to find appropriate alternatives to the use of animals in experiments in India.

                “As per the information received, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) has taken initiatives in the field of landslide risk reduction and management through landslide susceptibility mapping in various scales in different parts of the country including North-Eastern Region (NER) and Sikkim.

GSI in its landslide studies included Pre-disaster studies (multi-scale landslide susceptibility/hazard/risk mapping & conducting landslide awareness programme); and Post-disaster studies (landslide inventory mapping and site specific detailed geological mapping, slope stability analysis and landslide monitoring).

Under Pre-disaster studies, GSI has already formulated and carried out a National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (NLSM) Programme on macro-scale (1:50,000 scale) in various parts of the country including NER and Sikkim. Aproximately, 44,600 sq. km area has been completed under the ongoing National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Project (NLSM) in all the states of NER, except Arunachal Pradesh. . The State Remote Sensing Application Centre (SRASC) of Arunachal Pradesh has carried out landslide susceptibility mapping for the entire Arunachal Pradesh.  The outcome of the study includes (i) generation of field maps, (ii) categorization of hill slope in terms of landslide susceptibility, (iii) preparation of landslide inventory database using high resolution remote sensing data, archival information and field inputs and (iv) preparation of spatial database for geo-factors of landslides.

Besides this, GSI has also carried out meso-scale (on 1:10,000 scale) landslide susceptibility mapping in the different regions for (i) preparation of meso-scale detailed landslide inventory database using very high resolution remote sensing data and field inputs (ii) application of appropriate deterministic techniques for slope stability assessment and (iii) preparation of meso-scale landslide susceptibility map in a GIS by integrating rated and weighted thematic geofactor maps. 

In addition, Analog maps of Landslide Susceptibility on meso-scale (1:10,000) has been prepared by GSI in Shillong town of Meghalaya; Serchip, Chiahtiang Townships and Lunglei area of Mizoram, Mangan Urban area, Singtam-Mangkha-Dikchu road corridor and Singhik-Manul-Paegum-Chungthang road sector of North Sikkim Highway in Sikkim.

On landslide remediation, GSI has carried out Site specific landslide study through detailed mapping (1:2000 scale) at Sonapur landslide in Meghalaya; Martam Landslide, Rongpo Landslide, 9 mile landslide complex, Malten Landslide, Old Carbonment area, Gangtok, B2 slide, Monitoring of 9 mile slide complex, Andheri Jhora Landslide on Ranipool Pakyong road, Bojek, Psochen Pheri, Lanta-Khola, Manvir colony, Namak, Theng and Mayang Chu landslide, Sub-Jail Complex area, Omchung Gyalshing, Kyangsla and 17 Mile landslide, Sangkhola landslide on NH-31A, 5th Mile Landslide on Gangtok-Nathula road in Sikkim. 

GSI has recently concluded Research and Development (R&D) on 1:50000 landslide hazard and risk mapping for regional planning with case studies on selected highly vulnerable areas of Higher Himalayas in various parts of NER. 

In order to capacity building, GSI has conducted landslide awareness programme in collaboration with State Government and National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA). Contact programmes are being conducted for raising awareness and developing resilience. Recently completed contact programmes are in Aizwal, Mizoram (on 22 July 2015); Guwahati, Assam      (on 15 July 2016); East Jaintia Hills district, Meghalaya (on 22 August 2017).             

Further, the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) invites participants from all the states/U'I' of the country in its in-campus training programmes including North-Eastern Region. In addition NIDM has been conducting training programmes in North Eastern Region.

As part of the mandate under the Disaster Management Act 2005, the NIDM has organized more than 20 Training Programmes on Disaster Risk Reduction including landslides since 2006 in different states of the Northeast India including Sikkim.”

                “United States of America (USA) is the second largest Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emitter presently. However, if cumulative historical emission is considered, USA would be largest GHG emitter. So, its withdrawal will affect control of cumulative global GHG emissions. It will also affect the availability of international funds for climate change, as USA was a contributor to climate finance.

There is no proposal to rework the modalities of Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement was adopted under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015. It has been ratified by 172 Parties and only USA has submitted a written communication to UN Secretary-General stating its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. All other countries have indicated their continued support for it through the decision, ‘Fiji Momentum for Implementation’ adopted during 23rd Conference of Parties (COP-23) held in November 2017, which underscored the importance of keeping the momentum and continuing to uphold thespirit and vision of the Paris Agreement.

A preliminary estimate suggests that at least US $2.5 trillion (at 2014-15 prices) will be required for meeting India's climate change actions between 2015 and 2030, which is expected to evolve over time. The estimate covers both the domestic resources and the international climate finance. The foreign aid India is expected to receive under the Paris Agreement is subject to quantum of available international climate finance in the post-2020 period, which is a matter under negotiations currently.”

                “According to the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the cryosphere, comprising snow, river and lake ice, sea ice, glaciers, ice shelves and ice sheets, and frozen ground, plays a major role in the Earth’s climate system through its impact on the surface energy budget, the water cycle, primary productivity, surface gas exchange and sea level and is a fundamental control on the physical, biological and social environment over a large part of the Earth’s surface. Cryosphere is a natural integrator of climate variability and provides one of the most visible signatures of climate change. Observations show that there has been a continued net loss of ice from the cryosphere, although there are significant differences in the rate of loss between cryospheric components and regions.

The Government has launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in June 2008 to achieve its goals and to deal with the issues related to climate change. NAPCC comprises eight missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, sustainable habitat, water, sustaining Himalayan ecosystems, Green India, sustainable agriculture and strategic knowledge for climate change.

The National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE) under NAPCC encompasses conservation measures for sustaining and safeguarding the Himalayan ecosystems through establishment of monitoring network, promotion of community based management, human resource development, and strengthening regional cooperation. Major initiatives include establishment of a Centre for Himalayan Glaciology at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun”.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Agreement between India and Myanmar on Land Border Crossing.

The Agreement will facilitate regulation and harmonization of already existing free movement rights for people ordinarily residing in the border areas of both countries. It will also facilitate movement of people on the basis of valid passports and visas which will enhance economic and social interaction between the two countries.

The Agreement is an enabling arrangement for movement of people across India-Myanmar border. It is expected to provide connectivity and enhance interaction of the people of North Eastern States of India with the people of Myanmar. 

The Agreement would give a boost to the economy of the North East and allow us to leverage our geographical connections with Myanmar to boost trade and people to people ties.

The Agreement will safeguard the traditional rights of the largely tribal communities residing along the border which are accustomed to free movement across the land border.

                The Government of India and the World Bank today signed a $100 million Loan Agreement that is expected to promote rural enterprises, facilitate their access to finance, and create employment opportunities for youth, particularly women, in selected blocks of Tamil Nadu across 26 districts, directly benefitting over 400,000 people. 

The Tamil Nadu Rural Transformation Project will create an enabling environment for producer organizations and enterprises to promote businesses across select value chains. Based on the analysis, communities will identify commodities and subsectors in the value chain for preparing business plans. Thirty percent of the financing for these business plans will be through a matching grant program from the project and the remaining 70 percent will be leveraged from other financial institutions.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance said that the Government of India is committed to help create an enabling environment of institutional reforms, policies and investments which are key factors that will help India attain speedy and inclusive rural transformation. He said that the Project will enable producer organizations and enterprises especially women entrepreneurs in Tamil Nadu, build businesses that will help them access finance, markets and networks and generate employment.

​The Agreement for the project was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; Mr. Praveen P. Nair, Project Director on behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu; and Mr. Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, World Bank India, on behalf of the World Bank. 

​It will also specifically support eligible households from socially and culturally disadvantaged groups harness their existing assets, skills, and resources; break their entry barriers to value-added economic activities; enhance their ability to access finance, markets, technology, and related support services; help them graduate to value-added economic activities with higher returns such as garment manufacturing and food processing units, eco-tourism ventures, and businesses around creative industries.

Mr. Junaid Ahmad, World Bank Country Director for India said that World Bank-financed State Livelihood Projects, which have so far reached over 35 million people, have given the rural poor a greater sense of identity, and better services and livelihood opportunities. He said that this Project will build on those achievements and support Tamil Nadu’s rural enterprises access finance, build business skills and create jobs.

The Project will be operational in 120 blocks across 3,994 villages in 26 Districts of Tamil Nadu with 411,620 direct beneficiaries. It will work with targeted households that are already part of Self-Help Groups (SHGs). The project will be rolled out in a phased manner – 26 blocks will be taken up for implementation in all project districts in the first eight months, followed by 52 blocks by the end of 12 months, and the remaining 42 blocks by the end of 18 months from initiation of project implementation.

​ Selected innovations and start-up ideas will also be tested or scaled up under a newly created platform known as the Tamil Nadu Rural Transformation Marketplace. This platform will identify, showcase and celebrate innovative solutions related to themes that have the potential to impact rural economic growth in the state. Innovative ideas related to promoting rural artisans, local nutritious food systems and traditional health practices will be considered. The project will draw lessons from several rural livelihoods programs in India and build on the successes of the recently closed Tamil Nadu Empowerment and Poverty Reduction Project.

​Mr. Hans Raj Verma, Additional Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu said that the Project will support building an ecosystem that will provide business development services to entrepreneurs in rural and semi-urban areas for promoting rural enterprises and creating employment opportunities. He said that it will specifically target at least 60 percent women entrepreneurs from the SHG network in Tamil Nadu who have the potential to move into the next level of economic integration. 

​ ​An e-governance architecture with the use of ICT along with a robust Management Information System (MIS) will help monitor and track results real time.

The $100 million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 5-year grace period, and a maturity of 19 years.

                The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of India today signed a $250 million loan to finance the construction of 6,254 kilometres all-weather rural roads in the States of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal under the Prime Minister’s Rural Roads Program (PMGSY).

The First Tranche Loan is part of the $500 million Second Rural Connectivity Investment Program for India approved by the ADB Board in December 2017. The program is aimed at improving rural connectivity, facilitating safer and more efficient access to livelihood and socio-economic opportunities for rural communities through improvements to about 12,000 kilometresRural Roads across the 5 States.

Mr. Sameer Kumar, Khare, Joint Secretary (Multilateral Institutions), Department of Economic Affairs in the Government’s Ministry of Financesigned the loan agreement on behalf of Government of India.Speaking on the occasion, Mr Khare said that the ADB-funded investment program will provide continued assistance to the PMGSY and support the Government’s long-term goal for rural development. He said that the programme is likely to have a transformative impact in terms of rural economy and would also bring in greater efficiency in terms of access and connectivity for the rural people in the five States. Under the project, about 2,000 technical personnel would be imparted training on road safety and maintenance.

 



 

Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director of ADB’s India Resident Mission who signed the agreement for ADB, said that the investment program will support the Government’s drive for innovative approaches to reduce costs, conserve non-renewable natural resources, and promote the use of waste materials in rural road construction.He said that road maintenance will be ensured through the provision of a 5-year post-construction maintenance in each civil works contract.

 

The investment program builds on the $800 million ADB-financed first Rural Connectivity Investment Program in 2012 that added about 9,000 kilometres of all-weather rural roads in the same States.

 

In view of increased rainfall and storm surges in the project States, the road designs will take into account these climate risks with measures such as greater elevation of road embankments, slope protection, and better drainage in flood-prone areas. Women were extensively consulted during the project design and will gain some key benefits, including improved access to healthcare, livelihoods, and schooling.

                A series of major reforms undertaken over the past year will allow real GDP growth to reach 6.75 percent this fiscal and will rise to 7.0 to 7.5 percent in 2018-19, thereby re-instating India as the world’s fastest growing major economy. This was stated in the Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled in Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley. It said that the reform measures undertaken in 2017-18 can be strengthened further in 2018-19.



 

The survey underlines that due to the launch of transformational Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform on July 1, 2017, resolution of the long-festering Twin Balance Sheet (TBS) problem by sending the major stressed companies for resolution under the new Indian Bankruptcy Code, implementing a major recapitalization package to strengthen the public sector banks, further liberalization of FDI and the export uplift from the global recovery, the economy began to accelerate in the second half of the year and can clock 6.75 percent growth this year. The survey points out that as per the quarterly estimates; there was a reversal of the declining trend of GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017-18, led by the industry sector. The Gross Value Added (GVA) at constant basic prices is expected to grow at the rate of 6.1 per cent in 2017-18 as compared to 6.6 per cent in 2016-17. Similarly, Agriculture, industry and services sectors are expected to grow at the rate of 2.1 per cent, 4.4 per cent, and 8.3 per cent respectively in 2017-18. The survey adds that after remaining in negative territory for a couple of years, growth of exports rebounded into positive one during 2016-17 and expected to grow faster in 2017-18. However, due to higher expected increase in imports, net exports of goods and services are slated to decline in 2017-18. Similarly, despite the robust economic growth, the savings and investment as a ratio of GDP generally declined. The major reduction in investment rate occurred in 2013-14, although it declined in 2015-16 too. Within this the share of household sector declined, while that of private corporate sector increased.

  

 

 

  

 

The survey points out that India can be rated as among the best performing economies in the world as the average growth during last three years is around 4 percentage points higher than global growth and nearly 3 percentage points higher than that of Emerging Market and Developing Economies. It points out that the GDP growth has averaged 7.3 per cent for the period from 2014-15 to 2017-18, which is the highest among the major economies of the world. That this growth has been achieved in a milieu of lower inflation, improved current account balance and notable reduction in the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio makes it all the more creditable.

Though concerns have been expressed about growing protectionist tendencies in some countries but it remains to be seen as to how the situation unfolds. Some of the factors could have dampening effect on GDP growth in the coming year viz. the possibility of an increase in crude oil prices in the international market. However, with world growth likely to witness moderate improvement in 2018, expectation of greater stability in GST, likely recovery in investment levels, and ongoing structural reforms, among others, should be supporting higher growth. On balance, country’s economic performance should witness an improvement in 2018-19.

 

 

  

 

The survey highlights that against the emerging macroeconomic concerns, policy vigilance will be necessary in the coming year, especially if high international oil prices persist or elevated stock prices correct sharply, provoking a “sudden stall” in capital flows. The agenda for the next year consequently remains full: stabilizing the GST, completing the TBS actions, privatizing Air India, and staving off threats to macro-economic stability. The TBS actions, noteworthy for cracking the long-standing “exit” problem, need complementary reforms to shrink unviable banks and allow greater private sector participation. The GST Council offers a model “technology” of cooperative federalism to apply to many other policy reforms. Over the medium term, three areas of policy focus stand out: Employment: finding good jobs for the young and burgeoning workforce, especially for women. Education: creating an educated and healthy labor force. Agriculture: raising farm productivity while strengthening agricultural resilience. Above all, India must continue improving the climate for rapid economic growth on the strength of the only two truly sustainable engines—private investment and exports.

                The Economic Survey presented by the Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley in Parliament today has relied upon analysis of the new data to highlight ten new economic facts:

 



 

1.      Goods and Services Tax (GST) has given a new perceptive of the Indian economy and new data has emerged.  There has been a fifty percent increase in the number of indirect taxpayers. There has also been a large increase in voluntary registrations, especially by small enterprises that buy from large enterprises wanting to avail themselves of input tax credits.

 

The Survey also stated that fears of major producing states that the shift to the new system would undermine their tax collections have been allayed as the distribution of the GST base among the states got closely linked to the size of their economies.



 

Similarly, there has been an addition of about 18 lakh in individual income tax filers since November 2016. 

 

2.      India’s formal sector, especially formal non-farm payroll, is substantially greater than what it currently is believed to be. It became evident that when “formality” was defined in terms of social security provisions like EPFO/ESIC the formal sector payroll was found to be about 31 percent of the non-agricultural work force. When “formality” was defined in terms of being part of the GST net, such formal sector payroll share was found to be 53 percent.

 



 

3.      For the first time in India’s history, data on the international exports of states has been  dwelt in the Economic Survey.  Such data indicates a strong correlation between export performance and states’ standard of living.  States that export internationally and trade with other states were found to be richer.  Such correlation is stronger between prosperity and international trade. 



 

4.      India’s exports are unusual in that the largest firms account for a much smaller share of exports than in other comparable countries. Top one percent of Indian firms account only for 38% of exports unlike in other countries where they account for substantially greater share – (72, 68, 67 and 55 percent in Brazil, Germany, Mexico and USA respectively).  Such tendencies were also found to be true for the top five or ten per cent of the Indian companies.

 



5.      It was pointed out that the Rebate of State Levies (ROSL) has increased exports of ready-made garments (man-made fibers) by about 16 per cent but not of others. 

 

6.      The data highlighted another seemingly known fact that Indian society exhibits a strong desire for a male child.  It pointed out that most parents continued to have children until they get number of sons.  The survey gave details of various scenarios leading to skewed sex ratios and also gave a comparison on sex ratio by birth between India and Indonesia.

 



 

7.      The survey pointed out that tax departments in India have gone in for contesting against in several tax disputes but also with a low success rate which is below 30 per cent. About 66 per cent of pending cases accounted for only 1.8 per cent of value at stake.   It further stated that 0.2 per cent of cases accounted for 56 per cent of the value at stake.

 

8.       Extrapolating the data the survey indicated that growth in savings did not bring economic growth but the growth in investment did. 

 

9.      The survey mentions that collections of direct taxes by Indian states and other local governments, where they have powers to collect them is significantly lower than their counterparts in other federal countries. A comparison has been given between ratios of direct tax to total revenues of local governments in India, Brazil and Germany.



 

10.  The survey captures the footprints of climate change on the Indian territory and consequent adverse impact on agricultural yields.  Extreme temperature increases and deficiency in rainfall have been captured on the Indian map and the graphical changes in agricultural yields are brought out from such data.  The impact was found to be twice as large in un-irrigated areas as in irrigated ones.

                A preliminary analysis of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) data reveals that there has been a 50% increase in the number of indirect taxpayers, besides a large increase in voluntary registrations, especially by small enterprises that buy from large enterprises and want to avail themselves of Input Tax Credits (ITC). The Economic Survey 2017-18 presented today in Parliament by the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley informs that as on December 2017, there were 9.8 million unique GST registrants slightly more than the total Indirect Tax registrants under the old system (where many taxpayers were registered under several taxes). Therefore, adjusting the base for double and triple counting, the GST has increased the number of unique indirect taxpayers by more than 50 percent –a substantial 3.4 million. The profile of new filers is interesting of their total turnover, business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions account for only 17 percent of the total. The bulk of transactions are business-to-business (B2B) and exports, which account for 30-34 percent apiece. There are about 1.7 million registrants who were below the threshold limit (and hence not obliged to register) who nevertheless chose to do so. Indeed, out of the total estimated 71 million non-agriculture enterprises, it is estimated that around 13 percent are registered under the GST. Maharashtra, UP, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat are the States with the greatest number of GST registrants. UP and West Bengal have been large increases in the number of tax registrants compared to the old tax regime. It also underlines that the distribution of the GST base among the States is closely linked to the size of their economies, allaying fears of major producing States that the shift to the new system would undermine their tax collections.

 



 

Dwelling on the subject of International Trade, Inter-State Trade and Economic Prosperity, the Survey points-out for the first time in India’s history  that five States-Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana account for 70% of India’s exports. New data on the international exports of States suggests a strong correlation between export performance and States’ standard of living. Last year Survey had estimated that India’s Inter-State trade in goods was between 30 and 50 percent of GDP. But the GST data suggests that India’s internal trade in goods and services (excludes non-GST goods and services) is actually even higher and is about 60 percent of GDP.

 

The survey based on new GST data also provides a close look at the firm-level exports and states that India’s exports are unusual in that the largest firms account for a much smaller share of exports than in other comparable countries. Export concentration by firms is much lower in India than in the US, Germany, Brazil, or Mexico. The top one percent of firms accounted for 72, 68, 67 and 55 percent of exports in Brazil, Germany, Mexico, and USA respectively but only 38 percent in the case of India. Similarly, the top 5 percent accounted for 91, 86, 91 and 74 percent in those countries, compared with 59 percent in India and the top 25 percent of firms accounted for 99, 98, 99 and 93 percent in those countries, as opposed to 82 percent in India.

 

Referring to India’s formal sector, especially formal non-farm payroll, the Survey says it is substantially greater than currently believed. Formality defined in terms of social security provision yields an estimate of formal sector payroll of about 31 percent of the non-agricultural work force; formality defined in terms of being part of the GST net suggests a formal sector payroll share of 53 percent.

 

The Chapter titled “ A New, Exciting Bird’s-Eye View of the Indian Economy Through the GST” sums up that most of the discussions in the run-up to the GST centered on the size of the tax base, and its implications for the Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR). The RNR Committee had estimated a base of Rs.68.8 lakhcrore and the GST Council had estimated a base of Rs.65.8 lakh crore. Current data suggest that the GST tax base (excluding exports) is Rs.65-70 lakh crore, broadly similar to these two previous estimates. Based on the average collections in the first few months, the implied weighted average collection rate (incidence) is about 15.6 percent. So, as estimated by the RNR committee, the single tax rate that would preserve revenue neutrality is between 15 to 16 percent.

                The Pink-color Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled in Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley lays special emphasis on Gender and Son meta-preference, while providing an assessment of India’s performance on gender outcomes relative to other economies.

The Survey takes into account that Gender equality is an inherently multi-dimensional issue. Accordingly, assessments have been made based on three specific dimensions of gender, ie Agency (relates to women’s ability to make decisions on reproduction, spending on themselves, spending on their households and their own mobility and health), Attitudes (relate to attitudes about violence against women/wives, and the ideal number of daughters preferred relative to the ideal number of sons) and Outcomes (relate to ‘son preference’ measured by sex ratio of last child, female employment, choice of contraception, education level, age at marriage, age at first birth and physical or sexual violence experienced by women) which aim to reflect the status, role and empowerment of women in the society.

The key findings of the assessment made in the Survey include: Over the last 10-15 years, India’s performance improved on 14 out of 17 indicators of women’s agency, attitudes, and outcomes. On seven of them, the improvement has been such that India’s situation is comparable to that of a cohort of countries after accounting for levels of development.



The Survey encouragingly notes that gender outcomes exhibit a convergence pattern, improving with wealth to a greater extent in India than in similar countries so that even where it is lagging, it can expect to catch up over time. The Survey, however, cautions that on several other indicators, notably employment, use of reversible contraception, and son preference, India has some distance to traverse because development has not proved to be an antidote.

Economic Survey 2017-18 states that within India, there is significant heterogeneity, with the North-Eastern states (a model for the rest of the country) consistently out-performing others and not because they are richer; hinterland states are lagging behind but the surprise is that some southern states do less well than their development levels would suggest.

The Economic Survey 2017-18 notes the challenge of gender is long-standing, probably going back millennia, so all stakeholders are collectively responsible for its resolution.

The Survey thus recommends that India must confront the societal preference, even meta-preference for a son, which appears inoculated to development. The skewed sex ratio in favor of males led to the identification of “missing” women. But there may be a meta-preference manifesting itself in fertility stopping rules contingent on the sex of the last child, which notionally creates “unwanted” girls, estimated at about 21 million, adds the Survey. Consigning these odious categories to history soon should be society’s objective, opines the Survey.

The survey acknowledges that government’s Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao and Sukanya Samridhi Yojanaschemes, and mandatory maternity leave rules are all steps in the right direction. The Survey states that just as India has committed to moving up the ranks in Ease of Doing Business indicators, a similar commitment should be endeavored on the gender front.

                The Economic Survey 2017-18 focuses on the need to address the issues of pendency, delays and backlogs in the appellate and judicial arenas towards Ease of Doing Business. These issues, it says hamper dispute resolution and contract enforcement, discourage investment, stall projects, hamper tax collection, stress tax payers and escalate legal costs. The Survey suggests coordinated action between government and the judiciary to boost economic activity in the country. The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley tabled the Economic Survey 2017-18 in Parliament today. 

The Economic Survey notes that India jumped 30 places to break into the top 100 for the first time in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report (EODB), 2018. The rankings reflect the government’s reform measures on a wide range of indicators. India leaped 53 and 33 spots in the taxation and insolvency indices, respectively, on the back of administrative reforms in taxation and passage of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. It also made strides on protecting minority investors and obtaining credit, and retained a high rank on getting electricity, after a 70 spot rise in EODB, 2017 due to the government’s electricity reforms. The Survey however says that India continues to lag on the indicator on enforcing contracts, marginally improving its position from 172 to 164 in the latest report. 

The Survey emphasizes the importance of an effective, efficient and expeditious contract enforcement regime for economic growth and development. It says that a clear and certain legislative and executive regime backed by an efficient judiciary that fairly and punctually protects property rights, preserves sanctity of contracts and enforces the rights and liabilities of parties, is a prerequisite for business and commerce. 

The Government has taken a number of actions to improve the contract enforcement regime. Some of the steps briefly are as follows:- 

• Scrapping of over 1,000 redundant legislations. 

• Amending the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 2015. 

• Passing the Commercial Courts Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015. 

• Expanding the Lok Adalat Programme . 

• The Judiciary has at the same time expanded the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) and is near to ensuring that every High Court is digitized. 

The Survey attempts to make a preliminary enquiry at highlighting the developments based on new data compiled for the survey, which it says are simple and stark:- • High number of delays and pendency of economic cases in the Supreme Court, Economic Tribunals and Tax department are taking severe toll on the economy, in terms of stalled projects, mounting legal costs, contested tax revenues and reduced investment. 

• Delays and pendency are caused due to the increase in overall workload of the judiciary, in turn due to expanding jurisdictions and use of injunctions and stays; in the case of tax litigation, this stems from government persisting with litigation despite high rates of failure at every stage of the appellate process; and • Actions by courts and government acting together can considerably improve the situation. 

The Economic Survey also suggests that the Government could consider including efforts and progress made in alleviating pendency in the lower judiciary as a performance-based incentive for States. Expenditure could be prioritized for filing, service and other delivery related issues that tend to cause maximum delays. However, the review cautions that building additional judicial capacity may not be effective unless existing capacity is fully utilized. 

The Survey goes on to note that the Government and the Courts need to both work together for large-scale reforms and incremental improvements to combat a problem that is taking a large toll on the economy. It suggests some steps, which in brief are as follows:- 

• Expanding judicial capacity in lower courts and reducing existing burden on High Courts and The Supreme Court. 

• Considering its low success rate the tax department could exercise greater self restraint by limiting appeals. 

• Substantially increasing state expenditure on the judiciary, particularly on modernization and digitization. 

• Building on the success of the Supreme Court, creating more subject-matter and stage-specific benches that allow the Court to build internal specialization and efficiencies in combating pendency and delay. 

• Courts could consider prioritizing stayed cases, and impose stricter timelines within which cases with temporary injunctions may be decided, especially when involving government infrastructure projects. 

• Improving Courts Case Management and Court Automation Systems. 

The Survey concludes by noting that recent experience with GST has shown how vertical cooperation between the Centre and States – Cooperative Federalism – has brought transformational economic policy changes. It says that perhaps there is scope for a horizontal variant – which it coins as Cooperative Separation of Powers that could be applied to the relationship between the judiciary on one hand, and the executive/legislature on the other.

                    The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley tabled the Economic Survey 2017-18 in Parliament today.

            Based on the firm footing provided by the discernible improvements in most fiscal indicators such as revenue buoyancy, expenditure quality, tax devolution and deficits, the Government, in partnership with the States, ushered in the long-awaited GST era with effect from July,2017. The GST was unveiled after comprehensive preparations, calculations and multi-stage consultations, yet the sheer magnitude of change meant that it needed to be carefully managed. The Government is navigating the change and challenges, including the possibility that a substantial portion of the last-month GST collections may spill over to the next year, the Survey says.

            The data on Central Government finances available till November 2017 from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) suggests that during the first eight months of the current year 2017-18 the Gross Tax Collections are reasonably on track; and the robust progress in disinvestment compensates to a great extent for the sluggish pace in non-tax revenue. The growth in direct tax collections of the Centre has kept pace with the previous year and is expected to meet targets, with a growth of 13.7 per cent while indirect taxes grew by 18.3 per cent during April-November 2017.

            The eventual outcome in indirect taxes during this year will depend on the final settlement of GST accounts between the Centre and the States and the likelihood that only taxes for eleven months (excluding IGST on imports) will be realized. The States’ share in taxes grew by 25.2 per cent during April-November 2017, much higher than the growth in net tax revenue (to Centre) at 12.6 per cent and of gross tax revenue at 16.5 per cent.

            As an information repository, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) provides a radical change and a new insight into the understanding of the Indian economy. Preliminary analysis of this information yields the following feast of findings. There has been a fifty percent increase in the number of indirect taxpayers; and a large increase in voluntary registrations, especially by small enterprises that buy from large enterprises and want to avail themselves the input tax credits. The distribution of the GST base among the states is closely linked to the size of their economies, allaying fears of major producing states that the shift to the new system would undermine their tax collections. Data on the international exports of states (the first in India’s history) suggests a strong correlation between export performance and states’ standard of living. India’s exports are unusual in that the largest firms account for a much smaller share of exports than in other comparable countries. India’s internal trade is about 60 percent of GDP, even greater than estimated in last year’s Survey and comparing very favorably with other large countries. India’s formal sector, especially formal non-farm payroll, is substantially greater than currently believed. Formality defined in terms of social security provision yields an estimate of formal sector payroll of about 31 percent of the non-agricultural work force; formality defined in terms of being part of the GST net suggests a formal sector payroll share of 53 percent.

            The advancing of the budget cycle and processes by almost a month gave considerable leeway to the spending agencies to plan in advance and start implementation early in the financial year, leading to a robust pace of progress of Central expenditure.

            Sound Public financial management has been one of the pillars of India's macro  economic stability in the last three years. In accordance with this, the Fiscal Deficit, Revenue Deficit as well as the Primary Deficit has been declining for  the past 3 years.

                              

FISCAL INDICATORS AS PERCENTAGE OF GDP

            The early pick-up in expenditure coupled with front-loading of some expenditure and increased interest outgo exerted pressure on fiscal deficit which expanded to 112 per cent of budget estimates by November 2017. A good part of this growth is likely to normalize as the year progresses.

            If indications and patterns till November are to hold, then the States taken together may be able to meet  their targeted level of fiscal deficit in 2017-18.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley tabled the Economic Survey 2017-18 in Parliament today. The survey reviews the Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation. Here are the highlights:- 

• Monetary policy remained steady with only one policy rate cut in August, during 2017-18 (till January). Monetary policy during 2017-18 was conducted under the revised statutory framework, which became effective from August 5, 2016. 

• In the third bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement for 2017-18 in August 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to reduce the policy Repo Rate by 25 basis points to 6.0 per cent. It kept the rates unchanged in both October and the latest meeting held in December. 

• In tandem with the re-monetisation process, from November 17, 2017, as a favourable base effect set in, the Y-o-Y growth of both Currency in Circulation and M0 turned sharply positive and higher than their respective growth rates in the previous year. 

• After demonetisation in early November 2016, the Reserve Bank had scaled up its liquidity absorption operations using a mix of both conventional and unconventional instruments. 

• Liquidity conditions remain in surplus mode even as its magnitude moderated gradually with progressive remonetisation. Weighted Average Call Rate in recent months has drifted to the middle of the policy corridor. 

• The performance of the banking sector, Public Sector Banks in particular, continued to be subdued in the current financial year. The Gross Non-Performing Advances (GNPA) ratio of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) increased from 9.6 per cent to 10.2 percent between March 2017 and September 2017. 

• Non Food Credit (NFC) grew at 8.85 per cent Y-o-Y in November 2017 as compared to 4.75 per cent in November 2016. Bank credit lending to Services and Personal Loans (PL) segments continue to be the major contributor to overall NFC growth. 

• The NBFC sector, as a whole, accounted for 17 per cent of bank assets and 0.26 per cent of bank deposits as on September 30, 2017. The consolidated balance sheet size of the NBFC sector increased by 5 per cent (September 2017 over March 2017) to Rs.20.7 lakh crores, as against an increase of 14.2 per cent between March 2016 and March 2017. 

• The year 2017-18 (April-November) witnessed a steady increase in resource mobilisation in the primary market segment as compared to the corresponding period in the last financial year. 

• The 10 year G-sec yield, meanwhile, has hardened since September 2017. The G-sec yield as on January 11, 2018 stands at 7.26 per cent. 

• An ecosystem for the new insolvency and bankruptcy process took shape in 2017-18. The IBC mechanism is being used actively to resolve the NPA problem of the banking sector. A major factor behind the effectiveness of the new Code has been the adjudication by the Judiciary. The Code prescribes strict time limits for various procedures under it. In this process, a rich case-law has evolved, reducing future legal uncertainty. 

• The stock markets also hit record highs this financial year.

                Promoting inclusive employment-intensive industry, and building resilient infrastructure are vital factors for economic and development. The Government is taking several sector- specific measures in this direction. This was stated in the Economic Survey 2017-18 presented by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley in Parliament today.  Apart from structural reforms like Goods and Services Tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and measures to facilitate Ease of Doing Business, the Survey highlights that the Government has initiated sector specific reforms in Steel, Apparel, Leather and Power sectors to address specific challenges associated with each of these sectors. Various reforms undertaken by the Government over the last 3 years, have been recognized by international rating agencies such as Moody’s Investor Service and up-gradation in the ranking of Ease of Doing Business of the World Bank Report 2018, the Survey further adds. 

 

The Economic Survey 2017-18 further says that the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) which is a volume index with base year 2011-12, shows that the industrial output increased by 3.2 percent during April-November 2017-18. This was a composite effect of robust growth in electricity generation at 5.2 percent and moderate growth in both mining and manufacturing sectors at 3.0 percent and 3.1 percent respectively. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) registered a 25-month high growth of 8.4 per cent with manufacturing growing at 10.2 per cent

 

According to the Economic Survey 2017-18, the Eight Core Infrastructure Supportive Industries, viz. Coal, Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Petroleum, Refinery Products, Fertilizers, Steel, Cement and Electricity attained a cumulative growth of 3.9 percent during April-November, 2017-18. The production growth of Coal, Natural Gas, Refinery Products, Steel, Cement and Electricity was positive during this period. The steel production increased substantially, while the production of crude oil and fertilizers fell marginally during the period, the Economic Survey adds.

 

The Survey notes that nominal outstanding credit growth to industry turned positive to 1 per cent in November 2017 for the first time after witnessing negative growth since October 2016. Demand for funds by Indian firms, in the wake of the credit slowdown, has been somewhat met by alternative sources such as corporate bonds and commercial paper.

 

The pre-Budget Economic Survey state that the total Foreign Direct Investment inflow grew by 8 per cent i.e. USD 60.08 billion in 2016-17 in comparison to USD 55.56 billion of the previous year. In 2017-18 (April – September), the inflow of total FDI was to the quantum of USD 33.75 billion.

 

On the Ease of doing Business, the Economic Survey highlights that India has leapt 30 ranks over its previous rank of 130 in the World Bank’s latest Doing Business Report 2018. Credit rating company Moody’s Investors Service has also raised India’s rating from the lowest investment grade of Baa3 to Baa2.This has been made possible due to a host of measures undertaken by the Government including implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and announcement of bank recapitalization. A number of reforms to boost industrial growth include Make in India programme, Start-up India and Intellectual Rights Policy. 

The Economic Survey listed out Sectoral Initiatives:-  

Ø  Steel: In order to address dumping of cheap steel imports from China, South Korea and Ukraine, the Government raised customs duty and imposed anti-dumping duty, Minimum Import Price (MIP) on a number of items in February 2016, with a sunset clause of one year. These measures helped the domestic producers and exports recovered. The Government notified anti-dumping duties and Countervailing Duties on various steel products in February 2017. The Government has rolled out a New Steel Policy in May 2017.

Ø  MSME Sector: MSMEs in India play a crucial role in providing large scale employment opportunities at comparatively lower capital cost than large industries and also in industrialization of rural & backward areas. The Government has initiated a number of schemes for the sector and particularly the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana for development and refinancing activities relating to micro industrial units in 2016-17.

Ø  Textiles and Apparels: To address some of the constraints faced by apparel firms, the Cabinet announced a Rs.6000 crore package for the apparel sector on June 2016. It was found that since its implementation in June 2016, the package had a positive impact on the exports of Ready Made Garments (RMG) of Man-made fibres while it did not have a statistically significant impact on the RMG of other natural fibres, except wool. The impact of the package increased over time and did not show any signs of attenuation. The Government has in December 2017 approved the scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SCBTS) with an outlay of ₹1,300crore for the period 2017-2018 to 2019-2020.

Ø  Leather sector: Leather sector is also highly labour intensive sector. The sector faces challenges which have been addressed through a scheme for the purpose of promotion of employment in the leather & footwear sector in December 2017, with an outlay of Rs 2600 crore over three financial years 2017-18 to 2019-2020.

Ø  Gems and Jewellery:India is one of the largest exporters of gems and jewellery. Exports of the sector have risen from 0.7 per cent in 2014-15 to 12.8 per cent in 2016-17. Training in jewellerydesigning, setting up refineries, hallmarking centres etc. and creation of multiple jewellery parks would help the sector.

 

The Economic Survey notes that the Global Infrastructure Outlook forecasts around US$ 4.5 trillion worth of investments is required by India till 2040 to develop infrastructure to improve economic growth and community wellbeing.

 

According to the Survey, the Government is investing massively on building infrastructure to support India’s long term growth. India is far ahead than many emerging economies in terms of providing qualitative transportation related infrastructure. The primary agenda for the Government has been building new National Highways (NHs) and also converting State Highways (SHs) into NHs. As in September, 2017, total length of National Highways (NHs) /Express Ways in India was 1,15,530 km which accounted for 2.06 per cent of the total road length. On the other hand, the length of State Highways was 1,76,166 km as on 2015-16. The Government received proposals for declaration of more than 64000 km of State roads as National Highways (NHs) from various State Governments, against which the Ministry of Road and Transportation has declared about 10000 km of Roads/routes as new National Highways. In many under developed States with lower Per capita GSDP like Bihar, Odisha, Chhatisgarh, Jharkhand and Jammu & Kashmir, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, the density of Other Public Work Department (OPWD) Road/District Road is very low. There is a need for developing OPWD roads including District Roads, so as to provide better access, thereby enhancing economic activities, the Economic Survey adds.

The Survey observes that in order to expedite completion of delayed projects, various steps have been taken for streamlining of land acquisition & environment clearances. The new umbrella program like ‘BharatmalaPariyojana’ aims to achieve optimal resource allocation for a holistic highway development.

Regarding Railways, the Surveys states that during 2017-18 (upto September 2017) Indian Railways carried 558.10 million tonne of revenue earning freight traffic as against 531.23 million tonnes during the corresponding period of previous year, showing an increase of 5.06 per cent during this period. With emphasis on railways infrastructure development, the pace of commissioning Broad Gauge (BG) lines and completion of electrification have been accelerated. With financial assistance from Government of India, 425 km of metro rail systems are operational and about 684 km are under construction in various cities across India (as in December 2017). In 2017-18 (till 31.12.2017), cargo traffic handled at Major Ports has been 499.41 million tonnes compared to 481.87 million tonnes handled during the corresponding period of 2016-17. Under SagarmalaProgramme which is to promote port-led development along Indian coast line, 289 Projects worth Rs. 2.17 Lakh Crore are under various stages of implementation and development, the Survey adds.

In the Telecommunication Sector, the Survey pointed out that the programme like ‘Bharat Net’ and ‘Digital India’ are to convert India into a digital economy. As on end of September 2017, the total subscribers stood at 1207.04 million, out of which 501.99 million connections were in the rural areas and 705.05 million in the urban areas.

Regarding Civil Aviation Sector, the Economic Survey says  that in 2017-18 (April - September), domestic airlines carried 57.5 million passengers, showing a growth rate of 16% over the corresponding previous year period, with 10.3 percent domestic cargo handled. The Government is taking initiatives like liberalization of air services, airport development and regional connectivity through scheme like UDAN.

Highlighting the initiatives and achievement in the Power Sector, the Survey mentions that All-India installed power generation capacity has reached 3,30,860.6 MW as on 30thNovember, 2017 and electrification in 15,183 villages has been completed. The Ujjawal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) has focused on enhancing the financial health of DISCOMs by reducing interest burden, cost of power and aggregated technical and commercial losses. A new scheme, Saubhagya (Pradhan Mantri Sahaj BijliHarGhar Yojana), was launched in September 2017 to ensure electrification of all remaining willing households in the country in rural and urban areas with an outlay of Rs. 16,320 crore, the Survey adds.

According to the Survey, the Indian logistics industry worth around US$ 160 Billion has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.8 per cent during last five years. Logistics sector provides employment to more than 22 million people. The Global Ranking of the World Bank’s 2016 Logistics Performance Index shows that India jumped to 35th rank in 2016 from 54th rank in 2014 in terms of overall logistics performance. India has improved its rank in all the six components of logistics performance index.

India’s housing policies have been mostly focused on building more homes and on home ownership. The Economic Survey suggests that a more holistic approach is required that takes into account rentals and vacancy rates. In turn, this needs to pay more attention to contract enforcement, property rights and spatial distribution of housing supply vs. demand.

                Inflation in the country continued to moderate during 2017-18. Consumer Price Index(CPI) based headline inflation averaged 3.3 per cent during the period which is the lowest in the last six financial years.   This has been stated in the Economic Survey 2017-18 placed in  Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley .

 

The decline in the inflation was broad-based across major commodity groups except Housing and Fuel & Light. The Headline inflation has been below 4 per cent for twelve straight months, from November, 2016 to October, 2017 and CPI food inflation averaged around one per cent during April-December in the current financial year, says the Survey.

 



 

The Survey observes that the economy has witnessed a gradual transition from a period of high and variable inflation to more stable prices in the last four years.  Headline inflation measured by the CPI has remained under control for the fourth successive year. In fact the decline in the inflation in the first half of the current fiscal year was indicative of a benign food inflation which ranged between (-) 2.1 to 1.5 per cent.  . Survey says “This has been possible due to Good agricultural production coupled with regular price monitoring by the Government.”

 

 However, the rise in food inflation in recent months is mainly due to factors driving prices of vegetables and fruits.  In rural areas while food was main driver of CPI inflation during 2016-17, in urban areas housing sector has contributed the most to inflation in the current financial year.  If we a look at state-wise inflation during 2017-18, many states have witnessed sharp fall in CPI inflation.  Inflation in 17 states was below 4 per cent, during the period.  This has been possible due to various efforts made to contain inflation at various level by the Government, says the Survey.

                Controlling inflation has been a priority area for the Central Government, says the Economic Survey 2017-18 placed in Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley . It says that the Government has taken a number of measures for this purpose which, inter alia, include the following:- 

• Advisories are being issued, as and when required, to State Governments to take strict action against hoarding & black marketing and effectively enforce the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 & the Prevention of Black-marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980 for commodities in short supply. 

• Regular review meeting on price and availability situation is being held at the highest level including at the level of Committee of Secretaries, Inter Ministerial Committee, Price Stabilization Fund Management Committee and other Departmental level review meetings. 

• Higher MSP has been announced so as to incentivize production and thereby enhance availability of food items which may help moderate prices. 

• A scheme titled Price Stabilization Fund(PSF) is being implemented to control price volatility of agricultural commodities like pulses, onions etc. 

• The Government approved enhancement in buffer stock of pulses from 1.5 lakh MT to 20 Lakh MT to enable effective market intervention for moderation of retail prices. Accordingly, a dynamic buffer stock of pulses of upto 20 lakh tones has been built. 

• Pulses from the buffer are being provided to States/UTs for PDS distribution, Mid-day Meal scheme etc. The requirement of pulses by Army and Central Para-military Forces. 

• The Government has imposed stock holding limits on stockiest/dealers of sugar till April, 2018.

                Economic Survey 2017-18, tabled by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley in Parliament today, says that with growing rural to urban migration by men, there is ‘feminisation’ of agriculture sector, with increasing number of women in multiple roles as cultivators, entrepreneurs, and labourers. Globally, there is empirical evidence that women have a decisive role in ensuring food security and preserving local agro-biodiversity. Rural women are responsible for the integrated management and use of diverse natural resources to meet the daily household needs. This requires that women farmers should have enhanced access to resources like land, water, credit, technology and training which warrants critical analysis in the context of India. In addition, the entitlements of women farmers will be the key to improve agriculture productivity. The differential access of women to resources like land, credit, water, seeds and markets needs to be addressed. Towards this, Government has been implementing various schemes which help improve the entitlements of women farmers, which will prove to be advantageous in bridging the policy gaps which exits in the sector. The following measures have been taken to ensure mainstreaming of women in agriculture sector: 

• Earmarking at least 30% of the budget allocation for women beneficiaries in all ongoing schemes/programmes and development activities. 

• Initiating women centric activities to ensure benefits of various beneficiary-oriented programs/schemes reach them. 

• Focusing on women self-help group (SHG) to connect them to micro-credit through capacity building activities and to provide information and ensuring their representation in different decision-making bodies. 

• Recognizing the critical role of women in agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has declared 15th October of every year as Women Farmer’s Day. 

With women predominant at all levels-production, pre-harvest, post-harvest processing, packaging, marketing – of the agricultural value chain, to increase productivity in agriculture, it is imperative to adopt gender specific interventions. An ‘inclusive transformative agricultural policy’ should aim at gender-specific intervention to raise productivity of small farm holdings, integrate women as active agents in rural transformation, and engage men and women in extension services with gender expertise.

                Indian Farmers are adapting to farm mechanization at a faster rate in comparison to recent past. This was stated in Economic Survey, 2017-18 tabled by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley in Parliament today. The Economic Survey says that, sale of tractors to a great extent it reflects the level of mechanization. Indian tractor industries have emerged as the largest in the world and account for about one-third of total global tractor production, the Survey adds. 

According to the World Bank estimates, half of the Indian population would be urban by the year 2050. It is estimated that percentage of agricultural workers in total work force would drop to 25.7% by 2050 from 58.2% in 2001. Thus, there is a need to enhance the level of farm mechanization in the country. Due to intensive involvement of labour in different farm operations, the cost of production of many crops is quite high. Human power availability in agriculture also increased from about 0.043KW/ ha in 1960-61 to about 0.077 KW/ ha in 2014-15. However, as compared to tractor growth, increase in human power in agriculture is quite slow. 

Over the year, the shift has been towards the use of mechanical and electrical sources of power. In 1960-61, about 93% farm power was coming from animate sources, which has reduced to about 10% in 2014-15. On the other hand, mechanical and electrical sources of power have increased from 7% to about 90% during the same period. 

According to the Economic Survey, there is predominance of small operational holding in Indian Agriculture. It is, therefore, needed to consolidate the land holdings to reap the benefits of agricultural mechanization. There is a need to innovate custom service or a rental model by institutionalization for high cost farm machinery such as combine harvester, Sugarcane harvester, potato combine, paddy transplanter, laser guided land leveler, rotavator etc. to reduce the cost of operation and it can be adopted by private players or State or Central Organization in major production hubs.

                Rs.20,339 crore has been approved by the Government in 2017-18 to meet various obligations arising from interest subvention being provided to the farmers on short term crop loans, as also loans on post-harvest storages meets an important input requirement of the farmers in the country, specially small and marginal farmers who are the major borrowers. This was stated in the Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley in the Parliament today.The Survey further adds that this institutional credit will help in delinking the farmers from non-institutional sources of credit, where they are compelled to borrow at usurious rates of interest. Since the crop insurance under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is linked to availing of crop loans, the farmers would stand to benefit from both farmer oriented initiatives of the Government, by accessing the crop loans. 

The Survey says that the Government has been undertaking market reforms with a view to ensuring that the farmers benefit from remunerative prices for their produce in the market. The electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) that was launched by Government on April, 2016 aims at integrating the dispersed APMCs through an electronic platform and enable price discovery in a competitive manner, to the advantage of the farmers. While the farmers are advised to undertaken on-line trade, it is also important that they avail themselves of post-harvest loans by storing their produce in the accredited warehouses. The loans are available to Kisan Credit Card (KCC) holding small and marginal farmers at interest subvention of 2% on such storages for a period of upto 6 months. This will help the farmers to sell when they find the market is buoyant, and avoid distress sale. It is, therefore, needful for the small and marginal farmers to keep their KCCs alive, the Survey adds. 

Economic Surveys says, that the Government is keen to double the income of the farmers by 2022, for which it has launched several new initiatives that encompass activities from seed to marketing. The credit from institutional sources will complement all such government initiatives like Soil Health Card, Input Management, Per Drop More Crop in Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), PMFBY, e-Nam, etc.

The Chapter on Sustainable Development, Energy and Climate Change notes India’s commitment to environment and climate change that is reflected in the number of actions in supporting sustainable development goals while retaining reliance on cleaner energy, including cleaner, greener coal. It states that India has strengthened its response to the threat of climate change in accordance with the principles of equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and in the light of national circumstances with the “Paris Pledge” to reduce the emission intensity of GDP by 33-35 percent over 2005 levels by the year 2030. 

On the issue of sustainable development, the Survey says that India’s urban population is projected to grow to about 600 million by 2031. It suggests that Urban Local Bodies generate resources through financial instruments such as municipal bonds, PPPs and credit risk guarantees. The Survey says that access to sustainable, modern and affordable energy is the basis of achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Stating that as on 30th November 2017, the share of renewable energy sources was 18 percent in the total installed capacity of electricity in the country and that the increasing share of renewables has trebled in the last 10 years. 

Outlining India’s commitment to address Climate Change, the Survey mentions establishment of 8 Global Technology Watch Groups, extending Climate Change Action Programme launched in 2014 for the period 2017-18 to 2019-20 with a budget outlay of Rs. 132.4 crore and continuation of National Adaption Fund on Climate Change till 31st March 2020 with financial implication of Rs. 364 crore.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley tabled the Economic Survey 2017-18 in Parliament today. 

The Survey expresses concern over air pollution in Delhi with the onset of winter due to various factor. It ascribes four main reasons for Delhi’s worsening air quality – crop residue, biomass burning, vehicular emissions and redestributed road dust, industries, power plants and winter temperature inversion, humidity and absence of wind. It suggests that the solution is to address each source problem systematically, coordination between agencies and Central and State Governments and sustained civic engagement. 

It says that among the steps being implemented at present are short-term emergency plan and medium and long-range actions. The short-term emergency plan is to be implemented when 24-hourly PM 2.5 exceeds 300-400µg/m3, including imposing heavy penalties on burning of agricultural waste, using satellite-based tools to detect fires, payment of incentives to farmers. The medium and long-range actions include implementing congestion pricing for vehicles, improving public transport system and expanding modernized bus fleets, phasing out old vehicles and accelerating BS-VI. 

The Survey also notes the use of technology to convert agricultural waste into usable fodder or bio-fuels and provide incentives to shift to non-paddy crops and as a point in case quotes the straw management system for rice and wheat farming, as an example. It also mentions the Happy Seeder machine that sows seeds without removing paddy straw and suggests that such a technological solution must be combined with economics, by providing incentives to Centre and states and should be implemented through agricultural cooperatives and local bodies. 

It mentions the adverse impact of indoor pollution on women and children, adding that access to modern energy sources can reduce the amount of time spent on collective of firewood, as well as lead to a positive impact on the education and employment of girls.

                India remained the eighth largest exporter in commercial services in the world in 2016 with share of 3.4 per cent. This is double the share of India’s merchandise exports in the world at 1.7 percent, as put forth in the Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled in the Parliament today by the Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley. India’s services sector registered an export growth of 5.7 per cent in 2016-17. During the period April-September 2017-18, growth in services exports and services imports were robust at 16.2 per cent and 17.4 per cent respectively. Net services receipts rose by 14.6 per cent during this period. Net surplus in the services financed, about 49 per cent of India’s merchandise deficit in H1 of 2017-18. 

To boost services exports, the Survey mentions that the Government in its mid-term Review of Foreign Trade Policy 2015-2020, has increased incentives under Services Exports from India Schemes (SEIS) by 2 per cent, leading to an additional annual incentive of Rs.1,140 crore which could help services exports including Hotel & Restaurant, Hospital, Educational services etc. Although world trade volume of goods and services is projected to accelerate in 2018, enhanced global uncertainty, protectionism and stricter migration rules would be key factors in shaping India’s services exports.

                The Economic Survey 2017-18, tabled today in Parliament by the Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitely, presents a unique State-wise comparison of the performance of the Service sector in India. 

Out of the 32 States and Union Territories (UTs), in 15 states and UTs, the Services Sector is the dominant sector, contributing more than half of the Gross State Value Added (GSVA). The major services in most of the States are trade, hotels and restaurants, followed by real estate, ownership of dwellings and business services. 

However, there is wide variation in terms of share and growth of services GSVA. Out of the 32 States and UTs for which data are available for 2016-17 (or latest year for which data are available), in terms of services GSVA share, Delhi and Chandigarh are at the top with over 80 per cent share, while Sikkim is at the bottom with 31.7 per cent share. In terms of services GSVA growth, Bihar is at the top and Uttar Pradesh at the bottom with 14.5 per cent and 7.0 per cent growth respectively in 2016-17.

                FDI equity inflows to the services sector grew by 15.0 percent during 2017-18 (April-October). It has been possible because the Government has undertaken a number of reforms to ensure that India remains an increasingly attractive investment destination, which include announcement of National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policy, implementation of GST, reforms for ease of doing business. This was brought about in the Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley in Parliament today. 

The survey points out that the scale of reforms can be gauged from the fact the during this period, 25 sectors also including services activities and covering 100 areas of FDI policy have undergone reforms. FDI policy provisions were radically overhauled across sectors such as construction development, broadcasting, retail trading, air transport, insurance and pension. At present, more than 90 per cent of FDI inflows are through automatic route. After the successful implementation of the e-filing and online processing of FDI application by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), the Government announced to phase out the FIPB in the Union Budget 2017-18. Recently, on 10th January 2018, Union Cabinet approved amendments in FDI policy allowing 100 per cent FDI under automatic route for Single Brand Retail Trading. Foreign airlines also have been allowed to invest up to 49 per cent in Air India, the survey adds. 

The survey further states that though there is ambiguity in the classification of FDI in services, it is the combined FDI share of the top 10 service sectors such as financial and non-financial services falling under the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP)’s service sector definition; as well as telecommunications; trading; computer hardware & software; construction; hotels & tourism; hospital & diagnostic centers; consultancy services; sea transport; and information & broadcasting that can be taken as the best estimate of services FDI. However, these could include some non-service elements. The share of these services is 56.6 per cent of the cumulative FDI equity inflows during the period April 2000-October 2017 and 65.8 per cent of FDI equity inflows during 2017-18 (April-October). If the shares of another 5 services or service related sectors like retail trading, agriculture services, education, book, printing and air transport are included, then the total share of FDI equity inflows to the services sector would increase to 58.5 per cent and 69.6 per cent respectively for the above two periods. In 2016-17, FDI equity inflows to the services sector (top 10 sectors including construction) declined by 0.9 per cent to US$ 26.4 billion, though the overall FDI equity inflows grew by 8.7 per cent. However, during 2017-18 (April-October), the FDI equity inflows to these services sector grew by 15.0 per cent, as compared to 0.8per cent growth in total FDI equity inflows, mainly due to higher FDI in two sectors i.e. Telecommunications and Computer Software and Hardware.

                The Services sector, with a share of 55.2 per cent in India’s Gross Value Added (GVA), continued to be the key driver of India’s economic growth contributing almost 72.5 per cent of GVA growth in 2017-18, as stated in the Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled in the Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitely. While the growth of Service Sector as a whole is expected to be at 8.3 per cent in 2017-18, the growth in Services exports was 16.2 per cent in H1 of 2017-18. The Government has taken many initiatives in the different Services which include digitization, e-visas, infrastructure status to Logistics, Start-up India, Schemes for the housing sector, etc. which could give a further fillip to the Services Sector. 

Major Services’ Sector-wise performance and some recent Government policies to boost the growth of the sector are as follows: 

TOURISM

India’s Tourism sector has been performing well with Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) growing by 9.7 per cent to 8.8 million and Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEEs) at 8.8 per cent to US$ 22.9 billion in 2016. FTAs during 2017 were 10.2 million, with a growth of 15.6 per cent, while FEEs from tourism were US$ 27.7 billion, with a growth of 20.8 per cent over 2016.

Various initiatives have been taken by the Government to promote tourism include the introduction of the e-Visa facility under three categories of Tourist, Medical and Business for the citizens of 163 countries; launch of Global Media Campaign for 2017-18 on various Channels; launch of ‘The Heritage Trails’ to promote the World Heritage Sites in India; launch of International Media Campaign on various international TV channels; Celebration of ‘Paryatan Parv’ having 3 components namely ‘Dekho Apna Desh’ to encourage Indians to visit their own country, ‘Tourism for All’ with tourism events at sites across all states in the country, and ‘Tourism & Governance’ with interactive sessions & workshops with stakeholders on varied themes. FTAs on e-Tourist Visa grew by 143 per cent to 10.8 lakh in 2016, and further grew by 57.2 per cent to 17.0 lakh during 2017. 

IT-BPM

India’s Information Technology – Business Process Management (IT-BPM) industry grew by 8.1 per cent in 2016-17 to US$ 139.9 billion (excluding e-commerce and hardware) from US$129.4 billion in 2015-16, as per NASSCOM data.

REAL ESTATE

The Indian Real Estate sector has begun to show signs of improvement with the total FDI of US$ 257 million in H1 2017, which is more than double the total FDI in 2016 full year. 

Some of the recent reforms and policies taken by the Government of India related to Real Estate Sector include the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) with the government sanctioning over 3.1 million houses for the affordable housing segment in urban regions till November 2017. Of this, about 1.6 million houses have been grounded and are at various stages of construction, and about 0.4 million houses have been built under the mission. PPP policy for affordable housing was also announced on 21st September 2017 for affordable housing segment to provide further impetus to the ambitious ‘Housing for all by 2022’ mission. Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) under PMAY was extended to the Middle Income Group (MIG) segment, which got included in the scheme from 1st January 2017. With the enactment of Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016, it is anticipated that accountability would lead to higher growth across the real estate value chain, while compulsory disclosures and registrations would ensure transparency. 

R&D

The professional Scientific & Technical activities which include R&D services grew by 17.5 per cent and 41.1 per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively. India-based R&D services companies, which account for almost 22 per cent of the global market, grew at 12.7 per cent. However, India’s gross expenditure on R&D has been at around 1 per cent of GDP. India ranks 60th out of 127 on the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2017, improving from 66th rank in 2016. 

Buoyed by the Government’s support which includes important Schemes of different Ministries/Departments, the R&D sector in India is all set to witness robust growth in the coming years. According to a study, engineering R&D market in India is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 14 per cent to reach US$ 42 billion by 2020. India is also expected to witness strong growth in its agriculture and pharmaceutical sectors as the Government is investing large sums to set up dedicated research centres for R&D in these sectors. 

SPACE

In the case of Satellite Launching, as on March 2017, PSLV successfully launched 254 satellites. Foreign exchange earnings of India from export of satellite launch services increased noticeably in 2015-16 and 2016-17 to Rs 394 crore and Rs 275 crore from Rs. 149 crore in 2014-15. 

India’s share in global satellite launch services revenue has also increased to 1.1 per cent in 2015-16 from 0.3 per cent in 2014-15. Antrix foresees greater utilization of PSLV, GSLV and GSLV-Mk-III launch services by the international community for launching their Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.

                Utmost priority to social infrastructure like education, health and social protection is given by the Government to engineer an inclusive and sustainable growth for India. This was stated in the Economic Survey 2017-18, tabled by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley, in the Parliament today 

On the subject of “Social Infrastructure, Employment and Human Development”, bridging the gender gaps in education, skill development, employment, earnings and reducing social inequalities prevalent in the society have been the underlying goals of the development strategy to enhance human capabilities. The Survey notes that India is poised to grow as one of the leading knowledge economies where education, skill development and health will remain priorities for the Government. 

The Survey adds that the government has been enhancing the expenditure on human capital along with adopting measures to improve the efficiency of expenditure by convergence of schemes. The expenditure on social services by the Centre and States as a proportion of GDP had remained in the range of 6 per cent during 2012-13 to 2014-15. Expenditure on Social services stands at 6.6 per cent in 2017-18 (BE). 

As the way forward, the Economic Survey 2017-18 recommends that though macro-economic growth and efficient markets are essential, it is necessary to equally ensure that the benefits of growth are equitably accessible to all citizens to make growth broad-based. The Survey concludes that strengthening the policy and institutional eco-system supporting inclusive growth deserves to be a top policy priority.

                The Economic Survey 2017- 18 highlights Government of India’s commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG- 4) for education. It mentioned the significant progress made in universalisingprimary education, with substantial improvement in the enrolment and completion rates of education of children in both primary and elementary school. The Survey takes note of the increased percentage of schools which comply with the Student Classroom Ratio (SCR) and Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) at the all India level. This was stated in the Economic Survey 2017- 18 tabled in Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley.

The Survey, however, notes the inter-state variations in the adherence to Student Classroom Ratio (SCR) and Pupil Teacher Ratios (PTR) norms. Taking note of the substantially improved Gender Parity Index (GPI) at the primary and secondary levels of school enrolment with the consistent efforts of the government, the Survey acknowledges the success of programmes like Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao in addressing issues of gender bias in access to education.

                The Economic Survey 2017- 18 highlights several Labour reform measures. The Survey mentions the specifics of technology driven initiatives that ensure delivery by reducing complexity in compliance and bring transparency and accountability for better enforcement of Labour laws. This was stated in the Economic Survey 2017- 18 tabled in Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley. The Survey takes stock of legislative reforms in Labour sector that are being implemented for creation of employment opportunities and for providing sustainable livelihoods for the population who are largely engaged in informal economy. 

The Survey notes that the Government has undertaken numerous technology enabled transformative initiatives such as Shram Suvidha Portal, Ease of Compliance to maintain registers under various Labour Laws/Rules, Universal Account Number, and National Career Service portal in order to reduce the complexity in compliance and to bring transparency and accountability for better enforcement of the labour laws. 

The Survey mentions that there has been highest ever budget allocation under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) during 2017-18. About 4.6 crore households were provided employment totaling 177.8 crore person days during 2017-18 as on 14thJanuary, 2018. Out of this, 54 per cent were generated by women, 22 per cent by Schedule Castes and 17 per cent by Schedule Tribes.

                The Economic Survey 2017- 18 reiterates India’s commitment to achieve the targets under Sustainable Development Goals-3 (SDG-3) with some of them also aligned with the National Health Policy 2017. This was stated in the Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled in Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley. The Survey takes note of the shift in the disease burden from Communicable Diseases to Non-Communicable Diseases in the country between 1990 and 2016. The Survey mentions that Child and Maternal Malnutrition continues to be the most challenging risk factor for health loss in India in 2016. The other key risk factors include air pollution, dietary risks, high blood pressure and diabetes etc. 

The Survey takes note of the National Health Policy 2017 which recommended increasing State sector health spending to more than 8 per cent of the States’ Government Budget by 2020. It also takes note of the Report ‘India: Health of Nation’s States’ 2017’, which provides the first comprehensive set of findings for the distribution of diseases and risk factors across all States from 1990 to 2016. The concept of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) has been developed to provide a framework for analysing the disease burden and risk factors. The Survey advocates there is a need to understand the efficiency of public spending with respect to DALYs behaviour across the major States and to assess whether high-spending by States on health results in better health outcomes. 

The Survey notes that there has been significant improvement in the health status of individuals in India as life expectancy at birth has increased by 10 years during the period 1990 to 2015. The Survey, however, notes with concern that there are wide differences in the average prices of diagnostic tests across cities which need to be addressed by standardising rates to reduce Out of Pocket Expenses (OPE) on health services. 

According to the Survey, the National Health Policy 2017 will help in strengthening health delivery systems and in achieving universal health coverage.

                The Economic Survey 2017-18 takes note of the basic fact that quality of hygiene and sanitation has significant impact on improving the health outcomes. With the launch of Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) on 2nd October, 2014, the sanitation coverage in rural India has increased substantially from 39 per cent in 2014 to 76 percent in January, 2018. The Economic Survey 2017- 18 was tabled in Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley.

 



 

The number of persons defecating in open in rural areas, which were 55 crore in October, 2014 declined to 25 crore in January, 2018. So far,  296 districts and  307,349 villages all over India have been declared Open Defecation Free (ODF). Eight states and two Union Territories. i.e., Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Daman & Diu and Chandigarh have been declared as ODF completely. The surveys conducted by  the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and Quality Council of India (QCI) on usage of toilets by the individuals who have access to toilets reported more than 90 per cent of individuals using toilets in 2016 and 2017.

The Survey satisfactorily notes that there has been substantial reduction in the number of persons defecating in open in rural areas which has had positive health and economic impact in ODF areas. In a report, ‘The Financial and Economic Impact of SBM in India’, UNICEF estimated that a household in an ODF village in rural India saves Rs 50,000/- every year.

                The highlights of the Investment and Savings situation as brought out by Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled in Parliament today are as follows:- 

India’s unprecedented climb to historic high levels of investment and saving rates in the mid-2000s has been followed by a pronounced, albeit gradual, decline. This current episode of investment and saving slowdown is still ongoing. 

• The ratio of domestic saving to GDP reached 29.2 per cent in 2013 to a peak of 38.3 per cent in 2007, before falling back to 29 per cent in 2016. 

• The cumulative fall over 2007 and 2016 has been milder for investment than saving, but investment has fallen to a lower level. 

Based on the break-up of investment and saving, that is available up to 2015-16, private investment accounts for 5 percentage points out of the 6.3 percentage point overall investment decline over 2007-08 and 2015-16. 

Asian countries faced the largest number of slowdown episodes following 1997. Currently (after 2008), these economies are in the era of saving slowdowns. In India, the investment slowdown started in 2012, subsequently intensified and was apparently still continuing as of the latest date, that for 2016. 

Since investment slowdowns are more detrimental to growth than savings slowdown, so, policy priorities over the short run have focused on reviving investment by mobilizing saving, via attempts to unearth black money and encouraging the conversion of gold into financial saving. The share of financial saving is already rising in aggregate household saving - with a clear shift visible towards market instruments – a phenomenon that has been helped by demonetization. 

The cross-country experience to study the pattern of investment and saving slowdowns has revealed that the investment slowdowns have an impact on growth but not necessarily saving. The policy conclusion is urgent prioritization of investment revival to arrest more lasting growth impacts, as the government has done with plans for resolution of bad debts and recapitalization of public sector banks.

                Is there a low equilibrium trap if fiscal federalism is not achieved? This was the question posed by the Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley in Parliament today. 

The Survey pointed out that low level of tax collections by the local Governments in rural areas is posing challenge in reconciling fiscal federalism and accountability. Panchayats received 95 per cent of their revenues from the devolved funds from the Centre/State while generating only 5 per cent from own resources. Panchayats in States like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka do collect some direct taxes while villages in States like Uttar Pradesh almost entirely depend on transfer funds. This is because some State Governments have not devolved enough taxation powers to the Panchayats- permissible taxes for Panchayats include Property and Entertainment Taxes but not Land Taxes or Tolls on roads. In some other instances, even though the rural local governments have been given powers to tax, land revenue collection remained low between 7 to 19 per cent due to low base values applied to properties and low rates of taxes levied. In rural areas of Kerala and Karnataka which are ahead of others in devolving powers to Panchayats, the House tax revenue collection is only one third of the potential. The Centre which collects these taxes in some Union Territories also did not fare better and was able to collect only 30 per cent of the potential revenue. 

The Survey pointed out that economic and political development has been associated with a rising share of direct taxes in total taxes. Direct Taxes account for about 70 per cent of total taxes in Europe while in India the figure remained around 35 per cent. Unlike in other countries, reliance on direct taxes in India seems to be declining, a trend that will be reinforced if the Goods and Services Tax (GST) proves to be a buoyant source of revenue. Further, the Survey highlighted that fiscal decentralization is often embraced as not just a desirable economic but also as a political and philosophical principle. Quoting Rabindranath Tagore, the Survey underlined that fiscal decentralization captures the idea that spending and tax decisions must reflect local preferences as far as possible. However, in India the States 

generate very low share of about 6 per cent of their revenue from direct taxes while the figure is 19 per cent in Brazil and 44 per cent in Germany. In the third tier, rural local governments in India generate only 6 per cent of revenues from own resources compared to 40 per cent in Brazil and Germany. Meanwhile, urban local governments in India are much closer to International norms collecting 18 per cent of total revenues from direct taxes compared to 19 per cent in Brazil and 26 per cent in Germany. Further, urban local governments in India generate 44 per cent of their total revenue from own sources. This is evident that urban local governments have emerged more fiscally empowered than rural local government in India. 

While calling for better data and evidence to evaluate the impact of 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments (that devolved more powers to the rural and Urban local governments respectively) on India’s federal structure, its governance and accountability, the Survey concludes that the local governments in India in tier 2 and tier 3 rely much more on devolved resources. They generate less tax resources and collect less direct taxes. The reason does not seem to be so much that they don’t have enough taxation power. Rather, they are not fully utilizing existing taxation powers. 

The Survey poses questions – is the problem a potential unwillingness to tax by the state, stemming possibly from the close proximity between the state and the citizens? Are citizens able but unwilling to pay more because they are dissatisfied with the quality of services they are receiving? Or is it an equilibrium desired by all with Centre and States using their devolution powers to control lower levels which are unable to tax the proximate citizens and need outside resources? The Survey says answers to these questions must inform future discussions of devolution and decentralization. Unless the underlying problems are identified and solved, the states and third tier governments could remain stuck in a low equilibrium trap forever depending on outside resources with weak accountability mechanisms and weak own-resource general capacity.

                The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley tabled the Economic Survey 2017-18 in Parliament today. In one of the chapters the Survey examines how far the apprehensions of an impending “Late Converger Stall” are true for India and whether the stall is likely to affect India’s growth in the coming years. 

The Survey notes that the present era is one of economic convergence whereby poorer countries including India have grown faster than richer countries and closed the gap in standards of living. India moved from being a low income country in 1960 to a lower middle income country in 2008, and is now attempting to make a transition to middle income status. However, there are fears that this process of convergence may slow down for the late converger countries like India, who are trying to make this transition after the global financial crisis. It notes that India needs to take on four challenges in order to ward off the fears of an impending “Late Converger Stall” in the process of economic development. The four challenges that the Survey points to include: the backlash against globalization which reduces exporting opportunities, the difficulties of transferring resources from low productivity to higher productivity sectors (structural transformation), the challenge of upgrading human capital to the demands of a technology-intensive workplace, and coping with climate change-induced agricultural stress. 

a. Hyper globalization repudiation or backlash against globalization – 

Early convergers like Japan, South Korea and China were able to post average export growth rates of over 15% for thirty years of their convergence periods. However, the trading environment has changed for late convergers like India. A backlash in advanced countries against rapid globalization has led to a fall in world trade GDP ratios since 2011. This means a decline in exporting opportunities, especially since politics in advanced countries is moving de facto in the direction of seeking and forcing lower trade GDP ratios . b. Thwarted structural transformation or difficulties of transferring resources from low productivity to higher productivity sectors 

For successful development, resources need to shift from low productivity to high productivity sectors. Structural transformation gets thwarted if resources shift from informal, low productivity sectors to ones that are only marginally less informal or more productive. Studies in India show a weakening correlation between overall growth and good growth. 

c. Upgrading human capital to the demands of a technology-intensive workplace 

Late convergers like India have failed to provide even the basic education necessary for structural transformation. This is reflected in the finding that in India, roughly 40 to 50% of rural children in grades 3 to 8 cannot meet the basic learning standards. This failure will prove increasingly costly because the human capital frontier for the new structural transformation will shift further away as technology will increasingly favour skilled human capital. There is, however, some consolation that the trend has started to improve since 2014. 

d. Climate change-induced agricultural stress 

Growth rates of agricultural productivity for richer countries have been consistently greater than for developing countries. For India agricultural productivity growth has been stagnant, averaging roughly 3% over the last 30 years. It is also vulnerable to temperature increase and still heavily dependent on precipitation. For late convergers, agricultural productivity is critical not just for feeding people but for ensuring human capital accumulation in those who move from agriculture to the modern sectors. 

The Survey goes on to note that growth in India has occurred with limited transfer of labour resources from low productivity to high productivity and dynamic sectors, and despite relatively modest agricultural growth. Rapidly improving human capital, will be key to sustaining India’s dynamic growth trajectory. Rapidly improving agricultural productivity against the headwinds of climate change and water scarcity will be another key to achieving good sustainable growth. As of now India may not be faced with a “Late Converger Stall”, but need to act in time to ward it off.

                 Two important developments on the trade policy  front during the year relate to the mid-term review of Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) and the recent multilateral negotiations of WTO in December 2017.  Besides these, there were some developments on the trade logistics front and anti dumping measures.  This was stated in the Economic Survey in 2017-18 tabled in Parliament today by the Union Finance & Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley

FTP-Mid Term Review and subsequent trade related policies.

In the mid-term review of FTP released on 5th December 2017, some additional measures have been taken to help India’s trade sector.  Besides, on 15th December, 2017, a special package for employment generation in the leather and footwear sector was approved by the Government. This is also likely to help exports from this sector.

Multilateral Negotiations

The Eleventh Ministerial Conference (MCII) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ended without  aMinisterial Declaration or any substantive outcome.

During MCII India stood firm on its stand on the fundamental principles of the WTO, including multilateralism, rule-based consensual decision making, an independent and credible dispute resolution and appellate process, the centrality of development which underlies  the Doha Development Agenda (DDAQ) and special and differential treatment for all developing countries.

Foreign Exchange Reserves

India’s foreign exchange reserves reached US$ 409.4 billion on end-December 2017.  Foreign exchange reserves grew by 14.1 percent on a y-o-y basis from end December 2016  (US$ 358.9 billion) to end December 2017 (US$ 409.4 billion) and it grew by 10.7 percent from end- March, 2017 (US$370.0 billion) to end December 2017.  Foreign exchange reserves increased further  to US$ 413.8 billion on January 12, 2018.



The import cover of India’s foreign exchange reserves was 11.1 months at end-September 2017 as compared with 11.3 months at end -March 2017.  Within the major economies running current account deficit, India is among the largest foreign exchange reserve holders and sixth largest among all countries of the world.

The Survey’s observations on transformation of Indian Science & Technology in the last one year in the OUTPUTS of the sector are as follows:- 

Publications

Looking at publications and patents in Science & technology in India can help assess the productivity and quality of Indian research. In 2013, India ranked 6th in the world in scientific publications. Its ranking has been increasing as well. The growth of annual publications between 2009 to 2014 was almost 14 percent. This increased India’s share in global publications from 3.1 % in 2009 to 4.4 % in 2014 as per the Scopus Database. 

Broadly, the publication trends reveal that India is gradually improving its performance as measured by the number of publications which is an important metric. 

In addition to increasing publications, trends in quality are also slowly improving. The Nature Index (which publishes tables based on counts of high-quality research outputs in the previous calendar year covering the natural sciences) ranked India at 13 in 2017. 

Patents

If journal publications reflect a country’s prowess in science, patents reflect its standing in technology. According to the WIPO, India has the world’s 7th largest Patent Filing Office. In 2015, India registered 45,658 patents in comparison to China (1,101,864), USA (589,410) Japan (318,721) Republic of Korea (213,694) and Germany (91,726). However, India produces fewer patents per capita. 

One major challenge in India has been the domestic patent system. While India’s patent applications and grants have grown rapidly in foreign jurisdictions, the same is not true at home. Residential applications have increased substantially since India joined the international patent regime in 2005. However, the number of patents granted fell sharply post- 2008 and has remained low. While Indian residents were granted over 5000 patents in foreign offices in 2015, the number of resident filings in India was little over 800. 

The government’s recent hiring of over 450 additional patent examiners and creation of an expedited filing system for Indian residents in 2017 will therefore be a welcome and crucial intervention to help fix the existing patent system. Having addressed issues on the patent filing side, addressing patent litigation issues will also be crucial to ensuring that the patent system effectively rewards innovation.

                India’s external sector continued to be resilient and strong in 2017-18, as observed in the Economic Survey 2017-18 which was tabled in Parliament today by the Union Finance & Corporate Affairs, Shri ArunJaitley.

International Developments

The global economy is gathering pace and is  expected to accelerate from 3.2 percent in 2016 to 3.6 percent in 2017 and 3.7 percent in 2018 which reflects an upward revision of the earlier projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  

India’s balance of payments situation, which has been benign and comfortable since 2013-14, continued to be so in the first half of 2017-18, despite some rise in the Current Account Deficit (CAD) in the first quarter, with a relatively lower CAD in the second quarter.  India’s CAD stood at US$7.2 billion (1.2 percent of GDP) in Q2 of 2017-18, narrowing sharply from US$ 15.0 billion (2.5 percent of GDP) in the preceding quarter.

Trade Deficit

            India’s trade deficit (on custom basis) which had registered continuous decline since 2014-15, widened to US$ 74.5 billion in HI of 2017-18 from US$ 43.4 billion in HI of 2016-17.  India’s trade deficit was US$ 108.5 billion in 2016-17, with reduction in both POL deficit and non- POL deficit.  In 2017-18 (April-December) trade deficit (on custom basis) shot up by 46.4 percent to US$ 114.9 billion with POL deficit growing by 27.4 percent and non-POL deficit by 65.0 per cent. 

Composition of Trade

            Export growth in 2016-17 was fairly broad based with positive growth in major categories except textiles & allied products and leather and leather manufactures.  In 2017-18 (April-November) among the major sectors, there was good export growth in engineering goods and petroleum crude and products, moderate growth in chemicals & related products, and textiles & allied products; but negative growth in gems and jewellery.



            The prospects for India’s External Sector in this and coming year look bright with world trade projected to grow at 4.2 percent and 4 percent in 2017 and 2018 respectively from 2.4 percent in2016; trade of major partner countries improving and above all India’s export growth also picking up.  The downside risks lie in the rise in oil prices.  However, this could also lead to higher inflow of remittances which have started picking up.  The supportive policies like GST, logistics and trade facilitation policies of the government could help further.

                As India emerges as one of the world’s largest economics, it needs to gradually move from being a net consumer of knowledge to becoming a net producer. 

This has been emphasized in the Economic Survey 2017-18 tabled in the Parliament today, by the Union Finance & Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley. 

Given the dizzying pace and expansion of scientific research and knowledge on the one hand and a generally higher importance given to careers in engineering, medicine, management and government jobs amongst India’s youth on the other, India needs to rekindle the excitement and purpose that would attract more young people to scientific enterprise. Doing so would lay the knowledge foundations to address some of India’s most pressing development challenging in addition to maintain a decent, open society. Investing in science is also fundamental to India’s security, the human security of its populations, the resilience needed to address the multiple uncertainties stemming from climate change and the national security challenges stemming from new emerging threats, ranging from cyber warfare to autonomous military systems such as drones.

                The Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley said that dynamic nature of the Indian economy and availability of technology tools has impacted the functioning of all the Departments including the nature of Tax Administration. The Finance Minister said that there are two major challenges before the Customs Administration today which include that of trade facilitation and sharp detection & enforcement to avoid any tax evasion. Shri Jaitley said that there is also a challenge to keep a balance between these two dichotomic functions where the experience of tax authorities come to their rescue. The Finance Minister, Shri Jaitley was addressing the august gathering of senior officers and staff of the Central Board of Excise & Customs (CBEC) along with other dignitaries on the occasion of the ‘Investiture Ceremony 2018’ and ‘International Customs Day 2018’ in Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi today. The Finance Minister, Shri Jaitley expressed confidence that CBEC would take necessary steps to ensure that India’s ranking in trade across borders would improve substantially. On the occasion, the Finance Minister, Shri Jaitley also released two IT tools of the Customs Department i.e. ICETRAK, and ICETAB, developed by the CBEC to provide an easy way for trade to track their consignments and for providing other important information and updates. Earlier, the Minister of State for Finance, Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla, in his address complimented the role of Customs in implementing GST in record time, in securing our international borders and for facilitating trade and international passengers at airports. The Finance Secretary, Dr. Hasmukh Adhia congratulated the Department for smooth implementation of GST and adoption of new technology. He underlined the important role of Customs in further improving the nation’s ranking in trading across borders while appreciating the enhanced adoption of technology and keeping a pace with latest technology in their business processes. Shri P.K. Das, Member (Customs), Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), also spoke about the thrust on enhancing trade facilitation and the role of other stakeholders including participating Government agencies. Shri Sunil Kumar Sawhney, Chief Commissioner of Customs, Delhi Customs Zone, presented the vote of thanks.

International Customs Day celebrations were organised by the Central Board of Excise & Customs (CBEC). The Union Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley was the Chief Guest on the occasion while the Union Minister of State for Finance Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla was the Guest of Honour.

                Atal Pension Yojana (APY) is a Government of India's Old Age Pension Scheme being implemented through all Banks across the country as per the mandate received from the Ministry of Finance and monitored periodically at PMO.

Payments Banks and Small Finance Banks are a New Model of banks conceptualized by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 11 Payment Banks and 10 Small Finance Banks have received license from Reserve Bank of India to start banking operations in India.

                          The Government of India today unveiled details of the re-capitalisation of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) announced in October, 2017.  The capital infusion plan for 2017-18 includes Rs.80,000 crore through Recap Bonds and Rs.8,139 crore as budgetary support.  This plan addresses regulatory capital requirement of all PSBs and provides a significant amount towards growth capital for increasing lending to the economy. 

             The recap would be accompanied by a strong reforms package across six themes incorporating 30 action points. The reforms agenda is based on the recommendations made at the PSB Manthan held in November, 2017 involving senior management of PSBs and representatives from Government.  The reform agenda is aimed at EASE - Enhanced Access and Service Excellence, focusing on six themes of customer responsiveness, responsible banking, credit off take, PSBs as Udyami Mitra, deepening financial inclusion & digitalisation and developing personnel for brand PSB.   The overarching framework for the reforms agenda is “Responsive and Responsible PSBs”.

             Capital infusion by the Government is contingent on performance of PSBs on the reform.  Whole Time Directors of PSBs would be assigned theme wise reforms for implementation.  Their performance in this regard would be evaluated by the bank Board.

              A survey by an independent agency in respect of EASE would be conducted to measure public perception about improvements in access and service quality.  Results of the survey shall be made public each year.

             Taken together, the recap & reform agenda is sharply focused on strengthening PSBs, increasing lending to MSMEs and making it easier for MSMEs and retail customers to transact as well as significantly increasing access to banking services.  It includes a commitment to banking services within 5 kms of every village, refund  within 10 days of any unauthorised debit in electronic  transactions, a mobile App  for locating banking outlets and a mobile ATM in every underserved district.

                Complaints have been received from the Foreign Diplomatic Missions / UN Organizations regarding unwillingness of vendors / suppliers / E-commerce websites to record the UIN (Unique Identify Number) while making sales to such Embassies / Missions / Consulates or UN organizations. 

It may be noted that supply to Foreign Diplomatic Missions / UN Organizations is like any other Business to Consumer (B2C) supply and will not have any additional impact on the supplier’s tax liability. Recording of UIN while making such supplies will enable Foreign Diplomatic Missions / UN Organizations to claim refund of the taxes paid by them in India. Therefore, it is advised that suppliers should not decline to record the UIN of the Embassies / Missions / Consulates or UN organizations on the tax invoice. 

Unique Identification Number (UIN) is a 15-digit unique number allotted to any specialised agency of the United Nations Organisation or any Multilateral Financial Institution and Organisation notified under the United Nations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, 1947, Consulate or Embassy of foreign countries. First two digits of the UIN denotes State code where such entity is located. 

It may also be noted that recording of the Unique Identity Number on the invoice is a necessary condition under Rule 46 of the CGST Rules, 2017. Contravention of the Rule may attract punitive action under the CGST Act,2017. 

Search functionality for UIN is available on the GST Common Portal in “Search Taxpayer” option. On entering UIN and captcha, details of the entity will be available.

                The Government of India, the Government of Uttarakhand and the World Bank Board signed here today in New Delhi, a $120 million Loan Agreement which will help increase access to improved water supply services in peri-urban areas in the State of Uttarakhand. 

The Agreement for the project was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; Mr. Arvind Singh Hyanki, Secretary, Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, on behalf of the Government of Uttarakhand; and Mr. Hisham Abdo, Acting Country Director, World Bank, India on behalf of the World Bank. 

The Uttarakhand Water Supply Program for Peri-Urban Areas will help the State increase water supply coverage as well as ensure sustainable water supply service delivery in peri-urban areas. It will develop and implement a service-oriented and efficient water supply policy for peri-urban areas, strengthen the current monitoring and evaluation systems, and provide dedicated incentives for preparation and adoption of water supply ‘master-plans’ in peri-urban areas. 

Growth and urbanization has led to the rise of significant “peri-urban” areas (mostly in the plains) that, while classified as rural, are effectively urban in nature (in terms of density of population, the structure of the economy, and aspirations of the people).  The “disconnect” between the formal classification of these populated areas and their actual nature, including provision of water supply, along with unique governance, infrastructure, and service delivery challenges.

From 2001 to 2011, the state’s urban population grew by nearly 42 percent, which is substantially higher than the national average of 32 percent. While the state has made significant strides in piloting and implementing innovative approaches in water supply and sanitation services, water supply services in peri-urban areas have not been a focus.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India said that over 700,000 people residing in peri-urban areas of the state are expected to benefit from the program. He said that with increasing urbanization, the demarcation between rural and urban is slowly diminishing. The rise of peri urban areas in Uttarakhand presents many challenges to development.

Mr Khare concluded that through this project, the peri-urban population in the State, especially the women will have easy access to regular water supply services, thus freeing- up their time for other more socially and economically productive activities. 

The Program will focus on increasing coverage, quality and reliability of water supply services in all peri-urban areas of the State. Services would be provided through piped network and metered service connections with a focus on improving the operation and management (O&M) of it. Some of the efforts at improving services under the Program will include ensuring a minimum 16-hour water supply which meets the Government of India water quality standards, supplied at a minimum pressure of 12m, for no less than 300 days in a year; 100 percent customer metering and volumetric tariffs; and sustainable water supply systems which recover O&M costs through user charges with transparent subsidies, if any.

Speaking on the occasion, Ms Smita Misra, Lead Water Supply and Sanitation Specialist and the World Bank’s Task Team Leader for the program said that with rapid economic growth and urbanization, there is a strong demand for better public services, including water supply in peri-urban areas. She said that this Program is now a priority for the State as it moves towards achieving its goal of universal water supply coverage in urban areas by 2030 and in rural areas by 2022. She further said that we hope this program shows the way for others addressing service delivery issues in challenging `peri-urban’ areas that are increasingly part of the landscape of India and other countries in South Asia.

The $120 million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 5-year grace period, and a maturity of 17 years.

                The Government of India is pleased to take note that the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) has made its First investment today. NIIF has partnered with DP World to create an investment platform for ports, terminals, transportation and logistics businesses in India. The platform will invest in opportunities in the ports sector, and beyond sea ports into areas such as river ports and transportation, freight corridors, port-led special economic zones, inland container terminals, and logistics infrastructure including cold storage.

 

The first close of the NIIF Master Fund took place on October, 16, 2017 with contributions from a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and four Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs), viz., HDFC Group, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Life and Axis Bank.

 

An India-UK Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF) is also being set-up under the fund of funds vertical of NIIF, and shall have anchor commitments of GBP 120 million each from Government of India (through NIIF) and Government of UK. 

 

Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance said, “NIIF, set-up to function as a major platform in India for attracting foreign investments, has made good progress. We are pleased to learn of NIIF’s first investment to create an investment platform in the ports and logistics sector. Following its First Close in October 2017 on the fund-raising side, and now with its first investment, NIIF is making visible progress.’’

 

The NIIF is being operationalized by establishing three Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) under the SEBI Regulations. The proposed corpus of NIIF is Rs. 40,000 Crores (around USD 6 Billion). GOI’s contribution to the AIFs under the NIIF scheme shall be 49% of the total commitment. NIIF has mandate to solicit equity participation from strategic anchor partners, like overseas sovereign/quasi-sovereign/multilateral/bilateral investors.

                The Government of India has entered into an agreement with ONGC today for the strategic sale of its 51.11% equity share-holding in HPCL at a consideration of Rs. 36,915 crore. 

During the review in February 2016, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi underlined the need of efficient management of Government investments in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). The Government accordingly expanded the approach from of disinvestment to investment and public asset management. As part of investment management strategy, Government decided to explore possibilities of consolidation, mergers and acquisitions within CPSE space. An announcement in this regard was made by the Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley in his Budget Speech of 2017-18.

 In line with the Budget announcement, ONGC proposed to acquire the Government of India’s existing 51.11% equity shareholding in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL). The Union Cabinet, in its meeting held on 19.7.2017, gave 'in-principle' approval to the said proposal and decided to set up an Alternative mechanism under the Finance Minister to decide on the price, timing and the terms and conditions of the strategic sale.

 The Alternative mechanism under the Chairmanship of the Finance Minister in its meeting today approved the price bid of ONGC and the terms and conditions of the sale.

 Through this acquisition, ONGC will become India's first vertically integrated 'oil major' company, having presence across the entire value chain. The integrated entity will have advantage of having enhanced capacity to bear higher risks, take higher investment decisions and neutralizing the impact of volatility of global crude oil prices.  In this process, ONGC has acquired significant mid-stream and downstream capacity and will attain economies of scale at various levels of operations.

Through this economic consolidation, HPCL will join as a member of an integrated oil and gas major group. This will help it in further leveraging synergy at various levels of vertical value chains and look for economic consolidation within and outside the Group. However, HPCL will continue to be a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE).

                Tis Hazari Court has ordered judicial custody of the Director of a Delhi based Real Estate and IT Solution Company for non-compliance in Income Tax TDS Default case. It was found during investigations that the company had deducted TDS but had not deposited in the Government account despite there being a statutory obligation by the Income Tax Act. This also led to harassment of many innocent persons whose TDS had been deducted but the TDS returns had not been filed by the Real Estate Company. It was found that during FY 2013-14, FY 2014-15 and FY 2015-16, amounts of Rs. 45,68,990/-, Rs. 35,45,290/- and Rs. 33,36,970/- were deducted by the assessee company. The assessee company was found to be defaulting on filing of TDS return statements.  

Taking into account all defaults, show cause notices were served upon the Director to explain why sanction for prosecution should not be granted under section 278B read with 276B of Income Tax Act for not complying with the provisions of the law in respect of non -deposition of the Income Tax deducted at source. However, during the proceedings, the assessee asked for repeated adjournments, instead of giving reasonable explanations for the defaults during the proceedings. Hence, it was concluded that there is no justifiable reason for the delay in depositing the TDS. This clearly showed the non-serious behaviour of the assessee towards the provisions of deduction and depositions of tax at source. Therefore, TDS Wing in exercise of powers under Section 279(1) of Income Tax Act sanctioned the filing of criminal complaint against the company as well as the Director under Section 276B read with 278B, 278E and 279 of the Act for FY 2013-14, FY 2014-15 and FY 2015-16 in 2017. 

Non-bailable warrant was issued against the Director in December 2017 for non-compliance with the case proceedings. The Non-bailable warrants returned to the court unexecuted with the report that accused is avoiding execution of the warrants. Hence, on 19 Jan 2018 accused was taken into custody and was remanded to judicial custody. The accused has been sent to Tihar Jail for the same.    

The Principle Chief Commissioner of Income Tax - Delhi, Shri.  S. S. Rathore stated that the Department is very serious about timely depositing of the TDS deducted by the employers. It is reiterated that the TDS is Government money which has to be deposited in Treasury on timely basis. Failure to deposit the tax deducted will lead to criminal prosecution with imprisonment from 3 months to 7 years. This year the Principal Chief Commissionerate - New Delhi has sanctioned prosecution in approximately 240 cases which clearly shows the strict attitude of Income Tax Department towards the defaulters.  The Principal Chief Commissioner - Income Tax - New Delhi has given a strong message to non-compliant tax payers that tax defaulters will find it difficult to escape from penalties and prosecutions from vigilant and proactive Income Tax Department and at the same time ensuring Best Taxpayer Friendly Services for the honest and compliant taxpayers.""

                The two main Reports of the 2017 India Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) – the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) and Financial Sector Assessment (FSA), were released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, respectively on their websites on December 21, 2017. In continuation, the IMF and the World Bank today released two Detailed Assessment Reports (DARs) relating to the 2017 India FSAP. The Report providing ‘Detailed Assessment of Observance—Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision’ has been released by the IMF and the World Bank and the Report providing ‘Detailed Assessment of Observance of Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) Central Counter Party (CCP) and Trade Repository (TR)’, was released by the World Bank.

India welcomes these Assessment Reports by the joint IMF-World Bank team conforming to the highest international standards.

The DAR on the observance of Basel Core Principles (BCP) commends the Reserve Bank of India for the remarkable progress in strengthening banking supervision since the last FSAP. It notes that the supervision and regulation by the Reserve Bank remain strong and have improved in recent years. Most of the Basel III framework (and related guidance) has been implemented and cooperation arrangements, both domestically and cross-border, are now firmly in place. It states that the system-wide asset quality review (AQR) and the strengthening of prudential regulations in 2015 testify to the authorities’ commitment to transparency and a more accurate recognition of banking risks. A special mention is made of the implementation of a risk-based supervisory approach, in particular the Supervisory Program for Assessment of Risk and Capital (SPARC); as also the phasing-in of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and large exposure limits and states that the recently established Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC), will provide RBI with a robust supervisory enforcement framework. It acknowledges that banking reforms, including the Indradhanush Plan for revitalizing the Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and the Bank Board Bureaus (BBBs) have helped usher in an era of transparency and improved discipline and will go a long way in resolving the problem of bad loans in India.

 The DAR on the BCP was prepared before the announcement of the recapitalization of Rs. 2.11 trillion (about US$32 billion) and the under-capitalization of PSBs mentioned in the Report has since been effectively addressed by this Plan.

                India and USA have signed the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) under FATCA in 2015. To enhance the effectiveness of information exchange and transparency, both the sides committed to establish, by January 1, 2017, rules requiring their Reporting Financial Institutions (RFIs) to obtain the Tax Identity Number (TIN) of each reportable person having a reportable account as of June 30, 2014 (pre-existing account).The Income-tax Rules, accordingly, provide for reporting of U.S. TIN from the year 2017 onwards in respect of any pre-existing account. 

The US-IRS has issued guidelines through Notice 2017-46dated 25.09.2017 providing relaxation to Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs) with respect to reporting of U.S.TIN for calendar years 2017, 2018 and 2019. Now the Competent Authority of USA will not determine significant non-compliance with the obligations under the IGA solely because of a failure of a reporting FFI to obtain and report each required U.S.TIN, provided that the reporting FFI: 

(i)   obtains and reports the date of birth of each account holder and controlling person whose U.S. TIN is not reported;

(ii) requests annually from each account holder any missing required U.S. TIN; and

(iii) before reporting information that relates to calendar year 2017 to the  partner jurisdiction, searches electronically searchable data maintained by the reporting FFI for any missing required U.S. TINs. 

The Indian RFIs reporting pre-existing accounts should, therefore, ensure that the U.S. TIN is reported in respect of pre-existing accounts for the year 2017 onwards. However, in case the U.S.TIN is not available, to avoid determination by the USA Competent Authority of significant non-compliance to the obligations of the IGA, the RFIs are advised to insert nine capital letters e.g. (i.e. AAAAAAAA) in the TIN field (for the Account Holder or Controlling Person, as the case may be), for such accounts in their reports in Form 61B, provided that all the three conditions listed above are met.

NCDEX Agri-Options in Guar Seed aim to provide farmers better engagement in the commodity markets.​ ​

NCDEX also launched Mandi.com, a mobile app for farmers where they can learn more about Options and the commodity markets.For a commodity trader or member of a Farmer Producer Organization( FPO), this would be an additional tool to hedge your price risk and optimize your profits with the launch of Agri-Options here today by the Union Finance Minister, Shri. Arun Jaitley, The First ever Agri-Options trade was executed in front of a panel of distinguished guests.

National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX) launched India’s first Agri-Options on guar seed futures in the presence of SEBI, WDRA, Industry Associations, Government Officials and FPO members. Farmers from various States across the country were present at the occasion to mark the commencement with a Live Trade by a farmer producer company.​ ​

Launched on the auspicious occasion of Makar Sankranti, this new hedging tool, Agri-Options:Ek Aur Kadam Kisan Pragati Ki Ore, is set to mark an important evolution in trading of agriculture commodities market. This instrument will give a strong impetus towards systematic development and transformation of commodity derivatives market in India, which will make the agri-economy more efficient and bring huge amount of value for the farmers of India.A Mandi.commobile application was also launched on the occasion, where farmers can learn more about agri-Options and the commodities market.

Elaborating on the benefits of Options, Shri Rabi Narayan Das, Chairman, NCDEX, said, “The long wait for agri-commodity Options has finally come to an end with the launch of agri-Options on NCDEX’s platform.Agri-Options will serve as a powerful tool to empower farmers by allowing them to lock in the prices of their produce at a minimum cost. It has the potential to transform Indian commodity market in a way that will benefit more farmers across the country for their hedging requirements. While, as of now, agri-Options is allowed in only one agri-commodity, we can expect more commodities under this over a period of time.” ​ ​

Gracing the occasion with a recorded video message, the Union Minister of Commerce & Industry Shri Suresh Prabhu welcomed the Agri-Options to the commodity market, He said that he congratulates NCDEX for taking this noble step, which will contribute towards empowering the farming community and will further strengthen the agricultural ecosystem.​ ​

Our journey to connect farmers to the market would not have been possible without the immense support of our stakeholders and value chain partners and I take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks to all those who have contributed to make this happen. This instrument will create a win-win situation for farmers irrespective of the price movement. We hope with this step we bring more and more PRAGATI for everyone.”​ ​

In order to offer the audience a thought-provoking discussion on Agri-commodity markets, a panel discussion was also conducted by NCDEX.

The panel discussed the role Agri-Options can play as a new age hedging tool in the hands of the farmers and will be a game changer in the Agri-Commodity markets. The speakers said working models in other countries need to be studied so that retail prices for consumers can come down.​ ​

For more than a decade, NCDEX has played a big role in developing agriculture ecosystem. It has put a lot of effort and brought in various technological innovations that have helped in providing wider network and market access to farmers and other stakeholders, better price discovery, reduced information asymmetry, provided tools to mitigate prices risks and increased overall efficiency and transparency in the system.

                The Union Finance & Corporate Affairs Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley will launch the country’s First Agri-commodity Options in Guar Seed tomorrow, Sunday, the 14th January,2018 in New Delhi in presence of farmers & Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) from various States across country. The country’s First Agri-commodity Options in Guar Seed to be launched tomorrow by the Union Finance Minister Shri Jaitley on the auspicious occasion of Makar Sankranti, is the unique first-of-its-kind hedging tool which will prove to be a game changer for the farmers.

 In an effort to make the agri-economy more efficient and bring huge amount of value for the farmers of India, the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX), is launching the country’s First agri-commodity Options in Guar Seed. NCDEX Guar seed options is an important hedging tool. Looking at its importance for the agri commodity markets, the new instrument will be launched on the auspicious occasion of Makar Sankranti, which is celebrated as a key harvest festival across the country.

 The instrument, which is uniquely designed by NCDEX and approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), is expected to deepen trade in that commodity and will benefit farmers in reaping improved price realizations for their produce, with limited downside risk. This launch is largely inspired by the fact that Guar Seed is one of the most liquid contracts on the NCDEX platform and a large number of informal trading Centres in some communities of Rajasthan are already involved in some form of informal options trading.

The Official Launch will also see farmers share their experiences on how NCDEX has helped better their lives. As of December 2017, NCDEX has already seen 59 FPOs across various States participate on the Exchange, and more than 2.3 lakh farmers have already opened their trading account. In order to promote awareness around this new agriculture hedging tool, the Exchange has initiated a series of awareness programs and trainings across the value chain. The Exchange will also launch a mobile application on this occasion where farmers can learn more about agri options and the commodities market.

                The Income Tax Department has accorded the highest priority to tackle the menace of black money. With this objective in mind, the Department has initiated criminal prosecution proceedings in a large number of cases of tax offenders and evaders.

Prosecutions have been initiated for various offences including wilful attempt to evade tax or payment of any tax; wilful failure in filing returns of income; false statement in verification and failure to deposit the tax deducted/collected at source or inordinate delay in doing so, among other defaults.

During FY 2017-18(upto the end of November, 2017), the Department filed Prosecution complaints for various offences in 2225 cases compared to 784 for the corresponding period in the immediately preceding year, marking an increase of 184%. The number of complaints compounded by the Department during the current FY (upto the end of November, 2017) stands at 1052 as against 575 in the corresponding period of the immediately preceding year, registering a rise of 83%. Compounding of offences is done when the defaulter admits to its offence and pays the compounding fee as per stipulated conditions.

Due to the decisive and focused action taken by the Department against tax evaders, the number of defaulters convicted by the courts has also registered a sharp increase during the current fiscal. 48 persons were convicted for various offences during the current year(upto the end of November, 2017) as compared to 13 convictions for the corresponding period in the immediately preceding year, marking an increase of 269%. 

A few illustrative cases are highlighted.


	A Dehradun Court convicted one defaulter for holding undisclosed foreign bank account and sentenced him to two years of imprisonment for wilful attempt to evade tax and to two years for false statement in verification alongwith monetary penalty for each default respectively. 
	The Court of CJM, Jalandhar convicted a cloth trader with 2 years rigorous imprisonment for trying to cheat the Department by fabricating affidavits and gift deeds, in connivance with his advocate and witness, with the motive of evading tax. The Court, while awarding the sentence to the trader, also simultaneously awarded one year's imprisonment to the advocate notarizing the forged affidavit and also to the witness for aiding and abetting the serious offence.
	In Bengaluru, the MD of a company engaged in infrastructure projects was found guilty of non-deposit of TDS of over Rs. 60 lakh(within the prescribed time), and was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of three months alongwith imposition of fine. Similarly, a Mohali resident was held guilty of non-deposit of TDS within prescribed time and sentenced to one year jail alongwith fine.
	In another case of Hyderabad, the Director of an infrastructure company was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of six months and fine for wilful attempt to evade tax. She was simultaneously sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for six months alongwith fine for false statement in verification. 
	The Economic Offences Court at Ernakulam sentenced an individual to rigorous imprisonment of three months for selling property to evade payment of taxes of about Rs. 76 lakh despite issuance of the tax recovery certificate by the Tax Recovery Officer. 
	In yet another case reported from Agra, the Special CJM convicted one defaulter with imprisonment of one year & six months for wilful attempt to evade tax and for false statement in verification respectively alongwith fine.


 

The Income Tax Department is committed to carry forward the drive against tax evasion and action against tax evaders will continue in all earnest in the remaining part of the current Financial Year.

                Due to intensive efforts undertaken by the Income Tax Department, provisional attachment has been made in more than 900 cases of properties under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act (the ‘Benami Act’), which came into force w.e.f 1st November, 2016.  These attachments include plots of land, flats, shops, jewellery, vehicles, deposits in bank accounts, fixed deposits etc. The value of properties under attachment is more than Rs. 3,500 crore including immovable properties of more than Rs. 2,900 crore.

In five cases, the provisional attachments of Benami properties, amounting to more than Rs. 150 crore have been confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority. In one such case, it was established that a Real Estate Company had acquired about 50 acres of land, valued at more than Rs.110 crore, using the names of certain persons of no means as benamidars. This was corroborated from the sellers of the land as well as the brokers involved. In another case, post demonetization, two assessees were found depositing demonetized currency into multiple bank accounts in the names of their employees, associates etc. to be ultimately remitted to their bank accounts. The total amount attempted to be remitted to the beneficial owners was about Rs. 39 crore. In yet another case, a cash amount of Rs. 1.11 crore was intercepted from a vehicle with a person who denied the ownership of this cash. Subsequently, no one claimed ownership of this cash and it was held to be benami property by the Adjudicating Authority.

 Earlier, the Income Tax Department had stepped-up actions under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act (the ‘Benami Act’. The Act provides for provisional attachment and subsequent confiscation of benami properties, whether movable or immovable. It also allows for prosecution of the beneficial owner, the benamidar and the abettor to benami transactions, which may result in rigorous imprisonment up to 7 years and fine upto 25% of fair market value of the property.

The Department had set-up 24 dedicated Benami Prohibition Units (BPUs) under its Investigation Directorates all over India in May, 2017 to ensure swift action in respect of Benami properties.

 The Department is committed to continue its concerted drive against black money and action against Benami transactions will continue to be intensified.

                Following is the text of the Article written by the Union Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley on Necessity of Electoral Bonds:

""India is the largest democracy in the world.  However, despite strengthening various institutions for the last seven decades, India has not been able to evolve a transparent political funding system.  Elections and political parties are a fundamental feature of Parliamentary democracy.  Elections cost money.  The round the year functioning of the political parties involves a large expenditure.  Parties run offices throughout the country.  Staff salaries, travelling expenses, establishment cost are regular expenditures of political parties.  There has not been a single year where election either for the Parliament or State Assemblies have not been held.  Besides expenditure of individual candidates, political parties have to spend money on election campaigns, publicity, tours, travels and election related establishments.  These expenditures run into hundreds of crores.  Yet there has not been a transparent funding mechanism of the political system. 

          The conventional system of political funding is to rely on donations.  These donations, big or small, come from a range of sources from political workers, sympathisers, small business people and even large industrialists.  The conventional practice of funding the political system was to take donations in cash and undertake these expenditures in cash.  The sources are anonymous or pseudonymous.  The quantum of money was never disclosed.  The present system ensures unclean money coming from unidentifiable sources.  It is a wholly non-transparent system.  Most political groups seem fairly satisfied with the present arrangement and would not mind this status-quo to continue.  The effort, therefore, is to run down any alternative system which is devised to cleanse up the political funding mechanism. 

          A major step was taken during the first NDA Government led by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.  The Income Tax Act was amended to include a provision that donations made to political parties would be treated as expenditure and would thus give a tax advantage to the donor.  If the political party disclosed its donations in a prescribed manner, it would also not be liable to pay any tax.  A political party was expected to file its returns both with the income-tax authorities and Election Commission.  It was hoped that donors would increasingly start donating money by cheque.  Some donors did start following this practise but most of them were reluctant to disclose the details of the quantum of donation given to a political party.  This was because they feared consequences visiting them from political opponents.  The law was further amended during the UPA Government to provide for “pass through” electoral trust so that the donors would park their money with the electoral trusts which in turn would distribute the same to various political parties.  Both these reforms taken together resulted in only a small fraction of the donations coming in form of cheques. 

          In order to make a serious effort to carry forward this reform process, I had announced in my Budget Speech for the year 2017-18 that the existing system would be substantially widened and donations of clean money could be made to political parties in several ways.  A donor could enjoy a tax deduction by donating in cheque.  Donors were also free to donate moneys online to political parties.  A cash donation to a political party could not exceed an amount of Rs.2000/-.  In addition, a scheme of electoral bonds was announced to enable clean money and substantial transparency being brought into the system of political funding.

          I do believe that donations made online or through cheques remain an ideal method of donating to political parties.  However, these have not become very popular in India since they involve disclosure of donor’s identity.  However, the electoral bond scheme, which I placed before the Parliament a few days ago, envisages total clean money and substantial transparency coming into the system of political funding.  A donor can purchase electoral bonds from a specified bank only by a banking instrument.  He would have to disclose in his accounts the amount of political bonds that he has purchased.  The life of the bond would be only 15 days.  A bond can only be encashed in a pre-declared account of a political party.  Every political party in its returns will have to disclose the amount of donations it has received through electoral bonds to the Election Commission.  The entire transactions would be through banking instruments.  As against a total non-transparency in the present system of cash donations where the donor, the donee, the quantum of donations and the nature of expenditure are all undisclosed, some element of transparency would be introduced in as much as all donors declare in their accounts the amount of bonds that they have purchased and all parties declare the quantum of bonds that they have received.  How much each donor has distributed to a political party would be known only to the donor.  This is necessary because once this disclosure is made, past experience has shown, donors would not find the scheme attractive and would go back to the less-desirable option of donating by cash.  In fact the choice has now to be consciously made between the existing system of substantial cash donations which involves total unclean money and is non-transparent and the new scheme which gives the option to the donors to donate through entirely a transparent method of cheque, online transaction or through electoral bonds.  While all three methods involve clean money, the first two are totally transparent and the electoral bonds scheme is a substantial improvement in transparency over the present system of no-transparency.

          The Government is willing to consider all suggestions to further strengthen the cleansing of political funding in India.  It has to be borne in mind that impractical suggestions will not improve the cash denominated system.  They would only consolidate it.""

                The existing provisions of section 115JB of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (‘the Act’), inter alia, provide, that, for the purposes of levy of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) in case of a company, the amount of loss brought forward or unabsorbed depreciation, whichever is less as per books of account shall be reduced from the book profit.

 

In this regard, representations have been received from various stakeholders that the companies against whom an application for corporate insolvency resolution process has been admitted by the Adjudicating Authority under section 7 or section 9 or section 10 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (‘the IBC’), are facing hardship due to restriction in allowance of brought forward loss for computation of book profit under section 115JB of the Act. 

 

With a view to minimize the genuine hardship faced by such companies, it has been decided, that, with effect from Assessment Year 2018-19 (i.e. Financial Year 2017-18), in case of a company, against whom an application for corporate insolvency resolution process has been admitted by the Adjudicating Authority under section 7 or section 9 or section 10 of the IBC, the amount of total loss brought forward (including unabsorbed depreciation) shall be allowed to be reduced from the book profit for the purposes of levy of MAT under section 115JB of the Act.

 

Appropriate legislative amendment in this regard will be made in due course.

                 Government announced Indradhanush plan for revamping Public Sector Banks (PSBs) in August 2015. The plan envisaged, inter alia, infusion of capital in PSBs by the Government to the tune of Rs. 70,000 crore over a period of four financial years. Government has recently announced decision to further recapitalise PSBs to the tune of Rs. 2,11,000 crore, through recapitalisation bonds of Rs. 1,35,000 crore and budgetary provision of Rs. 18,139 crore (the residual amount under Indradhanush plan) over two financial years, and the balance through capital raising by banks from the market. Government has so far infused capital of Rs. 59,435 crore in PSBs under Indradhanush.

 

Capital infusion is aimed at supplementing the achievement of regulatory capital norms by PSBs through their own efforts and, in addition, based on performance and potential, augmenting their growth capital. Government has announced that a differentiated approach would be followed, based on the strength of each bank.

 

 Under the State Bank of India Act, 1955 and the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Acts of 1970 and 1980, the Board of Directors of the bank is responsible for general superintendence, direction and management of the affairs and business of the bank. Further, Companies Act, 2013 provides that the directors of a company shall act in good faith and in the best interests of the company, its employees and the shareholders. Under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has the power to remove managerial and other persons from office for, inter alia, securing proper management of any banking company.

 

This was stated by Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                 ‘Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) was launched on 9th May, 2015 by the Government to provide accidental insurance cover. PMSBY provides accidental death/disability insurance cover of Rs. 2 Lakhs for an annual premium of Rs.12/-. Any person within the age group of 18-70 years having a bank account can enroll for PMSBY. The scheme is offered/ administered through Insurance Companies both public sector and private in tie-up with scheduled commercial banks / Regional Rural Banks / Cooperative Banks concerned.

 

 One of the challenges faced is lack of insurance awareness and providing the low cost PMSBY Insurance cover to common men, especially poor and the under-privileged sections of the society. The Government and Public Sector General Insurance Companies organized massive promotion campaign to create awareness amongst the greater section of population. Several steps have been taken in this regard such as creation of an exclusive website www.jansuraksha.gov.in, which hosts all relevant material / information including forms, rules etc. related to this scheme in english, hindi and regional languages. Further, banks and insurance companies have also organized camps and outreach efforts to facilitate access to the scheme. Banners displaying features of the scheme were also installed at all banks and insurance company branches. 

 

A wide Media based publicity campaign through Local/National Newspapers and advertisements on Television/Radio/ Internet was used to create awareness about the various aspects of the schemes. 

 

There is an improvement in the number of enrolments (auto-debit) under the Scheme from 8.85 crore in the year 2015-16 to 12.75 crore till 15th December 2017. All the accidental insurance policies being offered by different Central Government Departments have been converged to PMSBY w.e.f. 1st June 2017.

                            Government has taken several steps to mobilize funds from various sources, including from capital market, for development of infrastructure.

                 Periodic reviews of the extant regulatory framework and various issue related processes are undertaken by the securities market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), with an aim to improve the quality of public offerings (IPOs) and expanding their reach amongst investors. Several reforms have been undertaken by SEBI during the past few years to facilitate and expedite the complete process of launching IPOs like, enabling Registrar and Transfer Agents (RTAs) and Depository Participants (DPs) to accept application forms and make bids on the stock exchange platform, facilitation of more issuers to raise capital through the ‘Fast Track’ Route in respect of further public offers, inclusion of RBI registered systemically important NBFCs in the category of qualified institutional buyers etc. The process of issuance of observations on draft offer documents filed by merchant bankers for raising funds by the companies has been streamlined and the total time taken in the entire process has been reduced considerably. Average time taken by SEBI in processing draft offer documents (IPOs and Rights Issues) has reduced from 78 days in 2016-17 to 61 days in 2017-18 (April to December 2017).

 

  These measures have the potential, over a period of time, to lead to fair, transparent and orderly functioning of the securities market which would also ensure protection of the interest of the investors. These measures could also increase the efficiency of fund raising and reduce the cost of investment for investors. 

With effect from January 01, 2016, Application Supported by Block Amount (ASBA) mechanism was made mandatory payment mechanism in public issue for retail investors and the post issue timeline for listing was reduced from 12 days post closure of issue to 6 days. At present, SEBI is undertaking discussions with National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and other intermediaries associated with IPO process, to assess the feasibility of developing an alternate payment mechanism, which building upon the ASBA mechanism, could enhance the process efficiency in payment system and may curtail the post issue timeline for listing from existing six days.

 An efficient payment mechanism has the potential to reduce the time and cost associated with public issue process and reduce the market risk for shareholders by allowing faster unblocking of capital.

                As per the World Economic Situation and Prospects 2018 report of the United Nations, the Indian economy is projected to grow at 7.2 per cent in 2018-19 and 7.4 per cent in 2019-20. The report indicates that the outlook for India remains largely positive, underpinned by robust private consumption and public investment as well as ongoing structural reforms. 

            Share of public sector (including public financial and non-financial corporations and general government) in total Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) increased from 21.4 per cent in 2011-12 to 22.0 per cent in 2014-15 and further to 25.2 per cent in 2015-16 (the latest year for which data is available). The share of public GFCF in GDP at current prices increased from 6.7 per cent in 2014-15 to 7.4 per cent in 2015-16. From the demand side, the contribution of Public sector GFCF to GDP growth was about 20 per cent in 2015-16. 

            The confidence in the Indian economy has increased on account of policy measures taken up by the government and Reserve Bank of India. Recently, Moody’s rating agency upgraded India’s local and foreign currency issuer rating to Baa2 with a stable outlook from Baa3 on the expectation that continued progress in India’s economic reforms will enhance India’s growth potential over time. According to World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business 2018 Report, India’s ranking improved by 30 positions to 100th rank in 2018. As per the World Economic Forum, India’s rank in Global Competitiveness Index is 40 out of 137 countries in 2017-18, improvement over 71 out of 144 countries in 2014-15 and 55 out of 140 countries in 2015-16.

Government has launched the ‘Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY)’ to provide social security during old age and to protect elderly persons aged 60 and above against a future fall in their interest income due to uncertain market conditions. The scheme enables old age income security for senior citizens through provision of assured pension/return linked to the subscription amount based on government guarantee to Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). 

The scheme provides an assured return of 8% per annum for 10 years. The differential return, i.e. the difference between return generated by LIC and the assured return of 8% per annum would be borne by Government of India as subsidy on an annual basis. Pension is payable at the end of each period during the policy tenure of 10 years as per the frequency of monthly/quarterly/ half-yearly/yearly as chosen by the subscriber at the time of purchase. Minimum purchase price under the scheme is Rs.1,50,000/- for a minimum pension of Rs. 1,000/- per month and the maximum purchase price is Rs.7,50,000/- for a maximum pension of Rs.5,000/- per month. The scheme is exempted from Goods and Services Tax (GST). The scheme is open for subscription till 3rd May 2018.

Senior Citizens Savings Scheme, 2014 is a deposit scheme for individuals who have attained the age of 60 years. However, persons retiring on superannuation or under any Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) who have attained the age of 55 years and retiring defense personnel who have attained the age of 50 years can also open the account subject to certain conditions. The upper limit of investment under this Scheme is rupees fifteen lakh. The rate of interest under the scheme for the quarter 01.01.2018 to 31.03.2018 is 8.3%. The deposits made in the scheme are exempt from income tax under section 80C of Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the interest earned on the deposit is not exempt from income tax. Provisions of Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) are applicable to the Scheme.

This was stated by Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                Rationale for the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017

There is no comprehensive and integrated legal framework for resolution, including liquidation, of financial firms in India presently.


	
	The powers and responsibilities for resolution of financial services providers are given under multiple laws to regulators, Government and the Courts, which does not facilitate development of specialised resolution capabilities. Also, because of this dispersed role definition, resolution of financial conglomerates becomes difficult. 
	
	
	The resolution instruments presently available under the respective legislations are limited, and so is guidance on the process leading up to the resolution. For example, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is empowered to take certain resolution actions with respect to banks, branches of foreign banks in India, and cooperative banks. However, these resolution powers are quite limited. RBI can effect change in bank management, or impose moratorium and recommend mandatory mergers. In the case of a bank, typically either of the two methods of resolution has been used, that is, amalgamation or merger of a weak bank with another bank; or winding up of the bank. Other resolution instruments are not available. 
	
	
	The Central Government has the power to restructure public sector banks, and regional rural banks. Non-banking financial companies can be liquidated or wound up under law by High Courts only, either voluntarily or on the application of RBI. Resolution regimes for insurance companies, financial market infrastructure, and other financial services providers are also quite inadequate. The current resolution regime is especially inappropriate for private sector financial firms in the light of significant expansion of private financial firms and many of these acquiring systemically important status in India. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 has introduced in the country a comprehensive resolution regime for mainly non-financial firms, but such a regime is not available in the country for financial firms.   

	The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017 (FRDI Bill) will replace the existing resolution regime by providing a comprehensive resolution regime that will help ensure that, in the rare event of failure of a financial service provider, there is a system of quick, orderly and efficient resolution in favour of depositors. 
	



	
	The impact of failures of financial services providers is much wider and can have a systemic effect on the economy and financial stability of a country, unlike traditional insolvency, where the affected parties are mostly limited to the creditors of the insolvent entity. Since financial service providers handle consumer funds, some of them are critical for financial stability, and therefore, it is important to resolve failing financial service providers expeditiously through a specialised resolution process, as lengthy resolution proceedings can lead to losses for consumers, or instability in the financial system.
	
	
	The FRDI Bill proposes to  establish a Resolution Corporation and a comprehensive resolution regime to enable timely and orderly resolution of a failing financial firm. Such institutional framework for expeditious resolution of financial firms exists in most other comparable countries. Further, it is favourable for depositors if in case of bank failures, a bank is resolved rather than liquidated, because the depositors are expected to get a much higher value in resolution of the bank as a going concern than in liquidation.
	
	
	It provides for detecting incipient insolvencies in financial firms by introducing a five-stage health classification of financial firms and stepping in to appropriately nurse a financial firm at the stage when its health becomes weak and it is classified in the category of material risk to viability, much before it is it is classified in the category of critical risk to viability when there might be no option but to resolve or liquidate the financial firm.  
	
	
	FRDI Bill also introduces a menu of resolution tools, including transfer of whole or parts of the assets and liabilities of a financial firm to another person, acquisition, merger or amalgamation, bridge service provider, and bail-in, and mandates recovery and resolution planning obligations to enable careful monitoring of risk to viability of a financial firm.
	
	
	The FRDI Bill also transfers the deposit insurance functions from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation to the Resolution Corporation, targeting at an integrated approach to the depositor protection and resolution. 

	Protection and enhancement of depositors’ rights under the FRDI Bill 

	The FRDI Bill does not modify present protections to the depositors adversely at all. The FRDI Bill provides only additional protections to the depositors in a more transparent manner, the details of which are as follows.

	 
	



	
	At present, deposits with banks are insured upto Rs. 1 lakh. The similar protection would continue under the FRDI Bill and the Resolution Corporation is empowered to increase the deposit insurance amount.
	
	
	The uninsured depositors, that is, beyond Rs. 1 lakh, of a banking company are treated on par with unsecured creditors under the present law and paid after preferential dues, including Government dues, in the event of its liquidation. As per the provisions of the FRDI Bill, the claims of uninsured depositors in the case of liquidation of a bank will be higher than those of the unsecured creditors and Government dues. Therefore, the rights of uninsured depositors will be better protected and such depositors will have an elevated status in the FRDI Bill compared to the existing legal arrangements.
	
	
	Thus, the interests of depositors (both insured and uninsured) would be better protected under the FRDI Bill. 

	Bail-in provision 

	Indian Banks have adequate capital and are also under prudent regulation and supervision to ensure safety and soundness, as well as systemic stability. The existing laws ensure the integrity, security and safety of the banking system. In India, all possible steps and policy measures are taken to prevent the failure of banks and protection of interests of depositors (e.g. issue of directions  / prompt corrective action measures, capital adequacy and prudential norms). 

	Bail in has been proposed as one of the resolution tools in the event a financial firm is sought to be sustained by resolution. Certain misgivings have been expressed in the media, especially social media, regarding the depositor protection in the context of “bail-in” provisions of the FRDI Bill. These misgivings are entirely misplaced. The Government always stands ready to take care of the capital needs of the public sector banks. Bail-in amounts to liabilities’ holders bearing a part of the cost of resolution by reduction in their claims. Bail-in is only one of many resolution tools in the FRDI Bill; others are acquisition, merger and bridge service provider, and is to be used either singly or in combination with other tools. Bail in provision may not be required to be used in case of any specific resolution. Most certainly, it will not be used in case of a public sector bank as such a contingency is not likely to arise. 

	Following formal safeguards have been built in the FRDI Bill pertaining to the appropriate use of bail-in, whereas the rights or interests of depositors can be, inter-alia, reduced in case of forced merger of a banking company with another bank under the present law without these explicit safeguards. 
	



	
	Insured deposits of banks can not be used in case of bail-in.
	
	
	The Resolution Corporation will have the option to design an appropriate bail-in instrument, which will be subject to Government scrutiny and oversight of the Parliament.
	
	
	Cancellation of the liability of the depositor beyond insured amount will be possible only with the prior consent of the depositor. On the other hand, in case of the forced mergers of banks under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the right of depositors of a merging bank (transferor bank) can be reduced and has been reduced, without the consent of depositors.
	
	
	Bail-in power can be used in a judicious and reasonable manner only by the Resolution Corporation and it will have to ensure that all creditors, including uninsured depositors, get at least such value, which they would have received in the event of liquidation of a bank. In case of injudicious and unreasonable exercise of bail-in power by the Resolution Corporation, for example, where the depositors of a bank get less value than in liquidation, such affected depositors will have the right to get compensation from the Resolution Corporation on an order of the National Company Law Tribunal. 

	The FRDI Bill does not prohibit the Government from extending support to banks 

	The FRDI Bill does not propose in any way to limit the scope of powers for the Government to extend financing and resolution support to banks, including public sector banks. Government’s implicit guarantee for solvency of public sector banks remains unaffected as the Government remains committed to adequately capitalise the public sector banks and improve their financial health. The Government is committed to protecting the existing protection to depositors and providing additional protection to them. 

	Examination of the FRDI Bill by the Joint Committee of Parliament on FRDI Bill 

	The FRDI Bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha on August 10, 2017, is presently under the consideration of the Joint Committee of the Parliament, which is consulting all the stakeholders on the provisions of the FRDI Bill. The Joint Committee of Parliament has been asked to submit their Report to the Parliament by the last day of the Budget Session, 2018. The Government is awaiting the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Parliament in regard to the FRDI Bill and would favourably consider the recommendations.

                The Hon. President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, launched the Pulse Polio programme for 2018 by administering polio drops to children less than five years old, at the Rahstrapati Bhawan, in the presence of the Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Shri J P Nadda and Ministers of State (Health) Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Smt. Anupriya Patel, here today. The Hon. President administered the polio drops on the eve of the National Immunization Day, which is observed tomorrow. More than 17 crore children of less than five years across the country will be given polio drops as part of the drive of Government of India to sustain polio eradication from the country.

Speaking at the function, the Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare Shri J P Nadda said, “We need to remain vigilant and maintain the population immunity and sensitive surveillance till global polio eradication happens as poliovirus is still circulating in other parts of the world which may reinfect us.”  Shri Nadda further stated that the Government is making all the possible efforts to protect children from more and more diseases. “It is important that all vaccines under the programme reache to every last child of our country,” he added. In order to mitigate the risk of poliovirus importation, the immunity against polio infection is maintained through National and Sub-National Polio rounds along with sustained high quality polio surveillance. To provide additional protection to our children, Government of India has also introduced the injectable Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) into its routine immunization program, Shri Nadda stated. 

Shri J P Nadda pointed out that Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is focusing on to protect children from more diseases than ever before and has introduced several new vaccines like Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, Rotavirus vaccine, and Measles-Rubella in the recent past. “To further strengthen and accomplish our goals we have launched Mission Indradhanush and encouraged by its success, we have recently intensified the mission in October, 2017 to achieve more than 90% full immunization coverage by 2018,” Shri Nadda elaborated.

Shri Nadda further informed that strengthening of immunization programme has significantly contributed to the decline of Infant Mortality Rate from 39 in 2014 to 34 per 1000 live births in 2016 (as per SRS reports).

The Health Minister also appreciated the efforts of State Governments and the supporting organizations like WHO, UNICEF and Rotary International etc., for strengthening the efforts of the Government not only for polio programme but also for other initiatives in immunization. He also applauded the efforts of the thousands of volunteers, frontline workers, health officials across thestatesfor their tireless efforts in keeping the country polio-free.

Also present at the function were Smt. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW), senior officers of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and representatives of development partners.

                 Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for his un-daunting support to the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA), as the programme crossed one crore mark in antenatal check-ups. The Union Health Minister stated that Hon’ble Prime Minister of India had envisioned that 9th of every month, symbolizing the 9 months of pregnancy, should be dedicated to pregnant women. The PMSMA programme was launched in 2016 to fulfil his vision and ensure comprehensive and quality antenatal checkups to pregnant women across India.  “More than one crore antenatal check-ups have been conducted under the ambitious Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA), which has provided quality antenatal checkups to pregnant women on the 9th of every month. Now safe pregnancy has become a social movement in our country,” Shri Nadda added.

Expressing satisfaction, Shri Nadda further stated that that the programme has been successful in reaching out to the difficult and remote areas of India, since out of the 1 crore checkups across the country, more than 25 lakh check-ups were conducted in high priority districts identified by the Health Ministry for focussed attention. “While all States/ UTs have made significant efforts to reach out to pregnant women, Maharashtra has reported the largest number of check-ups among the Non-Empowered Action Group (EAG) States and Rajasthan has reported the largest number of check-ups among the Empowered Action Group States.  All pregnant women visiting the PMSMA sites are examined by an obstetrician/ physician and appropriately investigated,” Shri Nadda elaborated.

Shri J.P Nadda also expressed his heartfelt gratitude to all doctors from the public and private sectors, for responding to the call of Hon’ble Prime Minister and making this remarkable milestone possible. He also urged all the doctors to continue their commitment, ‘IPledgefor9’ and boost the chance of further reducing maternal and infant mortality in the country.

It may be noted, that in the 31st July 2016 episode of Mann Ki Baat, Hon’ble Prime Minister had urged private sector doctors to dedicate 12 days in a year to this programme and provide voluntary services under PMSMA on the 9th of every month.  There are more than 12,800 government health facilities across States/ UTs where PMSMA sessions are conducted on the 9th of every month and pregnant women receive fixed-day assured, comprehensive and quality antenatal care in their second and third trimesters. More than 4,800 private sector doctors have pledged to provide voluntary service under PMSMA. More than 385 private sector volunteers have provided services in the high priority districts such as Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh. Several of these volunteers have provided free services at nearby government health facilities more than 10 times in the past months. 

There are several instances where private sector doctors have gone beyond the expectations to serve in remote areas. For example, Dr Pooja Upadhyay, a well-known gynecologist of Raipur turned down the travel support offered by the government and, instead, travelled all the way to Narayanpur, a remote left-wing affected district at her own expense to provide services under PMSMA.  

Comprehensive and quality ANC, and identification and follow-up of high risk pregnancies are critical components of the Abhiyan. In order to enable early detection of high risk pregnancies, 84 lakh haemoglobin tests, 55 lakh HIV tests, 41 lakh tests for gestational diabetes, 33 lakh tests for syphilis and more than 15 lakh ultrasounds have been conducted under the programme based on the individual requirements of pregnant women. Based on the clinical conditions and investigations, over 5.50 lakh pregnant women were identified as high risk pregnancies and referred to a specialist or a higher health facility for appropriate care. Identifying high risk pregnancies is the first step towards saving mothers and infants from preventable deaths. 

“India is committed to reducing preventable maternal deaths through concerted efforts and public –private partnership. The PMSMA has reached one crore mark with the commitment from doctors in the government sector across States/ UTs and with the help of the large number of private sector doctors who have voluntarily pledged for this initiative,” Shri Nadda stated.

The Hon’ble President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind delivering the Convocation Address at the 45th Convocation of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), at New Delhi today said,  “the name ""AIIMS” has become a byword for quality, commitment and rich experience. The faculty and doctors, as well as the students, are the pride of our medical fraternity and our nation.” The Hon’ble President further stated that patients and their families have great trust in the doctors.  “It is upon you to ensure that the trust is given due respect and that you treat them with care and compassion,” the Hon’ble President added. Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, and President of AIIMS, New Delhi was also present at the occasion, and awarded degrees to 572 graduating students.

Appreciating the efforts of the Health Ministry, the Hon’ble President said that by launching programmes like Mission Indradhanush, the Health Ministry is urgently trying to fill the immunisation gap and protecting all children from killer diseases. As a word of caution, the Hon’ble President stated that in our country, both obesity and malnutrition are substantial public health issues. “And in our country, we have a very large child population as well as one of the world’s largest populations of senior people. Both these groups pose very different but very real challenges to our healthcare system and our doctors and nurses”, he stated.

The Union Health Minister Shri J P Nadda congratulated all the students and said innovation for low cost effective and affordable healthcare is the need of the day. To take up all these challenge AIIMS is strengthening and expanding its facilities and Government of India is fully supporting this. He further said that the brand of AIIMS is recognized and respected the world over and every student educated at AIIMS has the potential to become a leader in their chosen area. A considerable number of AIIMS alumni have already demonstrated leadership in making our world a better place, he stated. 

Speaking at the function, Shri Nadda said that in order to protect each and every child in the country from vaccine preventable diseases, the government has launched ‘Mission Indradhanush’ special immunization drives in 2014, to fully immunize all children and pregnant women across the country. “So far, more than 3.2 crore beneficiaries have been immunized. From 1% annual increase in full immunization, ‘Mission Indradhanush’ has resulted in 6.7% of annual expansion. Recently released SRS data has indicated a steep decline in Under 5 Mortality Rate (U5MR) from 49 in 2013 to 39 in 2016,” Shri Nadda added.

Shri Nadda said that it’s a great challenge to produce high quality healthcare providers at all levels. We need the teachers and academicians to develop such human resources in health. In this regard, the country has a lot of expectation from all of you. “To address these challenges we have undertaken reforms like setting up of more medical and nursing schools, introduction of National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) to get rid of multiple entrance exam and ensure greater transparency & better standard, reforms in MCI and DNB regulations have helped in taking the total number of PG & DNB seats to more than 37,000, to name a few”, the Health Minister stated.  

Shri J P Nadda also presented lifetime achievement awards to eminent professionals in the field of medical science, and medals and prizes to meritorious students. The recipients of lifetime achievement award for 45th Annual Convocation are Dr. Purushottam Upadhyaya, Prof. Lalit Mohan Nath, Prof. Usha Nayar,   Dr. Meharban Singh, Prof. Indira Nath and Prof. M C Maheshwari.

                Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare expressed happiness over the just released SRS bulletin (2016) as India registered a significant decline in under-five child mortality. According to the bulletin, under-five child mortality (U5MR) of India showed an impressive decline by 9%, a 4 points decline from 43 per 1000 in 2015 to 39 in 2016. The rate of decline has doubled over the last year. Not only this, number of under-five deaths for the first time in the country have come down to below 1 million with nearly 120,000 fewer under-five deaths in 2016 as compared to 2015. Most of the states have shown good progress in reduction of under-five child mortality from the previous year, except Chattisgarh, Delhi and Uttarakhand, which have shown a slight increase over the previous year and Telangana, which has shown no change in 2016.

Congratulating all those associated with this remarkable feat,  Shri Nadda stated that the results signify that the strategic approach of the Government is yielding dividends and the efforts of focusing on low performing states is paying off. He stated that India with the current rate of decline of U5MR is on track to meet the SDG target for under-five child mortality of 25 by 2030. The Health Minister further said that under the visionary leadership and guidance of the Hon. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji, the government is committed to advancing the agenda of Universal Health Coverage in the country and its initiatives like Mission Indradhanush and Intensified Mission Indradhanush, with their focused approach, are significantly turning the tide in favour of India.

Shri Nadda said that these remarkable achievements in merely one year are the result of countrywide efforts to increase the health service coverage through various initiatives of the Government that include strengthening of service delivery; quality assurance; RMNCH+A interventions; strengthening human resources and community processes; information and knowledge; drugs and diagnostics, and supply chain management, etc.

According to the SRS Bulletin, the gender gap in India for child survival is reducing steadily; the gender difference between female and male under-five mortality rates has now reduced to 11% which was as high as 17% in 2014. The current under-five mortality for male child is 37 per 1000, while for female child is 41 per 1000 live births. Amongst the bigger states, seven states (Chattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, MP, Odisha, Tamil Nadu Telangana) have reversed the gender gap in survival of female child, while four of these have reversed the gender gap for under-five survival. These are Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. 

Telangana, West Bengal, Odisha, Punjab and Delhi have depicted less than 5% gap in mortality of female child and are within striking distance to reverse the gender gap. The maximum gender gap in survival of under-five for female child is in Bihar (46% higher mortality for female child), followed by Haryana (23%), Kerala (20%), Assam, Karnataka (19%) and Rajasthan (17%). 

Further, the SRS Bulletin also shows that the neonatal mortality rate has reduced by 1 point from 25 per 1000 live births to 24 per 1000.

                “Central Government is providing support to the tune of Rs. 482 crore for the States. As many as 45 State labs are to be strengthened. I request the States to come forward with the proposals or give us the plan for strengthening the laboratories.”This was stated by Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare as he presided over the ‘First Health Ministers Roundtable on Food Safety & Nutrition’ organized by FSSAI, here today. Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MoS (Health) along with the Health Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Telangana, Puducherry, Jharkhand and Delhi were also present at the roundtable.

Shri J P Nadda further stated that finance will not be a constraint and each State should have at least one government food laboratory of high quality with bigger States having at least two. Citing the example of Pradhan Mantri Dialysis Program, the Health Minister said that initially states expressed some apprehensions about this initiative however today the programme is a huge success. “More than 1.76 lakhs patients have availed free services from 539 Dialysis Units across the country, Shri J P Nadda added.

Speaking on the enforcement of food standards, Shri Nadda said that there should be fairness and transparency in enforcement. “We must safeguard public health by ensuring all food businesses are licensed and follow standards. At the same time, we should be careful that it does not put unnecessary regulatory burden on the food businesses”, Shri Nadda said. Emphasizing on generating awareness, Shri Nadda said that sensitization is a major area to work for and FSSAI can provide support in this so that people opt for self-regulation. 

Shri J P Nadda further mentioned that the focus should shift from disease and treatment centred healthcare to preventive and promotive healthcare. Moving towards this, the Government has announced transforming 1.5 lakh sub health centres to ‘Health and Wellness’ centres. Shri Nadda further stated that in a step towards provision of comprehensive primary care, the Government has initiated universal screening of common NCDssuch as diabetes, hypertension and common cancers at the sub-centre and Primary Health Centre.“This will enable the strengthening of preventive and promotive health, improve patient referral and access to secondary care services, ShriNadda added.

Speaking at the function, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MoS (Health) stated that promoting and building the mechanisms for availability and consumption of Safe & Nutritious Food is central to attainment of the goals laid out in the National Health Policy 2017 which focuses on “promotive and preventive health care” and targets to reduce disease burden and premature mortality through Non-Communicable Disease like Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases among others. He further said that carrying out IEC and outreach efforts to create awareness in people about safe food & nutrition at schools, workplace, etc is central to avoiding food borne disease related morbidity & mortality and consequent savings in healthcare.

Smt Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health) assured support to the States through NHM. She further stated that we all aware of the rising incidence of non-communicable diseases in our country. Promoting healthy dietary habits amongst citizens is a key step to address it. “We must work together to inspire greater public confidence about food and nudge people to eat safe and eat right so that we can a healthier nation”, she stated.

The Union Health Minister also released framework for ‘Clean Street Food Hubs’ and ‘Safe and Hygienic Food Festivals’. These two initiatives would help to build capacities of street food vendors and will go a long way to inspire citizens’ trust in unorganized street food vending. The Minister also released FSSAI’s ‘Healthy India Food Calendar’. First of its kind, this calendar covers India’s main festivals, the food associated with them and their nutritional benefits. FSSAI’s new look website with focus on its key stakeholders was also launched today. 

During the round table, a team of researchers, who have carried out a rapid assessment of economic costs of food borne diseases in India, shared their findings. According to them, food borne diseases impose a huge economic burden on India. As per their estimates, this would amount to as much as 0.5 percent of India’s GDP or about 28 billion USD. 

During the Round table, the State Health Ministers assured to work towards creating a culture of self-compliance amongst food businesses by helping them build internal capacities, focus on third party audit, making enforcement transparent, standardized, predictable and fair by adopting a digital compliance platform, encouraging rating and fair competition amongst food businesses. States agreed to strengthen the food safety machinery and the state food lab system in their respective States. 

During the Round table, the State Health Ministers adopted a joint resolution with a seven-point charter. This includes – 1) supporting development of robust food standards and code of practices for safe food; 2) creating a positive regulatory environment; 3) establishing a credible and robust national food testing system; 4) addressing micronutrient deficiencies and promoting healthy dietary habits; 5) bringing about large-scale social and behavioral change in citizens on safe and nutritious food; 6) building a culture of self-compliance in food businesses; and 7) developing effective institutions and institutional arrangements backed with competent human resources and adequate financial resources.

Also present at the Roundtable were State Health Secretaries and Food Safety Commissioners from the States, Senior officials from Ministry of HRD, Health and Family Welfare and Women and Child Development, FSSAI, industry associations, World Bank, WHO and World Food Programme, and development partners such as Tata Trusts, GAIN and PATH participated.

                The Committee on Subordinate Legislation (COSL) 16th Lok Sabha, on the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Amendment Rules, 2014, in its 11th Report felt a need for framing a “National Tobacco Control Policy” which should be equitable and pragmatic. An Inter-Ministerial Committee of Secretaries has been constituted at the national level.

The onus of enforcing various provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA 2003), lies with the States/Union Territories.

National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) was launched by this Ministry in 2007-08 with one such objective of ensuring effective implementation of the provisions under COTPA, 2003.

There are State and District Level Coordination Committees under NTCP to oversee its implementation. Quarterly Reports submitted by the States/Union Territories during each Financial Year and review meetings with States/UTs constitute the monitoring mechanism for implementation of the Programme. In addition, the States submit their annual activities conducted in their States through Programme Implementation Plan (PIP) process and the same are examined by National Tobacco Control Cell. Further, the implementation of the Programme is being discussed during the meetings of National Programme Coordination Committee (NPCC).

This Ministry has written letter to States/Union Territories to consider developing a mechanism to provide permission/authorization through Municipal Authority/Local Authority to the retail shops who are selling tobacco products with a condition/provision in the authorization that the shops authorized for selling tobacco products, cannot sell any non-tobacco product such as toffees, candies, chips, biscuits, soft-drinks, etc., which are essentially meant for children.

As per Section 6 (a) of COTPA, 2003 read with Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Amendment Rules, 2011, there is prohibition on sale of tobacco products to and by persons below the age of 18 years and as per Section 6 (b) of COTPA, 2003, there is prohibition on sale of tobacco products in an area within a radius of one hundred yards of any educational institution.

It is evident from the Quarterly Reports received under COTPA, 2003 from States/Union Territories that there is violation of this Section and accordingly action is being taken through imposing fine on violators.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                The Health Ministry has notified Electronic Health Record (EHR) Standards Version 2016 for India in December 2016 (whilst the earlier version of EHR Standards was notified in September 2013) with an intent to bring standardisation and homogeneity, inter-operability in capture, storage, transmission & use of healthcare information across various Health IT systems.

Efforts are being made with the healthcare providers and other stakeholders for adoption of these standards. All the States/UTs Government have also been advised to adopt the EHR Standards in all the IT applications in healthcare with support under National Health Mission.

With the advent of the envisaged system of EHRs of citizens in an inter-operable manner pan-nation, online availability and accessibility would be ensured. This would facilitate continuity of care, better health outcome and better decision support system and is expected to help in reducing expenditure on avoidable repetitive and similar diagnostic tests.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.

                Under National Health Mission (NHM) technical and financial support is provided to the States/UTs to strengthen their health systems, including support for provision of healthcare services through Public  Private Partnership, based on the requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Annual Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelop. Under NHM States are encouraged to contract in or outsource those services - which improve efficiency and quality of care in public health facilities or close critical gaps - to the private sector, based on their felt needs.

  
Towards this, based on consultation with States and other stakeholders, under NHM, guidelines for provision of healthcare services under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode have been circulated to the States/UTs for:

A report published in Lancet Global Health Medical Journal mentions about 1.56 crore abortions took place across India in 2015. The study is based on a sample of six states and is not representative of the country. 

The Government provides safe and comprehensive abortion care (CAC) services to women in health facilities. There are various reasons for unsafe abortions like confidentiality, stigma, need for anonymity, provider bias, self-medication etc. Disaggregated data on various methods of abortion is unavailable.

All efforts have been made to provide CAC services in health facilities. Provision of comprehensive safe abortion care services is an important component of RMNCH+A program under Govt. of India.  

 

National Health Mission (NHM) provides support to the states for provision of services for comprehensive abortion in the following ways: 


	Guidelines on Comprehensive Abortion care services and Medical Methods of Abortions (MMA) have been provided to all the States in the country to facilitate the implementation of these services.
	Provision of comprehensive safe abortion services at public health facilities including 24*7 PHCs/ FRUs (DHs/ SDHs /CHCs).
	Provision of funds to States/ UTs for operationalisation of safe abortion services at health facilities including procurement of equipment and drugs for medical abortion.
	Capacity Building of Medical officers in Safe Abortion Techniques and of ANMs, ASHAs and other field level functionaries to provide confidential counseling for safe abortion and promote post-abortion care including adoption of contraception.  
	Certification of private and NGO sector facilities to provide quality Comprehensive abortion care services.
	Supply of Nischay Pregnancy detection kits to sub centres for early detection ofpregnancy.
	Provision of Funds to States to plan and implement comprehensive “Information Education & Communication/ Behaviour Change Communication (IEC/BCC)” activities for maternal health including safe abortion care.
	Orientation/Training of ASHAs to equip them with skills to create awareness on Comprehensive abortion care issues in women in the community and facilitate women in accessing services.
	Under the Family Planning programme for post abortion cases, steps have been taken to increase the basket of choices of contraceptive services and family planning counseling services to the beneficiaries.

                For the purposes of food safety, production and testing of food products is regulated under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Rules and Regulations made thereunder.  Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) had undertaken a baseline survey of 72 State/Public Food Laboratories in 2013-14. During the survey, it was found that 62 state food testing laboratories were functional and that there was shortage of testing facilities in the majority of state food testing labs across the country. Further, the gap study indicated that in the state food testing laboratories, there is an urgent need to upgrade these laboratories both in terms of testing infrastructure, availability of trained scientific and technical manpower for food testing and putting in place a more reliable laboratory management and operating procedure.  Accordingly, FSSAI has rolled out a Central Sector Scheme for ‘Strengthening of Food Testing System in the Country including Provision of Mobile Food Testing Labs’ (SOFTeL) with a total outlay of Rs. 481.95 Crore to be implemented during 2016-17 to 2018-19. The Scheme comprises , inter alia, of the following components:


	Strengthening of about 45 state food  testing laboratories;
	Strengthening of about 12 referral food testing laboratories;
	Establishment of  about 62  mobile food testing labs;
	Capacity Building of food testing laboratories personnel. 


Under the said Scheme, grant is being provided to the State/Union Territory Governments and referral laboratories towards procurement of high–end equipments. So far, 23 state food testing laboratories from 22 States/UTs and 5 referral laboratories have been assisted. Similarly, 19 mobile food testing laboratories (now called Food Safety on Wheels) have been provided to 17 States/UTs for training, testing and surveillance. FSSAI has also conducted 25 training programmes in association with Government institutions, International bodies and Private Laboratories for lab personnel.   Further, FSSAI has notified 142 mostly Private NABL accredited laboratories across India for purposes of primary testing to strengthen the food testing infrastructure.

As per the latest Registrar General of India- Sample Registration System (RGI-SRS) Report (Special Bulletin on Maternal Mortality in India 2011-13); the Maternal Mortality ratio(MMR) of India is 167 per 100,000 live births.

The key steps taken under the National Health Mission (NHM) are:

v Every pregnant woman is given iron and folic acid, after the first trimester, to be taken 1 tablet daily till delivery and same is continued during the post-natal period. Pregnant women, who are found to be clinically anaemic, are given additional 1 tablet for taking two tablets daily. This has been now expanded to 6 months during ANC and 6 months during PNC.

In addition, the States have been suggested to conduct periodic prescription audits in private sector which could also be extended to public sector.

·         Government of India also has written vide OM M.12015/182/2015-MCH to Federation of Obstetrical and Gynecologists in India (FOGSI) to share the WHO statement among the Obstetricians and Gynecologists under the umbrella of FOGSI.

·         The Government of India has enacted the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 with the objective of registration and regulation of health care institutions including those in the private sector.

·         All CGHS empanelled hospitals are directed to display the information regarding ratio of deliveries by caesarean section vis-à-vis normal deliveries. A communication was sent in this regard vide OM Z15025/2017 to all the CGHS empanelled hospitals.

                 As informed by Lady Harding Medical College (LHMC), one study has been conducted as part of MD Thesis in department of Community Medicine 2014-2017 at Kalyanpuri Urban Health Centre (under LHMC) in association with Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital (under GNCT, Delhi).  As per this study the mean per capita annual expenditure on diabetes care is Rs.8958.00  

Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility of providing accessible, affordable and quality healthcare lies with the respective State Governments.  Under National Health Mission, to reduce out of pocket expenditure on healthcare, support is being provided to States/UTs for strengthening of their healthcare system based on the requirements posed by them in their Programme Implementation Plans.

Government of India is implementing National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) under the National Health Mission. The objectives of the programme include awareness generation, providing diagnosis and treatment facilities through different levels of healthcare by setting up NCD Clinics in District Hospitals and Community Health Centres (CHCs). 

For early diagnosis, population level initiative of prevention, control and screening of common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer) has been rolled out in over 100 districts of the country in 2017-18 under.  This will help in early diagnosis/treatment leading to reduce complications due to diabetes and financial burden on the Diabetic patients.

The Central Government, through its hospitals augments the efforts of the State Governments for providing health services in the country.  Under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana(PMSSY), 6 new AIIMS have been set up and upgradation of identified medical colleges has been undertaken which will also improve tertiary care facilities for NCDs including Diabetes.

Quality generic medicines are being made available at affordable prices to all, under ‘Jan Aushadhi Scheme’, in collaboration with the State Governments.

Under National Health Mission Free Drugs and Free Diagnostic initiative, essential drugs and diagnostics are provided free of cost in public health facilities.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has also started AMRIT (Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment) stores where essential life-saving medicines are being provided at a substantial discount vis-à-vis the Maximum Retail Price.

The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.

Under the Scheme, supplementary nutrition is provided to Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers in order to bridge the nutritional gap in the intake as against the Recommended Dietary Allowances for Indians prescribed by the Indian Council for Medical Research. 

Under the National Health Mission (NHM) and within its umbrella the Reproductive & Child Health Programme, following interventions are provided to the pregnant mothers for addressing malnutrition:

1.      Universal screening of pregnant women for anaemia and Iron Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation.

2.      Calcium Supplementation in Pregnancy.

3.      Deworming in pregnancy.

4.      Weight gain monitoring.

 5.      Counselling on nutrition, family planning and prevention of diseases.

 6.      Under Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK), Government of India is providing food to pregnant women during their stay at public health facility for delivery.

 7.      Under the National Iron plus Initiative (NIPI), iron-folic supplementation for prevention and treatment of anaemia in a life cycle approach is provided to children, adolescents, women of reproductive age groups, pregnant women and lactating mothers. 

 8.      Health and nutrition education through IEC & BCC to promote dietary diversification,    inclusion of iron folate rich food as well as food items that promotes iron absorption.

                Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary, Health and Family Welfare launched the Allied and Healthcare Professionals’ database portal, here today, as part of Ministry’s commitment to ensure better systems and frameworks for the healthcare workforce in the country. 

At the launch, Ms. Sudan, said that India enjoys a demographic dividend of more than 65% youth below the age of 35 years and the Government of India is eager to provide the country’s youth a strong foundation for continued and sustainable growth. She stated that the country is facing increasing burden of lifestyle diseases and ailments, and needs better standards and appropriate frameworks for professionals providing health services to the population. Further, she highlighted that as an essential pre-requisite to achieve this, the Health Ministry aims to put in place a robust data repository of healthcare workers and further emphasized that unless the existing manpower capacity is mapped adequately, successful policies cannot be framed. She added that this portal is a provisional measure taken by the Ministry to track and reach out to all the allied and healthcare professionals in the country till such a time that a statutory body is established.

More than 3000 professionals have already registered on the portal during the testing phase. The link to the website portal is a2hp.mohfw.gov.in.

The portal has a capacity of capturing more than 10 lakhs Allied and Healthcare Professionals’ data. It will help the Government to track the number of professionals and streams of allied and healthcare professions in the country. It may further prove helpful in expediting the envisaged processes viz. licensing of professionals, workforce policy planning, and bringing transparency in the system by maintaining standards of educational and clinical practice etc. The Allied and Healthcare Professionals’ can visit the portal on the link mentioned above and provide basic personal, qualification and professional information, the  portal will then send an auto-generated email to the registered email of the candidate for verification and will provide an enrolment reference number for further usage. The candidates can subsequently login to the portal using the credentials received in the email and edit the information, upload qualification degree etc.

Also present at the event were Additional Secretary (Health) Sh. Sanjeeva Kumar and Joint Secretary Sh. Arun Singhal, among other officials and dignitaries from NIC at Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

As per guidelines, management of the CPSEs would be free to negotiate wage revision for workmen where the periodicity of wage settlement of five years or ten years has expired generally on 31.12.2016 keeping in view the affordability and financial sustainability of such wage revision for the CPSEs.

However, no time frame has been laid down in the guidelines issued by the Government for completion of wage negotiations by the management of CPSEs with Trade Unions/Associations.

 This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha today.

                A group of 40 school children consisting of 20 girls and 20 boys hailing from remote and far flung areas of Jammu region called on the Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh here today. The students are on a Bharat Darshan Tour from 19th January 2018 to 30th January 2018 organized by the BSF.

The concept of Bharat Darshan Tours for the children from Jammu & Kashmir was started as an annual feature in the year 2000. Shri Rajesh Ranjan, SDG BSF apprised the Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh of the composition of the group. He informed that Bharat Darshan tour has widened horizons and given the children an opportunity to see the diversities of the nation.

The children then shared their experiences of visits to different historical places and thanked the BSF and the Government of India for organizing tours of this nature.

 While addressing the children, Shri Rajnath Singh desired to communicate the experiences gained during this tour to the remote areas from where all have come. It was also told that the anti-national elements should not overpower the thoughts of national integration. A token of remembrance has been given to the Home Minister by the children. 

These children are selected for Bharat Darshan as a part of intensive civic action programme of the force in remote and backward areas of the border.

 

This tour is conducted to give them insights into the rich historical, cultural and social profile of the country and the progress made in industrial, technological and scientific fields. The tour also aims at inculcating in them a sense of pride for the nation. 

As part of the programme, they visited Amber Fort, Albert Hall Museum, Junagarh Fort, Jantar Mantar and City Palace in Jaipur, Fatehpur Sikri, Taj Mahal and Agra Fort in Agra, Qutab Minar, Lotus Temple, Rastrapati Bhawan and Metro Ride and witnessed the Republic day parade at New Delhi.

After meeting with the Home Minister, all the children will proceed to  Amritsar where they will witness the Retreat Ceremony at Attari Border and also visit the historical places of Amritsar. 

Till date 1619 children from J&K have participated in BSF sponsored 58 Bharat Darshan Tours.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we must be eternally vigilant against forces which are inimical to India and want to derail the country’s onward march. He was delivering the 4th R.V. Raju Memorial Lecture on 'National Security Challenges in 21st Century', organized by National Investigation Agency (NIA), here today. 

The Vice President said that the national security environment in India is determined by its geographical attributes, socio-economic milieu as well as by regional and global developments. He further said that the national security challenges can be broadly categorised as internal challenges and external challenges, both of which are closely and intricately intertwined. The internal challenges include the growing radicalization in our society, separatist movements, insurgencies, communalism and Maoist violence, he added.

The Vice President said that India is now the fastest growing major economy in the world and India needs to grow faster to provide basic means of livelihood and decent opportunities to all its citizens. The need of the hour is to ensure that India remains peaceful so that the process of all round development continues unhindered, he added.

The Vice President said that United Nations has from time to time adopted various resolutions to combat global terrorism in all its formats. However, despite being members of the UN some member states continue to flout these resolutions by nurturing and providing support to terrorist organizations and it is time for the global community to take note of the situation and act against such errant member states, he added.

The Vice President reminded the recent investigations by the NIA in tracing and tracking the funding of the separatist groups and leaders have successfully disrupted the supply of funds to the separatist groups. He further said that this has led to a significant decrease in the incidents of terrorism as well as decline in the subversive activities being carried out by the separatists. He hoped that the NIA would continue to focus on all the aspects of financing of terrorism and effectively disrupt the channels and networks of funding to the terrorist organizations.

Speaking on the occasion, the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh said that terrorism is a big threat in today’s world. He further mentioned, despite some countries’ support to it, our security forces are fully competent to overcome it. Referring to the track record of achieving 95 percent conviction rate by the NIA, he commended the agency saying NIA was “better than the best” and exhorted it to further improve the figure to 99-100 percent. The Home Minister expressed satisfaction at the fact that stone pelting incidents in Jammu and Kashmir were successfully tackled by our security forces including due to the role of NIA. He also asserted that there is no doubt that Jammu and Kashmir would remain an integral part of India. He said that security agencies have strived very hard in the North East region and were able to achieve an 85 percent decline in the terrorist incidents there. The Home Minister said that NIA should develop technology and competence to deal with the threats emanating from cyberspace. This should be done to develop professional and scientific investigative tools, he added. He also emphasised that NIA should improve cooperation with Federal investigative agencies of other countries to learn and share best practices.

Director General, NIA Shri Y. C. Modi highlighted the achievements of NIA. He said that investigations have been completed in 185 cases by the NIA and chargesheets have been filed in 148 cases. He also elaborated upon the regional offices being set up by the NIA. 

On the occasion, following NIA officials were conferred Police Medals for Meritorious Service (PMMS) and President’s Police Medal for Distinguished Service (PPMDS):


	 Shri Alok Mittal, IG(Adm/Policy):  PPMDS for ID-2016

                Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said a fourth dimension has been added to threats national security faced till now. Addressing the Closing Ceremony of the 8th All India Police Commando Competition at Manesar, Gurugram in Haryana today, Shri Rajnath Singh said commandos should also train to stamp out threats from the cyber space, apart from conventional threats emanating on the land, emerging from the seas and in the air. Hacking websites and data leaks also indirectly imperil national security, he added.

Commending the smart turnout of the Commandos, the Union Home Minister said he is confident that their iron fists can sniff out any evil eye casting aspersions on our soil. A Commando is not only physically agile and deft in firing weapons, but it is the composed mindset to make threat assessment and application of one’s resources to overcome the threat that gets into making a Commando out of a soldier, he said. Shri Rajnath Singh said Commandos have made the nation proud, having proved their mettle during the 2001 Parliament attack, 2002 Akshardham temple attack, 2008 Mumbai attack and the recent Pathankot terrorist attack. Union Home Minister declared an honorarium of Rs. 5 crores towards the NSG Welfare Fund.

On the occasion, the Union Home Minister released a compendium and a coffee table book. He took salute of the march past and presented medals and trophies to the winners. The week long 8th All India Police Commando Competition was organised by the National Security Guard, wherein 25 teams from different Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and State Police Forces participated. The NSG team won the prestigious competition.  The teams from BSF and Maharashtra Police secured second and third positions, respectively.  A Sniper Shooting Competition was also introduced first time in the All India Police Commando Competition. An equipment display was organised on the sidelines of the competition where the latest weapons and equipment for the security forces were showcased.  Director General, NSG, Shri Sudhir Pratap Singh and Director, IB Shri Rajiv Jain were among the dignitaries present.

On the appeal of the Union Home Minister donations worth nearly Rs 13 crores were received on a single day for the Bharat ke Veer fund.

On the occasion, a graphic novel series on the martyrs’ sacrifices, produced by Amar Chitra Katha Publications, was released by Shri Rajnath Singh and other dignitaries.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has assured he will convene a meeting with the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister to accelerate development in eight most backward districts of the State. Chairing a meeting of the MHA, NITI Aayog and delegated Senior Officers of the respective districts, here today, the Union Home Minister said he will visit all the districts thereupon to review the implementation of the District Action Plan. 

The eight districts in Uttar Pradesh are among those 115 backward districts across the country picked up by the NITI Aayog for rapid transformation by 2022. For each of the Districts, a senior official in the rank of Additional Secretary and Joint Secretary has been nominated as Prabhari Officer. The eight districts are Bahraich, Balrampur, Chandauli, Chitrakoot, Fatehpur, Shravasti, Siddharth Nagar and Sonbhadra.

Prabhari Officers, who have undertaken a visit to their respective districts, said the districts fared poorly in Health and Nutrition and Primary Education. Most districts lacked Infrastructure and the acute shortage of doctors and paramedics in Government Hospitals and Clinics. To overcome the shortage of teachers in schools, it was proposed that there should be localized recruitment.

The 115 backward districts have been allotted to various nodal Central Ministries for real-time monitoring and ranking. MHA has been delegated responsibility in respect of 35 Left Wing Extremism affected districts.

Prabhari Officers of the eight districts and Senior Officers of MHA and NITI Aayog attended the meeting.

                The two-day International Workshop on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (IWDRI) successfully concluded here today, setting the stage for taking the dialogue on resilient infrastructure forward at the global level. 

The Workshop identified Best Practices in the Infrastructure Sector, as well as key issues in existing practices and ways to address them. Priority areas for collaboration on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure were also identified.

The Workshop was organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) jointly with United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). MoS (Home) Shri Kiren Rijiju delivered the Valedictory Address.

“Resilient infrastructure is important not only for the aggregate economic growth but also for ending poverty,” said Shri Rijiju. He further added, “Our actions today, through investment in infrastructure, can reduce or increase the future risk. We need to shape policies that seek to not only reduce risk but also stop the creation of new risks.” 

If we are able to build complete resilience in the country, there are studies which suggest that our GDP could go up by upto 2 per cent, he said, adding that the work on resilient infrastructure, however, needs to take into account the ongoing rapid urbanisation as unplanned urbanisation is closely linked to creation of new risks.

Delivering the valedictory address, Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog, invited both NDMA and UNISDR to work together with NITI Aayog to help spread disaster awareness in society rapidly and widely. He also called for the need of ranking States in terms of their progress in Disaster Management.

Dr. P.K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, reiterated India’s commitment to working towards Disaster Risk Resilience along with the global community. He also praised the practical, outcome-based deliberations at the Workshop.

“This workshop has explored new dimensions, opportunities and challenges to resilient infrastructure. Deliberations here are crucial not only for achieving the targets identified in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction but also for achieving Prime Minister’s 10-point agenda, outlined during the Asian Ministerial Conference on DRR 2016,” said Dr. Robert Glasser, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction.

The day began with a facilitated cross-country panel discussion upon country-specific issues in Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. This was followed by technical sessions on standards for infrastructure and on the role of finance, including risk transfer mechanisms, in building resilient infrastructure. Discussions were also held on reconstruction and recovery of key Infrastructure Sectors after a disaster. Dr. V. Thiruppugazh, Joint Secretary, NDMA summed up the proceedings of the conference.

The workshop was inaugurated by the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh, yesterday. On Day 1, technical sessions were held on issues pertaining to Risk Management in key Infrastructure Sectors, viz. Energy, Transport and Telecommunications, and Risk Assessment. 

Experts from 23 countries representing a wide variety of development and disaster risk contexts, multilateral development banks, the United Nations, the private sector, academics and other stakeholders participated in the workshop.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated the International Workshop on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (IWDRI) here today. The two-day workshop is being organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in collaboration with United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR).

Underlining the importance of Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, Shri Rajnath Singh said that it creates opportunities for economic growth and is at the core of sustainable development. ""The way we build our infrastructure today will either build risk or resilience for the future generations. We need to bring to bear tremendous foresight and rigour to ensure that all our new infrastructure is built to withstand the hazards of the present as well as the future.""

The Union Home Minister said, “As the infrastructure systems are globally interconnected, disruptions in one part of the world can cause havoc in another part of the world. It is, therefore, important that all stakeholders come together to address the challenges and devise solutions to create resilient infrastructure.”

Reiterating India's commitment towards building resilience and strengthening global cooperation, Shri Rajnath Singh talked about the Prime Minister's 10-point agenda, outlined during the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) held in New Delhi in November 2016. “At that conference, our Prime Minister outlined a ten-point agenda to give a sense of urgency to the implementation of Sendai Framework for DRR. His 1st point emphasized the need for investing in infrastructure in a manner so that it can withstand hazards not only now but also in the future,"" he said.

Shri Rajnath Singh also recalled the example of constructing sound structures in India’s ancient civilizations. “Infrastructure has shaped human civilization for millennia. Our forefathers showed tremendous foresight when they developed infrastructure that served us for generations,” said Shri Rajnath Singh. “They have helped us tame the fury of nature, while also helping us maximize the benefits of mother nature’s benevolence,” he added.

The Union Home Minister said robust infrastructure will be at the core of sustainable development in the coming decades; this is also recognized in the way the (United Nations’) Sustainable Development Goals have been framed. “The infrastructure that we will build in the next twenty years will be more than what we built over the last two thousand years. At the global level, by 2040, to adequately meet the infrastructure needs of humanity, we will need nearly $100 trillion. By 2030, Asia alone will need $26 trillion in infrastructure investment,” he said.

Shri Rajnath Singh said climate change is also posing new challenges to erecting Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. “Climate related extremes are likely to become more intense and frequent. Past is no longer a good guide for the future,” he said. “The challenge of building Disaster Resilient Infrastructure is such that no country can address it alone,” he added.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. P.K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, said that while reducing losses to infrastructure is one of the specific targets identified under the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), 2015-2030, it is also key to achieving other targets identified under the SFDRR. ""We cannot reduce the number of deaths, reduce the number of affected people, or reduce economic losses from disasters if our infrastructure is damaged and its functionality disrupted by disasters,"" he said.

Highlighting India's reconstruction experience after the Bhuj earthquake, Dr. Mishra said that rebuilding to appropriate standards of disaster resilience also delivers co-benefits in terms of improved quality of life. ""Investment in Disaster Resilient Infrastructure should be seen as an investment in sustainability,"" he said.

In his address, Shri R. K. Jain, Member, NDMA, highlighted the importance of collective efforts towards mainstreaming disaster risk reduction in infrastructure. ""This workshop is a unique opportunity to exchange ideas and explore collaborative initiatives,"" he said.

Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, Dr. Robert Glasser said the pace of urbanisation around the world today is an opportunity to not only avoid creation of new risks but also to reduce future losses.

Shri Junaid Kamal Ahmad, Country Director for the World Bank in India, emphasised upon the need to leverage the financial market to build financial resilience in today’s world. He also highlighted the importance of institutional mechanisms, federal structures and financial provisions in building resilience in infrastructure.

Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba was also present during the inaugural session.

Experts from about 23 countries, multilateral development banks, the United Nations, the private sector, academia and other stakeholders are participating in the workshop. Deliberations at the workshop will take the dialogue on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and global cooperation further. It will also help foster a sustained dialogue and mutual exchange of experiences, lessons and solutions.

Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh will inaugurate a two-day International Workshop on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (IWDRI) here on Monday, January 15, 2018. The workshop is organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in collaboration with United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR).

The workshop will bring together countries from different parts of the world - from Chile to Australia and from Japan to Sri Lanka - with different socio-economic backgrounds and geographical features. This will be a great opportunity to learn from their unique experiences in their efforts towards building disaster resilient infrastructure.  

The workshop will also see multilateral development banks, the United Nations, the private sector and academics coming together to identify best practices in the infrastructure sector, as well as key issues in existing practices and ways to address them. This workshop aims to take this dialogue on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and global cooperation further.

Brief on Workshop Sessions

Disaster Resilient Infrastructure: Opportunities and Challenges

In this session a broad discussion regarding the infrastructure development will take place which will highlight the limitations of the existing practices; risks to which the current assets are exposed to, the direct and indirect socio-economic impact of the disasters, the investment ecosystem, regulatory standards, sectoral roles and opportunities of building resilience in key projects of the future

Technical Sessions

Technical sessions will be held on following thematic areas: 

1. Risk Management of Key Infrastructure Sectors –                                                                                                              

Discussions will take place on issues pertaining to risk management in specific infrastructure sectors during the workshop. 

a.       Disaster Control Infrastructure: This will discuss strategies on how to build resilience in infrastructure which are designed specifically to protect people living in hazard-prone locations; for example, cyclone shelters

b.      Transport: This will see discussions how to build better disaster resilient transport infrastructure such as roads, bridges, tunnels, railways, ports, airports, etc.

c.       Energy: This panel will discuss ways of making power transmission and distribution lines resilient to the effect of risks from natural hazards. Case studies will be presented on topics ranging from design and operating standards of power plants to the kind of risk renewable energy systems are exposed to.

2.      Risk Assessment, Standards, Design, and Regulation for Infrastructure development, Operation and Maintenance – 

 

A risk assessment is a process to identify potential hazards and analyze what could happen if a hazard occurs. 

This session will have case studies on challenges in incorporating new disaster risk assessments to infrastructure; the absence of standardisation in methods of collecting data and its implication on disaster risk assessments.

Discussions will also happen on design standards; how regulations play their role in ascertaining that the prescribed standards are followed during construction of infrastructure; how to sustain and maintain resilience, etc.

3.      Financing Disaster Resilient Infrastructure

3.This session will deal with issues pertaining to how governments, especially those of developing countries make optimum use of their finance in creating disaster resilient infrastructure. Infrastructure remains largely public owned in most of the developing countries. Maximising benefits within budgetary constraints is a major challenge. Experts will discuss ways to do this without escalating costs beyond affordability. What is the role of insurance companies; role of multilateral development banks and private investors; possibility of a loan on reduced interest rate for more resilient infrastructure,  are some of the other areas of focus in this session

4.      Reconstruction and Recovery of Critical Infrastructure after Disasters

The panel will discuss issues ranging from how to identify critical infrastructure and quickly resume services along this infrastructure in the aftermath of a disaster to improving communication and enable recovery.

Backgrounder

India was one of the first to create a National Disaster Management Plan based on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. It is now on course to lead a global coalition which would work towards reducing damage to critical infrastructure.

The Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) held in New Delhi in November 2016, saw the adoption of the ‘Asia Regional Plan for Implementation of the Sendai Framework’. During the same, India showed strong commitment towards building resilience with Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing ten-point agenda, the first point of which, focuses on “working towards disaster resilient infrastructure to ensure that all development projects - airports, roads, canals, hospitals, schools, bridges – are built to appropriate standards and contribute to the resilience of communities they seek to serve."" He also emphasized the need of working “...with other partner countries and stakeholders to build a coalition or centre for promoting disaster resilient infrastructure in the region...”.  

The Asian region will see huge infrastructure projects in the coming years. A large proportion of these will happen in India. An estimate suggests that India needs about $1.5 trillion investment in the infrastructure sector in the coming 10 years. While this sounds exciting, the challenge lies in building infrastructure that is sustainable and resilient enough to handle extreme weather events. India alone is prone to multiple high impact hazards such as Earthquake, Cyclone, Landslide, Flood, etc. Urban Flooding (which troubles both the developed and developing regions of the world) is another menace which the country is facing every year. During a disaster, poor quality - weak infrastructure not just results in loss of lives, but also in livelihoods. It results in significant economic loss as well. For a 

country like ours, this could have been better utilized in various welfare projects. It is, therefore, extremely crucial that the new (as well as existing) infrastructure is strong enough to take on the hazards mentioned above. Having realised the importance of “prevention and mitigation”, investment in mainstreaming risk reduction is inevitable.

Various international agreements have also reiterated the importance and long-term benefits of investing in resilient infrastructure. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), 2015-2030, which is the first major agreement of the post-2015 development agenda, identifies investing in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) for resilience and to build back better in reconstruction as priorities for action towards reducing disaster risk. Similarly, Goal 9 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognizes disaster resilient infrastructure as a crucial driver of economic growth and development.

Besides reducing infrastructure losses, disaster resilient infrastructure will also help achieve targets pertaining to reduction in mortality, number of affected people and economic losses due to disasters. 

The frequency and severity of disaster events, especially the large hydro-meteorological disasters, has been increasing due to climate change. This means that there is an urgent need for making our infrastructure disaster resilient for effectively responding to climate change. Even more so in public infrastructure sectors - energy, transportation, tele-communication - as their resilience is critical for effective post-disaster response. Moreover, these sectors are likely to see the largest amount of investment in developing countries over the next fifteen years. Making them resilient makes for sound economic sense.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has assured there will be no shortage of funds for Border Infrastructure. Inaugurating the 43rd Annual Day function of MES Builders Association of India, here today, he said the Government will expedite Forest and Environmental clearance issues which still continue to dog such strategic projects. Shri Rajnath Singh said the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has also laid emphasis and relaxations will be obtained to facilitate completion of projects in national interest. He said the Private-Public Partnership (PPP) model will be crucial to create strategic infrastructure.

The Union Home Minister said the Government has embarked upon a five year ambitious project during the period 2017-2022 worth over seven lakh crore rupees to build road infrastructure. This includes more than 2,000 kms Border Roads. Pointing out that e-tendering process has led to transparency, Shri Rajnath Singh said quality delivery of the projects will be paramount. The Union Home Minister called upon the Armed Forces and the CAPFs for better coordination on the creation of Border Infrastructure.

The Union Home Minister said for the first time in India’s history, this Government has continued to roll out economic reforms even while the economic situation in the country has remained comfortable; normally the previous Governments were compelled on the path of reforms after landing in dire financial position.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Cadre review of Group 'A' Executive Cadre of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).  It provides for creation of 25 posts of various ranks from Assistant Commandant to Additional Director General ranks to enhance the supervisory staff in Senior Duty posts of CISF. 

The restructuring of the CISF Cadre will result in increase of Group 'A' posts from 1252 to 1277 with increase of 2 posts of Additional Director General, 7 posts of Inspector General, 8 posts of Deputy Inspector General and 8 posts of Commandant.

 

Impact:

 

After creation of these Group 'A' posts in CISF, the supervisory efficiency and capacity building of the Force would be enhanced. Timely creation of proposed posts in the Cadre Review of Group 'A' posts in the Force will enhance its supervisory as well as administrative capabilities.

 

Background:

 

The CISF came into existence through the CISF Act 1968 amended in 1983 declaring the Force as Armed Force of the Union. The original charter of CISF was to provide protection and security to the property of Public Sector Undertakings. The Act was further amended in 1989, 1999 and 2009 to enlarge the charter of duties and security cover to Private Sector Units and other duties that may be entrusted by the Central Government.

The CISF came into existence in 1969 with a sanctioned strength of only three Battalions. The CISF does not have a Battalion pattern like other CAPFs, except 12 Reserve Battalions and HQRs. Currently, the Force is providing security cover to 336 Industrial Undertaking (including 59 Airports) spread all over the country.  The Force, which had made a beginning with a sanctioned strength of 3192 in 1969, has grown to a strength of 1,49,088 as on 30.06.2017. The CISF has its Headquarters at Delhi. The Organization is headed by the DG which is an Ex-cadre post.

                Although ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects, the Government of India has taken a number of initiatives in the last three years for encouraging use of technology to optimize functioning of State police.

Under the scheme of Modernisation of Police Force (MPF), States have been provided central assistance for acquiring advanced weaponry such as AK-47 and INSAS Rifles, police equipment such as CCTV surveillance system, modern communication equipment, and state-of-the-art equipment for State Intelligence Branches and State Forensic Science Laboratories. 

By way of Crime and Criminals Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) project, the processes of crime registration, investigation, prosecution, etc., in police station are being computerized.  The various benefits of CCTNS are now available to State Police Forces.  The DIGITAL POLICE POROTAL launched by the Government of India, on 21.08.2017, provides facility to police officers for the purpose of investigation, policymaking, data analytics and research through national database of crime record.

The Government of India is also implementing a central sector project namely, Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) across the country with a view to supplement the efforts of the States/UTs to establish a standardized and reliable emergency response system across the country to effectively deal with emergency/distress calls relating to medical, fire and police emergencies etc. with a special emphasis on distress calls from women and children.  It is proposed to provide them necessary funding and policy level guidance for achieving the objectives and for setting up of Emergency Response Centers (ERCs).  A pan-India single emergency response number ‘112’ has already been put in place across the country.  Out of the total approved outlay of the project of Rs. 321.69 crore, an amount of Rs. 266.63 crore has been released during the years 2016-17 and 2017-18 to majority of States/UTs, which are in process of setting up of their Emergency Response Centres.

States have been sensitized for encouraging use of technology from time to time.  This has also been through issuance of guidelines, convening of meetings and various communications made to the States.  While approving Sates Action Plans under MPF scheme, the High Powered Committee, which approves these Plans, also guides States regarding improved technologies and equipment which States can acquire.

The amount earmarked and released for the above purposes in the current year budget are as below:-

                As per reports, the demonetization of bank notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denomination resulted in significant positive impact on most theatres of violence in the country. LWE cadres have deposited illegal money into the accounts of the sympathizers or simple villagers.  Nearly Rs.97.75 lakh was seized from various LWE groups after demonetization. Besides, Left Wing Extremists have also protested against the demonetization drive, thus indicating their discontentment. Since illegally held cash forms the major chunk of terrorist funding, after the demonetisation, most of the cash held with the terrorists turned worthless.  Demonetisation also led to instant extinguishment of Pak-printed high quality fake Indian currency notes.  It also adversely affected the hawala operators.

The views of the State Governments/UTs were not unanimous. The matter was, therefore, referred to Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) for examining  the same with reference to the observations of the States and feasibility of an implementable Witness Identity Protection and Witness Protection Programme, so as to enable Government to take a considered view. The report of BPR&D has been recently received and its recommendations are now under examination in the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.

                          As per the White Paper on Foreigners Issue, released by Home and Political Department, Government of Assam, during intensive revision of electoral roll in Assam in 1997, the letter ‘D’ (for doubtful/disputed) was marked against the names of those electors who could not prove their Indian citizenship status at the time of verification. Based on the verification report, the Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) took a decision on whether a reference to the concerned Tribunal was necessary to ascertain the Indian citizenship  status of  such electors.  Once, EROs confirmed in the affirmative, such cases were forwarded to the competent authority (SP of the concerned district) for reference to the concerned Tribunals. Based on the judgments/orders of the Tribunals, the letter ‘D’ was either removed if Indian Citizenship status was confirmed or name of the electors deleted from the electoral rolls if citizenship status as Indian could not be established in Court. 

Issuing notice to the ‘D’ voters is a legal process and there is no question of harassing people. ‘D’ voters are not detained. Only persons declared by Foreigners Tribunals (FTs) as foreigners are kept in the detention centers. State Government updates the details about ‘D’ voters. As per the monthly report of disposal of cases in FTs of Assam, 19,612 ‘D’ voters were declared Foreigners till October, 2017.

                On the New Year Day, the Union Home Minister today visited  the Forward Areas of the Himalayan borders in Uttarakashi district. He met the ITBP jawans deployed at the Nelong  Border Out-Post (BOP) located at the height of 11,636 ft MSL. Shri Rajnath Singh had personal interaction with the jawans deployed at the icy heights of the valley.

               Union Home Minister, while addressing the ITBP jawans during a   Sainik Sabha, lauded their dedicated service done in tough circumstances at high altitudes of Himalayas in sub-zero temperature.  He said that the Himveers are working with high morale and the MHA is aware of the invaluable services rendered by the ITBP personnel  to the nation. He assured them that the Ministry  is trying to extend all possible support to the Force to make it stronger.   Shri R K Pachnanda, DG  ITBP and senior officers accompanied Shri Rajnath Singh on the visit.

               Yesterday, Union Home Minister met the families of ITBP jawans residing in the family quarters of the Unit premises at Matli, Uttarkashi and greeted them on the eve of the New Year. This was the first ever visit by Shri Rajnath Singh  to Nelong Valley. In September-October last year, Shri Rajnath Singh had visited Mana, Lapthal and Rimkhim BOPs besides various other formations of ITBP- Mountaineering & Skiing Institute at Auli near Joshimath and Gauchar and had celebrated Dusehera with ITBP jawans.

            This LED fixtures has around 1 lakh burning hour whereas earlier light fixtures were around 10,000 burning hour.  New lighting system has computerized control having unified power and data cable for easy installation and maintenance with automation in selection of colour combination scheme using opti-bin technology, selection of timing, facility of dimming, switching on/off facility, individual/combined control of light fittings etc. through Ethernet based controller.  This lighting system has got features to produce multi-colour combinations.  The colour combination on domes, chattries, logia columns, facade of main buildings of Rashtrapati Bhawan, North Block and South Block have enhanced the architectural features of these buildings.  This system is energy efficient as well as cost effective and there is value addition by putting this system on these buildings.

                Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs along with the Chief Minister of Goa, Shri Manohar Parrikar today launched the ‘Protocol for Star Rating of Garbage-Free Cities’ in Goa. The star-rating initiative, developed by the Swachh Bharat Mission – Urban will be rating cities on a 7-star rating system based on multiple cleanliness indicators for solid waste management, which will include Door to Door Collection, bulk generator compliance, source segregation, sweeping, scientific processing of waste, scientific land filling, plastic waste management, construction and demolition management, dump remediation & citizen grievance redressal system etc. 

Cities can be rated as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 star based on their compliance with the protocol conditions specified for each of the rating. Further city should be ODF(Open Defecation Free) before it could be given rating of 3 star or above. While cities may self-declare themselves as 1-star, 2-star or 4-star, MoHUA will carry out an additional verification through an independent third party to certify cities as 3-star, 5-star or 7-star. Cities will need to get recertified themselves every year to retain their star-status.

The most significant feature of the rating protocol is that it provides stakeholders with a single metric to rate a city’s cleanliness, rather than separately evaluating multiple factors which contribute to a city’s overall cleanliness and garbage free status. The SMART rating (Single metric, Measurable, Achievable, Rigorous verification, Targeted towards outcomes) is characterized by Trust and verify model and sustainability (progressive and to be recertified every year).  The protocol will involve the participation of all stakeholders and common people to aspire for higher grading in cleanliness. The Swachh Survekshan survey run by the SBM Urban for the past three years has successfully built up a spirit of healthy competition among cities, vying with each other every year to improve their ranking as compared to other cities. The distinctive feature of Star Rating System will be that many cities can have higher stars as compared to only one city can be “Cleanest city” under Swachh Survekshan.

SBM-Urban’s objective of achieving a ‘clean India’ is encapsulated in the Vision statement of the star-rating protocol, stating that “All cities achieve “Garbage Free” status wherein at any point of time in the day, no garbage or litter is found in any public, commercial or residential locations (including storm drains and water bodies) in the city (except in litter bins or transfer stations); 100 per cent of waste generated is scientifically managed; all legacy waste has been remediated and city is scientifically managing its municipal solid waste, plastic waste and construction & demolition waste. Additionally, there must be a steady reduction in the waste generated by the city and visible beautification of the city to achieve a clean & aesthetically pleasing city”.It is expected that the Star-rating initiative will be another effective tool for achieving the objectives of Swachh Bharat Mission of “Open Defecation Free and Garbage Free India”

Sh Hardeep Puri, Housing and Urban Affairs Minister also informed that Goa being a young and a vibrant state given its socio-economic profile has immense potential in the affordable housing sector. Therefore, Pardhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Urban (PMAY-U) is an important mission to cater to the overall demand of affordable housing in Goa. The housing demand statistics registered in the PMAY-MIS indicates that there is housing demand for about 5,000 houses across the entire State in all 14 Urban Statutory towns included in the PMAY(U) Mission. About 1000 demand has been already registered in the CLSS component of PMAY(U) in Goa. Due to its vast tourism let economic activities, the facility of CLSS can be widely availed by the Aspirational class in EWS, MIG & LIG categories in the State of Goa. As of now 61 beneficiaries have already availed an interest subsidy of Rs. 1.28 crore in their home loan accounts under CLSS of PMAY (U). State has been requested to focus on MIG category for availing subsidy under CLSS due to its large working population. The 2011 Census has also reported 4,846 slum households in 3 towns (Ponda, Mormugao and Margao). The State Government has been requested to take up projects under In-Situ Slum Redevelopment projects (ISSR) component of PMAY(U) for making the cities clean and providing dignified living to slum households. The State of Goa has assured to bring project proposals under BLC component during the forthcoming CSMC which is scheduled to be held on 31.1.2018.  The State has been requested to ensure budgetary provision matching with the Proposals/ AIP and to ensure availability of encumbrance free land for meeting the demand for houses. State has also been requested to opt for technology neutral bidding process for adopting modern, innovative and green technologies and building materials.

Each city has developed a unique vision and has selected an area (ABD) which will be developed as a lighthouse, to be replicated by the city. The 9 cities selected have proposed an investment of Rs 12,824 crores of which Rs 10,639 crores would be in Area Based Development (ABD) and Rs 2,185 crores in Pan City initiatives which would be impacting 35.3 lakh persons living in these areas, he added. Smart roads, rejuvenation of water bodies, cycle tracks, walking paths, smart classrooms, skill development centres, upgradation of health facilities and Pan City Projects which include integrated command control centre and ICT based municipal services”.

These 9 Cities have approximately 409 projects. The funding sources for these projects is proposed to be with; SCM – with contribution from State and Centre 61.25%, Convergence 24.19%, PPP 12.90%, Own sources 1.57%, and Other sources 0.09%. With today’s announcement 99 cities Smart Cities have been selected. Previously, 20 cities were selected in January 2016, 13 cities in May 2016, 27 cities in September 2016 and 30 cities in June 2017. With the selection of these nine cities, the total proposed investment in the 99 Smart City Mission would Rs 2,03,979 crores. 

Providing details of the progress made in Smart Cities, Shri Puri informed that “so far 85 out of 90 cities already selected have incorporated their SPVs and 61 Cities have procured PMCs; another 8 cities are in various stages of hiring their PMCs. With more and more cities now equipped with a team of consultants and administrative teams, we can expect the progress in the start of work in projects to grow exponentially, over the next six months. Smart City Mission is setting a new benchmark in terms of project implementation. In duration of 2 years, which is a small period in terms of urban development life-cycle, the mission is picking up momentum. There has been more than 350% increase in the value of 'completed projects' and 230% increase in ‘work started projects’ over the last six months. Smart cities are implementing state of the art innovative ideas in their projects. These are bringing about unprecedented improvement in the quality of life of people”. Some examples:-

Smart City Centers based on advanced technologies: Smart City Centers have become operational in four cities like Pune, Surat, Vadodara & Kakinada and work is in progress in another 18 cities. Tenders to develop such Smart City centers have been issued in 11 more cities. In Rajkot for instance, after deployment of surveillance system, a part the Smart City Centre, crime-incidents have reduced by 17%, from 3,068 in 2016 to 2,554 in 2017; the city administration was able to completed 906 rallies/public meetings/VVIP movements during election period last year without a single incident of violence or disruption. Integrated traffic management has increased the traffic speeds and reduced traffic congestions. Surely, it has helped in cleaner air for people to breathe.

Street redesign projects have visual impact with provisions for cycle tracks and footpaths, promoting non-motorized transport. While 32 cities have issued tenders, and work has begun in 17 of them. For example, in Pune Street redesign project, in an 8 km stretch a pilot section of 1.5 kms has being developed has improved accessibility for elders, dedicated spaces for pedestrians & bicycle users, and beautification of the space by creating sitting zones and installation of public art with CSR funds has been very well received by citizens.

Similarly, for smart reuse and wastewater projects 33 cities have issued tenders, and work has begun in 16 of them. 

In order to promote renewable energy usage in our cities, projects of about 250 MW for providing Solar projects on rooftops of government buildings are already installed. Till date, 44 cities have issued tenders, and work has begun in 38 cities. Most of these cities have completed their projects.

 

As on 17 January 2018 there are 2,948 projects worth Rs. 1,38,730 crore are in various stages of implementation. 189 projects worth Rs. 2,237 crore have been completed, and implementation is underway for 495 projects with a cost of Rs. 18,616 crore; furthers tenders have been floated for 277 projects with a cost of Rs.15,885 crore; while 1,987 projects worth Rs.1,01,992 crore are at DPR stage.

The Housing & Urban Affairs Minister also announced the commencement of the Liveability Index Programme in 116 cities. The MoHUA is implementing several flagship Urban Missions. An overarching goal of these missions is to make Indian cities more ‘Liveable’. To develop a common minimum framework for cities to assess their existing status and chart their pathway towards providing a better quality of life to their citizens, the MoHUA has developed a set of ‘Liveability Standards’ relevant to Indian cities to generate a Liveability Index and rate cities. These standards were launched in June, 2018. The framework has its genesis in the 24 Smart City features contained in the Smart City Proposals and includes 79 indicators (57 Core Indicators and 22 Supporting Indicators). These indicators are organised in 15 distinct ‘Categories’, designed for measuring various institutional, social, economic and physical aspects that affect the quality of life of citizens and determine the ‘Liveability’ of a city.

 

MoHUA through an international bidding process under World Bank funded CBUD programme has selected M/s IPSOS Research Private Limited in consortium with M/s ATHENA INFONOMICS India Private Limited and Economist Group Limited for assessment of liveability indices in 116 cities. 

 


	Some of the key outputs of the exercise will include:


 


	
	
		Roll out of over 30 capacity building workshops to understand ‘urban data’ and equip cities with the necessary tools and knowledge to create the database for the evaluation.
		Reconnaissance visits to all 116 cities to capture critical city-level information to inform the city assessment reports.
		Over 1 lakh citizen and user surveys across the country to measure satisfaction on urban services.
		A state of the art ‘Economist-Portal’ to spatially map the data and the ‘Liveability Index’ outputs that will serve as a knowledge base for decision making on policy and planning.
		A framework to systematically capture City GDP, which may be integrated and rolled out in subsequent rounds.
		Ranking of cities on the basis of Liveability Index to promote competitive environment amongst cities that result will in systematic improvements in quality of life.

                “Smart Cities Mission is a step in the direction of achieving our vision to improve the ease of living particularly for the poor, women, elderly and differently abled people. All Indians should be able to enjoy a clean and sustainable environment.  As a major player in digital revolution and a technology superpower, India must also leverage cutting edge technology to power its infrastructure, offices and homes.” Stating this at the Smart Cities Summit organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry here today, Shri Hardeep S. Puri, Minister of State(I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs informed that the Smart Cities Mission is progressing at a brisk pace. 90 cities have been selected so far. The selection of ten more cities will be announced shortly.  There are about 3000 projects worth Rs.1,40,000 crores at various stages of implementation. Tenders for projects worth Rs 16,000 crore have been called, and more than 1 lakh crore worth of projects are being readied for issuance of tenders. This remains one of the fastest ever project implementations at this scale and geographic spread in urban sector.  This will have a ‘Lighthouse’ effect.  Other cities and regions around them will soon start undergoing transformation towards becoming centres of urban excellence.  

            Addressing the participants at the Summit, the Minister said that there is a new benchmark in terms of project implementation. In a short duration of 2.5 years (First round of 20 cities were selected in Jan 2016, and last 30 cities were selected as recently as June 2017) which is a small period in terms of urban development life-cycle where transitions take place over decades. He further informed – “Smart City Mission has a strong focus on innovative digital technologies and dovetails with Digital India 'vision areas'—digital empowerment of citizens, making government services available digitally, and creating digital infrastructure as utility to every citizen—very closely. Digital Technology solutions, such as surveillance systems lead to greatly reduced crime and improved safety of residents particularly women. City wide wi-fi networks have improved communication among citizens as well that with various service providers.  E-governance and citizen feedback management has led to improved social cohesion by increase in opportunities for citizen engagement, reduction in social inequities, and reduction in response time for services for business. Integrated traffic management will increase the traffic speeds and reduce traffic congestions and hence cleaner air for people to breathe”, he further informed.

            Deliberating on the approach followed by Smart Cities, the Minister informed that cities have co-created a vision and smart city proposal through an extensive citizen engagement. The quality of some of the smart city plans can be ascertained by the fact that Bhubaneswar smart city plan was adjudged as the best city plan by American Planners Association. This is also first time that cities have created an institutional mechanism (SPVS) at the city level. Till now 82 SPVs have been formed and considering the capacity gaps existing at cities, this is not a small achievement by any standards. For the first-time Cities are also thinking in terms of converging the objectives, resources and processes of different projects taken up by various agencies towards realization of a common vision. Today every project taken up at the cities are appraised by smart city SPVs in terms of public value it creates. This has led to an improved coordination and efficiency in delivery of services at cities. For the first time in the urban scenario in India there has been an emphasis to leverage the grant fund given by government through innovative financing mechanisms. The 90 smart cities have proposed to leverage the fund by 2.5 times through internal revenue mobilization, value capture financing, municipal bond issue etc. Cities need to work as start-up and leverage their financial resources. Smart city mission has been heralding this transformation.

                 Shri Hardeep S.Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs has called for making creative public art as an essential component for our works.  Addressing the Round Table on the theme of Public Art in Delhi, here today, Shri Puri stated that the time has come to plan for public art work in Delhi on a large scale by making it a component of all developmental plans and architectural designs.  The objective of the Round Table organized at the initiative of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs by Delhi Urban Art Commission is to bring together on the same platform artists, urban designers, city planners, architects and Government representatives to provide their valuable inputs on the subject.  Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, Shri Manoj Kumar, Additional Secretary, Professor P.S.N.Rao from DUAC, besides leading architects and artists were also present on the occasion.  

 Addressing those present, Shri Puri stated that “the intention today is to have an interactive session.  This is not intended as a one off meeting but one designed to commence an interactive process.  Besides celebrating the nation’s cultural diversity, Public Art should aesthetically celebrate the country’s rich cultural heritage with national, regional and local themes”.  In many National Capitals of the world, public spaces are seen as an opportunity for displaying Creative Art Work.  Such creative and artistic works not only beautify the city but also capture its soul.  They not only enhance the aesthetics of public spaces but also raise the stature of the city in the eyes of the visitors and have great potential to boost tourism.  Such public art also strengthens the affinity a resident of the city feels for the city, he further added.

 DUAC has come up with guidelines on Public Art which would help in encouraging integration of Art Work with Public Projects.  “When we have resolved to further develop Delhi as a world class city with the state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities to boost its potential for tourism as well as for holding world level conferences and seminars, there is no reason why we should not make creative public art as an essential component for all our works.  We have a vast reservoir of talent in the form of creative artists, sculptors, painters and designers who have made their name the world over by designing such public art, whenever they have been offered an opportunity to do so.  We need to tap this vast potential to beautify Delhi in the first instance and thereafter carry the movement forward to other cities and towns of the country”, Shri Puri said.

                  A Memorandum of Understanding(MOU) has been signed in the presence of ShHardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State(I/C) Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs to provide a centralized platform for processing interest subsidy to eligible beneficiaries under Self Employment Programme (SEP) component of DeendayalAntyodayaYojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM). The MOU was signed between Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA) and Allahabad Bank here today. Smt. UshaAnanthasubramaniyan, MD &CEO, Allahabad Bank and Shri Sanjay Kumar, Joint Secretary from the Housing Ministry signed the MOU.Ms. Archana Mittal, Director, NULM and senior officials from the Ministry were also present on the occasion.

The Web-portal will provide an end-to-end solution for processing interest subsidy for NULM schemes. The subsidy will be credited to Aadhaar linked beneficiary account in a seamless process through DBT mode. The portal will also facilitate on-line validation of loans granted by Banks, through Urban Local Bodies. 

Under the Self-Employment Component (SEP) of NULM, bank loans for setting up micro- enterprise are available to individuals (upto 2 lakhs) and groups (upto 10 lakhs) of urban poor; consumption loans (as per the savings) are also available for Self Help Groups (SHGs). Interest subvention from Ministry is available for the amount of interest charged over and above 7% , by the banks and women SHGs are eligible for additional 3% subvention on timely loan repayment

Currently, processing of interest subvention is manual – banks submit claims to ULBs on a monthly basis, who then verify and settle them – tedious and time-taking process


	Delay or non-submission of claims by banks for interest subsidy
	No mechanism to ascertain whether beneficiary has received subsidy or not
	As on 31st December 2017, the interest subsidy claimed by banks is Rs 204.27 crore, against an estimated amount of subsidy claim of Rs 700 crores (FY 2014-15 to Q3 2017-18). 


Under the Proposed System, Common centralized IT platform for all states, to streamline release of interest subsidy and facilitate proper monitoring – Allahabad Bank selected for the design and development of portal. Claims will be uploaded by Central/Zonal HQ of banks on the portal; concerned States/ULBs will verify the beneficiaries, after which the claim amount will be transferred to the beneficiary through Direct Beneficiary Transfer (DBT) mode; SMS will be sent to beneficiary intimating him about release of subsidy in his account; Allahabad Bank will charge a service fee of 1.05% of interest subsidy amount released; Ministry, States and ULBs will get reports to monitor interest subvention delivery; Web Portal will be functional by beginning of FY 2018-19

            Shri Hardeep Puri,
Minister of State(I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs has informed that the
focus of Swachh Survekshan 2018 been shifted from
process and output based indicators to indicators focusing on outcome and
sustainability.  Providing details of the Swachh Survekshan 2018 launched today,
Shri Puri stated that Swachh Survekshan has served as the agent of change demonstrating
massive potential of addressing challenges through unique interventions in
urban governance.  With the roll out of Swachh Survekshan 2018, we look
forward to a cleaner India, where each Indian citizen has played his/her part
in the Nation’s transformation, he added.  He was speaking at a Ministry of
Housing & Urban Affairs programme, this morning.  Sh Durga Shankar Mishra,
Secretary and Shri V.K.Jindal, Mission Director for SBM-U were also present. 

            

            Providing
details of the Swachh Survekshan 2018, the Minister informed that this is the
largest survey impacting more than 40 crore urban population and to ensure
level playing field in similar smaller cities, Swachh Survekshan 2018 will have
two categories of ranking-

 

1)     
500 cities with more than 1 lakh
population will have National Ranking

2)     
3541 cities with less than 1 lakh population
will have State and Regional ranking.

 

            The
survey attempts to capture the progress in following 6 broad parameters –

 

1.      Collection and
Transportation of Municipal Solid Waste: to ensure that segregated dry and wet
waste is collected daily from the households and our public areas are clean.

2.      Processing and
Disposal of Municipal Solid Waste: to encourage cities to process their waste
and wherever possible recycle the dry waste.

3.      Sanitation
related progress: to verify whether city is ODF with access to toilet available
for citizens.  This year even all Petrol Pumps of the country are coming
forward to offer their toilets as Public Toilets.

4.      IEC (Information,
Education and Communication): Whether cities have started campaigns promoting
Swachh Survekshan, engaging citizens in waste management, maintenance of
Community and Public Toilets etc. 

5.      Capacity Building: to
assess whether officials in the ULBs were provided sufficient opportunities to
attend trainings and go for exposure visits.

6.      Innovation and Best
Practices: This component has been introduced first time in this survey –
encourage cities to come forward and share their best practices in Swachh
Bharat Mission.  It will help the country to learn how our cities have
responded the call for Make India Clean and ODF by October 2019. 

 



            

 

 

           
In October, 2015, the Swachh Bharat Mission team in the Ministry conceptualized
and introduced a healthy competition ‘Swachh Survekshan’ among cities to
improve the status of urban sanitation in India.  

 

-       Swachh Survekshan-2016
conducted in January, 2016 assessing 73 Urban Local Bodies.  Mysuru got the tag
of Cleanest City of India.

 

-       Swachh Survekshan-2017
was conducted in January-February 2017 covering 434 ULBs.  Indore emerged as
the Cleanest City of India. 

           

           During
declaration of the Swachh Survekshan-2017 results on 4th May, 2017, it was
announced that all 4041 cities will be part of Swachh Survekshan-2018 to be
conducted from January to March, 2018.  



           The
methodology of the survey focuses on collection of data from 3 sources: 

 

1.      Service Level Progress: 
This will carry 35% weightage in the survey, where ULB’s documents are
physically verified to assess whether systems and processes are in place to
implement Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) in the most efficient way. 

 

2.      Direct Observation:
will have 30% weightage to observe and ascertain general cleanliness in the
cities by making random field visits in different parts of the city and public
conveniences covering Community/Public Toilets.

 

3.      Citizens Feedback: 
has been given 35% weightage to diagnose the experience of the citizens –
city’s pulse is checked by collecting citizens response against 6 specific
questions covering issues around general cleanliness and sanitation related
progress made by the city.  SwachhataApp, a grievance mechanism tool handed over
to citizens also contributes in indicating the efforts made by the cities in
resolving the issues raised by the citizens.  Till date more than 49 lakh
citizens have downloaded the App.

                Shri Hardeep Puri, Minister of State(I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs has stressed on the need for innovation in low cost materials and technologies for the poor.  Delivering the keynote address at the Global Housing Construction Technology Challenge(GHCTC) – Design Workshop here today, he mentioned about the great work done by several research organizations for easier and cheaper materials like stabilized mud-blocks, bamboo, waste-recycled, etc. and innovative construction employed for disaster relief, re-used elements, traditional techniques and local resources and hoped that this could include not just PMAY(U), but also the large rural component and several urgent and transitory needs of urban housing. 

 

GHCTC is a 2-day Workshop organized by the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs on 4th & 5th January, 2018.  Bloomberg Philanthropies, World Resources Institute(WRI) India, senior professors from the US, officials from various State Governments, and other stakeholders are participating in the Workshop.  Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs while addressing the participants informed about the entire process involved in the Global Housing Construction Technology Challenge and expressed confidence that the Workshop would provide a platform for discussing key issues involved in the process.  

 

 

Addressing the participants at the conference, Sh Puri stated that the challenge lies for those designing the competition. The GHCTC has to be inviting to all, with clear benefits, and yet scrupulous in its adherence to transparency, accountability, and quality. Only if the Challenge is successful in letter of competition and spirit of meeting the outcomes, would it be worthy of the vision of the PM. “I can see this challenge inviting innovation in not just Construction technology (processes of putting the materials together as a building), but also related aspects, such as:

 


	Material technology (science of developing new / improving existing building materials)
	Structural systems (science of transferring loads and countering external forces) 
	Building services (the amenities lifelines that enable habitation) 
	Building physics (performance of the buildings after construction)


 

There could also be innovation in resource management (including land, labour, capital, machinery, etc.), Project management and material & labour resource logistics, Site services & infrastructure planning (for and after construction) and Overall value-chain enhancement management of the construction process, he further said.

 

The Sessions will include: Principles of Challenge Prize Design, Problem Definition and Competition Goals, Round Table with key industry stakeholders, Implementation Issues, Support Needed for Competition and Post-competition activities, risks and mitigation among others.

 Informing the Members present, the Minister informed that “The selection process of Smart Cities is based on the idea of Competitive and Cooperative Federalism and follows a Challenge process to select cities in two stages.  A two stage selection process has been followed.  In the first stage, total number of 100 smart cities has been distributed amongst the States and UTs on the basis of equitable criteria.  The State/UT subsequently have shortlisted and potential smart cities on the basis of preconditions and scoring criteria.  In the second state of the competition, each of the potential 100 smart cities had prepared their Smart City Proposal(SCP) which contained the model chosen (retrofitting or redevelopment or greenfield development or a mix thereof) and additionally include a Pan-city dimension with smart solutions.

 In Stage 1, all States/UTs shortlisted 98 potential Smart Cities to participate in Stage II.  Further, on the basis of requests received from States, 12 new potential Smart Cities (left out capital cities and equal scoring cities) have also been included to participate in All India Competition (Stage 2) of the Smart City Challenge Process. In Stage II, 90 cities (20 cities in Round1 in January 2016, 13 cities in fast track round in May 2016, 27 cities in Round 2 in September, 2016 and 30 cities in Round 3 in June 2017) have been selected so far. The other 10 cities are expected to be selected in this financial year (2017-18), the Minister further informed.

Under SCM 2,864 projects worth Rs.1,35,958 crore are in various stages of implementation. 148 projects worth Rs.1,872 crore have been completed; work is underway for 407 projects with a cost of Rs.15,600 crore. Further, tendering has started for 237 projects with a cost of Rs.13,514 crore and DPRs are being prepared for 2,025 projects worth Rs.1,02,260 crore. The progress with respect to implementation of projects pertaining to Smart Solutions, Smart Roads, Smart Water, Solar Rooftops, and Visible & Impactful is also underway.

 Union Minister of State for Labour & Employment (I/C) Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar inaugurated newly constructed auditorium of Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) on the occasion of 117th Foundation Day of DGMS at Dhanbad today. He expressed his happiness that he visited the coal capital of India i.e. Dhanbad and understood the ground reality of mining by visiting the mines. He promised to visit mines at frequent intervals unlike the situation wherein no Minister has visited Dhanbad for past 17 yrs.

 



 

He informed that 44 Labour Laws have been compiled and only four Codes i.e. code on Wages, Code of Industrial relations, Code on Social security and Code on Working condition and occupational Health and Safety, have been framed for simplifying the complicated procedure. 

On the occasion of Foundation Day Shri Gangwar informed the gathering that he visited the Underground & Opencast mine workings and understood the method of workings as well as the risk associated with it. He praised DGMS for keeping constant vigil on the hazardous process of mining and advising management to take safety measures for the benefit of persons working in the mine. 



While replying to a query raised by various trade union leaders and Peoples representatives, relating to closure of Dhanbad–Chandrapura Rly line, he urged that the matter has been decided by a committee formed by HPCC and PMO is following it up. He categorically stated that wherever public safety is involved, no chance would be taken even if there is a risk of 0.1%.    

 Shri Gangwar met with mine workers, trade union representatives and mine officials to understand mining culture, mining methods, status of safety and the issues related to occupational health and safety matters prevailing in the mine yesterday. He also visited Moonidih Underground Coal Mine of M/s. Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) which is highly gassy and mechanized underground Coal Mine. He inaugurated “Bolter Miner Machine” which deals with coal cutting including roof bolting for roof support system in belowground workings. He interacted with contractor’s workers while inspecting belowground workings.

 While interacting with trade union representatives, Minister stated categorically that “trade unions are our eyes” who brings the real facts before the law enforcing agency for suitable action.

He expressed hope that DGMS will perform as a team and work hard for the noble purpose of saving human lives and succeed in our endeavourer.

 

Shri Ravindra Kumar Pandey and Shri Pashupati Nath Singh, Members of Parliament of Giridih and Dhanbad and Senior officials of the Ministry and DGMS accompanied him during the two day visit.

Reforms in labour laws are an ongoing process to update the legislative system to address the need of the hour so as to make them more effective, flexible and in sync with emerging economic and industrial scenario. The Second National Commission on Labour has recommended that the existing Labour Laws should be broadly grouped into four or five Labour Codes on functional basis. Accordingly, the Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on Wages; Industrial Relations; Social Security & Welfare; and Occupation Safety, Health and Working Conditions respectively, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws. Out of these, the Labour Code on Wages has been introduced in Lok Sabha on 10.08.2017 and subsequently, referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. The rest of the codes are at pre-legislative consultative stage. 

The process of Legislative reforms on Labour includes consultation with stakeholders including Central Trade Unions, Employers’ Association and State Governments in the form of tripartite consultation. Suggestions/comments received during the tripartite consultations are taken into account/considered while finalizing the amendment in various Act/Rules. 

The Ministry has taken a number of legislative initiatives in labour laws during the last 3 years. Some of the important initiatives are as follows:

Ø  Amendment to the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 by which   eligibility limit for payment of bonus enhanced from Rs 10000/- to Rs. 21000/- per month and the Calculation Ceiling from Rs. 3500/- to Rs. 7000/- or the minimum wages.

Ø  Payment of Wages (Amendment) Act, 2017 enabling payment of Wages to employees by Cash or Cheque or crediting it to their bank account.

Ø  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 provides for complete ban on employment of children below 14 years in any occupation or process.

Ø  Maternity Benefit Amendment Act, 2017, increases the paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks.

Ø  The Employee Compensation (Amendment) Act, seeks to rationalize penalties and strengthen the rights of the workers under the Act.

Ø  Ministry has notified  “Ease of Compliance to maintain Registers under various Labour Laws Rules, 2017” on 21st February 2017 which has in effect replaced the 56 Registers/Forms under 9 Central Labour Laws and Rules made there under in to 5 common Registers/Forms. The number of forms provided under 3 Central Acts/Rules has been reduced from existing 36 to 12. The register can also be maintained in digitised manner. This will save efforts, costs and lessen the compliance burden by various establishments. 

Ø  A Model Shops and Establishments (RE&CS) Bill, 2016 has been circulated to all States/UTs for adoption with appropriate modification. The said Bill inter alia provides for freedom to operate an Establishment for 365 days in a year without any restriction on opening/closing time and enables employment of women during night shifts if adequate safety provisions exist.

Ø  A category i.e. Fixed Term Employment has been introduced under Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 to impart flexibility to an establishment to employ people in case of Apparel Manufacturing Sector to meet the fluctuating demands of the sector due to its seasonal nature.

The Mines Act, 1952 does not differentiate between the permanent and contractual labourer. However, the retirement benefit does not come under the purview of the Mines Act, 1952.

He requested for reduction of export duties on Iron ore up to 60% so that the Iron ore industry of Goa is helped. Ministers from the States of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh also participated. 

A total of 88 major mineral blocks have been notified by 9 States for auction and 33 blocks have been successfully auctioned having total estimated revenue to the state government over the lease period stands at Rs 1,28,388 crores. The additionality to States due to bringing in of the auction process shall be in excess of Rs. 99,000 crores, which will accrue as an additional revenue to the States only due to introduction of auctions for grant of mineral concessions. Thus, the auctions introduced by MMDR Amendment in 2015 have brought huge additional revenues along with greater transparency in allocation of mineral resources of the country. 

The recent amendment to the Mineral Auction Rules by the Union Mines Ministry to make the auction process less cumbersome were welcomed by the States to enable them to expedite the mineral auction process. As a result, post amendment of Rules in 2017, almost 30 blocks will be put up on auction in January 2018, which is the highest in a month since the auction route was adopted for allotment of the mineral blocks. 

More than 13,700 Crore rupees have accrued in the fund of District Mineral Foundation in the mining districts of major mineral rich states across the country. These funds are being utilized for projects under the Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana (PMKKKY) for the social welfare, protection of environment and infrastructure development of mining affected areas and thus help in creating a congenial mining environment in the local communities.

The need for initiating the auction process well in advance for the leases of merchant miners expiring in 2020 was stressed to ensure a seamless transition from the existing to the new lessees. The States informed about the efforts to draw a road map for the requirements of exploration, auction and subsequent clearances. Minister stressed that States should auction these mines well in advance to avoid disruption in mineral supply to downstream industry.

Mining Surveillance System (MSS) harnessing the space technology was applauded by the States on its impact in curbing the incidence of illegal mining. It was informed that the portal for MSS of major minerals will be extended to the minor minerals to handhold the States control illegal mining which is more rampant in minor minerals. States indicated their eagerness for implementation of MSS for minor minerals.  Of the 296 triggers generated 48 cases of illegal mining has been deducted.

The Minister also said that ""Gharib Nawaz Skill Development Centres"" have been established in 100 districts across the country where various courses related to job-oriented skill development are being provided.

The Minister underlined that during the last one year, “Hunar Haat” has been successful in providing employment and employment opportunities to more than 3 lakh artisans and other people associated with them.  He pointed out that proper implementation of various schemes of the Ministry from skill development to educational empowerment to scholarships like “Gharib Nawaz Skill Development Scheme”, “Seekho aur Kamao”, “Nai Manzil”, “Begum Hazrat Mahal Girls scholarship”, “Nai Udaan”, “Padho Pardesh”, “Free Coaching”, “Ustaad”, “PM’s new 15 point programme” etc has been ensured with the cooperation of these Inspecting Authorities.

In this year's Civil Services exam, about 125 Minority youth have been selected, out of which 52 are from Muslim community”, he averred.

                The Government, led by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has succeeded in getting India’s Haj quota increased for the consecutive second year.  For the first time after the Independence, a record number of 1 lakh 75 thousand and 25 pilgrims from India will go for Haj 2018. The decision by the Saudi Arabia Government to increase India’s Haj quota for 2018 has come days after Shri Naqvi signed the bilateral annual Haj 2018 agreement between India and Saudi Arabia with Haj and Umrah Minister of Kingdom of Saudi Arabiaat Makkah.

Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said that three years ago, India’s Haj quota was about 1,36,020, which has been increased during the last two years, to a record – 1 lakh 75 thousand and 25.   “This has happened because of the growing popularity of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi and due to India’s cordial and strengthened relations with Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations under the leadership of Shri Modi”, the Minister said. He added that last year also, Saudi Arabia had increased India’s Haj quota by 35,000. 

On behalf of Government of India and people of the country, Shri Naqvi thanked the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Excellency, King Salman bin Abdul Aziz al Saud and Saudi Arabia Government for the increase in India’s Haj quota.  He emphasised that besides this, Saudi Arabia has also given the green signal for India’s decision to revive the option of sending Haj pilgrims through sea route also and officials from both the countries will discuss all the necessary formalities and technicalities, so that Haj pilgrimage through sea route can be started in the coming years. 

The Minister pointed out that about 3 lakh 55 thousand applications have been received for Haj 2018. Shri Naqvi said that for the first time, Muslim women from India will go to Haj without “Mehram” (male companion). More than 1, 300 women have applied to go for Haj without male “Mehram” and all of these women will be exempted from lottery system and allowed to proceed to Haj. Women above 45 years of age, who wish to go for Haj, but who do not have a male companion, are allowed to travel for Haj in groups of 4 or more women, according to the new Indian Haj policy.

                UnionMinister for Minority Affairs ShriMukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said that Saudi Arabia has given the green signal for India’s decision to revive the option of sending Haj pilgrims through sea route also and officials from both the countries will discuss on all the necessary formalities and technicalities so that Haj pilgrimage through sea route can be started in the coming years. 

A decision in this regard was taken yesterday,during the signing of bilateral annual Haj 2018 agreement between India and Saudi Arabia by Shri Naqvi and Haj and Umrah Minister of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, His Excellency Dr Mohammad Saleh bin TaherBenten at Makkah.

Shri Naqvi said that sending pilgrims through ships will help cut down travel expenses significantly. “It will be a revolutionary, pro-poor, pilgrim-friendly decision”, ShriNaqvi added. The practice of ferrying Haj pilgrims between Mumbai and Jeddah by waterways was stopped from 1995. 

The Minister said that another advantage with ships available these days is they are modern and well-equipped to ferry 4,000 to 5,000 persons at a time. They can cover the 2,300-odd nautical miles one-side distance between Mumbai and Jeddah within just 3-4 days. Earlier, the old ships used to take 12 to 15 days to cover this distance. 

Shri Naqvi said that last yearhe had discussed the option to revive sea route for Haj pilgrimage with Transport and Shipping Minister ShriNitinGadkari. Now, after the green signal from the Saudi Arabia Government, officials from India and Saudi Arabia will discuss all the issues related to Haj pilgrimage through sea route.   He said that this time Haj 2018 has been made 100 per cent digital/online. India’s transparent and digital Haj process has been lauded by Saudi Arabia Government. 

Shri Naqvi said that for the first time Muslim women from India will go to Haj without “Mehram” (male companion). Separate accommodation and transport has been arranged for these women Haj pilgrims in Saudi Arabia and women “Haj Assistant” will be deployed for their assistance.  

He pointed out that more than 1300 women have applied to go for Haj without male “Mehram” and all of these women will be exempted from lottery system and allowed to proceed to Haj. Women above 45 years of age, who wish to go for Haj but who don’t have a male companion, are allowed to travel for Haj in groups of 4 or more women according to the new Haj policy of India.

He pointed out that his meeting with Saudi Arabia’s Haj &Umrah Minister His Excellency Dr Mohammad SalehBenten was very fruitful, as a constructive discussion was held on whole gamut of issues related to the Indian Haj pilgrims and Haj pilgrimage. 

On behalf of the people and Government of India, ShriNaqvi, extended gratitude to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Excellency Saudi Arabia King Salman bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, for his keen personal interest and initiative in organising a successful Haj 2017. “We are confident that under the dynamic and visionary leadership of His Excellency Saudi Arabia King Salman bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, the excellent relationship between India and Saudi Arabia will be further strengthened and reach new heights”, he said

ShriNaqvi said that India and Saudi Arabia share the ideals of global peace, progress and prosperity. “We are tied together with strong civilizational, cultural, economic and political links. The regular visits by the leaders and senior-level officials of the two nations have further strengthened the relationship between the two nations”, the Minister stated.  “The visit of the Prime Minister,ShriNarendraModi, to Saudi Arabia during April 2016has added new dimensions to our vibrant relationship”, he added.  

Shri Naqvi said that Haj pilgrimage is one of the strongest pillars of India-Saudi Arabia ties. 

The Minister emphasised that about 3 lakh 59 thousand application have been received for Haj 2018. “For the first time, we have given option to Haj pilgrims to opt for another embarkation point. This will ensure that there is no financial burden on Haj pilgrims even after removal of Haj subsidy. This decision has received overwhelming response:,ShriNaqvi said.

                On receipt of 15 ratifications, the International Solar Alliance (ISA) Framework Agreement entered into force on the 6th December, 2017 thereby making ISA a de jure treaty based international intergovernmental organisation. So far 19 countries have ratified and 48 countries have signed the ISA Framework Agreement.

In one of its first outreach programmes post-ratification, the ISA hosted a two Day Event ‘International Solar Alliance Forum’ during 17-18th January, 2018 at the Future World Energy Summit (WFES) 2018. WFES is a signature event of a global initiative, Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, hosted by Masdar scheduled during 15-18th January, 2018 at Abu Dhabi (UAE). During the ISA event an ISA Pavilion was also set up for dissemination of information about ISA and its activities and programmes. 

On the first day of the ISA Forum, 17th January, 2018 the Ministerial Plenary of ISA Energy Ministers was held. The ISA Ministerial was attended by seven Energy Ministers of ISA Member countries. They presented their views on benefits of collaboration, synergies, and knowledge sharing at the international level to scale up solar energy for universal energy access and investing in Innovations, Technology and R&D for solar projects followed by breakout sessions. 

Delivering the keynote address on the occasion, Shri Raj Kumar Singh, Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Government of India congratulated ISA for organising the ISA Forum as its first overseas outreach activity. He stated that over the years the Renewable Energy has become cheaper and is set to replace conventional energy, which is a healthy development, and added that India has one of the fastest growing Renewable Energy programmes in the World and the country would achieve its target of 175 GW of installed Renewable Energy capacity well before 2020. The Minister said that that ISA shall help mobilize sufficient funds for solar energy projects. During his address, Shri Singh announced setting up of a $ 350 million solar development fund by the Government of India for solar projects financing. 

While formally opening the Ministerial session and welcoming the participants, Shri Upendra Tripathy, Interim Director General of ISA informed about exchange of LoIs / MoUs of nine solar related projects which various company and bankers signed early in the day. He further stated that ISA shall stand for translating ‘Action into Transaction’. He also informed that over 100 projects shall be signed by April 2018 under ISA umbrella. He also thanked member countries and various stakeholders making ISA a reality in a short time. He further informed about and extended invitation for the 2nd RE-INVEST meet to be held in partnership with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India during 19-21th April, 2018.

The Ministerial Plenary was followed by three technical panel discussions:  ISA a Trillion Dollar Opportunity; Networking of R&D Institutions in ISA Countries for Solar Innovation, Incubation & Start-Ups; and Best Practices for Solar Capacity Building in ISA Countries. These sessions were attended by Energy Ministers, policymakers, Multilateral Banks & Finance Institutions, R&D Institutions & Innovators, solar project developers and manufacturers, investors and other stakeholders.

At the end of the ISA Ministerial session, the YES Bank committed financing solar projects of over $5 Billion. M/s CLP and M/s NTPC Limited announced forging partnership deal with ISA and committed to make voluntary contribution of $1 million each to ISA fund corpus. IEA and GCF also announced entering into partnership with ISA.

Being an action-oriented organisation, ISA promotes actual on ground rolling out of solar projects. Therefore, during first half of the day Ten companies exchanged LoIs/MoUs for solar related projects in the ISA Pavilion. The companies are: Vyonarc Development Ltd., Greenko Solar, Gensol Group and SOLARIG from Spain, Shakti Pump, Refex Energy, Amplus Solar, TATA Power, Jackson Solar, Hero Future Group and Zodiac Energy.

About ISA

The Paris Declaration establishes ISA as an alliance dedicated to the promotion of solar energy among its member countries. The ISA’s major objectives include global deployment of over 1,000GW of solar generation capacity and mobilisation of investment of over US$ 1000 billion into solar energy by 2030. As an action-oriented organisation, the ISA brings together countries with rich solar potential to aggregate global demand, thereby reducing prices through bulk purchase, facilitating the deployment of existing solar technologies at scale, and promoting collaborative solar R&D and capacity building.

When the ISA Framework Agreement entered into force on December 6th, 2017, ISA formally became a de-jure treaty based International Intergovernmental Organization, headquartered at Gurugram, India. As of now the ISA Framework Agreement has been signed by 48 countries, with 19 of them also depositing the instruments of ratification with the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India.

                The 1st PIO-Parliamentarian Conference was inaugurated by Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi here today. Welcoming the delegates to the Conference, the Prime Minister said that while many people may have left India over the course of hundreds of years, India continues to have a place in their minds and hearts. The Prime Minister said that PIOs (Persons of India Origin) are like permanent ambassadors of India and partners for India's development, who have an important position in the Action Agenda till 2020, drafted by the NITI Aayog.

Addressing the 2nd Plenary Session on ‘Resurgent India-Role of PIO Parliamentarians’, Shri Ananthkumar, Union Minister for Chemicals & Fertilizers and Parliamentary Affairs said that, “I am honoured to be here on the momentous occasion of the 1st PIO-Parliamentarian Conference and extend a warm welcome to all of you.”

At the outset, the Minister congratulated Union Minister for External Affairs (MEA), Smt. Sushma Swaraj for hosting this important and historic conference, where a Rainbow of Parliamentarians of Indian Origin from over 20 Democracies of the World gathered to share Parliamentary best practices and mutually enrich each other with their experiences.

Shri Ananthkumar stated that under the dynamic leadership of Shri Narendra Modi, India and the Indian Diaspora has found greater recognition and popularity among the Comity of Nations. This is evident from the unprecedented response received by the Prime Minister in every country that he has visited. Occasions such as this conference provide us with an opportunity to further strengthen and diversify our engagement with diaspora, the Minister added.

Elaborating the contributions of PIOs in different countries around the world, Shri Ananthkumar said that people of Indian origin have contributed considerably to the economy and social upliftment of the countries in which they lived. The Minister conveyed his sincere appreciation at how languages like Hindi, Bhojpuri, folklore such as Ramayana, literature from India, traditional cuisine etc. have not only survived but are flourishing in these countries. This was possible and achieved only because Indian migrants in these countries were determined to preserve their traditions, norms and customs. “All of you here are members of our extended family and bound by ties of history, emotional attachment, cultural affinities and kinship”, the Minister added.

Shri Ananthkumar called the gathering as a mini World Parliament of People of Indian origin. He congratulated the External Affairs Minister for laying a strong platform today by organizing todays summit on PIO Parliamentarians. Further, he stated that PIOs have achieved great heights in Politics and Governance in various countries and also become Heads of State which is a matter of great pride and happiness for 1.25 billion Indians here.

The Minister invited the august gathering of PIOs to partner in the development of their Motherland India. Flagship schemes of Government of India such as Skill India, Start up India, Stand up India, Make in India etc. provide a great opportunity for PIOs to partner in India’s resurgence as a global power, Shri Ananthkumar stated

The session also witnessed distinguished PIO Parliamentarians placing their experiences before the gathering and how they are still very much connected to their roots in India through the Principles of Peace and Harmony that they have imbibed from their ancestors. Other dignitaries who addressed the gathering included Shri M. Thambidurai, Deputy Speaker Lok Sabha and Shri D.K. Mulay, Secretary MEA.

                The crucial issue of Efficient Functioning of Legislatures will be deliberated by the Whips of Parliament and Legislatures and the Ministers of Parliamentary Affairs of various States during a two-day Conference beginning on Monday, January 8, 2018 in Udaipur, Rajasthan. Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Ananthkumar will inaugurate the 18th All India Whips’ Conference, which will also consider, inter alia, the rolling out of e-Sansad and e-Vidhan in Parliament and State Legislatures to digitize and make their functioning paperless. This Conference is being organized by the Union Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs (MoPA) and the Government of Rajasthan. Chief Minister of Rajasthan, Smt. Vasundhara Raje would be the Chief Guest for the Inaugural Session of the Conference. 

Shri Vijay Goel, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Statistics and Programme Implementation and Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, would also grace the Inaugural session and chair different deliberation sessions during the Conference.

e-Sansad and e-Vidhan are mission mode projects of Government of India under Digital India, to make the functioning of Parliament and State Legislatures paperless. MoPA is the Nodal Ministry for implementation of both the projects. According to the agenda prepared by MoPA for the Conference, these projects would make the functioning of Parliament and State Legislatures participative, responsive, transparent, productive and more accountable to the public and make the entire Legislative process more efficient. Further, this environment friendly initiative is in line with the ‘Go Green’ initiative of the Government. 

Some States have made good progress in the field of automation of their Legislatures, yet consumption of huge volume of papers is still going on in these States. In order to address this issue and economize the entire Legislative process, e-Vidhan is proposed to be implemented in all the States/ UTs with Legislatures. For rolling out e-Vidhan in the State legislatures, funding to the maximum extent would be provided by the MoPA. The Delegates of the Whips’ Conference would deliberate on the issue and make suggestions/ recommendations for making the rolling out of e-Vidhan a success.

Other agenda items for deliberation during the Conference would include steps to be taken to ensure Efficient Functioning of Legislatures, while the States and Union territories will present Action-Taken Reports on recommendation of the 16th and 17th Whips’ conferences held in Goa in 2014 and Visakhapatnam in 2015, respectively.

Further, the Whips’ Conference would make other recommendations for smooth and efficient working of Parliament and the State Legislatures in the light of the experience gained by the Whips. The Union Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs would then forward these recommendations to the (i) the State Chief Ministers; (ii) Ministers-in-charge of Department of Parliamentary Affairs in the State Governments; and (iii) Presiding Officers of the State Legislatures and all the invitees to the conference, for information and necessary action.

A whip is an important member of a political party’s parliamentary body, having a central role in ‘Floor Management’ in both the Houses of Parliament and is responsible for discipline within the party. Their main job is ensuring that their members in Parliament and legislature vote in line with the party’s official policy on important issues and make sure that the members turn out for important votes. Such an importance of Whips in the Parliamentary system had been acknowledged by organizing the First All India Whips Conference at Indore in 1952, in the very first year of general elections to the First Lok Sabha.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh visited the site of River Devika Cleaning Project in Udhampur today, which has been included in Government of India’s National River Conservation Project (NRCP). 


He was accompanied by Member of Parliament Shri Shamsher Singh Manhas, Deputy Commissioner Shri Ravinder Kumar and other senior officers. He was informed that the cleaning process around river Devika had already started and the civil work of construction of cremation ghats etc, will be undertaken after the appraisal of the DPR by IIT experts, which may take some more time.

 

Earlier in the morning, Dr Jitendra Singh arrived at the venue of the 3-day “Vision 2018” exhibition, where he went around each of the stalls depicting achievements of different Ministries and Departments over the last 3 years of the Union Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

 

Addressing the students on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh urged upon them to spend sufficient time in stalls depicting achievements of ISRO and other scientific departments. This, he said, might promote their hidden aptitude for scientific research and work.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, in the field of space technology, India has covered an incredible journey, beginning from singing of hymns of ""Chandamama"" to achieving a supremacy and credibility wherein even the most advanced nations of the world like USA and Russia today approach Indian scientists to launch their satellites from Indian Launching Stations like Sriharikota.


Dr Jitendra Singh said that we have vindicated our pledge to use Atomic Energy for peaceful purposes and today India has set an example as a nation with nuclear energy being major source for its ever-increasing needs. 

 

In the field of economy, Dr Jitendra Singh said, under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the entire world is looking up to India to give a lead. It was evident more than enough at World Economic Forum at Davos.

                NEW DELHI, January 27:  A delegation of Central University Non-Teaching employees met Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and demanded  resumption of “festival allowance” which, according to them, they were receiving earlier but had got discontinued .

 The delegation led by Shri Surjit Manhas, President, ""Delhi University and College Karamchari Union (Regd.)"" stated that that non-continuation of festival allowance had affected nearly 4 lakh employees of 44 Central Universities and autonomous bodies all over India, who were earlier getting this bonus/allowance on the occasion of festivals like Deepawali, Dusshera, Eid etc.

The members of the delegation also presented to the Minister, a memorandum wherein, it was pointed out that whenever in the past, the Government of India passed an order for extension  of grant of “Non-Productivity Linked Bonus” to its employees, the order always automatically got implemented also for the Central Universities and autonomous bodies. However, the order for the extension of the bonus issued for 2015-16 and 2016-17 was not implemented in case of employees of Central Universities and autonomous bodies.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that he will seek the views of concerned departments on the issue.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that over the last three years, the Government led by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has taken a number of decisions to ""ease doing of business"". As a result of this, India has began to attract investors from all over, who are willing to set up ventures even in the hitherto lesser preferred regions like the North Eastern part of country. In other words, Dr Jitendra Singh said, India, including the Northeast, is fast emerging as a preferred destination for business and entrepreneurship.

Speaking at a ""Luncheon Round-table"" meet on the topic ""Sustainable Production through Fourth Industrial Revolution Innovations"" in Davos, Switzerland yesterday, Dr Jitendra Singh allayed the fears expressed by some of the participants about excessive regulatory controls exercised by certain governments across the world and said, that in the last over three years, the Government of India has made a conscious effort to bring in ease of business through relaxation of avoidable regulations. He said, within a short span of 3 to 4 years, the Government has done away with nearly 1,500 such rules and regulations which had become obsolete and irrelevant in this age.

Expressing his views on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robots to promote production and business in the times to come, Dr Jitendra Singh said, while these technological advances can prove an asset by contributing to sustainable development, the challenge, however, would be to ensure that human intelligence does not end up becoming a slave of Artificial Intelligence. He said, since this is the first generation faced with this new phenomenon, it might take another one or two generations to actually evolve a mechanism of healthy synergy between the Human Intelligence and the Artificial Intelligence. The most ideal situation would be when the human and the artificial components supplement each other's resources to accomplish Fourth Industrial Revolution Innovations, he said.

Dr Jitendra Singh said, while the international markers indicate that the year 2020 will be a milestone for evaluating progress towards the 2030 agenda, in India, an important milestone would be 2022, the year which marks the completion of 75 years of Independence. Several of the Government's recent initiatives have been targeted to meet their end point by 2022, following which the further journey would be to boost competitiveness and aim at targets beyond.

Dr Jitendra Singh also referred to the steps taken recently by India to resort to alternative sources of energy with the twin-objective of meeting the growing energy needs of India and at the same time, taking cognizance of the environmental factors. In this regard, he said, when, for example, over 50% of global Greenhouse Gas emissions result from the cradle-to-factory journey of goods, India has already geared itself to astounding levels of innovation in all spheres.

In addition, Dr Jitendra Singh also referred to new opportunities for public-private collaboration being facilitated by the Government with least intimidation or interference from the Government. This would also serve as an incentive for small and medium enterprises to stay relevant in future scenario changes, he added.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that travel security is imperative to check terrorism, both domestic terrorism as well as cross-country terrorism. This, he said, calls for not only constantly evolving new innovative methods to ensure security but also equally as much requires the involvement and vigilance on the part of the citizen. 

 Speaking at a workshop on the topic “Shaping the Future of Security in Travel” in Davos, Switzerland, today, Dr Jitendra Singh said, he was impressed to hear from the panelists the new comprehensive methods being evolved to create a foolproof framework for security in travel, but, he said, let us not forget that the terrorists and the violators of norms are also constantly evolving new methods to evade or bypass the detection of travel crime or travel related security checks. At this moment, he said, when we are holding a panel discussion over here on this subject, he cryptically remarked that somewhere a similar group of crime promoters may also be holding a similar discussion as to how to negate the new methods of security check.

While underlining the importance of forewarning through alarm, Dr Jitendra Singh also cautioned against the alarm system getting “alarmist”. Since out of hundreds of travellers, he said, there may be a rare isolated one who could be a suspect and therefore, the procedures of security checks also need to be made easy, convenient, and citizen-friendly.

Let us not forget, Dr Jitendra Singh said, that cross-border movement of legitimate travellers has, for centuries, enabled and sustained international trade, tourism driven economy and intermingling of cultures. Therefore, he said, an optimum mechanism needs to be evolved wherein, there is a zero-chance of a potential criminal or terrorist escaping a security check but at the same time, the mechanism does not prove deterrent to legitimate travellers. 

During the workshop, presentations were made by experts from Interpol, US Department of Homeland Security, officials from Counter-Terrorism Directorate of United Nations and representatives of Intelligence Wing of People’s Republic of China on the various new methods being tried for comprehensive and easy recording of fingerprints and other parameters without using the conventional methods practised in the past. Upgraded Digital Technology, Artificial Intelligence and Productive Analytic Techniques were also discussed.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh  said that the world is looking for a new “global” roadmap with uniform parameters, in spite of the diversity and heterogeneity. He was speaking at a panel discussion on “From Fragile Cities to Renewal” at  the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on  January 23, 2018. He said that it might not be possible to easily visualise the local perspective in different countries because of their diverse characteristics. For example, the population of Switzerland is only 8 million which is less than the population of Delhi, but nevertheless, with an accountable government and citizen participation, maximum problems arising in a growing world could be addressed. Other panellists included Mr David Cameron former Prime Minister of United Kingdom and Mr Berset , President of Switzerland. 

 

Dr Jitendra Singh further said that more than 239 cities in the world were classified as “fragile” due to pollution, conflict, terrorism, unemployment and lack of electricity, besides other factors. What was needed, he said, was to upgrade the urban space and offer better facilities to the population. When asked to narrate his experience of fragile cities in the context of insurgency in the North Eastern region of India, Dr Jitendra Singh said, in the last three and half years of the Modi Government, a lot of stability in the region has been established. He asserted that insurgency and “fragility” also have a correlation with lack of development and ineffective political leadership. He said, corruption not only leads to loss of moral authority of the State leadership but also causes a huge pilferage of the State exchequer, which would otherwise be gainfully utilized to address the fragility.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh added that with the growing aspirations among the youth, which is a welcome development, there will always be a certain amount of fragility noticeable even in the most ideal situations because fragility itself is a relative term and what was fragile yesterday may not be fragile today, and what is fragile today may not fragile tomorrow.

                             The 27th lecture of the “Lecture Series” organized by the Commission was delivered by Smt Sumitra Mahajan, Hon’ble Speaker, Lok Sabha here today on the topic “My Experiences as a Representative of People”.

 

            The distinguished speaker spoke about the need for society to introspect and look within itself  in order to change attitudes towards corruption, and to further the positive ideal of ethical conduct.  Her address drew inspiration from India’s traditional ideals in this regard and she discussed a wide range of issues using examples from traditional Indian spiritual thought as well as from her experiences as a representative of the public. She opined that society must look inwards at itself for inspiration in order to promote good conduct, both in the public as well as private spheres of life. The importance of prevention as being more effective than punishment was emphasized in her lecture. She also spoke of the need to examine instances of spending more than known sources of income in order to detect corruption.

 

The audience was told of many interesting instances of her experiences as a public representative, which served to highlight the need for society to introspect upon the decline in ethical values and the need to promote integrity in public life. The duties and responsibilities of a public representative were also explained using many examples from her interactions with people from all walks of life.  She felt that we ourselves are collectively responsible for this social change and we must draw inspiration from our own culture and ideals in order to do so.

           

Her initiatives towards setting up the Speakers Research Initiative in Parliament and the importance to training for members of Parliament were also discussed during the course of the lecture. The lecture was followed by a lively question and answer session.

 

            Invited dignitaries from the Government of India,  CMDs , Directors and senior executives of Central Public Sector Enterprises and full time and part time CVOs based in Delhi/NCR attended the lecture along with and other officers of the vigilance administration. The lecture was available for online viewing as it was webcast live through NIC. The link to the recorded webcast is available on the Commission’s website  www.cvc.nic.in.

                Kishtwar in Jammu and Kashmir will soon get a full-fledged Airport facility with provision for Aircraft landing and taking off, for which, an upgraded Airstrip will accordingly be constructed adjacent to the Chaugan ground in the city. 

This was disclosed here today by Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space Dr Jitendra Singh, after presiding over a joint meeting of Senior Officers of  J&K State Government and Defence Forces to sort out the nitty-gritties and other related aspects of the issue.

The meeting was arranged by MoS Defence Dr Subhash Ramrao Bhamre and also attended by Minister of State (I/C) Transport, Jammu and Kashmir, Shri Sunil Sharma.

The State Government was represented by Chief Secretary Shri Bharat Bhushan Vyas and Principal Secretary to Chief Minister, Shri Rohit Kansal through video conferencing, while those physically present at the meeting included Shri Dheeraj Gupta, Principal Secretary (Coordination), Government of Jammu and Kashmir, Dr Mandeep Bhandari, former Divisional Commissioner, Jammu and Shri Angrez Singh Rana, Deputy Commissioner, Kishtwar.

Defence Forces were represented by Major General TV Seha ADG, Brigadier Rahul R Singh, DDG, Brigadier Rohan Anand, Col. Gaurav Sanan, Lt. Col. P M Singh, ADG Shri K J S Chauhan, ADG Shri GS Rajeswaran and DEO Udhampur, Shri V K Bhatia.

 Dr Jitendra Singh said that in the next few days a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will be signed between the Government of Jammu and Kashmir and Defence Authorities wherein an Airstrip will be constructed and maintained by Government of Jammu and Kashmir, and the extra piece of land required for construction of this strip will be made available from the land currently under the possession of the Army. The airstrip that will come up, he said, will be for joint use, both by the civilian authorities as well as the Indian Army.

However, Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Government gives highest preference to the priorities and concerns of the Indian Army and is very sensitive about requirements of the Armed Forces. Considering this, he said, as per the MoU, the Army Authorities will be entitled to exercise priority and prerogative on different issues related to the bilateral arrangement between Civilian Government and the Army.

Dr Jitendra Singh said, with the development of a full-fledged Airstrip at Kishtwar, the town will get round-the-year facility for landing and taking off of Aircraft and even though the operation of commercial flights may not be possible in the very near future, but there will be certain and definite provisions for landing of State Aircrafts, chartered flights and operation of emergency flights.

 Dr Jitendra Singh appreciated the efforts made by MoS (Defence) Dr Subhash Ramrao Bhamre in having arranged a joint meeting of the Army authorities and the civilian administration in order to expedite the decision and to clear the reservations, if any. He also appreciated the follow-up feedback provided from time to time by J&K MoS (I/C) Transport and local MLA Shri Sunil Sharma.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has been approached by ""Save Sharda Committee, Kashmir"", a registered organization, for facilitating the resumption of annual Sharda Peeth Yatra to Sharda in district Muzaffarabad in Pak-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (PoJK). The Yatra has remained suspended since 1948.

A delegation led by Shri Ravinder Pandita held a meeting with the Minister here today and discussed various aspects and the sanctity of the Yatra. In a written representation, they stated that the Yatra used to be undertaken annually in the month of August i.e. Badaun on Ashtami of Shukla Paksh and would take the route via Kupwara in Kashmir to the Peeth in Muzafarrabad, PoJK. The Yatra was largely organized by the Dogra rulers in the pre-Independence era, but has remained suspended after 1948.

Dr Jitendra Singh informed the delegation that he is aware of the issue and has also held a series of meetings in this regard.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that the services of superannuating and retired employees should be gainfully utilized to carry forward the flagship programmes of the Union Government led by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

Addressing the Pre-Retirement Counseling (PRC) Workshop ‘Sankalp’ for the retiring employees of Ministries/Departments, organised by the Department of Pensions & Pensioners' Welfare (DOP&PW) here today, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the superannuating employees can be inducted into advisory bodies of their respective offices and also to dispose of grievances. Due to increasing life expectancy, an active life lies ahead of an employee at sixty years of age and the individual is at his prime capacity and energetic. Retirement should rather be viewed as the beginning of a new innings, he said. Such interactive workshops should come out with ideas on how best the services of retired employees can be utilized, he added.

Dr Jitendra Singh said for the first time this Government has cared for Pensioners as much as for the working employees. Minimum pension has been raised to Rs.1,000, Jeevan Pramaan biometrics introduced for submitting digital Life Certificate, more than 1,500 obsolete rules scrapped and the Anubhav platform introduced for the first time for retiring employees to share their experience.

In his address, Shri KV Eapen, Secretary, DOP&PW and Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances (DARPG), said the DOP&PW has so far registered more than 2,000 pensioners and conducted Pre-Retirement Counselling for more than 3,300 employees under the Sankalp project. The Department has registered 19 Pensioners' Associations and 16 NGOs to involve Central Government Pensioners in social activities.

The PRC workshops target retiring personnel two to two-and-a-half years before the retirement date. Topics covered are (i) Formalities to be covered for timely payment of retirement dues (ii) Financial planning for the amounts received at retirement (iii) Preparation of Will (iv) CGHS facilities after retirement and (v) Post-retirement opportunities through Sankalp.

The “Sankalp’ programme has been initiated by the Department towards this end and a web portal of the same name has also been launched. Pensioners, Pensioner Associations and NGOs can register on the website http//www.pensionersportal.gov.in/sankalp.

There are approximately 40,000 fresh retirees every year from the Central Government Civil establishments alone. This number could be close to 1,00,000 including defense, railways, posts and telecom. In addition there is a pool of around 50 lakh existing pensioners.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has called for blending the cinema entertainment with the aspirations of ""New India"".

Addressing a galaxy of leading luminaries of South India Film Industry, including some of the well known film makers, directors and music composers from Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada cinema in Chennai yesterday, Dr Jitendra Singh recalled early years of his life spent in the city when Devi Cinema Complex and Star Theatre were the cherished destinations for any youngster and said, gone are the days when a visit to a theatre to watch a movie was a festive occasion, planned several days in advance and thereafter recalled for several weeks to follow. 

Today, he said, even a child has a movie theatre in his pocket and can watch a movie of his choice with a mere touch on the screen of his smartphone. It is precisely this segment of youngsters, who comprise over 70% of India's population today, that the film maker will have to learn to relate to and act as torch- bearers of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's incredible new initiatives aimed at involving the youth in the task of nation building, he added.

Dr Jitendra Singh observed that a film with entertainment but without a message remains hollow, while a film with a message but no entertainment fails to attract the young audience for whom the message is meant. In this regard, he cited the distinct example of Satyajit Ray whose films optimally blended both these ingredients and specifically gave example of Ray's ""Pather Panchali"", a 1950's production, which till this day attracts houseful during every re-run.

Pointing out in the audience to the grandson of A. V. Meiyappan, the producer of several popular Hindi films of yester-years, Dr Jitendra Singh said, there was a time when even the Bombay Film Industry was dominated by South Indian Film Houses like AVM, Gemini and LV Prasad. The South Indian Film Industry, therefore, owes it to its legacy to assume a pan-India role and become messengers of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's ""New India"" mission, he said.

Responding to demands like constituting an Indian Film Commission and certain modifications in GST, Dr Jitendra Singh invited a delegation of Film Industry to New Delhi for a free-frank exchange of views on these issues. The programme was jointly organized by ""South India Film Chamber of Commerce"" and ""Bharat Niti"".

                The Central Government is the competent authority to initiate disciplinary proceedings against IAS officers for misconducts while working in the affairs of Government of India. The Central Government is also the competent authority in respect of disciplinary proceedings initiated by the State Government where subsequent to inquiry, a major penalty has been proposed. There are 36 disciplinary proceeding against IAS officers (State and Central cases) currently in progress at various stages.

The Central Government also considers proposals for sanction for prosecution against IAS Officers for offences under P.C.

DoPT in exercise of powers conferred under sub-rule 3 of the Rule 16 of the All India Services (Death-cum-retirement Benefits) Rules 1958 has prematurely retired, in public interest, 4 (four) IAS officers since 2014.  None of the officers belong to the Jharkhand Cadre.

As per report of the State Government, 3 IAS officers belonging to Jharkhand cadre are currently facing disciplinary proceedings for misconducts while working in the affairs of the State Government.

 This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.

                Public and pension matter grievances received are generally related to various service issues. Pension grievances relate to non-payment/delay in payment of pensionary benefits, delay in revision of pension/family pension etc. All such grievances are required to be redressed in a decentralized manner by the Ministries/ Departments concerned as per work allocation under the Allocation of Business Rules, 1961.  Grievances relating to State Governments are forwarded to them for appropriate action. 

As per the guidelines issued by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, any grievance, including a pension grievance, is required to be redressed within a period of 2 months by the concerned Ministry/Department/Organization to which it pertains and in case it is not possible, an interim reply with reasons for delay is required to be provided.

Grievance disposal is monitored through review meetings with the representatives of Central Ministry/Department/Organisation. Reviews of grievances of Ministries/Departments are also undertaken every month during meetings conducted on PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance And Timely Implementation) platform. An Electronic Dashboard for Secretaries has been created showing the consolidated status of grievances disposed and pending on CPGRAMS. Weekly reminders through SMS are also sent for pending grievances.   

When an official is allocated the work of redress of grievances, it is part of his/her responsibility, and action, if required, can be taken against the erring officials for dereliction of duties as per the relevant Service Rules.

This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.

Also, in the examination for recruitment of Multi Tasking Staff (non-Technical), conducted by SSC, the candidates have the option of answering in the descriptive paper in English or in any language included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.

As the Staff Selection Commission makes its recruitments on an All India basis, state-wise recruitment data is not maintained centrally by SSC. During the last three years, the number of candidates recruited by the Commission through various examinations conducted by it are given below:

 


	2014-15 :    58066
	2015-16 :    25138

                Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan here today met media persons and briefed them about the acquisition of HPCL by ONGC.

Shri Pradhan informed that the Government of India entered into an agreement with ONGC on January 20, 2018 for sale of its 51.11% equity shareholding in HPCL at a consideration of Rs. 36,915 crore.  Shri Pradhan said this is in line with the Budget announcement 2017-18 to create oil majors in the country.  This has completed the successful implementation of the Budget announcement in a time bound manner.

Shri Pradhan said ONGC-HPCL integration is the first innovative vertical integration that will help leveraging the strength of both the companies.  Through this acquisition, ONGC will become India’s first vertically integrated ‘oil major’ company, having presence across the entire value chain.  The group company will have advantage of having enhanced capacity to bear higher risk, take higher investment decisions and improve business.  

Shri Pradhan said ONGC-HPCL integration offers huge potential to attain economies of scale at various levels of operations and consolidation in petrochemical and refining business.  The group company will leverage the financial strength and diversify business portfolio in upstream, midstream and downstream sectors.  Shri Pradhan said that HPCL will continue to be a Board-managed Central Sector Public Enterprise and will maintain its distinct identity and brand value.

Reasons for shortfall in production with respect to target are as under:
	
	
	Delay in implementation of ‘Conversion of Sagar Samrat to MOPU’ & ‘Integrated Development of B 127 Cluster’ 
	Production from NBP field in western offshore affected due to ESP related issues. 
	Increase in water cut in wells of Heera, Neelam and B-173 fields. 
	Frequent power shut down hampered artificial lift operations and caused unexpected well closure in Mehsana.

                With the objective to achieve Prime Minister’s vision for Energy Security and Sufficiency, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) has steered a plethora of reforms in the recent past years. Aligned with the objective, the Government launched the Bid Round I under Open Acreage Licensing (OAL) Programme for international competitive bidding on 18 January, 2018. 

The landmark event was presided by Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, along with senior Government officials here today. The Launch event witnessed a pre-eminent gathering of industry captains, ambassadors, policy makers, bankers, leading professionals from E&P companies’ etc. totaling over 100 attendees. 

For the first time in India, 55 bidder selected blocks, each carved out by prospective bidders themselves in promising basins with an area of 59,282 Sq. Kms were announced for bidding. This is the largest offering of acreages; the Government has announced in the past 8 years.

During the event, he launched the e bidding portal and the Notice Inviting Offer (NIO). The ebidding portal is a fully safe, secured and transparent ebidding platform wherein the bidders can submit their bids from anywhere in the world. In parallel, ‘DGH OneTouch’ mobile application was also launched which would act as a one stop solution for accessing information about DGH, policy initiatives and other relevant information on the move.

Thereafter, he delivered a stimulating Keynote address, highlighting the increasingly growing positive industry sentiments and signs of steadfast progression of India’s O&G sector. He mentioned the scale of proactive reforms being enacted at MoPNG major ones being: Introduction of Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP), Discovered Small Field (DSF), National Data Repository (NDR), Hydrocarbon Resource Reassessment study. He mentioned that the reassessment study undertaken for the first time in two decades has indicated a significant increase (~50%) in resource estimation. Also, he shared his thoughts on future endeavors of further strengthening the E&P ecosystem by reforms focused on boosting the indigenous production of oil and gas by infusion of world class technology and collaboration with global oil and gas companies. Shri. Dharmendra Pradhan also took time and briefed the media to share the advances and future strategies in the Indian E&P sector.

Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri. K.D. Tripathi set the context for the occasion by delivering a talk on an overall outlook of the Indian E&P sector. 

DG, DGH Shri Atanu Chakraborty, delivered a detailed Presentation on Indian E&P Opportunities, showcasing the array of investment prospects in the sub surface of Indian sedimentary basins. He shared a glimpse of progressive Indian Economy with a focus on the upstream sector and also briefly touched upon, how India is set for high and sustained growth in energy demand, in years to come. Aside to this, he also showcased the spread of EOIs received across the diversified regions in Indian territories.

Joint Secretary (Exploration) Shri. Amar Nath delivered closing remarks and commended various stakeholders for their contribution in streamlining the Indian upstream sector and achieving greater feats.

This was followed by a comprehensive facilitation workshop entailing salient features of the Policy and also apprised the audience with the detailed information of blocks on offer. The facilitation workshop observed a turnaround of over 200 participants across the E&P populace.

Comparative status as compared to 2013


	In 2013, the project was approved by GoI and Foundation Stone was laid by the then President of Congress Smt. Sonia Gandhi on 22.09.2013 at Pachpadra, Barmer just prior to the imposition of Model Code of Conduct on 27.09.2013. 



	4800-acre land was allotted to the Project without any lease deed being executed, 
	Hence, surface right of the land was in the papers only. 
	Even Environmental Clearance to the project was not obtained. 
	No physical activities on the ground was initiated in 2013. 
	All this display lack of due diligence on the part of the then State Government. 


 


	With the NDA Government at the Centre, genuine and earnest efforts were made by the State Government with the intervention of Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, GoI and project was re-negotiated on better and advantageous financial terms & conditions. 



	Earlier, IRR of the project was 6.32 and now it has been improved to 12.2%.
	This has resulted in reducing the financial burden on the State Government from Rs 56,040 crores to Rs 16,845 crores resulting in saving of Rs 40,000 crores to the State ex-chequer. Cost of the land to the tune of Rs 188.80 crore has been adjusted against the upfront equity of GoR in the project.


 


	It was decided to start physical activities at the project site before the formal ground breaking ceremony so as not to repeat the mistake committed by the then State Government of launching the project only on paper. 


 


	For this, all the statutory clearances/approvals for commencement of work were obtained expeditiously like

	
		Environmental Clearance from MoEF, 
		Approval of GoI to the revised project and 
		Execution of Lease Deed of the allotted land of 4567.32 acre for the Refinery Plant.

Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shri Raj Kumar Singh, in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today, informed that the outcome of the Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme has exceeded the expectations, as the realized energy saving of 8.67 Million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent (MTOE) is about 30% more than the assigned energy saving targets of 6.68 MTOE. 

Shri Singh informed that under the scheme, PAT Cycle-I was completed in March, 2015. In this cycle, 478 Designated Consumers (DCs) belonging to 8 sectors (Aluminium, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, Fertilizer, Iron & Steel, Pulp & Paper, Thermal Power and Textile) were notified with mandatory specific energy consumption (i.e. energy use per unit of production) reduction targets. 

Further, these cumulative energy saving targets of 6.68 MTOE were to be achieved in a cycle of 3 years.  At the end of the PAT Cycle-I, upon monitoring and verification (M&V), which was carried out by third party energy auditors, accredited and empanelled by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), it has been assessed that these DCs have collectively achieved energy savings of about 8.67 MTOE.

                A high level meeting was held today between Union Minister for Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal and Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai, to discuss the setting up of a massive rail coach factory in Latur, Maharashtra by Indian Railways. This plant would manufacture Electric Multiple Units for suburban trains and coaches for metros. 

Work on this project will be done on high priority with fast track processing of all approvals. Maharashtra Government has offered several concessions including in land, taxes and etc.

Marathwada, the region where Latur lies, is amongst the most backward areas of Maharashtra. There have been few central government projects in this region. This will massively benefit 'Make in India', and bring employment to a large number of people. In addition, it will create an industrial ecosystem in the drought prone region boosting shift from agriculture to industry. It may be noted that the region suffers from heavy migration to other parts of the country.

                The Union Minister for Railways Shri Piyush Goyal has appealed to citizens to avoid selfies / stunt near railway tracks. 

Following is the text of Minister's statement:

“Dear Citizens,

In the last few days, I have seen news and videos in which there have been accidents of youth taking selfies or showing stunts near railway tracks. It is very disheartening to know about these accidents. You all are the future of the country and my appeal is to avoid putting your life at risk and stay alert around the railway tracks. Follow the rules & signs and pay attention while approaching rail crossings.

Jai Hind.

Piyush Goyal”

                A one-day Mega Conclave called ‘Nirman Samvaad’, a first ever interaction between the Ministry of Railways and the Construction Industry concluded here. This Conclave was organized by Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. (RVNL), a dedicated arm of Ministry of Railways for fast track implementation of railway projects. This Mega Conclave was an initiative taken by Hon’ble Minister of Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal as a step to streamline procedures and remove bottlenecks to ensure the fast track implementation of projects on the railways.  It was a major event aimed at taking measures to ensure expeditious implementation of ambitious Railway Infrastructure Development Plans.

The Conclave was chaired by the Hon’ble Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal who had a personal interaction with the participants. The conference was also attended by Chairman Railway Board, Shri Ashwani Lohani and Railway Board Members, Chairman & Managing Director, RVNL, and senior officers from Railway Board, Zonal Railways, CPSEs etc. The event was attended by the top management of 400 construction & consultation companies.

The meeting was thrown open and all participants were given opportunity to raise their respective issues and suggest remedies. The highlight of the conclave was a lively interaction session conducted by Hon’ble Minister of Railways.  The issues raised covered concerns on contract management, improving cash flows, execution of projects, expediting the inspection of various items to be procured from RDSO approved vendors, adoption of FIDIC documents by Railways, delay in acquisition of land, problems in obtaining licenses of minor minerals,  suggestions for reducing the time and cost over-run, expediting the payments of the contractors, risk sharing between the employer and the contractor, increased requirement of training of technical manpower,  availability of traffic and power blocks, proper estimation of quantities at the time of inviting tenders were discussed.

Minister of Railways gave directions that the suggestions made by the participants should be followed up and necessary changes in the systems and procedures be made to ensure that the pace of project execution is improved to implement the Ministry’s ambitious investment programme.

Backgrounder:-

Ministry of Railways has ambitious plans for development of Rail infrastructure to meet the ever increasing transport needs of the nation and a huge investment in this sector has been planned. The main focus is on:- 


	The pace of augmentation of railway network needs a quantum jump.  The speed of execution of doubling/tripling and quadrupling which is about 800 kms per annum for the last 5 years, needs to be  accelerated 2 to 3 times to meet the increasing demand.
	Completion of electrification of the full rail network in the next 3 to 5 years. So far out of 63000 RKM, 25201 RKM have been commissioned on electric traction till 31st March 2017.  The  average pace during last five years is about 1300 RKMs per annum which needs to be increased by 6 to 8 times to  electrify remaining 38000 RKMs to meet the ambition of complete electrification.
	Taking up of Hill Rail Projects, including Rishikesh - Karanprayag, Char Dham rail connectivity, Bhanupalli - Bilaspur and on to Leh.
	Completion of ongoing and proposed Dedicated Freight Corridors.
	Mumbai- Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Corridor and other projects on Diamond Quadrilateral to link the major Metropolitan Cities.

                In a major initiative to ensure expeditious implementation of ambitious Railway Infrastructure Development Plans, Ministry of Railways is organizing a “Mega Conclave” tomorrow i.e. 17th January, 2018 with all stakeholders including leaders of the construction industry. The Conclave will not only see Railway Board Members and Senior Zonal Railway Officials interacting with construction industry captains but will also see Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal to have a mutual dialogue and personal interaction with the participants. The Conclave named as “NIRMAN – SAMVAAD” is being organized by Railways PSU Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. (RVNL) which is a dedicated arm of the Ministry of Railways for fast track implementation of railway projects. The Conclave will provide an opportunity to discuss the impediments/constraints faced in implementation of the projects and to seek suggestions to remove bottlenecks and bring about efficiencies in project execution on Railways.

Senior Officers of Railway Board, Zonal Railways, CPSEs and top executives of about 400 construction and consultancy companies will be participating to deliberate upon the issues/impediments being faced by the industry and arriving at possible remedies thereof.  The ambitious Infrastructure Development Projects of Indian Railways include Doubling Projects, Electrification Projects, Hill Railway Projects, Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) and High-Speed Projects on diamond quadrilateral.

Backgrounder:-

Ministry of Railways has ambitious plans for development of Rail infrastructure to meet the ever increasing transport needs of the nation and a huge investment in this sector has been planned. The main focus is on:- 


	The pace of augmentation of railway network needs a quantum jump.  The speed of execution of doubling/tripling and quadrupling which is about 800 kms per annum for the last 5 years, needs to be  accelerated 2 to 3 times to meet the increasing demand.
	Completion of electrification of the full rail network in the next 3 to 5 years. So far out of 63000 RKM, 25201 RKM have been commissioned on electric traction till 31st March 2017.  The  average pace during last five years is about 1300 RKMs per annum which needs to be increased by 6 to 8 times to  electrify remaining 38000 RKMs to meet the ambition of complete electrification.
	Taking up of Hill Rail Projects, including Rishikesh - Karanprayag, Char Dham rail connectivity, Bhanupalli - Bilaspur and on to Leh.
	Completion of ongoing and proposed Dedicated Freight Corridors.
	Mumbai- Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Corridor and other projects on Diamond Quadrilateral to link the major Metropolitan Cities.


 

It has been experienced that there are constraints of capacity from the side of both executing agencies as well as from railways to meet the demand. 

The Conclave will address all these issues and workout solutions with a view to ensure fast track implementation of all railway projects.

                 The Centre for Transportation Research and Management (CTRAM), is an autonomous body of Transport Professionals in the country organized a National Rail Transport Seminar with the theme “Railways for Sustainable Development” in New Delhi today i.e. on 13th January, 2018. Minister of State in the Ministry of Railways & Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Communications, Shri Manoj Sinha, who could not attend due to some unavoidable reason in a message to the seminar said that “Sustainable development represents an extraordinary challenge and opportunity for Indian Railways, which is a key driver in the economic growth in India. While Indian railways contribute significantly towards sustainable development, it has to evolve and sharpen its strategy to become a flag bearer for such sustainable development. It is hoped that the seminar will throw new ideas and strategy for the benefit of Railway Sector”. 

The key note address at the inaugural session of the seminar was given Shri Mohd Jamshed, Member Traffic, Railway Board and Ex-officio President, CTRAM. The welcome address was given by Shri R K Tandon, Executive Director & Secretary, CTRAM. The other speakers at the inaugural session included Shri Mangu Singh, MD, DMRC and Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director, ADB. 

In his key note address, Shri Mohd Jamshed, Member Traffic, Railway Board said that, “I firmly believe that the topic for discussion today :“ Railways for sustainable development” is of utmost relevance for an economy like India that is resolutely ascendant on a high growth trajectory. As this country changes gear, the developmental choices that are made at this stage will undoubtedly be crucial, for the long term sustainability of development itself. 

Indian Railways (IR) is presently one of the world’s largest rail networks, spread over 66,000 route Kms.  As India’s “ engine of growth” which is how the hon’ble Prime Minister has fondly referred to it,  Indian Railways  today operates a staggering 20,000 plus  trains everyday to move, more than 3 million tonnes of freight traffic and more than 23 million passengers on a daily basis . 

         Over the years, declining modal share of Railways has no doubt, been a cause of concern for the policy makers and this thinking gets lucidly articulated in the Budget speech in 2016: 

         “The modal share of IR has been consistently declining over a long period of time. This trend has had a negative impact not only on the Railways but on the entire economy. We are determined to reverse this slide. There are three solution sets for this issue –expanding the freight basket of IR, rationalizing the tariff structure and building .. (capacity). 

         History of Indian Railways would regard 2015-16 to 2017-18 as a watershed years when the task of modernizing and transforming Indian Railways joined integrally, the mainstream agenda of Government of India.  As the budget 2017-18 emphasized, “Railways, roads and rivers are the lifeline of our country. We are now in a position to synergize the investments in railways, roads, waterways and civil aviation”. 

The merger of the Rail   Budget with General Budget in 2017-18 was in fact,  a part of the  larger transformation agenda of the government for Indian Railways. 

To walk the talk in this direction, the government since 2014, has rolled out a comprehensive and multipronged transformational strategy for IR. To address the root problem of financial starvation, the strategy aims to resolutely deal with the vicious cycle of underinvestment, strained capacity and low investible surpluses through a sustained and substantial capex. 

To make the Indian railways customer oriented and responsive to the needs of the economy, a number of  structural and policy reforms have been undertaken and to instill a culture of efficiency and cost consciousness in the organization,  a revamp of  its maintenance and accounting practices is underway. 

         On the CAPEX front, the total capital and development expenditure of IR since 2014-15 has risen from Rs 54000 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 94,000 cr in 2015-16 and 1.11 Lakh crore in 2016-17 and is targeted at 1.31 lakh crore in 2017-18. This is slated for further increase in the coming years.    

         Besides an enhanced support from the Government, IR has invoked various innovative financing models & Extra Budgetary Resources such as  loan from LIC, PPP models and models based on cooperative federalism through joint ventures with state governments for mutually beneficial projects.

         With the above input it is expected that the issue of capacity constraints will be addressed satisfactorily to meet the transportation needs of the country in days to come.

A large number of initiatives have been taken in the passenger sector, including steps to enhance ease of ticketing especially with IT aids, promoting digital transactions, to  meet passenger demands by creation of more capacity , fresh customer specific train products (like Humsufar, Antyodaya etc ), Improvements in the quality of travel experience. IR has also increased its focus on Non- fare revenue generation through monetization of its vast fixed, movable and soft assets. 

As a result of these initiatives, the decline in the number of passengers, a regular feature since 2012-13, has not only been arrested in 2016-17 but also reversed.  For the first time in last 5 years, the figures of 2017 -18 (April-Nov)  indicate a 0.7% percent increase in passengers carried, vis-à-vis last year and a 5.13 % increase in revenues. The reserved segment has witnessed a growth of 6.36 % during this period as compared to previous year.   

         Likewise, Freight sector reforms undertaken in the recent past after extensive ‘Samvaad’ with stakeholders have resulted in logistics costs of rail users getting lowered by 20-30%  from initiatives like  elimination of 10% port concession charge , elimination of the 15% Busy season surcharge for a significant period, reduction in documentation requirement and promotion of ease of doing business by elimination of the dual charging policy for export and domestic iron ore,  permitting 43 additional commodities for containerized movement at Lower (FAK )rates, opening more goodsheds ( category I and II goodsheds) to container traffic, facilitating reduced lot sizes (and lowered  inventory requirements/costs) for commodities like cement, salt ,foodgrain and  fertilizer transported in the  covered wagons of IR, etc. The policy of Long Term Contract with major freight customers has proved to be a game changer which offers freight incentives  on long term basis on incremental revenue. We have already signed 21 long term contracts within 6 months of launching the policy – a move towards building long term partnership.

         As a result of all initiatives taken, the revival in the freight traffic by IR, to retain and regain its market share is quite evident in the loading performance for first 9 months of current financial year. Indian Railways have loaded 39 MT more this year upto December in all commodities; a growth of around 4.5% almost 8 times of incremental loading against last year, including a massive growth in coal transportation.  Likewise loading in Raw material for Steel plants, Container sector and the segment called “ Other Goods” have also surpassed last years figures.

The recent decision by Hon’ble Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal for 100% electrification of Indian Railways in next 5 years would even further reduce carbon emissions from rail transport. Other areas where  we are doing our bit includes efforts in moving fast towards 100% LED fittings to reduce non traction energy requirement, installing upto 500 MW solar plants to reduce dependence of fossil fuels – on stations, hospitals , station buildings ( like Katra station), setting up wind power mills ( as in ICF Chennai), blending bio-diesel with HSD and exploring other alternate fuels like CNG, improving water use efficiency and rain water harvesting, planting trees along the railway track, constructing green buildings and so on.

So the good news seems to be - that despite the challenges and roadblocks Indian Railways have made the right course corrections and are definitely headed on the right path”. 

 

The seminar consisted of 4 sessions namely:- Inaugural Session, Technical Session on International Perspective, Technical Session on National Perspective & Technical Session on Sustainability & Railways-Horizon and Perspective.

The other notable speakers at the seminar included Ms Martha Lawrence, Senior Railway Specialist, World Bank, Mr. Michael Williamson, Head of Office, Sub-regional Office for South & South-West Asia, UN-ESCAP. 

The highlight of the seminar was that Young Indian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS) Officers (Probationers) of 2015 Batch made 5 different presentations at the seminar.

The seminar was attended by Senior Railway Officials, Retired Railway Officials, Transport Professionals & Experts, Industry Representatives, and Academicians. 

The Centre for Transportation Research and Management (CTRAM) is an autonomous body of Transport Professionals. It was registered as a “Society” in December 1998. CTRAM works under a Governing Council comprising of Senior Transport Professionals and is headed by Member/Traffic, Railway Board, as its ex-officio President. One of the key objectives of CTRAM has been to bring Industry, Government Agencies and Transport Professionals together for bringing improvements in infrastructure, systems and procedures. CTRAM provides a forum for cross-sectoral, cross-functional dialogue between policy makers, Industry and Transportation Professionals and Academician on issues relating to emerging needs for the fast growing economy.

                Indian Railways continues to take steps based on new technology to facilitate execution of its various activities. It has now been decided to introduce modern Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Kiosk Machines for quick & easy printing of tickets booked through UTS App for mobile phones by suburban commuters.

 Western Railway (Hqrs. Mumbai) becomes first railway zone to introduce this facility for its Mumbai suburban commuters of Western Railway. This new facility will make printing of tickets much simpler and quicker. Under this facility just by simply placing the screen of mobile phone displaying the SMS of the ticket booked through UTS Mobile App in the designated slot provided in the OCR Kiosk machine and the machine will simply read the SMS and print ticket immediately.

In the first phase, 25 OCR Kiosks have been planned by Western Railway for installation, out of which 20 Kiosks have been installed and became functional w.e.f today i.e. 11th January, 2018 on five Mumbai Suburban Stations of Western Railway namely Churchgate (1 Kiosk), Dadar (6 Kiosks), Bandra (3 Kiosks), Andheri (5 Kiosks), and Borivali (5 Kiosks). In addition, installation of five more OCR Kiosks at Churchgate is under process and will be installed shortly.

The use of these Kiosks will facilitate the passengers to get print-out of tickets booked through UTS mobile app and also reduce the queues at booking counters/ATVM machines thereby promoting transactions through UTS mobile app. Presently, passengers have to feed their mobile number and booking ID received on their mobiles, in the ATVM machines to get their tickets printed or get it through UTS counter. This new facility of simply placing the screen displaying the SMS in the designated slot provided in the Kiosk will also reduce the time of printing of tickets as the machine will simply read the SMS and print tickets immediately.

                In a major digital initiative to help plan the traffic flows and optimize freight operations, Ministry of Railways have launched Smart Freight Operation Optimisation & Real Time Information (SFOORTI) App for Freight Managers which provides features for monitoring and managing freight business using Geographic Information System (GIS) Views and Dashboard. 

Salient features of SFOORTI Application are as below:


	With this application, movement of freight trains on Geographic Information System (GIS) view can be tracked.
	Both passenger and freight trains can be tracked over Zones/Divisions/ Sections in single GIS View.
	Freight business can be monitored.
	Comparative Analysis of Zonal/Divisional Traffic.
	Analysis of new traffic captured and traffic lost.
	This app provides a Bird’s eye view of all Freight Assets in a single window.
	Provides end to end Rake movement on Geospatial view
	Expected Traffic at Interchange points to evaluate daily performance can be viewed.
	Performance of each zone and divisions with respect to loading and utilization of freight assets can be viewed.
	Sectional performance monitoring for sections, divisions and zones shall help in traffic routing.
	Freight terminal and sidings can be better monitored to ensure better turnaround of rakes. 


FEATURES OF SFOORTI APPLICATION:


	Freight Operation Information System Map View–A Geographic Information System (GIS) based monitoring and management tool has been designed and developed in CRIS which provides layered views of freight trains on Indian Railways network which can help plan the traffic flows and optimize freight operations. The FOIS Map View has been designed to cater to Divisional, Zonal and Board levels of management for improved freight operations. It provides Geo-Spatial view of freight train performances, some of which are: 



	Position of all freight trains on Indian Railways Network on basis of their last reporting in system. 
	Movement of freight trains from one zone/division to another zone/division across IR.
	Position of Rakes on the network detailing commodity wise loading.
	Position of all freight stock on Indian Railways - both loaded and empty on the network.
	Monitor Inward/ Expected traffic flow at Interchange points along with real time monitoring of forecast for day against actual interchange. 
	Indicates new traffic Origination-Destination (OD) captured over IR network.
	Indicates Rakes detaining beyond permissible free time on the network.
	Loading trends of major commodities is available identifying the loading performances of terminals and their Origination-Destination (OD) on the network.
	Section wise speed performance of freight trains across the network which is updated on real time basis. This is done by making use of real time sectional running data captured through Control Office Application and comparing it with the historical freight running data to work out the level of performance in the section on real time basis. 



	Forecasted Rakes Awaiting Interchange: 


Monitoring of all the loads, which have been forecasted for the divisional interchange, but the same interchange has not yet reported. Forecasted Loads Awaiting Interchange are plotted on two colour themes, based on their divisional interchange direction.


	Stock Specific / Commodity specific Rake Position: 


Position of Rakes for Specific Type of Stock can be viewed. Loaded and Empty Rakes of specific Rake Types are plotted on the Indian Railways network map in Different colours. Further drill down along with load path can also be viewed on the Geo-Spatial view. 


	New Origination-Destination Added in IR: 


Monitoring of New Origination Destination flows captured during the specified period in comparison with those loaded in previous 3 years data. Detail are represented either Commodity wise or Origination Destination (O-D wise).


	Loading Trends for Major Commodities: 


Monitoring of Loadings across Indian Railways for major commodities during a period. Terminals are presented on the GIS View, with different commodity shown in different colour.  Further drill down is also provided to view Individual Origination-Destination (O-D Flows). 


	Freight Train Performance:


Performance of Freight Train Running on Indian Railways Sections can be viewed through this option for each working shift. Performance is determined through comparison of current sectional speed with the benchmark average speed. 

Section Performance is represented as Below Average, Average or Good based on section performance against benchmarks (Shown in different colours). Entire section is plotted on the map on its congestion colour theme.

Congestion status is available in three shifts (00:00 to 08:00), (08:00 to 16:00) and (16:00 to 24:00).

                In-line with the philosophy of the Government to make systems and procedures digital and transparent, Research Designs & Standards Organisation (RDSO), (headquartered at Lucknow), the research arm of Ministry of Railways, has launched “New Online Vender Registration System”. This system was evolved after Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal undertook comprehensive review of the functioning of the RDSO. This new system provides major improvements and paradigm changes in the registration system over the earlier system. Public access to the information, expeditious process completion with defined timelines, simplification of procedures, round-the-year services, availability of all related information on RDSO Website, constant monitoring at all levels, reduction in cycle timelines, regular updation of online data, user friendly interface etc. are the hallmarks of the new system. Some of the salient features of this new system are given below:-


	Vendor need not come to RDSO for any activity related to his case for registration.
	All activities in vendor registration cycle have been tied to specific timelines and in case these activities exceed the allotted timelines, a system generated alert is flashed to all concerned officials and higher ups for immediate corrective action in the matter.
	The process of documents scrutiny and physical verification of the Vendor’s facility has been made a parallel exercise. Earlier 8 to 11 months would elapse before physical verification activity used to start. It used to start only after completion of document scrutiny. Now both the activities i.e. document scrutiny & physical verification start simultaneously. This is a major improvement over earlier process and would help in reduction of cycle timelines. 
	Process has been made simpler and user friendly. With the new online system implemented by RDSO, the Vendor can now deposit registration fee, submit documents, download technical drawings & specifications and interact with RDSO online. At each stage the vendor would get a system generated alert / acknowledgment regarding status of his case with details.
	Management dashboard has been provided for centralized monitoring of the whole procedure and the process work-flow with the objective of identifying bottlenecks , if any, and initiating corrective action


RDSO has invited Expression of Interest (EOI) for all the 600 plus items and has kept the window open with no timelines to enable wider participation and association of industries and interested vendors in developing products and new technologies for the Railways. Now vendors can register for any of the item throughout 365 days of the year. It will provide tremendous business opportunity for growth of new SMEs thus aiding job creation.

All RDSO controlled items have now been listed on RDSO website with specific timelines for Vendor Registration process for each individual item. RDSO will endeavor to complete the registration process for which the vendor applies within defined timelines.

 

All information and data pertaining to cases of vendor registration and all references pending at RDSO has now been brought into public domain by uploading it on RDSO website. Details of all cases are now available in public domain and can be accessed by everybody. Regular updation of this data is now being ensured by RDSO for information of all stake holders and general public.

It has been given directions to Zonal Railways to procure such cameras. This is in-line with Railways’ desire to use technology to enhance safety and efficiency in train operations.

“Drone” cameras shall be deployed to undertake monitoring activities of relief and rescue operation, project monitoring, progress of important works, conditions of track and inspection related activities. It shall also be used to assess preparedness of Non-Interlocking (NI) works, crowd management during fairs and melas, to identify scrap and also for aerial survey of station yards. It is going to be instrumental in providing real time inputs related to safety and maintenance of tracks and other railway infrastructure.

Under this initiative, West Central Railways with headquarter at Jabalpur (M.P) has become the first Zonal Railway to procure “Drone” cameras in Indian Railways. West Central Railways has already done a trial-run of those cameras last week on its all the three divisions in the following locations.


	Jabalpur Division – Narmada Bridge near Bhitoni
	Bhopal Division – (i) Nishatpura Yard; (ii) Third Line work between HBJ – Misrod.
	Kota Division – (i) Chambal Bridge near Kota; (ii) Dakania Talav Yard near Kota.


WCR further plans to use Drone for project monitoring in 3rd line work of Bina-Katni, Doubling work in Katni-Singrouli, Important Bridge inspections and Mansoon preparedness in deep cutting portions of Ghat Sections of Bhopal and Jabalpur Divisions. Earlier, demonstration of “Drone” camera was done for project monitoring of Railway Electrification work of Jabalpur Yard.

                  Railways carries out certain transport activities which are uneconomic in nature and are carried out in the larger interest of the country. The tariff policy on Indian Railways has traditionally been one of restraint with regard to increase in passenger fare. Indian Railways continues to incur losses every year by performing a variety of un-remunerative service. These losses are mostly due to (a) Low ordinary second class fare, (b) Low Suburban and non-suburban season ticket, (c) Loss on essential commodities carried below cost, and (d) a variety of concessions granted on passenger ticket. Working of uneconomic branch lines, too, imposes a heavy burden on Indian Railways’ finances. A gap is thus created between the revenue income generated through these service and their costs. The overall losses incurred on coaching operation services and on essential commodities carried below the cost of operation was ₹35959.59 Cr. in 2015-16.

                With a view to increasing speed of trains in Indian Railways, ‘Mission Raftaar’ was announced in the Railway Budget 2016-17.  The mission envisages a target of doubling of average speed of freight trains and increasing the average speed of all non-suburban passenger trains by 25 kmph  in the next 5 years.

Principal routes have been identified for raising of speed under Mission Raftaar. These are six routes on Golden Quadrilateral and diagonals namely, Delhi – Mumbai, Delhi – Howrah, Howrah- Chennai, Chennai – Mumbai, Delhi – Chennai and Howrah – Mumbai.  These six routes carry 58% of freight traffic and 52% of coaching traffic with a share of only 16% of the network.  Golden Quadrilaterals and its Diagonal routes have been prioritized for replacement of loco hauled short distance passenger trains by MEMUs/DEMUs having better acceleration and deceleration characteristics for fast pickup and braking.

The present installed capacity of the two coach production units involved in manufacturing of Mainline Electric Multiple Unit( MEMU) and Diesel Multiple unit (DEMU) coaches are as under:-

 


	
		
			
			              Name of the Unit
			
			
			   Present installed capacity (Annual)
			
		
		
			
			Integral Coach Factory (ICF), Chennai.
			
			
			  1700 coaches
			
		
		
			
			Rail Coach Factory(RCF), Kapurthala.
			
			
			 1500 coaches
			
		
	


 

               There is no specific capacity for manufacturing of DEMU and MEMU coaches. However, product mix of coaches i.e DEMUs, MEMUs, other self propelled coaches and passenger coaches etc is decided in annual Production Programme as per traffic requirements.  These six routes would require about 1200 MEMU coaches and 200 DEMU coaches. DEMU/MEMU coaches to be inducted progressively on balance routes of the Indian Railways.

                During the last three years, the number of consequential train accidents (including accidents at Unmanned Level Crossings) have decreased from 135 in 2014-15, to 107 in 2015-16 and further to 104 in 2016-17.  In the current year (upto 15th December, 2017) the number of consequential train accidents have reduced to 52 as compared to 87 in the corresponding period of the previous year.

In the Railway Budget 2016-17, Mission Zero Accident was one of the Missions announced, comprising the two sub-missions: 


	Elimination of unmanned level crossings (UMLC) over broad gauge in the next 3-4 years. 
	Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) to prevent collisions and signal passing at danger by the Loco Pilot. 


As far as steps taken for improving tracks is concerned, railway tracks are replaced through track renewal works which is an ongoing process. Track renewal works are undertaken as and when a stretch of track becomes due for renewal on the basis of criteria laid down in Indian Railway Permanent Way Manual on age cum condition basis viz. traffic carried in terms of gross million tonnes and incidence of rail fracture/failure, wear of rails and maintainability of track as per standards etc. In case any stretch of track is not renewed in time due to various reasons including scarcity of funds, material etc., suitable speed restrictions, if required, are imposed to ensure safe running of trains.

In order to improve signaling,  electrical/electronic interlocking system with centralized operation of points and signals are being provided to eliminate human failure and to replace old mechanical systems.

Superior and safer Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) Coaches having anti-climbing features have been  progressively introduced on Indian Railways to reduce the fatalities in case of accidents.     

In the Budget 2017-18, an exclusive fund called “Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh” (RRSK) has been made with a corpus of ₹1 lakh crore over a period of 5 years for giving a major boost to safety related works over Indian Railways for improving safety of tracks, rolling stock and proliferation of other safety technologies and training of staff.

                In a unique effort and as per vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister for “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”, three Ministries of the Union Government have joined hands to propel the Technology Mission for Indian Railways (TMIR). The Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Human Resource Development and the Department of Science & Technology (Ministry of Science & Technology) signed an MoU, on 4th January, 2018 at Rail Bhawan, New Delhi for joint funding of TMIR.

The MOU was signed today by Chairman/TMIR Prof. N.S. Vyas; Shri Alok Kumar, Co-Chairman/TMIR, on behalf of Ministry of Railways; Shri R. Subrahmanyam, Additional Secretary (TE) on behalf of Ministry of Human Resource Development and Dr. Neeraj Sharma, Adviser/DST on behalf of Ministry of Science and Technology.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Ashwani Lohani, Chairman, Railway Board said, “An MOU is being signed to facilitate collaboration and cooperation between the Parties in ‘Technology Mission for Indian Railways’. This MOU will facilitate the co-financing of ‘Technology Mission for Indian Railways’ by investment sharing for identified railway projects for applied research. The funding component of MOR is 30%, MHRD is 25%, DST is 25%. This Technology Mission will provide forceful impetus to India’s growth engine on the ‘Make in India’ vision track of the Hon’ble Prime Minister. The indigenous technologies would successfully be developed with win-win scenario to all the consortium members. While Indian Railways would get the world class technologies, Academic & Research Institutions would get involved in numerous applied research projects which would help them in reorienting research towards national objectives. I wish this Technology Mission with the motto of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas” a great success and hope that ground-breaking applied research done under the Mission will help Indian Railways provide a safer, more comfortable, hassle-free and faster journey to all rail users and will make Indian Railways the world leader”

Shri K.K. Sharma, Secretary/MHRD & Dr. Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary/DST also spoke on the occasion. 

The Ministry of Railways had set up the Technology Mission for Indian Railways (TMIR) as a consortium of Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Human Resource Development and Ministry of Science & Technology on an investment sharing model for taking up identified railway projects for applied research and use on Indian Railways.

As per this MoU, Ministry of HRD and Ministry of Science & Technology have agreed to fund the TMIR projects to the tune of Rs.75 crore each while Railways and Industries will also contribute to their respective shares.

The Technology Mission will take up R&D projects in the areas of heavy haul, safety, energy, environment and urban railways. The projects will be implemented through a Mission Implementation and Coordination Committee having members from the three Ministries, academia and industry. The projects will be implemented in the national R&D labs and academic institutions. Collaborations, wherever essential, will be entered into with similar foreign institutions. 

The “Mission Implementation and Coordination Committee” (MICC), consists of nominees of Railways, RDSO, Ministry of HRD, Ministry of Science & Technology and is headed by Prof. N.S. Vyas of IIT-Kanpur as Mission Chairman and Shri Alok Kumar, Chief Admin. Officer/Const/NR as Co-Chairman/TMIR. 

While through this consortium approach for technology development in mission mode, Railway will be benefitted with availability of world class indigenized technologies at very reasonable cost, academic research institutions will be benefitted with applied research and real situation output in the form of new products for immediate use and with availability of source codes for all such indigenized technologies at very low cost. The Indian industries will also be gaining in the form of production of new items to be used on Indian Railways with additional export potential, helping in the national cause of revenue generation and on the theme of ‘Make in India’.

Shri Ashwani Lohani, Chairman, Railway Board; Shri K.K. Sharma, Secretary/MHRD; Dr. Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary/DST; Senior officials from all the concerned Ministries graced the occasion. Members from press & media were also present during the MoU signing ceremony.

                Ministry of Railways in collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is implementing Real-Time Train Information System (RTIS) which involves tracking of train by placing GPS / GAGAN (GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation System) based devices on locomotives. In Phase-I, the RTIS project will cover about 2700 electric locomotives in which the GPS device will be installed. This phase is planned to be completed by December, 2018. Remaining locomotives will be covered in subsequent phases. 

The trials for this system have been done on New Delhi – Guwahati and New Delhi – Mumbai Rajdhani trains on six electric locomotives. A reliable and high level (about 99.3%) of real time reporting of arrival departure timing updates has been observed, which is considered adequate to meet the RTIS requirements. 

This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on 03.01.2018 (Wednesday).

Indian Railways has already introduced paperless ticketing. In case of e-tickets booked through Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website including through mobile application based ticket, Short Message Service (SMS) sent by IRCTC and screen shot of the e-ticket (Virtual Reservation Message) displayed through laptops/palmtops/mobile phones has been permitted as valid authority for travel alongwith prescribed identity proof in original subject to appearance of name of the passengers on the reservation chart and thus there is no need to take a print-out of Electronic Reservation Slip (ERS)/e-ticket in this case. 

Further, with a view to facilitating convenient booking of unreserved tickets by passengers without having to stand in long queues to purchase Railway tickets, Indian Railways has introduced the facility of booking of paperless unreserved ticket, season ticket and platform ticket through mobile phone in some stations in Central, Western, Eastern, Southern, South Eastern, South Central and Northern Railways.

                Indian Railways has tested the bio-diesel of different feed stock (Jatropha, Mahua, pongamia, waste cotton seed, Fish Oil, Soyabeen oil, Palm stearin etc.) in the different blending ratio such as B5, B10, B20, B50 and B 100 on its 16 cylinder ALCo and EMD engine test beds. The power performance of engine has been found satisfactory without any adverse impact on engine working. Besides, bio-diesel is found to reduce certain emission parameters which would have otherwise caused pollution in environment. 

Key Advantages of Bio-Diesel: 

(i) Renewable Energy source 

(ii) Derived from Vegetable oil 

(iii) Non-toxic & Biodegradable 

(iv) Contains no sulphur that causes acid rain 

(v) Higher Cetane number, better ignition quality 

(vi) Used directly in unmodified Diesel engines, neat or blended in any ratio with HSD 

(vii) Higher Lubricity – Can prolong engine life 

(viii) Flashpoint higher than HSD-safer to store & transport 

(ix) Environment friendly-less emissions 

(x) Has rural employment potential. 

 

Bio-Diesel is environment friendly. It substantially reduces unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matter in exhaust fumes. Sulphur dioxide emissions are also eliminated.

                An MoU was signed yesterday between National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHIDCL) under the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, and M/S IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd for construction of the 14.150  km long,  2-lane bi-directional Zojila Tunnel in Jammu & Kashmir . This would be India’s longest road tunnel and the longest bi-directional tunnel in Asia. The construction of this tunnel will provide all weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh and will bring about all round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions. The project has strategic and socio-economic importance and will be an instrument for the development of the economically backward districts in Jammu & Kashmir.

The project aims at construction of 14.150 km long two lane bidirectional single tube tunnel with a parallel 14.200 km long egress tunnel between Baltaland Minamarg in the state of J&K. The total capital cost of the project is Rs 6808.69 crore. It includes the cost towards land acquisition, resettlement andrehabilitation and other pre-construction activities as well as maintenance and operation cost of the tunnel for four years. The civil construction cost of the project is Rs 4899.42 crore. The construction period of the project is seven years which shall be reckoned from the date of commencement of construction.

The tunnel will be an engineering marvel, a first of its kind in such geographical area. It will have all modern technical safety arrangements such as cut and cross ventilation system, two axial fans,, fully transverse ventilation system, uninterrupted  power supply, CCTV monitoring, variable messaging boards, traffic logging equipment , tunnel radio, emergency telephone system etc.   

The main objective of the project is to provide all whether connectivity to strategically important Leh region in Jammu & Kashmir which at the moment is limited to at best 6 months in a year because of snow on the passes and threat of avalanches. This project, along with other ongoing projects like 6.5 km long Z-Morh tunnel at Gagangir would ensure safe, fast and cheap connectivity between the two regions of Kashmir and Ladakh.

Speaking on the occasion Shri Nitin Gadkari, Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation urged the construction company to make efforts to complete the project faster than the seven years assigned for it so that its  benefits can reach the people of the region at the earliest. He also urged the company to explore whether it is technically feasible to lay railway tracks in the tunnel along with the road. 

The projects will also increase the employment potential for the local labourers for the project activities. There would be enormous boost in employment as local businesses get linked to national market and the region is able to receive round the year tourist traffic.

                Toll plazas run by NHAI will soon have kiosks selling drinking water, tea/coffee, and packaged food for the convenience of highways users.   Termed as Highway Nest (Mini), these kiosks are under construction on both up-side and down-side at all 372 NH run toll plazas. These kiosks are being built on 10mx20 m paved platforms about 200-250 m from the toll plaza.  Toilet facilities for ladies/gents and physically challenged persons are also available at these sites.  

Two  Highway Nests (Mini) have been inaugurated already - one at Narayanpura toll plaza on NH-76 on Udaipur-Chittorgarh-Kota route under Regional Office, Jaipur and another at Hyderabad-Vijaywada section of NH-65, Korlapahad toll plazas at km 118.250 (TP-2) under RO Hyderabad.  Efforts are being made to have the Highway Nest (Mini) in place on all the remaining toll plazas by the end of March 2018.

                Bangladesh, India and Nepal have agreed on the text of the operating procedures for passenger vehicle movement in the sub-region under the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA) signed in June 2015, and will soon complete the internal approval processes for signing of the passenger protocol. The participating countries have also agreed to conduct more trial runs for cargo vehicles under the agreement. High-level officials of the three countries discussed the implementation of the MVA at a meeting held on 10-11 January in Bengaluru, convened and chaired by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) of the Government of India.A Bhutanese official delegation also attended the meeting as observers.

The landmark MVA was signed by Transport Ministers of the BBIN countries in Thimphu, Bhutan on 15 June 2015.  Trial runs for cargo vehicles under the MVA were conducted along the Kolkata-Dhaka-Agartala and Delhi-Kolkata-Dhaka routesin the past. The trials were successful in establishing the Agreement’s economic benefits.Bangladesh, India, and Nepal have already ratified the MVA and have agreed to start implementation of the MVA among the three signatory countries, with Bhutan joining after it ratifies the Agreement.

“I am encouragedby the strong commitment of the BBIN countries to move forward on the MVA initiative”, says Ms. Dakshita Das, MoRTH Joint Secretary and chair at the Bengaluru meeting. “India will do its best to make the MVA successful, making it a key instrument in accelerating cross-border trade and economic integration in the subregion,” she said.

The Asian Development Bank(ADB) has been providing technical, advisory, and financial support to the BBIN MVA initiative as part of its assistance to the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program, a projects-based economic cooperation initiative that brings togetherthe BBIN countries, Maldives, Sri Lanka and more recently, Myanmar. ADB is the secretariat of SASEC.

Meeting participants—which included delegations led by Mr. Safiqul Islam, Additional Secretary from the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, and Mr. Keshab Kumar Sharma, Joint Secretary from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport of Nepal, agreed on the text of thepassenger protocol, the document detailing procedures for cross-border movement of buses and private vehicles, to be signed by the three countries after completing necessary internal approval processes in their government. The delegations also agreed to continue to conduct trial movement of cargo vehicles along scheduled routes from April 2018 onwards, before finalizing the protocol for cargo vehicular movement. All participating country delegations described the meeting as a major milestone in regaining the momentum of transport facilitation in the subregion.

                The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways signed an MoU with Transport for London in New Delhi today. The MoU is aimed at using the expertise of TFL to revamp the public transport architecture in the country. TFL is the agency that manages the transport system for Greater London, and has demonstrated its capability by creating a strong and dependable public transport system in the city.    

Speaking on the occasion the Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari said that the country needs a good transport policy that promotes convenient and comfortable public transport system. He said an effective public transport system would be one that ran on electricity or other less polluting, indigenously produced fuels like methanol, ethanol and bio-diesel. Such a system would not only reduce pollution, but would also be cost effective, he said.

The Minister further said that to implement reforms in public transport systems in the country, we have to learn from the best practices across the world. The government has to facilitate the capacity building in public transport with learnings from the experienced and proven public transport agencies like TFL.

TFL has   created a unique system of operating buses in PPP model with over 17 operators under a single brand. A salient feature has been their double decker buses which provide for high capacity with low road space requirement. They have also been operating large number of electric and hybrid buses. The common mobility card is another successful product launched by TFL which has made travel easy for the commuters and accounting easier for the operators. As a result of creation of a successful public transport system in London, the city has not seen any increase in number of their private cars.

Shri Gadkari said that the proposed MoU will help to revamp the public transport and augment passenger capacity by way of creating a sustainable public transport system. It will help us adopt best practices for policy reforms in the transport sector. It will also enable improved customer services, harness from scientific data analysis and implement effective IT systems in the transport sector. The MoU can see an increase the use of electric vehicles in public transport and promote digital transaction for ticketing. It can also help us improve major procurement strategies including PPP models for operations, infrastructure maintenance strategies, infrastructure design and delivery, besides promoting behavioral change towards promotion of public transport.

The MoU will help to improve the overall public transport system in the country, improve passenger services and promote the use of high capacity buses in India. It will go a long way in strengthening ties and promoting bilateral relations between India and United Kingdom.

The MoU will help in strengthening the integrated public transport for all. This will help people from poorer strata of the society to have access to a quality public transport system.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval to the construction, operation and maintenance of 2-lane bi-directional Zojila Tunnel with Parallel Escape (Egress) Tunnel excluding approaches on Srinagar-Leh section connecting NH-1A at Km 95.00 and at Km 118.00 in Jammu & Kashmir on Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) mode. The construction of this tunnel will provide all weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh and will bring about all round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions. The project has strategic and socio-economic importance and shall be an instrument for the development of the economically backward districts in Jammu & Kashmir.

Project Details:


	The construction period of the project is seven years which shall be reckoned from the date of commencement of construction. 
	The civil construction cost of the project is Rs 4899.42 crore. 
	The total capital cost of the project is Rs 6808.69 crore.  It includes the cost towards Land Acquisition, Resettlement & Rehabilitation and other pre-construction activities as well as Maintenance and Operation cost of tunnel for four years.
	The Project aims at construction of 14.150 km long two lane bidirectional single tube tunnel with a parallel 14.200 km long egress tunnel excluding approaches between Baltal & Minamarg in the State of J&K. 
	The construction of approaches of this tunnel is being undertaken separately.
	The project will be implemented by Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRT&H) through National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL).


Impact:


	The main objective of the project is to provide all whether connectivity to strategically important Leh region in Jammu & Kashmir which at the moment is limited to at best 6 months because of snow on the passes and threat of avalanches. 
	This project alongwith other ongoing projects like 6.5 km long Z-Morh tunnel at Gagangir would ensure safe, fast and cheap connectivity between the two regions of Kashmir and Ladakh. 
	It will further increase the employment potential for the local labourers for the project activities. 
	The project, on completion, would lead to enormous boost in employment as local businesses get linked to National market and the beautiful region is able to receive round the year tourist traffic. 
	These sectors will generate employment at multiple levels.

1.             INTRODUCTION

1.1     2017 has been a major milestone year for the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. While the period since 2014 to 2016 was utilised for the purposes of reform and course correction, 2017 witnessed consolidation, culmination and the rollout of a new road-map for the Highways sector. Keeping the rapid developments in the sector in mind, RBI appreciated the highway infrastructure development sector in their Annual Report 2016-17, noting that there is a decline in cost and time overruns to the tune of Rs. 1.5 Billion and an all-time rise in award and construction of highways projects including a peak of daily additions to the roads constructed. Further, it pointed out that stalled projects had declined, both in terms of value and numbers. Another creditworthy development was that following the upgrade of India's sovereign rating from Baa3 positive to Baa2 stable on 16th November 2017, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the issuer ratings of National Highways Authority of India to Baa2 from Baa3 and revised the outlook to stable from positive.

1.2     2017 witnessed several highlights. This was the year when engineering marvels like the Dhola Sadiya bridge in Assam and Chenani Nashri tunnel in Jammu and Kashmir were opened up to connect far-off areas and pave the way for their socio-economic development. This was also the year that saw the launch of Bharatmala Pariyojana, India’s largest ever highways development programme that promises to optimize the efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. In the area of road safety too, we witnessed a slight decrease in the number of road accidents.

1.3     Year 2017 can also be seen as a major turning point for transport planning in the country, with the idea of multi-modal transport development gaining ground. The Union Budget 2017-18 set the ground for this with a comprehensive budget for the transport sector as a whole. MoRTH took the idea further by organising the India Integrated Transport and Logistics Summit, organized in May 2017 and by actively promoting multi-modal transport planning with greater synergy in  investments in railways, roads, waterways and civil aviation. 

1.4     The Ministry and its project executing organizations have carried forward the good work of the previous years in 2017, expanding the national highways network in the country, taking various steps to make these highways safer for the commuter and making best efforts to minimize adverse impacts on the environment. Significant activities taken up by the Ministry during the year are as follows:

 

2.       CONSTRUCTION OF NATIONAL HIGHWAYS

2.1         Award / Construction Statistics:

Award and construction activity is a direct consequence of demand, land availability and management of contracts. March 2017 witnessed the highest awards at 15948 kilometres and construction at 8231 kilometres. The table below details the trends of NH construction over the years:

Note: 2017-18 is work in progress and with the finalisation of the Bharatmala Pariyojana and its contours, the activity of award and construction has been focused in concerted directions

2.2         New Programmes, Projects and Structures

(i)            Bharatmala Pariyojana: Phase-I

This is a new umbrella program for the highways sector that aims to optimize the efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. Special attention has been paid to fulfilling the connectivity needs of areas of economic activity, places of religious and tourist interest, border areas, backward and tribal areas, coastal areas and trade routes with neighbouring countries under the programme. Multi-modal integration is one of the key focuses of this programme. A total of around 53,000 kms of NHs have been identified to improve National Corridor efficiency, of which 24,800 kms are to be taken up in Phase-I, which will be implemented over a period of five years i.e. 2017-18 to 2021-22 in a phased manner. This includes 5,000 kms of the National Corridors, 9000 kms of Economic Corridors, 6000 km of Feeder Corridors and lnter-Corridors, 2000 kms of Border Roads, 2,000 kms of Coastal Roads and Port Connectivity Roads and 800 kms of Green-field Expressways. Total likely fund provision for Bharatmala Phase-I is Rs. 5,35,000 cr. Bharatmala will be a major driver for economic growth in the country. lt is estimated that more than 35 crore man-days of employment shall be generated under Phase-l of the programme. 

 (ii)    Chenani- Nashri Tunnel 

An ideal example of the government’s ‘Make in India’ and ‘Skill India’ initiative, the 9 km long, twin-tube, all-weather tunnel between Udhampur and Ramban in Jammu & Kashmir is not only India’s longest highway tunnel but also  Asia’s longest bi-directional highway tunnel. Built at an elevation of 1200 metres on one of the  most difficult Himalayan terrains, the tunnel  cuts the travel time between Jammu and Srinagar by two hours, bypassing about 41 kms of road length. It will also ensure an all-weather passage on a route that often sees heavy traffic jams and disruptions due to landslides, snow, sharp curves, breakdown of vehicles and accidents. The tunnel has been constructed at a cost of about Rs 3720 crores and is a part of the 286-km-long project for four-laning of the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway. 

(iii)    Dhola Sadiya Bridge

The Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, inaugurated India's longest bridge- the 9.15 km long Dhola-Sadiya Bridge over River Brahmaputra in Assam on 26th May 2017. The bridge has ensured 24x7 connectivity between upper Assam and Eastern part of Arunachal Pradesh, marking a major transformation from the ferry-based, day-only connectivity that collapsed during floods. It has considerably reduced the distance and travel time between the two states. The distance between Rupai on NH- 37 in Assam to Meka/Roing on NH-52 in Arunachal Pradesh has been cut down by 165 KM. The travel time between the two places has come down from six hours to just one hour – a total five hour reduction.

(iv)    Extra-dosed Bridge across River Narmada at Bharuch

A new four lane, Extra-dosed Bridge across river Narmada at Bharuch, inaugurated by the Prime Minister on 9th of March 2017, has brought major relief for people travelling on the Vadodara- Surat section of NH-8. The 1.4 km ‘Extradosed’ cable stayed bridge is the longest in India and the second such bridge in the country after Nivedita Setu over Hooghly.

(v)     Bridge over River Chambal at Kota 

A 6-lane Cable Stayed Bridge across river Chambal at Kota was inaugurated by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on 29th August 2017. Built at a cost of Rs. 278 Crores, this bridge marks the completion of the East-West corridor.

2.3         Status/ Progress of important programmes/ projects under implementation 

(i)            Chardham Mahamarg Vikas Pariyojna

The projects envisages development of easy access to the four prominent Dhams, namely, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedranath and Badrinath, situated in the state of Uttrakhand. These four Dhams are prominent pilgrimage centres. The project entails development of 889 km of roads with configuration of two-lane with paved shoulders at an estimated cost of about Rs. 12,000 crore. So far, 24 works have been sanctioned traversing a length of 395 kilometres. 22 works covering a length of 340 kilometre have been awarded. The projects are being taken up on EPC mode amd the program is targeted for completion by March, 2020 

(ii)     Eastern Peripheral Expressway– Western Peripheral Expressway

The project of Peripheral Expressways around Delhi, comprising Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) and Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) emanating from NH-1 (near Kundli) and terminating at NH-2 (near Palwal), bypassing Delhi aims to decongest Delhi and reduce pollution levels in the NCR. While the EPE is being developed by the NHAI, the WPE is being developed by the State of Haryana. Each of these Expressways is 135 km long, leading to an outer-outer ring road of 270 kms for Delhi. These Peripheral Expressways are to be access controlled six-lane roads. The work, being executed in six packages, is due for completion before March 2018. 

(iii)   Delhi-Meerut Expressway

The Delhi-Meerut Expressway aims to provide a fast link between the two cities. The alignment of DME starts from Nizammudin Bridge from Delhi and follows existing NH 24 upto Dasna. While one leg of DME will continue from Dasna on NH 24 to Hapur, a Greenfield alignment has been planned from Dasna to Meerut. The 8.7 km, 14-lane highway is being completed in a record time of about 15 months as against the originbal scheduled completion period of 30 months. This first stretch from Nizamudin Bridge to UP Border is provisioned with with 14 lanes, and has several features that would help reduce pollution. These include a 2.5 metre wide cycle track on either side of the highway, a vertical garden on the Yamuna Bridge, solar lighting system and watering of plants through drip irrigation only.

(iv)        Vadodara-Mumbai Expressway

The 473 km expressway will link Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway to Mumbai-Pune Expressway thus providing Expressway connectivity from Ahmedabad to Pune for a length of about 650 Km. The project will be taken up in three phases. Land acquisition, environment clearance etc are at advanced stage of approval for Phase I and II. Bids have also been invited for the First package of of phase -1. 

(v)          Bangalore-Chennai Expressway (262 km)

Bangalore-Chennai Expressway is a green-field alignment and will be operated with a closed toll system. There are two existing roads connecting Bangalore-Chennai, one is via Hoskote (Bangalore)-AP then to Chennai & second is via Electronic City (Bangalore) Hosur (Tamil Nadu) and then to Chennai. The alignment of proposed expressway is passing in between these two stretches. The processes of land acquisition, environment and other pre-cnstruction activities are under progress.

(vi)        Byet Dwarka – Okha Bridge

The Ministry has taken up constuction of a signature 4-lane Bridge to connect the mainland at Okha to Byet-Dwarka Island off the Gujarat Coast with this signature Bridge spanning a length of 2.32 kms. The Project has been awarded on 01.01.2018 at a cost of Rs. 689.47 crores. This will be the longest span cable stayed bridge in India with the main span of 500 mtrs. The project is scheduled to be completed in 30 months time. 

2.4     New Expressways planned under under Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-I          

(i)            Delhi-Jaipur Expressway

(v)          Nagpur-Hyderabad-Bangalore (NBH) Expressway  

(vi)        Kanpur Lucknow (KL) Expressway  

(vii)      Ring road/ Expressway at Amravathi 

2.5     Indian Bridge Management System (IBMS)

The Ministry took-up a new initiative, known as Indian Bridge Management System (IBMS), to inventorise all structures  e.g. Bridges and culverts constructed on the National highways. The consultants have completed their report and also undertaken the condition assessment of all the existing bridges on National Highways. As such, inventory for more than 1,62,000 bridges and culverts has been completed. A total of 147 Bridges have been identified as distressed structures which call for immediate restoration/ replacements. A time-bound action plan to undertake repairs and restoration or construction of new bridges in place of the decadent structures has been put in place. 

2.6     Setu Bharatam

In order to ensure safe and smooth flow of traffic, Ministry has envisaged a plan for replacement of Level Crossings on National Highways by ROBs/ RUBs under a scheme known as Setu Bharatam. Under this programme, construction of 208 RoBs/ RuBs on Level Crossings (which are not falling under any other programme like NHDP etc.) at an estimated cost of Rs. 20,800 crore is envisaged. Out of these 208 ROBs, Detailed Project Reports for 127 ROBs have been received in the Ministry, out of which 78 ROBs with an estimated cost of Rs. 6428.57 crore have been sanctioned till 31.03.2017, of which 35 works have been awarded so far.  09 ROBs with an estimated cost of Rs. 576.58 crore have been sanctioned till date during FY 2017-18. 

2.7      Funding Models and other policies to facilitate construction of National Highways

(i)           Measures to revive Languishing stalled projects: 

The Ministry has focused on completion of on-going projects along with sanction and award of new projects. A total of 73 projects (8,187 km) worth an estimated investment of Rs.1,00,000 crore were identified as Languishing Projects. The reasons for delay were identified and policy interventions undertaken to address the same. This, inter alia, includes (a) One Time Fund Infusion Scheme (OTFIS) whereby financial assistance is provided by NHAI to the contractor/ concessionaire in the form of a  working capital loan, (b) Rationalized Compensation whereby a one-time compensation, equivalent to annuities that were missed on account of delay in completion of the project , is provided to the concessionaire in the case of BOT (Annuity) projects; (c) Extension of concession period, (d) Substitution of concessionaire & Termination. As on date, the entire portfolio of languishing projects that have been taken up for revival/ completion is as per table below:-

(ii)          Toll- Operate-Transfer (TOT)

The Ministry is monetizing its road assets constructed with public funds through Toll-Operate-Transfer (ToT) scheme. The scheme envisages bidding of bundled national highways for a concession period of 30 years. The bids for the first bundle of 9 NHs have been invited and are scheduled to be received on 09.01.2018. 

(iii)        Masala Bonds 

Targeting mobilization of funds, NHAI launched an issue of Masala Bonds at the London Stock Exchange in May 2017. The Masala Bond saw an overwhelming response from a wide spectrum of investors. The initial benchmark issue of Rs 1500 crore was upsized to Rs 3000 crore. Asia contributed 60 percent and Europe 40 percent of subscription. 61 percent of the amount is from fund managers or insurance funds, 18 percent from banks and 14 percent from private banks. NHAI’s Masala Bonds have been rated the best for the year 2017.

 

(iv)       Planning for Multi Modal Transport Systems

An India Integrated Transport and Logistics Summit was organized in New Delhi from 3rd to 5th May 2017. It was attended by around 3000 delegates from India and abroad which included central and state government organizations, international organizations like World Bank and ADB, global transport and supply chain experts and representatives of private companies. Thirty-four MoUs amounting to about Rs 2 lakh crores were signed at the end of the Summit. Carrying the initiative further, the Ministry is actively engaged with a few states for establishment of Multi-modal Logistics Parks in this direction. 

Further, it has been decided to develop state-of-the-art Inter-modal stations at Varanasi and Nagpur as the two pilots. A Committee has been constituted for review, monitoring and implementation of these Inter-modal Stations at these locations under the Chairmanship of respective Divisional Commissioners with the charter to facilitate DPR preparation etc.

(v)         Decentralisation & Administrative Measures

(a)           Enhanced powers for approval of projects have been delegated to the NHAI Board specifically in the case of EPC projects and all PPP (BOT) projects where no VGF is involved. This will fast track the decision making process.

(b)          Powers for appraisal and sanction of NH projects implemented through the state PWDs have been enhanced and certain field offices of MoRTH are now headed by the CE-ROs with a view to further streamlining various  processes. This is expected to increase efficiency and speedier decision making.

(c)           Within the Bharatmala Parijoyna 10% of the funds will be ear-marked under the Grand Challenge mechanism for the State Governments where sufficient and timely land is made available. This will fast track the projects.

3.       ROAD SAFETY 

3.1         Decrease in road accidents and fatalities 

India is committed to bring down fatalities from road accidents. This requires a multi-pronged approach for strengthening automobile safety standards, improving road infrastructure, generating awareness programmes, strengthening enforcements and streamlining the trauma care assistance programme. The Ministry's concerted efforts at bringing down the number of road accidents has started showing results. As per the report Road Accidents in India-2016, there has been a decrease in road accidents by 4.1% in 2016. The data for first three quarters indicates that this trend continues. The number of accidents up to September, 2017 saw a reduction of 5.2% over the figures for the corresponding period in 2016. The fatalities have shown a decrease of 4.4% during this period. Except the States of Assam, Bihar, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh, all the States have witnessed a decrease in road accident fatalities ranging between 2-10 % during this period. 

3.2         New Accident Reporting Format 

A strong Road safety action plan requires a credible database. The current format of reporting was, therefore, revised on the basis of the recommendations of an expert committee comprising of experts from IIT Delhi, IIT Kharagpur, WHO, senior officers from the Police and Transport Departments of States and the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The new format of accident reporting has been adopted by all the States and will help in focussing at the key risk areas to strengthen road safety in coming years. 

3.3     Rectification of Black Spots 

The Ministry has so far identified 789 road accident black spots in various States of which 138  are on State roads. 189 spots have already been rectified and sanctions for rectification of 256 spots accorded till date which are in different stages of bidding/ progress. 2 Nos. of road safety improvement works on National Highways at selected critical locations at a cost of Rs 30 crore have also been sanctioned under road safety annual plan during 2017-18 which are also under bidding/ progress. Apart from carrying out road safety audits as part of all EPC/ BOT projects, standalone road safety audit has also been initiated on National Highways. Ministry had also has sanctioned installation of crash barriers on national highways in hilly terrain at accident prone locations in different hill states in a length of 137 km at a cost of Rs  85 Crore.  

3.4     Training of Drivers 

Ministry has been working in association with States, Vehicle manufacturers and NGOs for strengthening the driving training. Institutes of Driving Training and Research (IDTRs) have been established in a few states which act as model Driving Training Centres with state of art infrastructure. Ministry has also launched a scheme for creating driving training centres in all the districts of the country in due course and also supports refresher training programmes for heavy commercial vehicles drivers.  

3.5         Model Automated Centres for checking fitness of vehicles: 

Ministry has sanctioned 20 Inspection and certification Centres for testing the fitness of the commercial vehicles though an automated system. Six centres are already operational. These centres will provide for objective evaluation of road worthiness of the heavy commercial vehicles. Based on the encouraging experience, it is now proposed to extend this scheme to all the states during next year.   

3.6         New steps for safety of vehicles :

(i)            Two Wheelers: Two Wheelers account for a major share of accidents and consequent fatalities. A frequent reason is skidding of vehicles. To save the precious lives of two-wheeler users, all the two wheelers have been mandated to be fitted with Anti-Lock braking System (ABS) w.e.f. 1st April, 2019. This is expected to significantly improve the on-road safety of two-wheelers. Apart from this, all the two-wheelers have also been mandated to have a day light running system to improve the conspicuity of the two wheelers. Helmet is provided as a compulsory accessory at the time of sale of all new two wheelers. This has helped improve helmet compliance amongst two-wheeler riders.

(ii)          Motor Cars - All the passenger cars are also mandated to be fitted with ABS to improve their safety and stability. One of the highlights of the year is the mandate for car manufacturers to fit additional safety features on cars to be manufactured from 1st July, 2019. These include compulsory air-bags, speed warning audio alert, seat belt audio alerts and reverse sensors. 

(iii)        Heavy Vehicles: All heavy vehicles have been mandated to have ABS fitted on them. The bus body code has been implemented which would help improve the passenger safety as well as ensure minimum level of comfort. The truck body code has also been notified.

3.7     Free Eye Check-up Campaign

          The Minister of Road Transport and Highways and the NHAI launched a countrywide Free Eye Check-up  Campaign and distribution of spectacles for truck drivers, cleaners and helpers on 2nd October, 2017 at Panjari Toll Plaza, Nagpur Bypass, Nagpur, in Maharashtra. 50 free eye check-ups camps were also set up on identified National Highways till 6th October, 2017. More than 5,000 drivers registered for the eye check-up and more than 3,000 spectacles were distributed to those with impaired vision free of any charge.

3.8         Passenger Safety and Security

          To enhance the passenger safety and specially the safety and security of women and children in transit, all the passenger buses and taxis have been mandated to be fitted with GPS devices to enable real time tracking and intervention in times of crisis.

3.9     Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill, 2017  

          The Ministry constituted a Group of Ministers across states to deliberate upon and propose strategies for reducing road fatalities and to suggest actionable measures for implementation.  On the basis of recommendations of the GoM, MoRTH introduced the Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill 2016 in Parliament (Lok Sabha) on 9th August, 2016. The Bill addresses road safety issues by providing for stiffer penalties, permitting electronic enforcement, improving fitness certification and licensing regime, statutory provisions for protection of good Samaritans and recognition of IT enabled enforcement systems.  The Bill also paves way for reforms in public transport which in turn will help in improving road safety.  The Bill contains provisions for treatment of accident victims during golden hour which will help in saving precious lives. The Bill also aims to simplify processes for the citizens dealing with transport departments and usher in an era of transport reforms in the country. The Bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha and has been referred to the Select Committee of Rajya Sabha. 

4.       GREEN INITIATIVES

4.1         Green Highways Division in NHAI 

NHAI has set up a Green Highways Division and has planted over 2.5 lakh trees planted last year in order to make National Highways green, clean and pollution free.

4.2         Linking of Construction of Highways with digging of Water Bodies in drought affected areas            

The requirement of earth work for the development of National Highway network for embankments is met by the contractors/ concessionaires through buying the earth from landowners or procuring the same through mining of minor minerals as per the provisions laid down by the concerned State Governments. Keeping in view that many parts of the country face drought conditions and restoration of ponds, check dams, water tanks offers an age-old system of water conservation/ ground water recharging, instructions have been issued by the Ministry to the agencies responsible for construction of National Highways to advise their contractors/ construction agencies through their field officers to approach the concerned District Collectors/ Sub-collectors/ Water Conservation Departments to obtain a list of any such villages/ rural areas where de-siltation/ revival of existing ponds/ water bodies or digging of areas for creation of new water bodies are required and procure the requisite soil for road embankments by digging/ de-silting the existing village ponds/ water bodies, subject to such soil being found suitable for the embankment purposes. This arrangement would help in restoration of such dried-up water bodies without any charge and the contractors will be able to source the requisite soil without any payment.

4.3         Bridge cum Barrage

The Ministry has sought proposals from state PWDs for making bridge-cum-barrage on NHs so as to serve the dual purpose of crossing the water body and storing water on the upstream/ down stream side to serve as water reservoirs/ ground water recharging bodies. This will help better and optimum utilization of water for various purposes.

4.4         Swachhta Pakhwada 

Swachhta Pakhwada was observed from 16th to 31st July, 2017 under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). The main focus was to accelerate the pace of on-going Swachh Bharat Mission activities of construction of toilets and provision of litter-bins at 371 NHAI Toll Plazas, and additional activities including provision of temporary toilets and drinking water facilities at toll plazas, cleaning of roads and drains, proper management of road construction sites, removing litter etc. 

4.5         Measures undertaken to combat vehicular pollution:

(i)            Ministry has taken a landmark step towards reducing the vehicular pollution. Emission norms for Tractors and Construction Equipment vehicles have been notified for low Sulphur fuel, to be implemented from 01st October, 2020.  

(ii)          Ministry has also taken initiatives to promote alternate fuels in vehicles. The Electric vehicles are being given a big push by the Ministry. India’s first multi modal Electric Vehicle passenger transport project was launched in Nagpur with integrated solution of buses, taxis and E-Rickshaws.

(iii)        The E-Rickshaw, which has proved to be an effective substitute for manual Rickshaws, has emerged as a cost effective, environment friendly solution for improving last mile connectivity. These have been exempted from the requirement of obtaining permits. This has created a game changing scenario for promoting E-rickshaws. During the year to promote last mile connectivity for metro passengers, 1000 number of E-Rickshaws were launched at Gurugram, Haryana.

5.       E- INITIATIVES

5.1         Project Monitoring Information System(PMIS) 

A very effective Project Monitoring Information System (PMIS) has been introduced for tracking the status of all projects, preparation of reports and online upload of important project documents like DPRs and contract documents, etc.

5.2    INAM-Pro+ launched

With 37 Cement companies registered on it, the portal facilitated comparison of price, availability of materials etc. and made it convenient for prospective buyers to procure cement at reasonable rates in a transparent manner. INAM-Pro*, with enhanced features will reduce the time and efforts in preparation of proposals and bid submissions, and help increase efficiency and transparency in procurement of construction materials as a user can now place orders, obtain price quotes and track them in swift manner on this portal. 

5.2         Bhoomi Rashi,  a web Utility for land acquisition

ln its attempt to move towards total e-governance and avoid delays, this Ministry has developed a Web Utility for  land acquisition related processes including gazette notification. The web utility would be linked with the e-gazette platform of the Ministry of Urban Development, for e-publication of land acquisition related Gazette Notifications. The affected/ interested parties would also be given an access to the system so as to track the status of their acquired land and the CALA(s) in different states are being taken on board to deposit the compensation amount in the respective accounts of affected/ interested person 

5.3         E-TOLLING 

(i)            Implementation of Hybrid ETC system

Electronic toll collection (ETC) system, the flagship initiative of MoRT&H, has been implemented on pan-India basis in order to remove bottlenecks and ensure seamless movement of traffic and collection of user fee as per the notified rates, using passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology.  Indian Highways Management Company Limited (IHMCL), a Company registered under the Companies Act, has been incorporated for working as implementing agency for ETC with National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) functioning as the Central Clearing House (CCH). 11 banks (including Public and Private sector banks) have been engaged as issuer Banks in order to issue FASTag to road users. A cashback of 7.5% is being offered for the FY 2017-18 in order to incentivize road users for usage of FASTag. In addition to FASTag, several other electronic means have also been employed to enable road users for payment of user fees such as use of PoS machines for collection of fees through Credit/ Debit cards, use of Pre-paid payment instruments etc.

As on 1-12-2017, a total of 7.7 lakh FASTag units are being used by road users. User fees collected through FASTag has also seen significant growth in terms of user fees collected and the penetration has increased from 179.1 Cr with 11.2% penetration in January 2017 to 285.3Cr with 18.5% penetration in the month of November 2017.

(ii)         Other Initiatives

(a)      In order to further augment the services provided to FASTag users, all the lanes at the fee plazas are being converted to Hybrid lanes with one dedicated lane on either side, exclusively for FASTag users. This is to be completed by 31.03.2018.

(b)     All new vehicles of class M and N being sold after 1-Dec-2017 will be affixed with FASTag by the vehicle manufacturer or the authorized dealer, in order to enhance the penetration and usage of FASTg among road users.

                Mahatma Gandhi NREGA aims at strengthening the rural livelihood resource base through creation of productive and durable assets for sustainable growth. To ensure this, there has been a lot of emphasis on timely completion of works and on improving the quality of works, during the last three years. There has been equal thrust on capacity building of dedicated MGNREGS functionaries and community resource persons towards upgradation of their skills for improved quality of implementation of the Programme.

Completion of incomplete works under MGNREGS, is a major concern of the government. As such, the Ministry is focusing on completion of all 61.39 lakh works which have been lying incomplete out of a total of 4.54 crore works that have been taken up since inception of the Programme. Owing to the close monitoring and intense engagement with the states, the Ministry has been able to ensure completion of over 1.02 crore works during FY 2016-17 and current FY, so far. We hope to improve completion further through effective monitoring.   

Given the diverse nature and scale of works being executed and the varied capacities of stakeholders involved, separate training modules to suit the requirements of the target groups have been developed with support from domain specific apex organisations. These training modules have formed the basis of imparting training to technical personnel under the banner SAKSHAM. The programme was launched by the Hon’ble Minister Rural Development on 19th June 2017 and will be completed by 15th March, 2018 covering more than 65,000 technical persons. Around 57,000 technical personnel at State (521), district (6669) and block level (48,934) have been capacitated, so far, on the use of Remote Sensing and GIS tools for project planning and monitoring along with the thematic components like watershed, groundwater and geohydrology, plantation and Integrated Natural Resource Management. National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad and Central Ground Water Board have partnered with the Ministry of Rural Development in this massive exercise.

Imparting skill training to MGNREGA workers is a key focus area. 6367 Bare Foot Technicians have been trained, so far, for improving the quality and durability of assets through appropriate work planning, timely monitoring and supervision of works and also to bridge the gap in availability of technical resources at Gram Panchayat level. These are local youth (10th Pass) from among the MGNREGA worker household/ Mate/ Supervisor who have been identified and provided 90 days of residential training, assessed and certified after successful completion of training at a cost of Rs 62,040/- per person including stipend @ Rs 150/- per day. 

The Ministry has also taken steps to standardize the estimates to bring about uniformity in cost norms, minimize leakages and to improve quality of works through detailing of technical specifications, tasks and workflows by adopting a Software for Estimate Calculation Using Rural Rates for Employment (SECURE). The Ministry has initiated training of Resource Persons at state, district and block levels on SECURE. All estimates under MGNREGS will be generated with the use of SECURE software from the Programme’s Management Information System with effect from 1st April, 2018.

Further, Institutional strengthening for Social Audit in accordance with notified auditing standards has been ensured through concerted efforts for establishment of administratively and financially independent Social Audit Units and training of dedicated resource persons. A total of 3760 resource persons from these independent Social Audit Units, at the state, district and block level, have been trained, assessed and certified by Tata Institute of Social Sciences, on a 30 days Certificate course on conduct of Social Audit.

Steps have also been taken to ensure engagement of women of Self Help Groups as Village Resource Persons for conducting the Social Audits. As of now 47000 women SHG members have been trained on a 4 days training module, for conducting Social Audits at the Gram Panchayat level.

To bring in transparency and to enhance the visibility of the programme, the Ministry is implementing GeoMGNREGA, a GIS based solution to visualize, analyze and explore MGNREGS asset related data. As on date more than 2.34 crore assets have been geotagged across the country. This has been achieved through capacity building of over 2.6 lakh functionaries on a mission mode. Now, the Ministry has initiated GeoMGNREGA Phase-II in 31 States/UTs from 1st November 2017. Under GeoMGNREGA Phase-II, the geotagging is being carried out in three stages viz. (i) before start of the work, (ii) during the work and (iii) on completion of work. A National Orientation Workshop and Training was held on 21-22 August 2017 for State Resource Persons and subsequently, 2,69,075 officers from State, District, Block and Gram Panchayat have been trained, so far from 29 states and 2 UTs.

The impact is already discernible as reported in a recent study conducted by Institute of Economic Growth, New Delhi to assess the impact of Natural Resource Management Works under MGNREGA. Primary and secondary data from 30 districts spread over 21 states reveal that MGNREGA has helped in crop intensification and diversification leading to increase in rural household incomes. 76% households have reported that the quality of assets created under MGNREGA are very good/ good. Only 0.5% of the beneficiaries felt that the quality of assets was not satisfactory over time. Further, the creation of these NRM assets has led to an increase in irrigation potential and ground water table. The availability of water in turn has led to a growth in production between 11% for rice and 25% in Oilseeds and encouraged 28% of the sampled households to adopt horticulture plantation for higher returns. Overall, the study reported an 11% increase in Gross annual income per household (HH) of all the 30 districts taken together within a span of two financial years 2015-16 and 2016-17.

                Union Minister for Science & Technology, Dr. Harsh Vardhan today announced four schemes to promote young scientists and researchers in the country. The scheme primarily aims at early recognition and reward to young talent in the field of science.  “The schemes focus on youth to empower, recognize and motivate them,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said, while announcing the new schemes.

The Minister said that in a bid to tap the potential of trained faculty in Universities, colleges and private academic institutions, 500 teachers will be assisted under the Teacher Associateship for Research Excellence (TARE) scheme. It will connect them to leading public funded institutions like IIT, IISc or national institutions like CSIR, preferably nearer to their place of work to pursue research. They will be paid Rs. 5 lakh yearly, and a monthly out-of-pocket expense of Rs. 5,000. This will be in addition to the salary from their existing employer.

 The second scheme – Overseas Visiting Doctoral Fellowship offers support to 100 PhD scholars for training in universities/laboratories abroad upto 12 months during their doctoral research. They would be given a monthly fellowship equivalent to US $ 2000, one-time contingency allowance of Rs. 60,000/- to cover travel and visa fee.

The Distinguished Investigator Award offers a maximum of 100 fellowships to principal investigators of SERB/DST projects.  “This one-time career award will be judged on the basis of a completed project,” said Dr Harsh Vardhan. “This is aimed at giving early recognition and reward to young scientists, he added.”

The selected 100 researchers will be given a monthly fellowship of Rs. 15,000/- for three years and an optional research grant, based on peer review of the project proposal submitted.

 A scheme to encourage science writing seeks to tap the potential of over 20,000 PhD scholars in science to popularise and communicate their research outcome. Augmenting Writing Skills for Articulating Research, AWSAR carries a monetary incentive of Rs. 10,000/- each for 100 best entries in a year and a Certificate of Appreciation, besides getting the story published. Three leading stories from the selected 100 would be awarded Rs. 1 lakh, Rs. 50,000/- and Rs. 25,000/- respectively.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that these schemes will be notified and applications invited from across the country on February 1.

Teacher Associateship for Research Excellence (TARE) Scheme of SERB, DST aims to tap the latent potential of faculty working in state universities, colleges and private academic institutions who are well trained but have difficulty in pursuing their research due to varied reasons including lack of facilities, funding and guidance. This scheme facilitates mobility of such faculty members to carryout research in well-established public funded institution such as IITs, IISc, IISERS and other National Institutions (NITs, CSIR, ICAR, ICMR labs, etc) and Central Universities located preferably nearer to the institution where the faculty member is working. Up to 500 TAs will be supported under this scheme.

Overseas Visiting Doctoral Fellowship of SERB has been instituted for enhancing the international mobility of Indian research students which has the potential to create a talented pool of globally trained manpower.  The scheme provides an opportunity for research students to gain exposure and access to top class research facilities in academia and labs across the world. This scheme offers opportunities for up to 100 PhD students admitted in the Indian institutions for gaining exposure and training in overseas universities / institutions of repute and areas of importance to country for period up to 12 months during their doctoral research. The selected fellows will be paid a monthly fellowship amount equivalent to US $ 2000, one-time Contingency / Preparatory allowances of Rs. 60,000/- to cover visa fee, airport transfer charges, medical insurance etc. 

SERB Distinguished Investigator Award (DIA) has been initiated to recognize and reward Principal Investigators (PIs) of SERB/DST projects who have performed remarkably well. The scheme aims not only to reward the best PIs of completed projects but also to motivate the ongoing PIs to perform exceedingly well. This positive reinforcement strategy would effectively improve the productivity of the research undertaken and the overall efficiency of the research ecosystem. DIA is a one-time career award devised to specifically cater to the younger scientists who have not received any other prestigious awards or fellowships. The award carries a fellowship of Rs. 15,000/- p.m. and an optional research grant for three years, based on peer review of the project proposal submitted. 

AWSAR (Augmenting Writing Skills for Articulating Research) of National Council of Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC), DST has been initiated to encourage, empower and endow popular science writing through newspapers, magazines, blogs, social media, etc. by young PhD Scholars and Post-Doctoral Fellows during the course of their higher studies and research pursuits. As over 20,000 youth are awarded PhD in S&T every year in India, the scheme aims to tap this tremendous potential to popularize & communicate science and also to inculcate scientific temperament in the masses. AWSAR carries monetary incentive of Rs.10,000/- each for 100 best entries from PhD scholars in a year along with a Certificate of Appreciation besides getting the story published/projected in mass media. In addition, three leading stories from the selected hundred would also be awarded cash prize of Rs.1,00,000/-, Rs.50,000/- and Rs.25,000/- respectively. Further, twenty entries would be selected from articles submitted exclusively by Post-Doctoral Fellows relating to their line of Research for monetary incentive of Rs.10,000/- each and the most outstanding story to be given a cash prize of Rs.1,00,000/-.

                “Scientists should try to find solutions to develop 115 backward districts in the country”, suggested Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Science & Technology, Environment, Forest & Climate Change and Earth Sciences.  Addressing scientists at the Hyderabad-based National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) under CSIR today, the Minister said that these districts with growth potential, many in the northeast, were neglected in the past. Dr. Vardhan said that scientists and scientific laboratories can contribute to the solution of several developmental issues in these districts. He added that it is time, our scientists gave equal importance to ‘solution science’ from ‘fundamental science’.

Dr Vardhan pointed out that NGRI’s expertise in Heliborne surveys to map mineral and ground water could be utilised to explore natural resources in these districts.   NGRI provided technical assistance for Heliborne Survey to the Central Ground Water Board first time in 2013, to carry out aquifer mapping, or mapping the water pools beneath ground in Rajasthan. He appreciated the efforts of NGRI for aligning its research with initiatives of the government.

“There should be synergy among scientific institutions to develop newer technologies to deliver a new India envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated. “We have the demographic advantage now, and we should exploit it,” the Minister noted.

Earlier this month, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, had convened a meeting of district magistrates of 115 backward districts for their fast-track development. The meeting decided upon six development indicators – health, education, basic infrastructure, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development.

                Union Minister for Science & Technology, Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, has said that under the leadership of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, the Government is committed to harness science and technology for the preservation of environment. Presiding over the function to mark the commencement of DST-Intel Collaborative Research for real-time river water and air quality monitoring and announcement of research projects at Hotel Taj Mahal here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan emphasised that research has to be increasingly made people-centric and research must find solutions to the problems of the people.  The Minister also stressed the need to change the definition of “impact factor” to include how much the research will impact the common and lead to an alleviation of sufferings of the people.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that real time water and air quality monitoring is another initiative of the Government towards scientific social responsibility.  “The scientific vision of the Government has been demonstrated through state-of-the-art technology solutions delivered through global partnership”, he stated.

Congratulating the scientists on the occasion, the Minister pointed out that India stands third in the field of nano-technology.  “India’s R&D efforts have been hailed by the entire world”, he said.  “There is nothing on this planet that cannot be solved with the help of science”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan averred.  The Minister added that national missions like Namami Gange can really benefit from science and that Mission Namami Gange needs help from scientists.  He stated that development and application of advanced tools and techniques by leading Indian and US institutions for real time water and air quality monitoring is of utmost importance to address the critical scientific challenges involved.  

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology Prof. Ashutosh Sharma, highlighted the technology-based solutions provided to address the challenges of water availability and water quality.  He also underlined the significant investment made in national, bilateral and multilateral research efforts to address water challenges.  “The department is committed to contribute to national missions through science and technology and current endeavour for the development of online autonomous sensor networks for water and air quality monitoring is one such step”, he said.

Addressing the gathering, vice president, Internet of Things Group (IOTG), Intel Corporation, Mr. Jonathan Ballon said, “Intel continues its focus on supporting innovation and technology research aimed at creating solutions to help improve the quality of life. The initiative will draw meaningful insights that will help towards developing end-to-end IoT-based real-time water and air quality monitoring solutions, creating affordable and applicable solutions for India’s community challenges.”

Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Intel have jointly initiated a research programme titled, “Research Initiative for Real-time River Water and Air Quality Monitoring” to develop low-cost and low-power autonomous wireless sensor technologies for sensing, communication and analysis of large-scale data collected from autonomous networks of perpetual/ long-lived sensor nodes. The development of these technologies will be followed by integration and deployment for water and air quality monitoring in real time. This real-time data will significantly strengthen and complement the Missions of national priority like Namami Gange, by serving as critical data feeders for pre and post treatment analysis. 

The joint programme is co-funded by DST and Intel and implemented by the bilateral Indo-U.S. Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF). The programme offers a unique opportunity for the academia and industries across the two countries (India and USA) to collaborate and develop end-to-end Internet of Things (IoT)-based Water and Air Quality Management (WAQM) solution [End-to-End IoT WAQM]. The development of such an end-to-end solution, composed of several individual research elements, can also potentially impact environmental quality monitoring systems in diverse contexts such as urban, domestic and industrial settings. 

 

Four Projects selected in real-time air and water quality monitoring:

After a comprehensive review, two projects each in Air and Water Quality Monitoring have been selected. These research projects will be pursued by leading Indian scientific and technical institutions such as IITs and IISc in collaboration with top US institutions like Duke University, University of South California, Michigan State University, Stanford University etc.  

The two Air Quality Monitoring projects are: 

1. Streaming Analytics over Temporal Variables from Air quality Monitoring (SATVAM)

2. High resolution air quality monitoring and air pollutant data analytics

These projects will lead to development of systems to report and visualize scientifically validated PM2.5 and gas measurements. This project will have the potential for replication in 500 cities and towns across India. The projects will also lead to development and validation of low-cost sensor systems with improved techniques of sampling and calibrations towards developing the air quality index and identifying sources of pollutants with focus on vehicular pollution. 

The two Water Quality Monitoring projects are: 


	Aquatic Autonomous Observatory (Niracara Svayamsasita VedhShala - NSVS)
	Integrated low-cost water sensors for real- time river water monitoring and decision- making (SensorWarn).


 

These projects will lead to the design and development of low-cost, multi-parameter, water quality platforms with auto-sampling capabilities integrated with energy harvesting system. The projects will also result in development of sensors for water quality and water flow integrated with communication system to develop an early warning mechanism.

                Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Environment, Forest & Climate Change, EFCC and Vice President, CSIR, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, has called for a more favorable approach in addressing the issues of pollution due to firecrackers, as well as protecting jobs and businesses in the existing value chain of firecrackers, through the power of science.   Addressing a brainstorming meeting on non-polluting firecrackers held at Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan emphasised that all S&T organizations should come together to address this issue and that CSIR is uniquely positioned to provide amenable solution to this menacing problem. He urged scientists to put their heart and soul into this endeavor and give a new Diwali to the children of the country, which could be remembered in history as “CSIR’s Diwali”. The Minister highlighted the background issues on the matter called for focused R&D efforts on non-polluting firecrackers/fireworks. He also said that he strongly believes that science has an answer to this problem. 

Appreciating the efforts of CSIR towards the development of eco-friendly crackers, Dr. Harsh Vardhan also called for comprehensive measures such as development of suitable masks to address the overall issues of pollution. He stressed the need for simultaneous action on product development, regulatory approvals and supply chain aspects.

DG, CSIR, Dr. Girish Sahni, pointed out that CSIR is committed to national priorities and towards this important societal cause. “Several CSIR laboratories have come together and are putting together a robust S&T strategy for development of eco-friendly firecrackers and fireworks”, he said. Dr. Sahni stated that the first phase will cover reduction of pollutants, while future strategies will cover removal of pollutants from the compositions. 

An inter-ministerial/departmental Expert Committee has been constituted by the CSIR to guide and mentor CSIR laboratories in this unique R&D endeavour.  Taking the R&D ideas forward, CSIR also proposes to meet the manufacturers of firecrackers in the country to involve the concerned stakeholders in its larger action plan.  Each of the members appreciated the CSIR initiative and voiced their strong support to make this endeavour a great success.  

There have been widespread reports and observations of rising levels of pollution due to firecrackers/fireworks, especially during the festival time of Diwali. There have been reports of lung related disorders and upper respiratory diseases due to the high levels of pollution. One of the stringent measures recently adopted in Delhi/NCR was to ban the sale of firecrackers during the festival period by the Hon’ble Court.

CSIR Directors, Dr. Rakesh Kumar, CSIR-NEERI and Prof. Santanu Chaudhury, CSIR-CEERI gave an overview of the strategy and action plan that CSIR has put together to address the directives of Hon’ble Minister. The Directors elaborated on potential measures to curb pollution, which   included preventive and post combustion measures. The viable propositions will also pay due attention to the light & visuals as well as sound factors of the newly proposed compositions. E-crackers and chemical-hybrid systems are the other options proposed for pursuit.

Besides Directors and scientists from CSIR laboratories such as CSIR-IICT, CSIR-NBRI, CSIR-IITR, CSIR-NCL, CSIR-CLRI, CSIR-CECRI, CSIR-CGCRI, CSIR-CMERI, CSIR-NPL, and CSIR-NEERI, the brainstorming meeting was also attended by senior members from High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), Pune; Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi; Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers; and DGFT, Department of Commerce, Delhi. 

The Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), known for its cutting edge R&D knowledgebase in diverse S&T areas, is a contemporary R&D organization. Having a pan-India presence, CSIR has a dynamic network of 38 national laboratories, 39 outreach centres, and 5 units. CSIR pursues wide range of R&D activities in various S&T domains.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari, will lay the foundation stone for an Intermodal Terminal at Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh tomorrow. The Rs 155 Cr terminal is being constructed by the Inland Waterways Authority of India as part of the World Bank aided Jal Marg Vikas Project on river Ganga or the NW-I, that aims to augment the navigational capacity of the river.  Shri Manoj Sinha, Minister of State for Communication (Independent Charge) and Railways and Shri Keshav Prasad Maurya, Deputy Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh will also be present on the occasion.

The intermodal terminal at Ghazipur will have linkage to both NW-I or River Ganga and NH-31 which is just 650 metres away. NH19 links Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh with Patna in Bihar. The terminal will thus be very important for efficient movement of large and small cargo by providing the options for both land and water transportation or the option for intermodal switching. The terminal will have facilities like berths, storage areas and sheds, terminal building, communications systems and electrical substation. It will have a handling capacity of 12 lac tonnes per annum.

As part of IWAI’s efforts to promote environment friendly mode of transport, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) bunkering facility is also being planned at Ghazipur terminal. IWAI plans to run LNG fuelled vessels on NW1. The terminal is expected to provide between 5000 direct and indirect jobs. The first phase of the terminal construction is expected to be completed by April, 2020. 

The intermodal terminal at Ghazipur is one of the several sub projects under the Rs 5369 Crore Jal Marg Vikas project.  The other sub projects include construction of three multi modal terminals at Varanasi, Sahibganj and Haldia; a new navigational lock at Farakka, bank protection works,   river navigation system, construction of Ro-Ro terminals and another intermodal terminals at Kalughat. IWAI is building this infrastructure along Ganga or NW-I to make the river navigable for cargo vessels. The development of this waterway would result in an environment friendly, fuel efficient and cost-effective alternative mode of transportation, especially for bulk goods, hazardous goods and over dimensional cargo. NW-1 is an important constituent of the Eastern Transport Corridor of India, along with the proposed Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor and National Highway -2.  This corridor connects the National Capital Region (NCR) with the eastern and north-eastern states, and will also be an important  link to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Nepal and other east and south-east Asian countries through the Kolkata Port and Indo- Bangladesh Protocol Route. Jal Marg Vikas project could therefore turn River Ganga into an economic lifeline for the region.

Along with focused efforts to improve operational efficiency of ports and increase traffic at ports, Ministry of Shipping is making steady strides towards utilizing the country’s river system & inland waterways aseconomically viable and environment friendly mode of transport.

Opening a new world for business & employment opportunities in North-East through inland waterways, recently, Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation  flagged off regular cargo movement on Brahmaputra (NW2) from Pandu Port to Dhubri in Assam.  Focused efforts are been made to connect North-East region to Kolkata, Haldia, Mongla and Chittagong ports, provide efficient logistics in North-East region and set up Ro-Ro off services across river banks

The Ministry of Shipping, under the leadership of Shri Gadkari is all geared up to create an enabling environment for growth of seaplane led air connectivity and leverage water bodies in country.  After witnessing the Seaplane trial in Mumbai recently, the Minister has requested the Ministry of Civil Aviation to prepare a regulatory framework for seaplanes, keeping in mind all safety aspects.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi recently has given its approval for implementation of the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) for capacity augmentation of navigation on National Waterway-1 (NW-1).  The Rs 5,369 Crore project, which is expected to be completed by March 2023, will bring down the logistic cost in the country and lead to major infrastructure development like multi-modal and inter-modal terminals, roll on-roll off (Ro-Ro) facilities, ferry services, and navigation aids. The JMVP will create an alternative mode of transport that will be ""environment friendly and cost effective"" and will give boost to economy & trade, generate huge business & employment opportunities thus converting Ganga into the economic lifeline of people in states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand & West Bengal.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved amendments in the Model Concession Agreement (MCA) to make the  Port Projects more investor-friendly and make investment climate in the Port Sector more attractive.  

Salient features:

The amendments in the MCA envisage constitution of the Society for Affordable Redressal of Disputes - Ports (SAROD-PORTS) as dispute resolution mechanism similar to provision available in Highway Sector.

The other salient features of the revised MCA include the following:-


	Providing exit route to developers by way of divesting their equity upto 100% after completion of 2 years from the Commercial Operation Date(COD). This is now similar to the MCA provisions of Highway Sector.
	Under provision of additional land to the Concessionaire, land rent has been reduced from 200% to 120% of the applicable scale of rates for the proposed additional land.
	Concessionaire would pay Royalty on ""per MT of cargo/TEU handled"" basis which would be indexed to the variations in the WPI annually. This will replace the present procedure of charging royalty which is equal to the percentage of Gross revenue, quoted during bidding, calculated on the basis of upfront normative tariff ceiling prescribed by Tariff Authority for Major Ports (TAMP). This will help to resolve the long pending grievances of Public Private Participation (PPP) operators that Revenue share is payable on ceiling tariff and price discounts are ignored. The problems associated with fixing storage charges by TAMP and collection of Revenue share on storage charges which has plagued many projects will also get eliminated.
	Concessionaire would be free to deploy higher capacity equipment/facilities/technology and carry out value engineering for higher productivity and improved utilization and/or cost saving of Project assets.
	""Actual Project Cost"" would be replaced by ""Total Project Cost"".
	The new definition of ""Change in Law"" will also include 



	imposition of standards and conditions arising out of TAMP guidelines/orders, Environmental Law & Labour Laws and 
	increase and imposition of new taxes, duties, etc. for compensating the Concessionaire. Since the viability of the project was affected, concessionaire will now be compensated for the increase and imposition of new taxes, duties etc. except in respect of imposition/increase of a  direct tax,   both  by  Central  &  State Government.



	vii. Provision for commencement of operations before COD. This will lead to better utilization of assets provided by the Port in many projects before the formal completion certificate.



	Provision regarding refinancing is aimed at facilitating availability of low cost long term funds to Concessionaire so as to improve the financial viability of the projects.
	Extending the provision of SAROD-PORTS for redressal of disputes to the existing Concessionaires also by introducing the Supplementary Agreement to be signed between the Concessionaire and the Concessioning Authority.
	Introduction of Complaint Portal for the use of port users.
	A   Monitoring  Arrangement  has   been   introduced  for  keeping periodical status report of the project.


 

The amendments have been proposed keeping in view the experience gained in managing PPP projects in port sector during the last twenty years and to obviate the problems being faced on account of certain provisions in the existing MCA. The amendments in the MCA have been finalized after extensive consultation with the stakeholders.

The Minister of State for Shipping , Road Transport & Highways and Chemical & Fertilizers Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today informed that at present, there are two major ports and 48 minor ports (non-major ports) in Maharashtra. Both the major ports in Maharashtra, Mumbai Port and Jawaharlal Nehru Port are equipped with modern facilities. The infrastructure augmentation & modernization of Major Port is a continual process. Out of the 48 minor ports, which are under the administrative control of Government of Maharashtra, 10 are equipped with modern facilities such as conveyor belts/cranes etc. and 6 are barge ports. Remaining minor ports are “Port Limits” where no cargo is handled and are used for fishing vessels and ferry services only. The Steps have been taken by the Government of Maharashtra for development of Rewas port, Vijaydurg port, Redi port, Vadhavan port, Trombay port and Karanja port through private sector participation. 13 port projects (Rs. 410.51 Cr) have been sanctioned under Sagarmala for the State of Maharashtra.

                In order to promote cruise tourism in the country, and make India an attractive cruise tourist destination, the Ministry of Home Affairs has, on request of the Ministry of Shipping, exempted cruise tourists arriving with e-visa     from the requirement of biometric enrolment for a period of three years i.e. till 31.12.2020.  This will make immigration clearance of such passengers faster, leaving them with more time to spend on shore. This is also an important factor that helps cruise lines decide whether or not to include a destination in their itinerary. 

 

The Ministry of Shipping has been working towards simplifying the immigration clearance procedure and providing passengers with a customer friendly and hassle free logistics process when they embark on or disembark from their cruise at the Indian ports. E-Visa has been in place in the five major ports of Mumbai, Mormugao, New Mangalore, Cochin & Chennai.  Till now biometrics of passengers were required at port of first arrival for immigration clearance.  However, with the existing facilities at the cruise terminals at these ports, the immigration procedure was taking more than the internationally accepted norm of clearing immigration for all cruise passengers in a maximum of 90 minutes. This is especially significant because, as per the schedule of arrivals of cruise ships for the current cruise season 2017-18 and 2019-20, many of the cruise ships coming to India are mega ships with 2000-4000 passengers on board.  Most of these cruise passengers are expected to arrive on E-Visa, and biometric enrolment of all these passengers would slow down immigration clearance.   Hence the need for the exemption. 

 

This simplified immigration clearance procedure is part of a series of steps to attract and to enhance cruise passenger experience at the major ports.  The standard operating procedures to handle cruise was revised earlier and is being implemented uniformly at all ports.  In November, 2017 major ports reduced their tariffs for 3 years by 42 – 67% to make it attractive for cruise lines to visit India.  Major ports now change a single comprehensive uniform rate of USD$ 0.35 per GRT.

                In a path breaking initiative to empower Persons with Disabilities, 100 Accessible websites of various State Governments/UTs under Accessible India Campaign were launched by the Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot on the occasion of ‘National Conference on Improving Accessibility’ here today. Ministers of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla and Shri Krishna Pal Gurjar were present. Secretary, DEPwD Shri Shakuntala D. Gamlin and the officials from Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Housing and Urban Development participated in the conference and submitted their valuable inputs on implementation of accessibility in various walks of life.

 

Accessible Websites are those websites into which Persons with Disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can contribute to the Web. The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) initiated a “Website Accessibility Project” for State Government/Union Territories under Accessible India Campaign through ERNET India, an autonomous scientific society under the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY), to make total 917 websites accessible and providing funds for the same. Now 100 accessible websites are made accessible under the project.

 

The aim of the conference was to sensitize and bring awareness among different stakeholders including the officials of state government on accessibility in the context of recently enacted Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2016. The Accessible India Campaign has three important components viz Built Environment; Transport and Information and Communication Eco-system accessibility. 

 

In his address, Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment said that the Divyangjans are an integral part of our society and we have to play an active role for their welfare. He said that Accessible India Campaign is a nationwide flagship campaign of Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. The aim of the campaign is to make a barrier free environment for persons with disabilities all over the country for safe, dignified life of Persons with Disabilities. He said that around 5800 ADIP camps had been organised nationwide by his ministry for distribution of assistive device to Divyangjans. He opined that such Accessible websites will play an important role in proper dissemination of Governments policies and schemes for the welfare of Divyangjans. 

 

Shri Vijay Sampla in his address said that today we have moved ahead are more step towards Accessible India campaign by launching 100 Accessible websites of various State Governments/UTs under Accessible India Campaign. He said that DEPwD is doing a commendable job in this regard. 

 

In his address Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar said that during past three and a half years many revolutionary steps have been taken by DEPwD, Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment for the welfare of Divyangjans. He said that we need to empower the Divyangjans so that they can lead a normal life.

 

Addressing the gathering, Mrs. Shakuntala D Gamlin urged the Central and State Government Departments to adopt accessibility standards while providing any service be it physical, infrastructural and IT etc.

 

Mrs. Dolly Chakrabarty Joint Secretary, DEPwD emphasised on ensuring rural access as there is substantial difference in planning accessibility in rural areas and it is a less talked about topic in the growing era of urbanisation.   

 

ERNET India (MEITY) is executing the project which is funded by DEPwD under Accessibility India Campaign so far 917 websites across 27 States & UT have been chosen from the list of websites which have been provided by the State Social Welfare Departments through DEPwD. 


Accessible Website Design Principles: - Provide appropriate alternative text, Caption video; Provide transcripts for audio; All documents (e.g., PDFs) to be accessible; Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning; and Make sure content is structured, clearly written and easy to read. 

 

Current Status of Accessible Websites: -Total no. of websites: 917; Under Development: 244; Developed and Internally Audited: 208; and   Live: 100

 

Web content accessibility guidelines –WCAG 2.0 :- Websites are made accessible by complying it as per Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) published by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the main international standard organisation for the World Wide Web.

 

The guideline establish three levels of accessibility on basis of which websites are designed, namely:-


	Level A: This Indicates the basic level of accessibility that any web page must have
	Level AA: This indicates an intermediate level of accessibility that any web page should have
	Level AAA: This indicates the highest level of accessibility that any web page can achieve


The founding principles of the guidelines state information and user interface components must be presentable to user in ways they can perceive, user interface components and navigation must be operable and information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. Moreover, content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal to amend Section 4(1) and Section 5(1) of the National Trust for the Welfare of Person with Autism, Cerebral Plasy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act, 1999 to fix the term of the Chairperson and Members of the Board of National Trust for three years.

Section 4(1) of the National Trust   Act, 1999   provides that the Chairperson or a Member of the Board of National Trust would continue in office beyond the prescribed term of three years   until   his   successor   shall   have   been   duly   appointed. In case of resignation of the Chairperson, section 5(1) of the Act provides for him to continue in office until his successor is duly appointed by the Government.   The wording of the above provisions of the Act in its present form has resulted in continuation of a Chairman for an indefinite period as no suitable successor could be found eligible for appointment. The proposed amendments in these provisions of the Act seek to avoid such a    situation and will thus eliminate any chance of prolonged continuation in the same post by any incumbent.

	A complaint box is maintained at every work place.
	On-line complaint mechanism has also been introduced through KVS website. 
	The complaints, if any, received even from family members/relatives are also given due cognizance. 
	In all training programmes a component of gender sensitization is kept in  modules to bring awareness among the trainees.

Ministry of Health and Family Welfare have informed that there is a shortage of doctors to treat drug addicts.

As informed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, currently, a super-specialization course “DM (Addiction Psychiatry)”, to create super-specialist doctors for treatment of drug addiction, is offered through three premier Institutes under them, i.e. All India Institutes of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, National Institutes of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore and Postgraduate Institutes of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh.

Under the “Drug Treatment Clinic (DTC)” Scheme of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government hospitals are financially supported to provide treatment of substance use disorders through outpatient clinics and training is provided to doctors for treatment of drug addicts. 

The Ministry has already formulated a draft National Policy on Drug Demand Reduction and the same is being finalized.

This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.

The Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has released the First Revised Estimates of National Income, Consumption Expenditure, Saving and Capital Formation for the financial year 2016-17along with Second Revised Estimates for the financial year 2015-16 and Third Revised Estimates for the financial year 2014-15 (with Base Year 2011-12) as per the revision policy*. Estimates for the years 2011-12 to 2015-16 released vide press note dated 31st January, 2017 were subsequently revised by incorporating the new series of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) released on 31stMay, 2017 and presented in National Accounts Statistics (NAS) 2017.


	The First Revised Estimates for the year 2016-17 have been compiled using industry-wise/institution-wise detailed information instead of using the benchmark-indicator method employed at the time of release of Provisional Estimates on 31st May, 2017. The estimates of GDP and other aggregates for the years 2014-15and 2015-16 have undergone revision due to use of latest available data on agricultural production; industrial production especially those based on the provisional results of Annual Survey of Industries (ASI): 2015-16 and final results of ASI: 2014-15; government expenditure (replacing Revised Estimates with Actuals for the year 2015-16) and also more comprehensive data available from various source agencies and State/UT Directorates of Economics and Statistics. 
	The salient features of the estimates at aggregate level are indicated below:


Gross Domestic Product

 


	Nominal GDP or GDP at current prices for the year 2016-17 is estimated as Rs. 152.54 lakh crore while that for the year 2015-16 is estimated as Rs. 137.64 lakh crore, exhibiting a growth of 10.8 per cent during 2016-17 as against 10.4 per cent during 2015-16.


 


	Real GDP or GDP at constant (2011-12) prices for the years 2016-17 and 2015-16 stands at Rs. 121.96 lakh crore and Rs. 113.86 lakh crore, respectively, showing growth of 7.1 per cent during 2016-17 and 8.2 per cent during 2015-16. 


 

 

Industry-wise Analysis

 


	The changes in the Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices in different sectors of the economy at current and constant (2011-12) prices are presented in Statements 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. At the aggregate level, nominal GVA at basic prices increased by 10.1 per cent during 2016-17 as against 9.2 per cent during 2015-16. In terms of real GVA, i.e., GVA at constant (2011-12) basic prices, there has been a growth of 7.1 per cent in 2016-17, as against growth of 8.1 per cent in 2015-16.

	The growth in real GVA during 2016-17has been lower than that in 2015-16 mainly due to lower growth in ‘manufacturing’ (7.9%), ‘construction’ (1.3%), ‘transport, storage, communication & services related to broadcasting’ (4.3%), ‘trade, repair, hotels and restaurants’ (8.9%), ‘financial services’ (1.3%) and‘real estate, ownership of dwelling & professional services’ (8.0%) as may be seen from Statement 4.2.At constant prices, the growth rates of primary (comprising agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining & quarrying), secondary (comprising manufacturing, electricity, gas, water supply & other utility services, and construction) and tertiary (services) sectors have been estimated as 7.4 per cent, 6.1 per cent and 7.5 per centduring 2016-17 as against a growth of 2.6 per cent, 9.4 per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively, in the previous year.


 

Net National Income


	Nominal Net National Income (NNI) at current prices for the year 2016-17 stands at Rs. 134.9 lakh crore as against Rs. 121.5 lakh crore in 2015-16, showing an increase of 11.0 per cent during 2016-17 as against an increase of 10.7 per cent in the previous year.


 

Gross National Disposable Income


	Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) at current prices is estimated as Rs. 154.6 lakh crore for the year 2016-17, while the estimate for the year 2015-16 stands at Rs. 140.2 lakh crore, showing a growth of 10.3 per cent as against 10.2 per cent in the year 2015-16. 


 

 

Saving


	Gross Saving during 2016-17 is estimated as Rs. 45.73 lakh crore as against Rs. 43.02 lakh crore during 2015-16. Rate of Gross Saving to GNDI for the year 2016-17 is estimated as 29.6 per cent as against 30.7 per cent, estimated for 2015-16. 


 


	The highest contributor to Gross Saving is the household sector, with a share of 54.2 per cent in the year 2016-17. However, this share has declined from 56.9 per cent in 2015-16. This decline can be attributed to decline in households gross financial savings, which has declined from Rs. 15.21 lakh crore in 2015-16 to Rs. 14.05 lakh crore in 2016-17. On the other hand, as shown in Statement 5, the share of Non-Financial Corporations and Financial Corporations have increased from 39.8 per cent in 2015-16 to 41.0 per cent in 2016-17 and 6.8 per cent in 2015-16 to 7.3 per cent in 2016-17, respectively. The dis-saving of General Government has decreased from 3.5 per cent of Gross Saving in 2015-16 to 2.5 per cent in 2016-17.


 

Capital Formation


	Gross Capital Formation (GCF) at current and constant prices is estimated by two approaches :– (i) through flow of funds, derived as Gross Saving plus net capital inflow from abroad; and (ii) by the commodity flow approach, derived by the type of assets. The estimates of GCF through the flow of funds approach are treated as the firmer estimates, and the difference between the two approaches is taken as “errors and omissions”. However, GCF by industry of use and by institutional sectors do not include “valuables”, and therefore, these estimates are lower than the estimates available from commodity flow approach.


 


	Gross Capital Formation (GCF) at current prices is estimated as Rs. 46.71 lakh crore for the year 2016-17 as compared to Rs. 44.42 lakh crore during 2015-16. The rate of GCF to GDP declined from 32.3 per cent during 2015-16 to 30.6 per cent in the year 2016-17. The rate of GCF excluding valuables to GDP stands at 30.8 per cent and 29.5 per cent for the years2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively. The rate of capital formation in the years 2011-12 to 2016-17 has been higher than the rate of saving because of net capital inflow from Rest of the World (ROW).


 


	In terms of the share to the total GCF (at current prices), the highest contributor is Non-Financial Corporations. However, its share has declined from 56.0 percent in 2015-16 to 55.1 percent in 2016-17(Statement 9). Share of household sector in GCF is also significant, which has risen from 30.5 percent in 2015-16 to 31.4 percent in 2016-17. The share of General Government in GCF has increased from 11.9 per cent in 2015-16 to 12.9 per cent in 2016-17.


 


	Within the Gross Capital Formation at current prices, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) amounted to Rs. 43.52 lakh crore in 2016-17 as against Rs. 39.18 lakh crore in 2015-16. The rate of GFCF to GDP at current prices continues to be the same at 28.5 per cent in both the years 2015-16 and 2016-17. The change in stocks of inventories, at current prices, decreased from Rs. 2.55 lakh crore in 2015-16 to Rs. 1.00 lakh crore in 2016-17, while the valuables decreased from Rs. 2.03 lakh crore in 2015-16 to Rs. 1.76 lakh crore in 2016-17.


 

 


	The rate of Gross Capital Formation to GDP at constant (2011-12) prices has decreased from 34.5 per cent in 2015-16 to 33.5 per cent in 2016-17.


 

Consumption Expenditure 


	Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) at current prices is estimated at Rs. 90.05 lakh crore for the year 2016-17as against Rs. 80.91 lakh crore in 2015-16. In relation to GDP, the rates of PFCE at current prices during 2015-16 and 2016-17 are estimated at 58.8 per cent and 59.0 per cent respectively.


 


	At constant (2011-12) prices, the PFCE is estimated as Rs. 63.51 lakh crore and Rs. 68.12 lakh crore, respectively for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17. The corresponding rates of PFCE to GDP for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17 are 55.8 per cent and 55.9 per cent respectively.


 


	Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) at current prices is estimated as Rs. 16.64 lakh crore for the year 2016-17 as against Rs. 14.28 lakh crore during 2015-16. At constant (2011-12) prices, the estimates of GFCE for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17 stand at Rs. 11.25 lakh crore and Rs. 12.62 lakh crore respectively.


 

Estimates at per capita level


	Per Capita Income, i.e., Per Capita Net National Income at current prices, is estimated as Rs. 94,731 and Rs. 1,03,870 respectively for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17. Correspondingly, Per Capita PFCE at current prices, for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17 is estimated at Rs. 63,065 and Rs. 69,322 respectively.


 


	More details of these estimates are available in Statements 1-9 appended to this Press Note.


 

Summary of Revision in the GDP Estimates


	The use of latest available data from various agencies have resulted in some changes in both the levels of GVA and growth estimates for the years 2014-15 and 2015-16. The reasons for revision in the estimates of the years 2014-15 and 2015-16, released on 31.05.2017 are mentioned in the Annexure.

7. GNDI = NNDI + CFC = GNI + other current transfers from ROW, net (Receipts less payments)

8. Gross Capital Formation= Gross Savings+ Net Capital Inflow from ROW

9. GCF = GFCF + CIS + Valuables + “Errors and Omissions”

10. Gross Disposable Income of Govt. = GFCE + Gross Saving of General Government

11. Gross Disposable Income (GDI) of Households = GNDI – GDI of Govt. – Gross Savings of All Corporations

 

REMARKS ON THE FORMULAE:

1. Production taxes or subsidies are paid or received with relation to production and are independent of the volume of actual production. Some examples are:

Production Taxes - Land Revenues, Stamps and Registration fees 

Production Subsidies - Subsidies to Railways, Subsidies to village and small industries


	Product taxes or subsidies are paid or received on per unit of product. Some examples are:


Product Taxes: Excise Tax, Sales tax, Service Tax and Import and Export duties

Product Subsidies: Food, Petroleum and fertilizer subsidies


	Other Current Transfers refers to current transfers other than the primary incomes
	Estimate of GCF derived from this formula is taken as the “firmer” estimate and the difference between this estimate and the sum of GFCF, CIS and valuables is taken as “errors and omissions”, as referred in 9 above.

The Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has released the First Advance estimates of national income at constant (2011-12) and current prices, for the financial year 2017-18. These are presented in Statements 1-4. 

 

2.         The First Advance Estimates of GDP have been released in accordance with the release calendar of National Accounts@. The approach for compiling the advance estimates is based on benchmark-indicator method. The Sector-wise estimates are obtained by extrapolation of  indicators like (i) Index of Industrial Production of first 7 months of the financial year, (ii) financial performance of listed companies in the private corporate sector available upto quarter ending September,2017 (iii) 1st advance estimates of crop production, (iv) accounts of  Central & State Governments, information on indicators like deposits & credits, passenger and freight earnings of railways, passengers and cargo handled by civil aviation, cargo handled at major sea ports, sales of commercial vehicles etc. available for first 8 months of the financial year.With the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 1st July 2017 and consequent changes in the tax structure, the total tax revenue used for GDP compilation include non-GST revenue and GST revenue. For the year 2017-18, the Budget estimates of tax revenue as provided by Controller General of Accounts (CGA) has been used for estimating taxes on products at current prices.  For compiling taxes on products at constant prices, volume extrapolation is done using volume growth of taxed goods and services and aggregated to get the total volume of taxes. Annual forecast of indicators which are available for first 7/8 months is based on regression using seasonal dummies to account for seasonal fluctuations.Some indicators like IIP has been compiled by dividing the cumulative value for the first 7 months of the current financial year by average of ratio of cumulative value of 7 months to the annual value of past years.The salient features of the estimates are detailed below:

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for mandatory packaging of foodgrains and sugar in the jute material for the Jute Year 2017-18.  The decision would sustain the core demand for the jute sector and support the livelihood of the workers and farmers dependent on the sector.   The Jute Year 2017-18 period is from 1st July 2017 to 30th June, 2018.

Features:


	The CCEA has extended the mandatory packaging norms under the Jute Packaging Material (JPM) Act, 1987.   
	The approval mandates that 90% of the food grains and 20% of the sugar products shall be mandatorily packed in jute bags. 
	The decision also mandates, in the first instance, the entire requirement for packing of food grains would be placed in jute bags thus, making a provision for 100% packing of food grains in jute bags subject to the ability of the jute industry to meet the requirement.


Impact:

The decision will benefit farmers and workers located in the Eastern and North Eastern regions of the country particularly in West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya and Tripura.

Measures taken by Government to give a boost to Jute industry:

Jute industry is predominantly dependent on Government sector which purchases jute products more than Rs. 5,500 crore every year.  Considering that nearly 3.7 lakh workers and approximately 40 lakh farmers are dependent for their livelihood on the jute sectors, the government has been making concerted efforts for the development of jute sector; increasing the quality and productivity of raw jute, diversification of jute sector and also boosting and sustaining demand for jute products.  These include-

 


	With a view to boosting demand in the jute sector, Government of India has imposed Definitive Anti Dumping Duty on import of jute goods from Bangladesh and Nepal with effect from 5th January, 2017. As a result of these measures, 13 Twine mills in Andhra Pradesh had resumed operation, benefitting 20000 workers. Further, imposition of Definitive Anti Dumping Duty has provided scope for an additional demand of 2 lakh MT of jute goods in the domestic market for the Indian jute industry.


 


	In order to improve the productivity and quality of raw jute through a carefully designed intervention, called the Jute ICARE, the Government has been supporting close to one lakh jute farmers by disseminating improved agronomic practices such as line sowing using seed drills, weed management by using wheel-hoeing and nail-weeders, distribution of quality certified seeds and also providing microbial assisted retting. These interventions have resulted in enhancing the quality and productivity of raw jute and increasing income of jute farmers by Rs. 10,000 per hectare.


 


	In order to support jute farmers, Jute Corporation of India (JCI) has been given a grant of Rs. 204 crore for 4 years starting from 2014-15 to enable JCI to conduct MSP operations and ensure price stabilization in the jute sector.


 


	With a view to supporting diversification of jute sector, the National Jute Board has collaborated with National Institute of Design and a Jute Design Cell has been opened at Gandhinagar.


 


	Promotion of Jute Geo Textiles and Agro-Textiles has been taken up with the state governments particularly those in the North Eastern region and also with departments such as Ministry of Road Transport and Ministry of Water Resources.


 


	In order to promote transparency in jute sector, Jute SMART an e-govt initiative was launched in December, 2016, providing an integrated platform for procurement of B-Twill sacking by Government agencies. Further, the JCI is transferring 100% funds to jute farmers online on the jute procurement under MSP and commercial operations.

                Shri K.J. Alphons, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Tourism presented the awards to the winners of ‘All India Essay Competition’ for Schools across India on ‘Hospitality Education & Career’ at a function organized by the National Council for Hotel Management & Catering Technology (NCHMCT), Noida today. NCHMCT is the apex body under the Ministry of Tourism coordinating hospitality education in the country. 

The top prize has been won by Ms. A.Gayatri of Guntur Subbiah Pillai T.Nagar Girl’s Higher Secondary School, Chennai winning cash prize of Rs.40,000/- followed by Ms. Nikhi Khambhatwala from Bharuch, Gujarat Rs.30,000/- and Anabil Goswami from Sonitpur, Assam Rs.20,000/-.  In addition, schools were also honored for encouraging participation through award of Golden and Silver Plaques while consolation prizes of Rs.10,000/- were given away to three schools from each of the four regions.

Addressing on the occasion, Shri K.J. Alphons said that the country is abuzz with the recent figures released by the Ministry of Tourism for 2017 wherein foreign tourist arrivals have been recorded at crossing the 10 million mark for the first time with an annual growth of 15.6 percent in 2017. Tourism in India alone earned USD 27.7 billion (Rupees 1,80,379 crores) in 2017. The Tourism sector contributes 6.88 per cent of the country's GDP. It contributes 12.36% in terms of total employment. Resultantly, this sector is poised for phenomenal growth in the coming years owing to the new holistic policies of the Government, especially on grant of e-visa and visa on arrival for specified countries. Greater number of foreign tourists are now attracted towards India because of its incredible cultural vibe, scenic natural locations, wildlife, religious circuits and more recently growth of the medical and wellness segment. Indian cuisine is now globally accepted, where foreigners are willing to indulge in sampling hot and spicy curries including the regional cuisines of India. 

The gathering comprised senior officials from Ministry of Tourism, students, teachers and Principals from All India schools, the IHM fraternity and members from the hospitality industry of private and public sector. 


	highlight of the program was the attendance of Padamshri Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, also an alumni of IHM under NCHMCT, who motivated and encouraged the young students into taking up hospitality as a promising career which is full of thrills, excitement and gives you an excellent opportunity for cross cultural interaction. 


National Council for Hotel Management & Catering Technology (NCHMCT) is the apex body under the Ministry of Tourism coordinating hospitality education in the country. Initially with only four Institutes of Hotel Management in 1962, today the numbers have grown to 72 Institutes- both Government institutes and private institutes, across India, under its academic umbrella. Each year, nearly 12,000 trained students pass from the various 11 specialized courses offered by the Institutes of Hotel Management, who get readily picked up by the industry including hotels, restaurants, retail sector, airline, shipping, railways etc. while several become entrepreneurs or opt for higher studies.

In order to bring about greater awareness about hospitality programs offered by IHMs, the NCHMCT for the first time organized an ‘All India Essay Competition’ for Schools across India on ‘Hospitality Education & Career’ in December 2017. Through wide publicity, NCHMCT received overwhelming response from young students of 11-12th grade classes who enthusiastically described their interest in hotel management as a career option as against more traditional one like engineering, medicine, IT, etc . The essays were scrutinized and short listed at regional level and the finalists were reassessed by and an expert panel at the NCHMCT-NOIDA.

                Ministry of Tourism has streamlined the Hotel classification guidelines to make them simple, transparent and time bound. The application for classification and payments of fees have been made through digital platform only and the prevalent options of application by post and payment of fees by Demand Draft has been done away with. This has ensured the eradication of possibility of delay/manipulation caused by human interference.

Similarly, the time limit for ensuring compliances on deficiencies of a hotel, the prevalent system had an open ended scope without any prescribed time limit. The recent amendments have included a time limit of three months, thus removing any discretion in the matter. This will ensure a time bound compliance and speedy disposal of cases.

The amendments have made it clear that liquor shops/liquor stores in the premises of the hotel other than bars will not be considered for classification under star hotels ""with alcohol"" category, to remove any ambiguity.

It has been made mandatory for all the hotels classified under all categories to display their classification status prominently at the reception and on their websites under a separate icon on the opening page, which will display the order of classification issued by the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India.

The amendments have included a detailed timeline within which the classification has to be completed. In every case where the required documents and procedures are fulfilled, the classification will be completed within 90 days. Event wise time limits (like inspection, uploading inspection report, submission of compliance in case of deficiencies, approval of Competent Authority and uploading of classification letter etc.) have been fixed to ensure that all the cases with no deficiency /compliance issues can be classified within 90 days of the date of application.

                Hotel classification guidelines have been streamlined to make them simple, transparent and time bound.

The application for classification and payments of fees have been made through digital
platform only and the prevalent options of application by post and payment of fees by Demand
Draft has been done away with. This has ensured the eradication of possibility of delay/manipulation caused by human interference.

Similarly, the time limit for ensuring compliances on deficiencies of a hotel, the prevalent system had an open ended scope without any prescribed time limit. The recent amendments have included a time limit of three months, thus removing any discretion in the matter. This will ensure a time bound compliance and speedy disposal of cases.

The amendments have made it clear that liquor shops/liquor stores in the premises of the hotel other than bars will not be considered for classification under star hotels ""with alcohol"" category, to remove any ambiguity.

It has been made mandatory for all the hotels classified under all categories to display their classification status prominently at the reception and on their websites under a separate icon on the opening page, which will display the order of classification issued by the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India.

The amendments have included a detailed timeline within which the classification has to be completed. In every case where the required documents and procedures are fulfilled, the classification will be completed within 90 days. Event wise time limits (like inspection, uploading inspection report, submission of compliance in case of deficiencies, approval of Competent Authority and uploading of classification letter etc.) have been fixed to ensure that all the cases with no deficiency /compliance issues can be classified within 90 days of the date of application.

                Ministry of Tourism has recognised Medical and Wellness Tourism as Niche Tourism Products for promotion. The Ministry offers financial support as Marketing Development Assistance, for Publicity, and for organising Wellness and Medical Tourism Promotion shows as well as workshop/events/seminars to accredited Medical and Wellness Tourism Service Providers and Chambers of Commerce, etc. A film on Medical Tourism has been produced in association with BBC and is used at various fora for promotional purposes. Medical and Medical attendant visa has been introduced to ease the travel process of Medical Tourists. The e-tourist visa regime has been expanded to include medical visits as well. It has also been decided to set up facilitation counters at the major airports of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Bengaluru for tourists arriving on Medical Visas. A National Medical and Wellness Tourism Board has been constituted to provide a dedicated institutional framework to take forward the cause of promotion of Medical and Wellness Tourism including Ayurveda and any other format of Indian system of medicine covered by Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH). 

India has emerged as a major Medical Tourism destination. While Ministry of Tourism does not maintain any data regarding the growth of India’s medical tourism vis a vis other countries, Ministry of Commerce informs that as per a FICCI-IMS Knowledge Paper titled, ‘Medical Value travel in India: Enhancing value in MVT’, published in 2016, India is amongst the top 6 MVT (Medical Value Travel) destinations of the world which include Thailand, Singapore, India, Malaysia, Taiwan and Mexico (India ranked third in the world in 2015).

The Department of Commerce and Services Export Promotion Council (SEPC) have launched a Healthcare Portal www.indiahealthcaretourism.com, as a single source platform providing comprehensive information to medical travellers on the top healthcare institutions in the country in English, Arabic, Russian and French.

According to these modalities, only those proposals which have been recommended and justified by the concerned State Government / Union Territory Administration and concurred with by the Registrar General of India (RGI) and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) are to be considered for amendment of legislation. 

The criteria presently followed for specification of a community as a Scheduled Tribe are (i) indications of primitive traits, (ii) distinctive culture, (iii) geographical isolation, (iv) shyness of contact with the community at large, and (v) backwardness.

(iv)       Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)

There are certain groups among Scheduled Tribes who have declining or stagnant population, low level of literacy, pre-agricultural level of technology and are economically backward.  These groups are among the most vulnerable sections of our society as they are few in numbers, have not attained any significant level of social and economic development and generally inhabit remote localities having poor infrastructure and administrative support.  75 such groups in 18 States and one UT have been identified and categorized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  The scheme is implemented in accordance with CCD (Conservative-cum-Development) / Annual Plans prepared by the State / UT through various agencies of the State Government/UT Admn like Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDPs) / Integrated Tribal Development Agencies (ITDAs) and Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs).  It is a 100% Central Sector Scheme.  

 

(v)        Scheme of Grant-in-aid to voluntary organizations working for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.   

 

The Scheme was launched in 1953-54 and was last revised w.e.f. 1st April 2008.     The prime objective of the scheme is to enhance the reach of welfare schemes of Government and fill the gaps in service deficient tribal areas, in the sectors such as education, health, drinking water, agro-horticultural productivity, social security net etc. through the efforts of voluntary organizations, and to provide favourable environment for socio-economic upliftment and overall development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs).  Any other innovative activity having direct positive impact on the socio-economic development or livelihood generation of STs may also be considered through voluntary efforts.  The scheme is Central Sector Scheme.  The grants are provided to the non-governmental organizations on application, in a prescribed format, duly recommended by the multi-disciplinary State Level Committee of the concerned State Government/UT Administration. Funds are generally provided to the extent of 90% by the Government.  The voluntary organization is expected to bear the remaining 10% balance from its own resources.

 

(vi)       Vocational Training in Tribal Areas.

 

The main aim of the Scheme is to develop the skills of the ST youth for a variety of jobs as well as self-employment and to improve their socio-economic condition by enhancing their income.  The scheme covers all the State and Union Territories.  It is not an area-specific scheme, the condition being that free vocational training facilities are extended only to tribal youth 100% grants under the scheme are provided to the State, Union Territories and other Associations implementing the Scheme.  Each Vocational Training Centre (VTC) under the Scheme may cater to 5 vocational courses in traditional skills depending upon the employment potential of the area.  Keeping in view the limited potential of even skilled persons in interiors areas, each ST boy/girl is trained in two trades of his/her choice, the course in each trade being for duration of three months.  Each trainee is to be attached at the end of six months to a master craftsman in a semi-urban/urban area for a period of six months, to learn his/her skills by practical experience.  The scheme has been revised with effect from 1.4.2009 to provide enhanced financial norms and to ensure linkages of vocational courses with recognized certificate/diploma through affiliation/accreditation of courses and institutions under Modular Employable Skills and Craftsman Training Scheme by National Council of Vocational Training of Ministry of Labour and Employment. 

 

(vii)      Scheme of Strengthening Education among ST Girls in Low Literacy Districts.  

 

The primary objective of this Central Sector Scheme is promotion of education among tribal girls in the identified low literacy districts of the country.  The scheme, revised w.e.f. 1st April 2008,   aims to improve the socio-economic status of the poor and illiterate tribal population through the education of women.  The Scheme has been revised with effect from 1.4.2008.  Now it is being implemented in 54 identified low literacy districts where ST Population is 25% or more and ST female literacy rate is below 35% as per 2001 census.  The Scheme aims to bridge the gap in literacy levels between the general female population and tribal women and is meant exclusively for ST Girls.  The educational complexes are established in rural areas of identified districts and have classes I to V with a provision for upgradation up to class XII, provided there is sufficient accommodation for classrooms, hostel, a kitchen, gardening and for sports facilities.  The educational complexes impart not only formal education to tribal girls but also train the students in agriculture, animal husbandry, other vocations and crafts to make them economically strong. 

 

 (viii)    Support to Tribal Research Institutes

Support to Tribal Research is a sub-scheme of Umbrella Programme for Development of Scheduled Tribes.  Under this component, Ministry of Tribal Affairs has been extending financial support to  TRIs through the Scheme ‘Support to TRIs’ for identified activities such as research and evaluation studies, documentation & preservation, organizing workshops / seminars/training, purchase, maintenance & preservation of artifacts for the existing museums, organize exchange visits by tribals etc. TRIs are engaged in the work of providing planning inputs to State Governments, conducting research and evaluation studies, collection of data, identifying challenges in the field of socio-economic development of tribals and understanding, promoting and preserving their culture.

Procurement and Marketing operations at pre-fixed MSP is undertaken by designated State agencies. Being a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, the funds are released to the States in the ratio of 75% Central Government share: 25% State Government share.

                The Constitution of India has several provisions to prevent discrimination against people belonging to Scheduled Tribes and to protect their rights.  Some of the important provisions, inter-alia, are:


	Article 15 pertaining to prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth;

Besides, several legislations are in place to prevent discrimination against people belonging to Scheduled Tribes and to protect their rights. These, inter-alia, are: 


	In order to prescribe punishment for the preaching and practice of “Untouchability” for the enforcement of any disability arising therefrom and for matters connected therewith, the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 has been enacted.

Government has adopted a multi-pronged strategy for overall development and mainstreaming of tribal people in the country, which includes support for education, health, sanitation, water supply, skill development, livelihood, infrastructure, etc. Major part of infrastructure development and provision of basic amenities in tribal areas / regions in the country is carried out through various schemes / programmes of concerned Central Ministries and the State Governments concerned, while the Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides additive to these initiatives by way of plugging critical gaps.

Ministry of Tribal Affairs has been implementing several programmes/schemes for the benefit of scheduled tribe people. These, inter-alia, are:

Ekalavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs), with the capacity
of 480 students in each school, are set up in the States/ UTs under Grants
under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India. The capital cost
for setting up the school complex, including hostels and staff quarters etc.
has been earmarked as Rs. 12.00 crore with a provision to go up to Rs.16.00
crore in hill areas, deserts and islands. Recurring cost during the first year
for schools would @ Rs. 42000/-per child, with provision of raising it by 10%
every second year to compensate for inflation etc. 

 

Besides, the
Ministry also provides funds for setting up residential Ashram schools under
the Centrally Sponsored Scheme `Establishment of Ashram Schools in Tribal Sub
Plan Areas`. As per extant provisions of the Scheme, State Governments are
eligible for 100% central share for construction of all Girls’ Ashram Schools
and also for construction of Boys’ Ashram Schools in naxal affected areas. The
funding pattern for the other Boys’ Ashram Schools is on 50:50 basis, while
cent percent assistance is given to UTs for construction of both Girls’ and
Boys’ Ashram Schools. 

 

The above
schemes are demand driven and implemented through the State Governments/UTs.
Funds are sanctioned by the Ministry under these scheme based on the proposal
received from the State Governments including State of Jammu and Kashmir. A
statement showing release of funds to the State Governments for EMRSs during
last three years is given below:-

                            The water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on January 25, 2018 was 73.029 BCM which is 45% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs. This percentage was at 47 for the week ending on January 18, 2018. The level of water storage in the week ending on January 25, 2018 was 91% of the storage of corresponding period of last year and 91% of storage of average of last ten years. 

 

The total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 161.993 BCM which is about 63% of the total storage capacity of 257.812 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. 37 Reservoirs out of these 91 have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW. 

 

REGION WISE STORAGE STATUS:-

The northern region includes States of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. There are 6 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 18.01 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 7.91 BCM which is 44% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 39% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 45% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the corresponding period of last year but is less than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

                India will be hosting the International Dam Safety Conference - 2018 at Thiruvananthapuram on January 23-24. Shri Pinarayi Vijayan, Chief Minister of Kerala will inaugurate the conference and Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Union Minister of State for of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will preside over the inaugural function.  Central Water Commission is organizing the event in association with Kerala Water Resources Department (KWRD), Kerala State Electricity Board, National Institute of Technology Calicut and College of Engineering, Trivandrum.

 

Dam safety conferences are organized as an annual event under the Dam Safety Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) project being run by the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation  (MoWR,RD & GR) in the seven states of Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Uttarakhand. Launched in the year 2012 with a financial outlay of Rs. 2100 Crores, this World Bank aided project aims at  the rehabilitation of old dams in the country that may be experiencing distress and are in need of attention for ensuring their structural safety and operational efficiency. The project also aims to strengthen the institutional capacity and project management in this area. As part of this exercise, DRIP has been engaged in bringing greater awareness on dam safety issues and finding novel solutions to address them by pooling the best technologies, knowledge and experience available around the world. In this direction, Dam Safety Conferences are being organized as annual events in the different DRIP states. Dam professionals, academicians, scientists, as well as industries assemble to deliberate on the problems associated with the dam safety and share the concepts, techniques, instruments, materials etc. available to address the design and construction of new dams, and also for monitoring, surveillance, operation, maintenance, rehabilitation along with disaster mitigation measures for existing dams. 

The upcoming conference at Trivandrum will see the participation of 550 delegates from over 20 countries.  Some of the  international experts include Dr Anton J Schleiss, President of the International Commission on Large Dam EPFL Switzerland, Dr Nicholos Schofield, Chief Executive of Australian Water Partnership,  Mr Satoru Ueda, Lead Dam Specialist of the World Bank,  Dr Martin Wieland, global seismic expert from Switzerland, Dr Ignacio Escuder Bueno, President of Spanish Commission on Large Dams, Technical University of Valencia, Spain, Dr Desmond Harfort, leading dam safety expert, BC Hydro Canada, Mr Angus Swindon, National Director, Entura, Hydro Tasmania, Australia Over 140 technical papers will be presented on several aspects of dam safety including case studies. About 30 national and international organizations are showcasing contemporary developments in technology, materials, instrumentation and their application in addressing dam safety issues during the exhibition being organized during the conference. The themes for various sessions include Sustainable Dam Safety Initiatives; Uncertainties and Risk Management in Dams; Operation, Maintenance, Rehabilitation, and Upgrading of existing dams; Dam Safety Management Practices; and Integrated Flood Management for existing dams. 

Seven dam safety guidelines and manuals developed under DRIP will also be released for implementation during the conference. A software programme - Dam Health and Rehabilitation Monitoring Application (DHARMA)-  will also be launched during the conference. DHARMA is a web tool to digitize all dam related data effectively. It will help to document authentic asset and health information pertaining to the large dams in the country, enabling appropriate actions to ensure need based rehabilitation. It is a new stride in asset management aspect by India.

                 

The key recommendations emerging from the deliberations of the conference will be circulated to stakeholders as well as policy makers for implementation. Select technical papers received for the conference will be published as a compendium to provide a permanent reference in the libraries of the State Agencies responsible for design, construction, operation and maintenance of dams. For wider dissemination, the compendium will also be available on the DRIP website: www.damsafety.in. 

                    

Dams have played a key role in fostering rapid and sustained agricultural and rural growth and development, which have been key priorities for the Govt. of India since independence. Over the last seventy years, India has invested substantially in the critical infrastructure required to manage and store the limited surface water resources in reservoirs to ensure food, energy, and water securities. Globally India ranks third after China and the United States of America in terms of number of large dams (5254 large dams in operation and 447 large dams under construction) with a total storage capacity of about 283 billion cubic meters. About 80% of these large dams are more than twenty-five years old, and about 213 dams exceed the age of 100 years and were built in an era whose design practices and safety considerations do not match with the current design standards and the prevailing safety norms. This necessitates special efforts at rehabilitation of old dams and ensuring their long term structural safety. 

The project DRIP consists of three main components; Component I: Rehabilitation of selected dams and their appurtenances; Component II: Institutional Strengthening; and Component III: Project Management. Institutional Strengthening includes capacity building in the DRIP Implementing Agencies through national and international training, equipping selected premier academic institutions in dam safety areas so that their expertise can be utilized to provide solutions to dam safety issues, assisting in the development of Emergency Action Plans (EAP) for dams, developing the software tool ‘Dam Health and Rehabilitation Monitoring Application (DHARMA)’, Seismic Hazard Mapping for the entire Country and development of Seismic Hazard Assessment Information System (SHAISYS), preparation of Guidelines and Manuals, strengthening of Dam Safety Organisations etc.  In the year 2017, the project was extended by two years, until June 2020, to finish all the programmed rehabilitation works on 223 dams with a proposed revised cost of 3466 Crore INR.

                Patna will soon be amongst the few major cities along river Ganga to have 100 percent sewage treatment capacity to ensure that no waste water gets discharged into the river. The National Mission for Clean Ganga has put in place a comprehensive sewage management plan for the city, that will replace its existing, defunct system with one that will take care of its sewage treatment requirements till 2035.

 

The existing sewage treatment plants in Patna have long outlived their utility. The old sewer lines are choked, so waste water cannot flow into the STPs for treatment.   As a result the STPs are lying defunct and sewage is getting discharged into the river. 

 

In order to revamp the sewage management system in the city, NMCG has approved eleven projects worth Rs 3582.41 crore that will involve laying down 1140.26 km of sewerage lines and create sewage treatment capacity of 350 MLD. This would cover the sewage treatment requirements of the city upto 2035, when its sewage generation is estimated to be 320 MLD. The new system will also cover Digha and Kankarbagh sewerage zones which have no existing treatment facility so far.  Once these projects are completed, Patna will be amongst the few cities having 100 % sewage treatment capacity. 

 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for four awarded sewerage projects costing Rs 738.04 crore on October 14, 2017. The ceremony took place at Mokama. These four projects together will create new STP capacity of 120 MLD and upgrade the existing 20 MLD for Beur, Karmalichak and Saidpur sewerage zones. This will also lay down sewer network of 234.84 km in Beur and Saidpur zones.

 

Seven other sewerage projects are at various stages of implementation out of which two – Digha and Kankarbagh sewerage zones – worth Rs 1402.89 crore are sanctioned under Hybrid Annuity-based PPP mode. Sewer network works for two zones – Karmalichak and Saidpur zones – worth Rs 708.63 crore will be awarded soon whereas three more projects in Pahari zone to create 60 MLD STP capacity and lay down sewer network of 198.38 km costing Rs 732.85 are under implementation.

Apart from the foregoing sewage management projects, Patna River Front Development project worth Rs 254.52 crore is at an advanced stage of completion (more than 80% work done). Under this, 16 ghats and 6.6 km of promenade are being developed among other services that include toilets, bathrooms, changing rooms etc. Pathri Ghat in Patna which was developed under Namami Gange programme won 2A Asia Architecture Award 2016. Under the River Surface Cleaning project, a trash skimmer has been deployed in Patna at a cost of Rs 3.96 crore. 

It was only with the launch of Namami Gange programme and empowerment of NMCG as an Authority that Patna was given the attention it deserves. Numerous visits of senior officers to Patna and several consultations with technical experts, river scientists, city administration and city dwellers led NMCG to expedite the sanctioning of projects of demographically dense areas generating more sewage water. Because of the city’s geographical placing, a significant quantum of pollution load discharges into the river. Keeping in mind these considerations, all sewage management projects in Patna were approved in a time-bound manner. Also, Patna has some of the best quality ghats which have been constructed under River Front Development project under Namami Gange and more are underway.

Patna is one of the oldest inhabited cities in India with a population of over two million. The western periphery of the city is bound by river Sone whereas on southern side flows Punpun River which later joins river Ganga. It is the second largest city of eastern India and the most densely populated city in Bihar. The swift transformation of Patna into a metropolis, with a population of over 2 millions, makes it a crucial city for Namami Gange programme. A cleaner and healthier river Ganga would augur well for the already ascendant development of this historic city.

                Union Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation,  Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari has called upon state govenments to cooperate with one another  and with the centre to expedite the projects for interlinking of rivers. He was addressing the fourteenth meeting of the Special Committee for Inter-linking of Rivers in New Delhi today. Shri Gadkari stressed upon the need to design better technical models that aimed at bringing down construction cost while maintaining  quality, so that projects do not languish for want of funds. He also called upon state governments to explore new financing models including low-interest loans from foreign agencies. 

Shri Gadkari  said that inter-linking of rivers will bring a big social economic change in the country, and usher in prosperity in many regions that are poorly developed today. He said if we are able to save the enormous amounts of river water that gets lost to the seas as run-off, and are able to divert this to water deficit regions, we can solve the problem of water scarcity that exists in several states today. 

The Minister however added that while implementing the river interlinking projects the rehabilitation of displaced persons must be fully ensured. He said he is pained to see a large number of DPs still awaiting rehabilitation at various project sites which have been completed long back.

In order to resolve issues related to various projects Shri Gadkari said that clusters of states will be made and MoS  Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal will soon visit states and hold meetings   for on the spot discussion with the concerned state government on the various pending issues. Referring to the funding of various ILR projects Shri Gadkari said the time has come when we have look for innovative funding mechanisms  for these projects. He urged state governments to come forward with definite funding proposals which can be taken up with foreign funding agencies. Shri Gadkari said his Ministry will provide all help to the states for this.   

Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Dharam Pal Singh, Irrigation Minister of UP, Shri T Harish Rao, Irrigation Minister of Telangana and Senior officials from the centre and state governments attended the meeting. 

The meeting confirmed the minutes of the 13th meeting of the Special Committee for Inter-linking of Rivers held on July 27, 2017 at New Delhi. It also reviewed the follow-up action on the decisions taken during the last meeting. The other issues taken up included the status of clearance of Ken-Betwa Link Project, Damanganga-Pinjal and Par-Tapi-Narmada Link Projects. The meeting was informed that the clearances for Ken-Betwa Link Project have been given and MoU is likely to be signed soon. For the other two projects also all major issues have been resolved. Other topics that were discussed include Surplus Water in River Basin for Interlinking of Rivers, Status of Intra-State link proposals, Restructuring of National Water Development Agency, Constitution of Group of Financial Aspects under TFILR, Consideration of inter-linking of rivers (ILR) projects as National project and Alternative proposal of Diversion of Godavari water upto Cauvery basin (Phase-I). 

Union Cabinet in its meeting held on July 24, 2014 had approved the constitution of the Special Committee on ILR. Accordingly, Special Committee on ILR was constituted vide order dated September 23, 2014. The first meeting of the committee was held on October 17, 2014. The committee, after considering the views of all the stakeholders, is proceeding ahead to expedite the objectives of the interlinking of rivers as per terms of reference. Vigorous efforts have been made for generating consensus with development of alternative plans and also setting out road maps for implementation of projects.

Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and Parliamentary Affairs Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal has said that National Project Construction Corporation Ltd. (NPCC), a PSU of the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will now undertake basic infrastructure projects like Road, Buildings and Environment related projects also. He was addressing a function organized on the occasion of 61st Annual Day celebration of NPCC at New Delhi yesterday. Shri Meghwal said that government is giving proper attention on development of infrastructure projects as well as on the projects related to linking of Rivers and Cleaning Ganga. He further said that NPCC has begun working as Nodal Agency in Jharkhand for Clean Ganga Mission. He expressed hope that NPCC will serve the country well by implementing projects of the Ministry and projects of border areas with high quality standards in cost effective manner. He wished for success of NPCC in construction sector also and appreciated the dedication of employees of the company who work in remote and difficult areas where common man does not dare to enter. 



Welcoming the Minister the CMD of NPCC Shri Sanjay Kundu briefly narrated the achievement of the company and said that it was possible only due to collective efforts of the employees, cooperation of shareholders, clients and stakeholders. He said the company faced many ups and downs in last fifty years and was revived by the Government of India during 2009-10 and since then it is continuously earning profits. He informed the company paid a dividend of Rs. 1.02 crore for the year 2015-16 after a gap of almost 50 years. The dividend paid by the company to the Government for the year 2016-17 was Rs. 2.05 crore.

                In recognition of the contribution made by the Central Water Commission (CWC) for promoting the health and safety of large dams in India through the World Bank aided Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP), Central Board of Irrigation and Power (CBIP) conferred on CWC, the CBIP Special Recognition Award 2018, Excellence in Health & Safety of Large Dams for Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project for promoting health and safety conditions of large dams in India under the ‘Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project’ by application of state-of-the-art technology, to ensure their operational effectiveness for Irrigation and Drainage, Water Resources Management, Flood Protection, Disaster Management and excellent leadership in managing the Project. The award was received by Shri S M Husain, Chairman, CWC in the CBIP Raising Day celebrations here yesterday.

Besides assisting in the rehabilitation of distressed large dams, DRIP also assists in the capacity building of the Implementing Agencies through national and international training programmes in which about 3200 dam professionals have been trained on various aspects of dam safety aspects. Besides, six premier academic institutes have been assisted to improve their capability in dam safety areas, so that their expertise could later be utilized by the dam owning agencies in their dam safety efforts. Seismic Hazard Assessment of South-India Region is being carried out by the Earthquake Engineering Department of IIT Roorkee and a Memorandum of Understanding is under process to sign with CWPRS, Pune for the Seismic Hazard Assessment of North and North-East India Region thereby making available Seismic Hazard map for India. Memoranda of Understanding have been signed by NGRI, Hyderabad, CWPRS Pune and IIT Roorkee with DRIP Implementing Agencies for the establishment of seismological instrument stations at specified dams at appropriate locations and later for collecting, processing, monitoring, analyzing, interpreting and archiving the data generated at seismological instrument stations of these Dams.

With the assistance from Japan Water Agency, an Inspection Manual for Dam Field Engineers after Seismic Events for the Ichari Dam in Uttarakhand has been developed. Guidelines for the Development and Implementation of Emergency Action Plans for Dams was published, and five more Guidelines i.e. Guidelines for Preparing Operation and Maintenance Manual for Dams; for Instrumentation of Large Dams; for Mapping Flood Risks Associated with Dams; for Safety Inspection of Dams; and the Manual for Rehabilitating Large Dams are to be released this month.

                The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation, now Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD & GR) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The Pre-Feasibility Report (PFR) of the all 30 links have been prepared and circulated to the concerned State Governments by the NWDA. After survey and investigations, Feasibility Reports of 14 links under Peninsular Component and Feasibility Reports of 2 links and draft Feasibility Reports of 7 links (Indian portion) under Himalayan Component have been completed.

Presently, the survey, investigation and preparation of Pre-Feasibility Report (PFR)/ Feasibility Report (FR)/ Detailed Project Report (DPR) is being funded through River Basin Management scheme of MoWR, RD & GR. This Ministry has constituted a Group on Financial Aspects on 12.09.2017 under Task Force for Interlinking of Rivers (ILR) to consider the financial aspects of ILR projects and to suggest the funding pattern for implementing the same. Three meetings of the Group on Financial Aspects has been held on 24.10.2017, 17.11.2017 and 08.12.2017 respectively.

Funds are being released to Indirasagar Polavaram Project through Long Term Irrigation Fund, which has been created through National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development for funding Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana projects. Polavaram Project has provision of diversion of 80 TMC of water from Godavari Basin to Krishna Basin. The Right Main Canal of Polavaram Irrigation Project is proposed as lined canal, runs for a length of 174 km for diverting 80 TMC Godavari water to Krishna river upstream of Prakasam Barrage through the existing Budameru Diversion Channel. The canal is also contemplated to irrigate 1.29 lakh ha of ayacut (3.2 lack acre) in West Godavari and Krishna districts. Polavaram Poject has been declared as National Project by the Central Government.

The Government of Andhra Pradesh has taken up Pattiseema Lift Scheme to achieve early benefits of Polavaram Irrigation Project in order to utilize the flood waters going waste into the sea. The Pattiseema Lift Scheme is envisaged to utilize the already existing Polavaram Right Canal by lifting 240 Cumecs (8500 Cusecs) of water from Akhanda Godavari Right Bank on downstream side of Polavaram dam site near Pattisam village and dropping into Polavaram Right Canal at chainage 1.50 km. The main aspect of the Lift Scheme is to transfer 80 TMC of water into Krishna River by interlinking through Polavaram Right Canal.

The Pattiseema Lift Scheme work is completed and water is being drawn from Polavaram Right Canal from the year 2015-16 onwards.

                A Model Draft Bill for Flood Plain Zoning Legislation was circulated by the Union Government in 1975 to all States to help States enact legislation. The model bill provided for prohibition and restriction of the activities in the notified area of the flood plain.

The River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016 provides that the bank of River Ganga and its flood plain shall be construction free zone. It also prohibits construction of any structure for residential or commercial or industrial or any other purposes in the River Ganga, Bank of River Ganga or its tributaries or active flood area of River Ganga or its tributatires.

The National Green Tribunal vide its judgment dated 13.07.2017 in O.A. 200/2014 has directed to identity and demarcate the flood plains of river Ganga from Haridwar to Unnao and has ordered that till the said identification and demarcation of flood plain is completed, 100 metres from the edge of the river would be designated as no development/construction zone.

Further, Ministry of Environment Forests & Climate Change also circulated draft notification on “River Conservation Zones” in 2015 to all States.

Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation has taken up the matter with all the states. Only Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Manipur have enacted the Legislation.

Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) carries out ground water monitoring, four times a year, on regional scale through a network of observation wells in the Country. Comparison and analysis of Pre-monsoon (2017) water level data collected by CGWB with the decadal average (2007-2016) indicates decline in ground water level in about 61% of the wells. Details are given at Annexure.

Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and artificial recharge to ground water is primarily States’ responsibility.

MoWR, RD & GR has circulated a Model Bill to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable ground water legislation for its regulation and development which includes provision of rain water harvesting.  So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the ground water legislation on the lines of Model bill.

CGWA has issued advisories to States and UTs to take measures to promote/adopt artificial recharge to ground water/rainwater harvesting. 30 States/UTs have made rainwater harvesting mandatory by enacting laws or by formulating rules & regulations or by including provisions in building bye-laws or through suitable Government Orders.

Besides, other steps taken by the Central Government for conservation of ground water are available at the following URL http://mowr.gov.in/writereaddata/GW_Depletion.pdf

                Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is monitoring water quality at 3000 locations in 29 States and 6 Union Territories spread over the country, of which 1533 locations cover 540 rivers including River Ganga. Arsenic is one of the parameters analysed in water samples. Monitoring of water quality does not indicate detectable presence of Arsenic at any of monitored locations on rivers of the CPCB network. 

However, the Central & State Pollution Control Boards are implementing the Water Act, 1974 to restore water quality and following important steps are taken to prevent and control water pollution.


	During year 2016-17, monitoring network was expanded from 2500 to 3000 locations by addition of 500 new monitoring locations.



	Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) has been prepared and shared with all the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) on monitoring, analysis, parameters, frequency and data reporting etc.



	Online web based portal developed for quick data transfer and retrieval as Environmental Water Quality Data Entry System (EWQDES).



	CPCB identified 302 polluted river stretches in 275 rivers in the country.



	CPCB issued Directions under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 regarding ‘Treatment and Utilization of Sewage for Restoration of water quality of River’ to Municipal Corporations of 46 Metropolitan cities and 20 State Capitals in October, 2015.



	CPCB issued Directions under Section18 (1) (b) of the water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 regarding treatment & utilization of sewage to SPCBs/PCCs.



	CPCB issued Directions under Section18 (1) (b) of the water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 regarding untreated sewage and industrial effluent and disposal in coastal towns in India.



	CPCB prepared a reference document as a model plan for restoration of river stretches and communicated to all the SPCBs/PCCs for preparation of detailed project report.



	Model plan for restoration of River Hindon by incorporating assessment of point sources of pollution (Industrial and Municipal wastewater discharge) has also been prepared and suggested measures were shared with local administration for providing technical support from CPCB.



	Ministry of Environment Forest & Climate Change has notified standards for treated effluent of Sewage Treatment Plants on dated 13 October, 2017 for adherence.



	With respect to industrial effluents, consent management for compliance of standards is being enforced by SPCBs/PCCs to improve the water quality of the rivers.



	With respect to industrial units in the country CPCB has given directions under Section 5 of E (P) Act, 1986 for setting up of online Continuous water quality monitoring system to check the effluent quality being discharged. Subsequently non complying units in failure of installation of online monitoring system have been identified for action.



	Common effluent treatment plants for cluster of Small Scale Industrial units have been established. Directions under Section 5 of the E (P) Act, 1986 is also given to all Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) to install continuous effluent monitoring system to comply with the stipulated standards.

                Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and artificial recharge to ground water is primarily States’ responsibility. 

Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has prepared a conceptual document titled “Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water – 2013” which provides information about area specific artificial recharge techniques to augment the ground water resources based on the availability of source water and capability of subsurface formations to accommodate it. The Master Plan envisages construction of about 1.11 crore artificial recharge structures in urban and rural areas at an estimated cost of Rs. 79178 crore. This comprises around 88 lakh recharge structures/ facilities utilizing rainwater directly from roof top and more than 23 lakh artificial recharge and rainwater harvesting structures for conserving surplus runoff to augment the groundwater resources. It is estimated that annually about 85,565 MCM of surplus run-off can be harnessed to augment the ground water.  The Master Plan is available in public domain and has also been circulated to the State Governments for its implementation.

                The Government of India has launched Namami Gange programme in May 2015 for conservation of river Ganga with total outlay of Rs.20,000 crores. Namami Gange Programme is a holistic approach to clean Ganga through various activities such as treatment of municipal sewage, treatment of industrial effluent, river surface cleaning, rural sanitation, ghats & crematoria works, afforestation, biodiversity, awareness creation & public outreach etc. Total 187 projects for various activities have been sanctioned, out of which 47 projects have been completed. Cleaning of river is a continuous process and all out efforts are on to complete the projects.

Trash skimmers are being deployed at 11 locations to make the Ganga river garbage free. The Trash Skimmers collect all kinds of floating waste materials in the river such as flowers, coconuts, plastic bottles/bags, food packets, algae, logs, bamboos and any other floating waste.

                The current procedure followed by Central Water Commission (CWC)/Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD & GR) for clearance of irrigation projects is as follows:

The Preliminary Report of an irrigation project is submitted by the State Govt./Project Authority to CWC for “In-principle consent” for preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR).

After receiving “In-principle consent”, the DPR is prepared by the Project authority and is submitted to CWC for techno economical appraisal. Further, Statutory Clearances such as Environmental Clearance and Forest Clearance from Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC), clearance from Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) etc. are also to be submitted by the Project Authority.

The “Advisory Committee of MoWR, RD & GR constituted for consideration of techno-economic viability of Major, Medium Irrigation, Flood Control and Multipurpose project” considers such proposals for techno economical clearance.

Subsequently investment clearance proposals are submitted by states which are considered for approval by the Committee of MoWR, RD & GR constituted for said purpose.

                The 9th meeting of High Powered Review Board of Brahmaputra Board was held at Borgos, Kaziranga in Assam on December 30, 2017.

The meeting was chaired by Sri Nitin Jairam Gadkari, Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation. It was also attended by Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, Chief Minister, Assam, Shri Keshab Mahanta, Minister, Water Resources, Assam, Shri Chandra Mohan Patowary, Minister, Transport, Shri Atul Bora, Minister, Agriculture, Assam, Shri Letpao Hopkip, Minister, Water Resources, Manipur, Chief Secretary, Government of Assam, Chief Secretary, Government of Arunachal Pradesh, and other dignitaries and senior officers from basin states.

Shri Nitin Jairam Gadkari also launched the Mathematical Model Study prepared by IIT, Guwahati called Brahma-ID on this occasion. This project has been sponsored by Brahmaputra Board for an amount of Rs. 3.00 crore. 

The key points that were discussed and agreed upon during the 9th meeting of 9th High Powered Review Board were as follows:-

·High Powered Review Board (HPRB) approved restructuring of Brahmaputra Board and advised that funds should be largely spent for works and limited funds should be spent for establishment costs including salary and wages.

·HPRB ratified the project for protection of Majuli Island from flood and erosion for an amount of Rs. 237 crore.

·HPRB approved the establishment of Brahmaputra Board office complex in Majuli and handing over the works to NPCC, a PSU of the Ministry. 

·HPRB approved that the preparation of Master Plans, Feasibility Reports and DPRs for development of the complete Brahmaputra basin be also given to WAPCOS, a PSU under the Ministry. 

·HPRB suggested to create a Centre for Brahmaputra Studies in IIT, Guwahati covering multi-disciplinary aspects of hydrology, environment, inland waterways, agriculture and sociology. For this purpose, IIT, Guwahati will identify and earmark a land area of about four acres for development of the Centre and the Government of India will support establishment of this Centre.

·HPRB advised to take up actively afforestation and catchment area treatment in the upper riparian states to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation. For this purpose MoWR, RD &GR will prepare a proposal through Brahmaputra Board and take it up with MoEF & CC for consideration and release funds through CAMPA.

·HPRB advised Brahmaputra Board to share Master Plans for all the river basins with party Sates by March 31, 2018.

·HPRB advised Brahmaputra Board to constitute an Advisory Board in all the basin States. The Advisory Board should include NGOs, political leadership, Water Resources Department officials so that they may become active stakeholders in the management of Brahmaputra basin.

·HPRB recognized need among basin Sates to build their capacity of Water Resources Departments. To this end, HPRB advised Brahmaputra Board and Central Water Commission to conduct regional workshops in every basin State to enable the states to build capacity especially in the field of preparation of Master Plans, Feasibility Reports and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs).

HPRB recognized the fact that Brahmaputra river offers great opportunities for economic growth and employment generation in the NE States through development of inland waterways, tourism, industry, agriculture and allied sectors. To this end, comprehensive DPRs need to be developed for integrated water management. These DPRs should be bankable which can be taken up for external funding with International Agencies like World Bank, JICA, and ADB etc. The HPRB formed a Committee comprising Chairman, Brahmaputra Board, Chief Secretary, Assam and Chief Secretary, Arunachal Pradesh to determine the terms of reference for this purpose. The HPRB further directed that this work of comprehensive integrated master plan be assigned to WAPCOS, a PSU of Ministry, who may partner with leading global organizations working in the field of integrated water management.

Shri Nitin Jairam Gadkari hoped that Brahmaputra Board will turn these challenges of flood, erosion and sedimentation in Brahmaputra into opportunities for great economic growth with the cooperation of all stakeholders. He summed up with his vision for development of Brahmaputra as a great bridge to link India with South East Asia.

The Government on 16.11.2017, realizing the multi-dimensional needs of out of school adolescent girls (11-14 years) owing to the onset of second growth spurt during this period and with a aim to motivate these girls to join school system, approved continuation of the Scheme for Adolescent Girls (SAG) for out of school girls in the age group of 11-14 years. The scheme aims at providing them nutritional support @ Rs.9.50/beneficiary/day for 300 days in a year, motivating out of school girls to go back to formal schooling or skill training under non-nutrition component of the scheme. Government has also approved expansion and universalisation of the Scheme for Adolescent Girls in a phased manner i.e. in additional 303 districts in 2017-18 and the remaining districts in 2018-19 with the simultaneous phasing out of Kishori Shakti Yojana.

 

Presently, MWCD is implementing the Scheme for Adolescent Girls (SAG) in selected 508 districts across the country. SAG aims at empowering out of school adolescent girls of 11 to 14 years by improving their nutritional and health status, upgrading their skills. In addition to the nutritional support under the scheme, the girls are equipped with information on health, hygiene and guidance on existing public services. The Scheme aims to mainstream out of school girls into formal education or non-formal education. The scheme is being implemented using the platform of Integrated child Development Services Scheme. Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) are the focal point for the delivery of the services. Scheme for Adolescent Girls is a centrally sponsored scheme, implemented through Centre and State share in the ratio of 50:50, for nutrition component 60:40 for the rest of the activities for State and UTs with legislation, 90:10 for NE and three Himalayan States and 100% for UTs without legislation.

                Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Shri Rakesh Srivastava launched the Management Information System (MIS) portal for Anganwadi Services Training Programme in New Delhi today. The Ministry of Women and Child Development in collaboration with National Informatics Centre (NIC), has developed a Management Information System (MIS) portal for submitting applications/estimates by NGOs for carrying out Anganwadi Services (ICDS) Training through AWTCs/MLTCs. The first phase of the portal will enable NGOs to submit proposal to the respective States/UTs. They, in turn, process the proposals and recommend requirement of funds for running the Programme in the States/UTs. The Central government would further examine the proposal and release the funds. It will ensure that funds are released timely and reach the beneficiaries for training purpose. The URL is http://icds-trg.nic.in

 

The Anganwadi Services Training Programme under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the overall administration, management and monitoring of the implementation of the Scheme are being done by the respective State Government/UT Administration. The training provided to the Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)/Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) and the Supervisors at the Anganwadi Workers Training Centres (AWTCs)/Middle Level Training Centres (MLTCs) is a part of the Anganwadi Services. AWTCs/MLTCs are run either by the respective State Governments/Union Territory Administrations or by NGOs under the supervision of respective State Governments/UT Administrations. The Government of India releases funds to the State Governments/UT Administrations for implementation of the Scheme. 

 

As per the directions of the NITI Aayog, NGOs/VOs are required to get themselves registered with the NGO-PS portal and they must have PAN & Aadhaar of members/office bearers of NGOs/VOs duly verified. The unique ID generated by NGO-PS portal on successful sign-up by them with the NGO-PS portal, is mandatory requirement when the NGOs/VOs approach the Central/State Government for grants. 

 

In September, 2017, the Ministry finalized the Comprehensive Training Guidelines for AWTCs and MLTCs and e-Learning Manual for smooth functioning and operation of training centres in various States and UTs.

The Minister of Food Processing Industries, Smt Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Ms. Anupriya Patel were also present on the occasion. These women achievers ‘FIRST LADIES’ are those who are first to set a milestone in their respective fields like the first female Merchant Navy Captain, first train driver of passenger train, first female fire fighter, first female bus driver, first Indian woman to reach Antarctica among others. 


     Welcoming the First Ladies, the Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that the First Ladies are a unique group of women who are the first in their respective fields of achievement and each one deserved to be recognized. "" Your achievement will inspire other women to break the glass ceiling and do the women of India proud"", she said. Smt Maneka Gandhi said that the WCD Ministry has been organising similar events to recognise women achievers in different ways which has yielded great results.

     The Minister of Food Processing Industries, Smt Harsimrat Kaur Badal congratulated the First Ladies and hoped that their number will grow bigger and bigger. The Minister said that women in India face a number of challenges, and achieving the distinction of being a first in any field would have been truly challenging for most women. "" You have shown and proved that it can be done and it will happen"" Smt Harsimrat Kaur said.

      The Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Ms Anupriya Patel appreciated the WCD Ministry for its unique initiative ""First Ladies"". The initiative is in the spirit of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao programme and the women achievers will act as a role model and inspiration for women across the country. ""You have started a journey which will take India forward"", the Minister exhorted.


Smt Aishwarya Rai Bachchan graced the occasion with her presence and interacted with the First Ladies. 

A coffee table book showcasing the achievements of these ladies was also released on the occasion. These first ladies busted stereotypes and broke the glass ceiling to become the Number One. Facebook and DD News have partnered with the Ministry of Women and Child Development in this unique initiative.

On March 8th, the WCD Ministry honours with Nari Shakti Puruskars, those women who have contributed to society but have remained unsung. The Nari Shakti Puraskars are conferred by the Hon'ble President of India at Rashtrapati Bhawan. Along with these Puruskars, the Ministry has started a new system of recognising in different ways, those women who have broken the glass ceiling and ventured into unusual fields.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development has developed web  portals “TrackChild” and “Khoya-Paya” to track the missing and found children. The TrackChild Portal is implemented in association with various stakeholders including Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Ministry of Railways, State Governments/UT Administrations, Child Welfare Committees, Juvenile Justice Boards, National Legal Services Authority, etc. and the “Khoya-Paya” has been integrated as a citizen corner on TrackChild portal. As per Section 2 (14) (i) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), a child  who is found without any home or settled place of abode and without any ostensible means of subsistence is included as a “child in need of care and protection.” The primary responsibility in execution of the JJ Act lies with the State Governments. However Central Government is executing a scheme namely ICPS (now “Child protection Services”), since 2009-10, for providing financial assistance to State Governments/UT Administrations, on sharing pattern, for execution of the Act and with the objective to create a safe and secure environment for overall development of children in need of care and protection, including destitute children.  These include placement in Children Homes if there is no family to look after the said child, or sponsorship support if the child is living with family (financial support for education etc) to ensure that their education can continue in an undisturbed manner.  In the CCIs, children are provided age appropriate education either within the institution or outside in a formal education system through convergence with other schemes and programs of the Government or civil society. The other programmes and activities at these CCIs inter-alia include access to vocational training, recreation, health care, counselling etc.

 

The number of  website hits reported on TrackChild portal from 1st January, 2012 to   28th December, 2017 are 13,94,43,896. The number of children tracked/rescued with the help of such tracking system/portals so far in the country, State/UT-wise is given below:

Details based on Entry time and Date Range 01-01-2012 to 28-12-2017 for the Missing, Recovered & Matched/Traced Out Children is as follows:

 



	
		
			
			Category

Apart from above this Ministry is also providing support for an outreach service for children in distress. This service is available through a dedicated toll free number, 1098 and can be accessed by children in crisis or by adults on their behalf from any place in the geographical location of India. Further Ministry is also collobarating with Ministry of Railways to rescue and rehabilitate children in difficult circumstances who come in contact with Railways by setting up child help desks at platforms. Currently, CHILDLINE service is functional in 412 locations and Child Help Desk (CHD) has been set up at 33 major Railway Stations. In addition, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) has been prepared for tracing of missing children, and has been circulated to all the States and UTs for further dissemination to all other stake holders such as Police, Child Welfare Committees (CWCs) Juvenile Justice Baoards (JJBs) etc. This SOP lays down the uniform guidelines for expediting the search and rehabilitation of a missing child all over the country.

                The Ministry of Women & Child Development will support the National Commission for Women to push the agenda of prison reforms to ameliorate the condition of women in jails across the country.  This was disclosed by the Minister of Women & Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi while briefing media persons in New Delhi today in the presence of Acting Chairperson of the National Commission for Women (NCW), Smt Rekha Sharma. The NCW will formulate a manual with details on the ideal standard operating procedures and practices/entitlements for women prisoners to be adopted by jail authorities in prisons across India, the WCD Minister explained.

Giving more details, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that the NCW will soon inspect 144 Central Jails which fall within the scope of NCW to gauge the prevailing conditions of women inmates. The procedures and practices for jail authorities will be formulated accordingly, the Minister said. Smt Maneka Gandhi said that the matter will be taken up with the Home Ministry to include the manual for women prisoners in the overall jail manual. The WCD Minister emphasized that the  Institutional reforms in prison have become a necessity now since the reports at present depict a dearth in the most basic of human facilities, leading to inhuman living conditions for women inmates. The Ministry will aid NCW in pushing these institutional reforms, across India, the Minister added.

Explaining the inspection mechanism, Smt Maneka Gandhi said that the NCW will partner with NGOs who will visit these jails and look at the condition of women including food, quantity & quality of water, facilities for children of inmates, provision of sanitary napkins, skill development and training among others. The possibility of setting up Ombudsman in prisons will also be explored where women inmates can complain in case they are not given proper facilities or treatment.

The NCW Chairperson, Smt Rekha Sharma said that the National Commission for Women has, in compliance of its mandate, been conducting inspections of Jails from time to time with a view to assess the condition of jails where women inmates are lodged. Similar inspections are also carried out by the State Women Commissions. 

Smt Rekha Sharma disclosed that in a fresh initiative, the NCW representatives will start visiting the 144 Central Jails immediately followed by the jails under the purview of State Commissions. They will prepare report on the condition of women prisoners on the basis of a proforma designed by the NCW. The team will look at various aspects including overcrowding, availability of legal help, rehabilitation plans including skill development and training, legal awareness and legal help for women inmates, proper facilities for the small children of these inmates among others. The report will be prepared State wise for each of the prisons to be tabled in the State legislature within a year. The NCW, with the support of Ministry of Women & Child Development will ensure that these institutional reforms are put in place by the authorities concerned, Smt Rekha Sharma said. The NCW has already undertaken inspection in over 60 jails in the past, she said. The matter of prison reforms for women will be highlighted with State Commissions prominently during the celebration of 25 years of NCW on 31st January, 2018, the NCW Chairperson declared.

                In a path breaking initiative to empower women, the Minister of Women & Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi inaugurated an online portal NARI in New Delhi today. Developed by the Ministry of Women & Child Development, the portal will provide women citizens with easy access to information on government schemes and initiatives for women. Further to provide a platform for NGOs and Civil Societies to interact with the Ministry of Women & Child Development, e-Samvad portal has also been developed which was inaugurated by the WCD Minister today. The Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Dr. Virendra Kumar was also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that for the first time ever since Independence, women of the country will be able to access information about benefits being provided to them by the Government. The portal contains information about schemes being run by both Central as well as the States Governments. The WCD Minister also gave an overview of the agenda of the WCD Ministry in the current year 2018. The Minister said that the new National Nutrition Mission will be launched in January, 2018 and will be operationalized in 315 districts across the country. About 50.7 lakhs women will be given Conditional Cash Transfer under maternity benefit scheme Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) this year, the Minister explained. The bill on Trafficking, which has been referred to the GOM, will be finalised and presented in the Parliament in the Budget Session. Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that the deadline mandated by the Supreme Court for registration of Child Care Institutions expired on 31.12.2017. There will be very sharp focus on linking of the Child Care Institutions to the adoption system in 2018.

Giving details about the panic button scheme for women in distress, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi said that the user trials of panic button, backed with a full real time emergency response system, will begin in Uttar Pradesh from 26th January this year. The Childline will be expanded to 500 Cities (currently in 412 cities) and Railway Childline will be expanded to 88 Railway stations (currently in 33) by March, 2018. 150 new One Stop Centres will be added in 2018 beyond 165 centres which are operating. The inter-ministerial authority on issues related to NRI marriages has already been constituted. The Law Ministry is already examining legislative amendments pertaining to this issue which will be taken up in 2018, WCD Minister explained.

The Government – both Central and State – has implemented a number of schemes & legislations for women to provide them equal rights, economic opportunities, social support, legal aid, housing etc. However, there is often a lack of awareness of these provisions and difficulties in accessing their benefits. For example, many are unaware that One Stop Centres are available in 168 districts for women in difficult circumstances, PM Awas Yojana gives priority to registraton of homes in the name of women and many State Governments offer financial support for the education of girl children. However, information related to women centric schemes/legislations are all scattered on different websites/portals.

In order to make this information more easily accessible in one place, the NARI portal summarizes over 350 government schemes and other important information for the benefit of women, with more being added everyday. It provides links to the Ministries, Departments and autonomous bodies offering these schemes as well as easy access to online applications and grievance redressal.

NARI will provide information to women on issues affecting their lives. There are tips on good nutrition, suggestions for health check ups, information on major diseases, tips for job search and interview, investment and savings advice, information on crimes and against women and reporting procedures, contacts of legal aid cells, simplified adoption procedures and much more.  It will endow women with the power of information to build their life skills and facilitates them in taking full advantage of the services provided by the Government for them.

Through e-Samvad portal, NGOs and civil society can provide their feedback, suggestions, put up grievances, share best practices etc.  Senior Officers within MWCD will be able to view the inputs/suggestions received for their concerned subject areas and appropriately respond to NGOs. This will help in formulation of effective policies and measures for welfare of women and children.

Empowerment and welfare of women and children is top priority of the government, NARI  and e-Samvad portals are  initiatives in this direction.

At this carnival, the sheer number of people who have come forward to pledge for the success of the Khelo India School Games is an endorsement of the potential for the future of sports in India. We are confident the pledge will play a vital role in encouraging and fostering the spirit of sporting culture in the country.”

                The legendary Indian tradition of ‘teacher-and-student’, referred to as the “Guru-Shishya Parampara” will be celebrated in grand style at the Opening Ceremony of the inaugural Khelo India School Games (KISG) at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on January 31. Depictions of numerous coach-athlete combinations in sports ranging from archery to wrestling and from across the country will be part of the spectacle.

A poignant part of the ceremony will train the spotlight on some wonderful and well-known combinations of coaches and athletes from the disciplines that form a part of the Khelo India School Games (KISG) programme. This will ensure that the coaches, who teach basics to their students, and help them become elite athletes are given their due recognition.

The Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports Col. Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi was very keen that society honours the coaches who work tirelessly to ensure India a place in the sporting firmament. “We have some wonderful examples of coaches playing a big role in the rise and success of Indian sportspersons and it will be great to bring the tradition back in focus,” he said. 

This rich combination of coaches and athletes who will represent the ‘Guru-Shishya Parampara’ in the Opening Ceremony is bound to inspire more such tales across the country as it bids to revamp the structure in such a way that talented young athletes are given a massive platform to perform and are then nurtured into champions of the future.

The initiative of showcasing of coaches of all levels with their eminent trainees is in keeping with Col. Rathore’s recent indication that the Government is revamping the incentives scheme to encompass all coaches who have been instrumental in an athlete’s journey from the early days through the development stage to international acclaim.

                The National Sports Programme, Khelo India, figured prominently as the float of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports returned today to the Republic Day parade on Raj Path after four years. It drew applause not only from those present along Raj Path but also from everyone on the entire route to Red Fort.

“Khelo India, Jo Khelega Woh Khilege (Play India! The one who plays sport is the one who blossoms),” the legend on a side of the float said. A collage of photographs of India’s sporting heroes including Olympic medallists celebrated their success, inspiring millions of youngsters to take to sport.

A small team of malkhamb exponents, dressed in traditional attire, braved the chill to showcase the ancient Indian sport. They used a Seesham (rosewood) pole to perform various exercises and get into a formation with the athlete on top of the pole balancing another above him. There is no doubt that the malkhamb team took everyone’s breath away.

A couple of boxers sparred in a ring with a referee watching the proceedings with an eagle eye. Women weightlifters on two sides of the boxing ring and a Games flame were also on float. At the tail-end of the float was a replica of the iconic Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium with the figure of legendary archer Arjuna on top of the revolving world.

The presence of a TV cameraman on the float, capturing images of the malkhamb team from different angles was testimony to the importance of the media in telling stories of human endeavor and valour. Sports equipment, including a pair of boxing gloves, a football, a cricketer’s helmet, a tennis racquet, were on display

The inaugural Khelo India School Games will be held from January 31 to February 8 in five venues that have staged the Asian Games 1982 and Commonwealth Games 2010. More than 3200 athletes in 16 disciplines will vie for 198 gold medals. The Khelo India School Games, to be broadcast live by the Star Sports network, would expectedly be the first step in a seamless journey to podium.

                Karnataka’s Srihari Nataraj, named the best swimmer at the National Aquatics Championships 2017 in Bhopal, will be among the cream of country’s young swimming talent which will be on view in the first Khelo India School Games at the iconic Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Swimming Pool Complex here from February 1 to 4.

Srihari, who stands close to six-feet tall, has constantly broken barriers and seeks to go faster than anyone else, aiming to represent India in the Asian Games in Jakarta this year and the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. In fact, the Jain College student from Bengaluru is the owner of all National records for backstroke over 50m (26.58 seconds), 100m (56.99) and 200m (2:04.11). 

“I know that the best talent will get picked for handsome scholarships worth Rs 5 lakh each year for eight years but I am entering five events, including the 100m and 200m freestyle, for the race experience,” Srihari, who will turn 17 on January 16, said. “I want to show that I am the best each time I take to the pool.”

Karnataka’s Saloni Dalal, who lowered her own 200m breaststroke National Record to 2:43.01, is the other prominent swimmer who will compete in the Khelo India School Games.

The Dubai-based Tanish George Mathew (Indian High School), who won three gold in the SGFI National Championships 2017, will look forward to racing Srihari Nataraj in the 50m backstroke event and National junior silver medallist Neel Roy (Maharashtra) in the 50m butterfly event. His 200m butterfly battle with Padam Padam Birthare (Maharashtra) will also be eagerly watched.

                The Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM)  Dr. Bibek Debroy has said that advance GDP growth estimate of 6.5% show that the reform measures undertaken by the Government are yielding results, because 6.5% for the full year means that Q3 and Q4 numbers will be far better than first half of the year. Q3 numbers should be higher than 6.5% and Q4 numbers will be close to 7%. The growth numbers will depend on the indirect tax collections. Several indicators have already shown signs of improvement, whether it is the PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index), the high growth in 8 core-sector industries or data on car sales. The reform measures undertaken by the Government will stimulate and pick up growth to more than 7 per cent in 2018-19.

Reacting to the estimates released today, the Chairman, EAC-PM said that the advance estimate numbers only reinforce what was already known, that several measures undertaken by the Government will place the economy firmly on an upward growth trajectory, without compromising on fiscal consolidation. He  expressed confidence that the private investments and exports would also pick up soon.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today interacted with Collectors and Officers-in-charge of aspirational districts, at a Conference organized by NITI Aayog at the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre in New Delhi.

This event is in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Transforming India by 2022. The Union Government has embarked upon a major policy initiative for the rapid transformation of 115 districts that are lagging on specific development parameters.

Six groups of officers made presentations on the themes of nutrition, education, basic infrastructure, agriculture and water resources, eradication of Left Wing Extremism and financial inclusion and skill development.

Addressing the gathering, which also included many Union Ministers and senior Union Government officers, the Prime Minister said this is the first official programme at the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre, and therefore has a special significance.

He said that relative backwardness of some regions is an injustice to the people of those regions. In that context, he added, this effort to develop 115 backward districts, is in keeping with the vision of Dr. Ambedkar, who worked for the upliftment of the under-privileged.

Giving the examples of the Jan Dhan Yojana, the construction of toilets, and rural electrification, the Prime Minister said nothing is impossible in our country if we have a firm resolve. He also gave examples of success that is being achieved in entirely new initiatives such as soil testing.

He emphasized that there is limitless potential, limitless possibilities, and limitless opportunities now in India. In this context, he mentioned the improvement in ease of doing business. He credited officials of the Government - and Team India - for this success.

The Prime Minister said that top-down solutions do not yield results. Therefore, the effort is that people on the field contribute to solutions. In this context, he appreciated the clarity of thought, and faith in conviction, in the presentations today.

The Prime Minister said that regional imbalances should not be allowed to increase indefinitely. Therefore, the development of backward districts is imperative. He said that success stories are vital to change the negative psyche and mindset in these areas. The first step is to convert this mindset of pessimism into one of optimism, he explained.

The Prime Minister said that public movements for development require a meeting of minds in the core team. In this context he suggested brainstorming at the district level. There need to be systematic arrangements to involve people, he said, giving the example of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. He emphasized the importance of building positive narratives and optimism in the achievement of development targets.

We need to recognise and channelize the aspirations of the people of the aspirational districts, the Prime Minister said. He said public participation should lead to a matching of the aspirations of people, with schemes of Governments. He said the Collectors of the 115 aspirational districts have the opportunity to earn lasting satisfaction, by delivering on development objectives. He said challenges are the path to achieving success in life, and these Collectors have the opportunity for that. He called for a concerted effort to achieve visible results in three months, till Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary on April 14th. He said he wishes to personally visit one such well-performing district in the month of April. He said these 115 districts can become the foundation for developing New India.

                The Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, Dr. Rajiv Kumar has said that the GDP growth will become more robust in 2018-19. Reacting on the growth estimates released today, he said that the Second half GDP growth in 2017-18 has risen to 7% bringing the annual growth rate to 6.5%. The Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog pointed out that economic activity has been picking up over the last three quarters and can be expected to strengthen in the coming period with the manufacturing PMI now reading at a five year high of 54%, and FMCG demand picking up briskly. Hence the GDP growth will become more robust in 2018-19.  He added that the estimates assume significance in the wake of the fact that the higher second half growth has come despite a weaning of public sector expenditures which had peaked in 2016-17 on account of the implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission.

                The Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), Dr. Bibek Debroy has said that the Economic Survey is a reflection of Government’s commitment to growth and development. Highlighting the optimistic outlook of the economy reflected by the Economic Survey, he said the emphasis on women’s empowerment is a welcome step.

         Economic Survey for 2017-18 estimates a real GDP growth rate of 6.75 per cent for the full year, based on a 7.5 per cent real growth for the second half of the year. For 2018-19 it projects a real GDP growth between 7 – 7.5 per cent. It is optimistic in its tone because of Government’s commitment to carry forward structural reforms like GST, deregulation measures, bank re-capitalization and resolution through the IBC process.

The Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) endorsed the pick-up in growth highlighted in the Survey, but was of the view that in 2018-19 the real GDP growth rate is likely to be closer to 7.5 per cent rather than 7 per cent. The Government is committed to fiscal consolidation and prudent public expenditure. It would be in order if public expenditure is also financed through off-Budget instruments. It is rightly mentioned that growth drivers will have to fundamentally emerge through exports, private investments and consumption. The Survey has already noted the likely pick-up in both exports and private investments.

The Survey has stressed that demonetization was only a blip that did not last beyond mid-2017. It is important to emphasize this aspect because a lot of general statements are made about the impact of demonetization on GDP growth. One of the objectives of demonetization and GST was an increase in the tax payer base. Correcting for trends, the Survey has figures to show that the number of tax payers has actually increased because of these policy measures, though many of these tax payers declared incomes that are close to the minimum threshold levels. There has also been lot of debate about job growth, despite the lack of credible data. The Survey has specific numbers to show that formal sector employment is much higher than what is commonly suggested. The survey lists out down-side risks and up-side gains that will influence growth in 2018-19. Amongst down-side risks, the most important one is crude oil prices. The Chairman, EAC-PM is of the view that the impact of any increase in crude prices, will be more than compensated by recovery in exports, private investments and even private consumption, unless real interest rates remain too high.

                The Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM)  Dr. Bibek Debroy has said that advance GDP growth estimate of 6.5% show that the reform measures undertaken by the Government are yielding results, because 6.5% for the full year means that Q3 and Q4 numbers will be far better than first half of the year. Q3 numbers should be higher than 6.5% and Q4 numbers will be close to 7%. The growth numbers will depend on the indirect tax collections. Several indicators have already shown signs of improvement, whether it is the PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index), the high growth in 8 core-sector industries or data on car sales. The reform measures undertaken by the Government will stimulate and pick up growth to more than 7 per cent in 2018-19.

Reacting to the estimates released today, the Chairman, EAC-PM said that the advance estimate numbers only reinforce what was already known, that several measures undertaken by the Government will place the economy firmly on an upward growth trajectory, without compromising on fiscal consolidation. He  expressed confidence that the private investments and exports would also pick up soon.

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has found Nair Coal Services Pvt. Ltd., Karam Chand Thapar & Bros (CS) Ltd. and Naresh Kumar & Co. Pvt. Ltd.  to be in contravention of the provisions of Section 3(1) read with Section 3(3)(c) and Section 3(3)(d) of the Competition Act, 2002 for acting in a collusive and concerted manner which eliminated and lessened the competition besides manipulating the bidding process in respect of the tenders floated by Maharashtra State Power Generation Co. Ltd. (MAHAGENCO) for award of contract of coal liasoning work for its various thermal power stations.           

Taking a serious view of the collusive conduct of coal liasoning agents, CCI opined that the case fell in the category of hard core cartels as the parties reached an agreement to submit collusive tenders and to divide the markets which warranted the matter to be dealt with utmost severity. Accordingly, CCI invoked the stringent provision of the law which enables it to impose a higher penalty in case of agreements entered into by cartels. Hence, a penalty at the rate of 2 times of the total profits earned from provision of coal liasoning services to all power generators for continuance of the cartel for 2010-11 to 2012-13 years was imposed upon the parties. Resultantly, CCI has imposed a penalty of Rs. 7.16 crore, Rs. 111.60 crore and Rs. 16.92 crore upon NCSL, KCT and NKC for the anti-competitive conduct. Besides, a cease and desist order was also issued against the above companies. 

CCI has also deprecated the conduct of the Informant in breaching the confidentiality and sanctity of the inquiry by circulating copies of the investigation report to B.S.N Joshi & Sons Ltd.- a rival of the Opposite Parties – who, in turn, forwarded copies thereof to various authorities.   

The Order was passed on 10.01.2018 in Case No. 61 of 2013 and a copy thereof has been uploaded on the website of CCI at www.cci.gov.in.

                On 7th August, 2017, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) received a notice filed by Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (Bayer) in relation to acquisition of the entire shareholding of Monsanto Company (Monsanto) by Bayer. Bayer, the Acquirer, is a German Stock Corporation, and is a life sciences company with competencies in the areas of health care and agriculture. The activities of Bayer are carried-out in three main Divisions viz. pharmaceuticals, consumer health, and crop sciences. Monsanto is a global provider of agricultural products for farmers, viz. seeds, biotechnology traits and herbicides.

The Commission is of the prima facie opinion that the proposed combination is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition and, accordingly, has directed Bayer, in terms of Section 29(2) of the Competition Act, 2002, to publish details of the combination for bringing the combination to the knowledge or information of the public and persons affected or likely to be affected by such combination. 

Bayer has already published the details of the proposed combination in all India Editions of four newspapers viz., The Business Line, The Financial Express, Indian Express and The Statesman on 05th January, 2018 and the same is also hosted on the respective websites of the parties. The said details are also available on the website of the Commission (www.cci.gov.in).

As per the provisions of Section 29(3) of the Act, the Commission invites comments/objections/ suggestions in writing, from any person(s) adversely affected or likely to be affected by the proposed combination.  The same may be addressed to the Secretary, Competition Commission of India, Hindustan Times House, 7th Floor, 18-20, Kasturba Gandhi Marg, New Delhi – 110001 or through email: secy@cci.gov.in, within fifteen working days from the date of publication of details of the proposed combination.

The Commission is not likely to consider unsubstantiated objections.

                The Competition Commission of India (‘Commission’) has found the Chemists and Druggists Association of Baroda (‘CDAB’) and Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists Association (‘Gujarat Federation’) to be in contravention of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 (‘Act’). One of the stockists based in Vadodara filed an information alleging that despite an earlier order of the Commission in the year 2012, CDAB, through its practices, has continued to limit and control the supply of drugs and medicines in the market by mandating ‘No Objection Certificate’ (‘NOC’/‘LOC’) prior to appointment of stockists and payment of ‘Product Information Service’ (‘PIS’) charges prior to introduction of new products in the market by pharmaceutical companies. 

Investigation carried-out by the Director General (‘DG’) revealed involvement of the State Level Association, i.e. the Gujarat Federation, besides CDAB, in the alleged conduct. After detailed enquiry, the Commission has found that CDAB and the Gujarat Federation were indulging in the anti-competitive practice of insisting NOC prior to the appointment of new stockists by pharmaceutical companies. Further, the Gujarat Federation was found to be carrying on the practice of making introduction of new products in the market subject to payment of PIS charge and its approval. These practices were held to be limiting and controlling supplies of drugs/medicines in the market, in contravention of Section 3 (3) (b) read with Section 3 (1) of the Act. Further, the Commission has held office bearers of CDAB and Gujarat Federation, namely Shri V.T. Shah (President, CDAB), Shri Jashvant Patel (President, Gujarat Federation), to be responsible under Section 48 of the Act, for their involvement in the anti-competitive practices.

Accordingly, CDAB, Gujarat Federation and their office bearers, have been directed to cease and desist from indulging in the aforesaid anti-competitive practice. Further, the Commission imposed a monetary penalty of Rs. 1,08,588/- and Rs. 11,11,549/-, calculated at the rate of 10% of the average income of CDAB and the Gujarat Federation, respectively, under the provisions of Section 27 of the Act. Penalties of Rs. 34,048/- and Rs. 62,144/-, calculated at the rate of 10% of their respective average incomes, are also imposed upon Shri V.T. Shah (President, CDAB) and Shri Jashvant Patel (President, Gujarat Federation).

This case is yet another example of how competitive markets and fair-play in the distribution of drugs/medicines are being compromised by the persisting anti-competitive behaviour of the chemist and druggist associations at the Regional as well as State level. It is indeed a serious matter that despite various orders by the Commission in similar cases and specific directions through a press notice, chemist and druggist associations have not mended their ways and have continued to indulge in such anti-competitive conduct. Considering the larger public interest involved in the distribution of drugs/medicines, the Commission deprecates such a conduct and its perpetration in any form by those responsible, be it the Associations, Stockists/Distributor/Wholesaler/Retailer and the Pharmaceutical Companies. Given the widespread and continuing indulgence in the Anti-competitive practices, the Competition Commission of India will be keeping a close watch on the conduct by all such entities in various parts of the country and would not hesitate to take action, wherever deemed necessary. 

The detailed order can be seen at the Commission’s website www.cci.gov.in.
