                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 27th convocation of the Dr Harisingh Gour Vishwavidyalaya, Sagar, Madhya Pradesh today (April 28, 2018).

Addressing the gathering, the President said the Dr Harisingh Gour Vishwavidyalaya is an important centre for higher education in Madhya Pradesh and particularly in the Bundelkhand region. Due to a large presence of SCs and STs in this region, the role of the University in building capacities in society and contributing to development becomes even more important. The President said he saw the University as a source of social and economic empowerment.

The President said education was not merely a mechanism to gain knowledge and employment. Education also makes a person self-reliant and enhances the individual’s capacities. This helps an educated person in creating opportunities for others, and to become a job provider instead of a job seeker. In this context, he was happy to note that an Entrepreneurship Cell has been set up at the Dr Harisingh Gour Vishwavidyala. It is assisting students to transform ideas into business ventures. He appreciated the University’s efforts in promoting modern techniques to increase mushroom production in nearby villages.

Later in the day, the President graced the Satguru Kabir Saheb Mahotsav in Sagar. It has been organised to commemorate the 620th Pragatosav of Satguru Kabir. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that in the times of Sant Kabir the voice of the underprivileged and of the weaker sections was not adequately heard. In such a backdrop, Sant Kabir spread the message of humanity and equality, and gave voice to the voiceless.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received the first copy of the book “Adi Shankaracharya: Hinduism’s Greatest Thinker”, from the author Shri Pavan Varma, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (April 21, 2018). Among the dignitaries present were Dr Murli Manohar Joshi and Shri D P Tripathi.  

Speaking on the occasion, the President said the imprint of Adi Shankaracharya, who was born over 1,200 years ago in Kerala, is still apparent in contemporary India and in fact in all parts of our country. He remains among the most influential personalities in our long and rich history. He was a spiritual leader, a Vedantic philosopher, a monk, a scholar and an explorer. His contributions are not just in the religious or spiritual sphere – they continue to be a guide to everyday life.

The President said that while modern technology expands our knowledge of the universe, it is our ancient wisdom that helps us to reconcile our very existence with today’s cutting-edge inventions and discoveries. That is why 21st century India is a synthesis of both the Upanishads and the Internet. Both are important for the Indian soul. 

The President said that Adi Shankacharya instinctively understood this. Way back in the 8th Century, he combined pride in India’s earliest philosophical traditions with the realities of his age. He established four peethas – in the north, south, east and west. These peethas were and are different – and at once they were and are the same. That is the beauty of India. 

A visit to these peethas, the President said, should not be seen as just a pilgrimage. It is actually a cultural exploration of the frontiers of Indian civilisation and of our diverse society.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri was a national icon and an exemplar of simple living, sacrifice and virtue. He was an embodiment of Indian values, and associated with the founding of the Vidyapeetha. Students of this institution have the responsibility of imbibing his ideals in their everyday lives and spreading these in society. The President said that the main purpose of education should be to build character and make a person sensitive and empathetic. An educated person is one who has a sense of philanthropy and commitment to public interest.

The President said the Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Sanskrit Vidyapeetha has established a healthy tradition of academics, research and publications in the past 55 years. He was happy that this Vidyapeetha has a modern science faculty and that students are studying contemporary topics like environmental sciences and human rights. He was also happy to note that there is a Centre for Computer Applications as well. He said modern technology should be used for the promotion of Sanskrit. In this context, he commended the efforts of the Vidyapeetha.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the sixth convocation of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University in Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, today (April 18, 2018). 

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President referred to recent reports of the brutalisation and killing of a girl child in the state. Perhaps the most beautiful thing in the world, the President said, was the smile on the face of an innocent child. The greatest benchmark for society to judge its success would be to keep our children safe. Protecting every child and ensuring all children feel secure is the utmost responsibility of society. In various parts of the country, our children are sometimes victims of heinous crimes.The occurrence of such barbaric incidents even 70 years after Independence is a matter of shame. We have to ask ourselves – what kind of society are we building? What are we giving our future generation? Are we building a society where women can enjoy justice, equality and independence, as provided for by ourConstitution? The President said it was a commonresponsibility for all of us,in all parts of the country, to address this issue.

 

Turning to the progress of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, the President was happy to note the success of its Technology Business Incubation Centre. The Centrecan help incubate student-led start-ups. The President said that in today's world, universities and students need to emphasise research, innovation, technology and entrepreneurship. 

 

The President also noted that girl students had got eight of 12 gold medals at the University convocation.Despite the fact that our society till places more restrictions on girls than on boys, young women are achieving a lot, and in every field. The President specifically mentioned the medal winning performances of female sportspersons from all corners of India in the recent Commonwealth Games.  

 

Later in the evening, the President attended a civic reception hosted for him by the state government at Amar Mahal in Jammu.Addressing the gathering, the President said the peopleof Jammu and Kashmir have shown courage, fortitude and resilience, even in the face of challenges. All of India takes pride in them and is confident of their ability to use economic and educational opportunities that are being created in different regions of the state. The President appreciated the government and people of the state for showing commitment to development and to the path of progress.

Venkaiah Naidu, who formally released it at a function held at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (April 14, 2018), to mark Dr B.R. Ambedkar’s birth anniversary. Speaker, Lok Sabha, Smt Sumitra Mahajan, Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thaawar Chand Gehlot, and the editor of the book, Shri Kishor Makwana, were also present.  

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Dr Ambedkar, like Dr Martin Luther King Jr, is an inspiring figure for all humanity. There is need to do justice to his legacy. The President was happy to note that Dr Ambedkar’s 125th birth anniversary was commemorated at the United Nations in 2016.

The President said the book that he had been presented was a slim volume but covered the inspiring life of Dr Ambedkar and several dimensions of his ideas and personality.

He congratulated all those associated with its publication. He expressed hope that thoughts compiled in the book would reach more and more citizens and motivate them to work together in peace and harmony.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed a function in Mhow (Madhya Pradesh) today (April 14, 2018) on the 127th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Dr BR Ambedkar. Earlier he paid tributes to Dr Ambedkar at his memorial in Mhow. In doing so President Kovind became the first President of India to pay homage to Dr Ambedkar at his birthplace (Mhow) on his birth anniversary.

Addressing the gathering, the President said that the greatest contribution of the Constitution of India, created under the guidance of Dr Ambedkar, was to make all Indians equal citizens, irrespective of social or economic background. This Fundamental Right ensured that every Indian has the right to a dignified life. In parallel, the Constitution introduced universal franchise and gave every citizen, irrespective of social background or economic status, the right to vote.

These two rights, President Kovind said, have special significance for the poor, the traditionally disadvantaged and the weaker sections of our society. These rights, along with the importance of education that Dr Ambedkar underlined, are crucial for the proper exercise of all other rights granted to citizens by our Constitution. Our country is run on democratic traditions – elections are held, governments are formed, and the future of citizens is worked towards. There is need for people to be aware of challenges and opportunities – and to exercise their democratic rights wisely.

The President said that in his move towards building a better and fairer society, Dr Ambedkar emphasised the values of nonviolence and of compassion in public life. He fought for welfare of weaker sections of society but his path remained nonviolent – stressing consensus through dialogue. He believed that this was our country, for all of us, and that whatever needed to be done to bring justice to the weaker sections of society could be achieved by adhering to social harmony. In his final speech in the Constituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar said now that we have constitutional methods of expressing opposition, we should avoid disruptive mechanisms.

The President said our Constitution is our sacred text. It empowers those from traditionally weaker and disadvantaged sections to aspire to and reach the highest positions in the country. It is a tribute to Dr Ambedkar’s efforts that today people from such sections are making important contributions to building a modern and better India.

The President said Dr Ambedkar often stressed that being an Indian was his primary, secondary and ultimate identity. Today, there is need for every citizen to internalise this sentiment. Equality and fraternity create harmony. As such, all citizens, especially young people, should follow the path of fraternity that Dr Ambedkar showed us.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has greeted fellow-citizens on the eve of birth anniversary of Dr B.R. Ambedkar. 

 

In a message, the President has said, “On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr B.R. Ambedkar, I pay my homage to this icon of our national life, and extend my warm greetings to all fellow citizens. Dr Ambedkar was a multifaceted personality whose impact on our society and nation has remained relevant – and will remain relevant. He was an academic and economist, a scholar and moral philosopher, an exceptional legal mind and constitutionalist. Above all, he was an activist for social reform and for legitimate opportunities for women, and a champion of liberty.

 

Dr Ambedkar waged a life-long struggle for a better and fairer society – for a modern India free of caste and other prejudices, ensuring equal economic and social rights to women and to those from traditionally disadvantaged communities. His ideals and his belief in the rule of law found most eloquent expression in the Constituent Assembly. Appropriately, he is considered the Chief Architect of our Constitution – which continues to be the guiding light for the Republic of India.

 

Despite the personal challenges he faced, Dr Ambedkar was remarkably free of rancour and resentment. For this, and for his many social, political and professional contributions, he continues to be a beacon for us. And he shines as a universal symbol of human freedom and individual dignity. It is important to appreciate Dr Ambedkar’s personality and message in all its dimensions, and not to compartmentalise, as we often do.

 

Let us draw inspiration from this great figure of history and this great Indian. The best tribute to him would be to build a just, egalitarian and developed India – an India that lives up to the republican ethic that Dr Ambedkar shaped and defined for us and for future generations.”

	It is a privilege for me to meet members of the Indian community in Livingstone. Thank you for welcoming me with such affection. I am delighted to meet a vibrant Indian community in this old and historic city and this very important tourist centre – so close to the Victoria Falls, which I will soon be visiting.



	This is my third journey abroad after becoming President of India. I have made it a point to schedule all my visits so far to Africa. This is a reflection of how closely we in India view the continent. Africa is home to some of our closest friends as well as to very well-integrated Indian communities. And the Indian community in Zambia stands out. With your contributions you are a model for the Indian diaspora. You are true cultural ambassadors of India. 



	The Indian community in Zambia can be traced back to even before this country’s independence in 1964. Trade and commerce, mining and hospitality, healthcare and academics – you are doing your bit for Zambia in so many fields. You come from various parts of our country. But here in Zambia, despite the diversity, you are all united as representatives of Indian society and of our civilisation. 



	Your contributions have helped generate goodwill for your community as well as for India as a nation. You are our champions in a faraway land, even in Livingstone, which I understand is as much as 7,500 km away from Delhi. We in India have long believed in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. Today, I am truly happy to meet our Livingstone kutumb! You have made great efforts to embellish India’s reputation as well as keep alive our cultural traditions so far from home. This is heart-warming. I congratulate all of you.  



	The greatest Indian to have lived in Africa was, of course, Mahatma Gandhi. For both India and Zambia, he is an inspiration. On this visit, I have been received very warmly by President Lungu and the government and people of Zambia. Yesterday I was fortunate to meet Dr Kenneth Kaunda, a statesman who has the same stature in Zambia that Mahatma Gandhi has in India. He is an old friend of our country and of your community.



	It is because of such mature leaders in Zambia and because of the efforts of every section of society – including all of you – that Zambia is an example for the rest of Africa as a democratic developing country. Our people share the values of liberty and freedom, of human dignity and socio-economic development. As members of the Indian community here, you are custodians of that value system. You are a living bridge between India and Zambia. Please help make this partnership even more meaningful.


Ladies and Gentlemen


	Our government seeks sustained and proactive engagement with our overseas community. The dialogue with the diaspora is aimed at providing possibilities and platforms through which you can learn about as well as participate in India’s transformation. And link this transformation with the developmental priorities of Zambia. I urge you to partner us in this process.



	Today India is on the road of fast economic growth. There is confidence and optimism among our youth. India’s rise is creating newer opportunities for collaboration with the external world. Our government is keen to strengthen ties with our people abroad. You must take advantage of available schemes, particularly of the OCI programme. It will connect you with India forever. 



	Last but not the least, time and online booking slots permitting, I invite you to visit Rashtrapati Bhavan the next time you are in Delhi. It is not just where I live and work. It is every Indian’s address – including every Indian in Livingstone! 


Thank you 

Jai Hind!

                1.    Your Excellency, Mr. President allow me start by mentioning how happy we are, to be in this beautiful, warm and friendly country. My wife and I, and indeed my entire delegation, greatly appreciate the gracious hospitality you have extended to us. I am honored to be visiting Zambia.

2.    Excellency, India and Zambia share a very special relationship. Ours has been a partnership built on the legacy of our founding fathers: Mahatma Gandhi and President Kenneth Kaunda. Years gone by are witness to our commitment and steadfast support for justice, freedom and solidarity for those who needed them most. 

3.    Excellency, the soil and sinews of this country and this continent have always espoused the larger cause: you have been the font of liberation movements in Africa; and it was on your sacred African soil that Mahatma Gandhi first shook the shackles of injustice. We could not have shared a more glorious past !!

4.    Excellency, I am delighted that we have continued with our friendship with same vigor and passion in the present. I must say that to be called “an all weather and time-tested friend” is both an honour and privilege for us. 

5.    There is much in common in between our two countries, and not just in being home to the wonders of the world - the awesome Victoria Falls in Zambia and the magnificent Taj Mahal in India. We have a shared commitment to democratic governance, the rule of law, respect for human rights and inclusive development. Our economic cooperation is doing well but we both desire to do more. Indian companies have been much encouraged by your leadership and economic policies. They are keen to create new ventures and projects, in partnership with your people and your communities. The Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement that we have signed will give a boost to our economic engagement. There is a lot that “Smart Zambia” and “Digital India” can share with each other. Similarly, Indian growth story and Zambian economic strengths should support and build each other.  

6.    We are proud of our development partnership with Zambia. This is in keeping with our age-old guiding principle of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbam”- that is - “the world is our family”.  Our assistance in health and energy sectors is adding value to people’s lives in this country. We are keen to step up our capacity building and training support. To this end, we have offered to establish an Entrepreneurship Development Centre in Zambia. I hope that it would foster new ideas, enterprises and start-ups in the country.  

7.     Excellency, we thank you for joining the International Solar Alliance. Solar energy can do wonders for the land of safaris, and we are ready to assist you, both with technology and finance.  

8.    Excellency, our two countries are strong partners on defence and security. As with our political relations, we share the comfort of history in our defence ties; our men have fought together in various theatres of war. Let us build on this strong foundation. We should also come together to defeat and destroy terrorism in all its manifestations. 

9.    Excellency, as two countries with multitude of languages and peoples, we both understand the value of diversity. Our Diaspora, many of whom are proud Zambians today, have added their beauty and colour to your social fabric. They have not only contributed to your economic progress but also helped build bridges of friendship between the two countries.

10.    Excellency, we have great admiration for your political legacy. It fills us with joy and pride that Zambia continues to play a leading role in the region. The peace and stability you have maintained and enjoyed is a shining example for many to follow.

11.    With these words, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, May I   request you to join me in raising a toast:
-To the health and happiness of the President of Zambia and First Lady;  
-To the continued well-being and prosperity of the friendly people of Zambia; and
- To the enduring friendship between Zambia and India.
 May the fragrance of Bougainvillea and Lotus together radiate in all directions. Thank you.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, and the President of Zambia, Mr Edgar Chagwa Lungu, ceremonially commenced work on the 93-km Lusaka Traffic Decongestion Project today (April 12, 2018) – the final day of President Kovind’s state visit to three African nations, Equatorial Guinea, Swaziland and Zambia. The Lusaka Traffic Decongestion Project has received substantial financial support from the government of India and is being executed by an Indian company, AFCONS Infrastructure. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that development partnership and economic cooperation are key pillars of India-Zambia relations. He was happy to note that the two countries are collaborating on projects that will benefit the citizens of Zambia. He said that India appreciates the people-centric approach of the Zambian government in its programmes and policies. 

The President said that traffic congestion is a modern day challenge in urban centres across the world. The economic costs of traffic gridlocks, and the additional burden of traffic congestion on the health and well-being of commuters, are well-documented. He expressed hope that the Lusaka project would lead to further cooperation between Zambia and India on socially relevant initiatives. 

Later in the day, the President travelled to Livingstone and addressed the Indian community there. He said that the government of India seeks sustained and proactive engagement with the overseas Indian community. Dialogue with the diaspora is aimed at providing possibilities and platforms through which it can learn about as well as participate in India’s transformation. And link this transformation with the developmental priorities of Zambia. 

Following a short visit to the Victoria Falls, President Kovind will return to Lusaka and board the flight to Delhi. He is expected to land in India early in the morning tomorrow (April 13, 2018).  

Yesterday (April 11, 2018) evening, the President attended a banquet hosted in his honour by the President of Zambia in Lusaka. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India and Zambia have a shared commitment to democratic governance, rule of law, human rights and inclusive development. Our economic cooperation is on track but we both desire to do more. 

Indian companies, President Kovind said, have been encouraged by the economic policies of the government of Zambia. They are keen to create new ventures in partnership with the Zambian people and local communities. The Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement that we have signed will give a boost to our economic engagement. There is a lot that “Smart Zambia” and “Digital India” can share; the Indian growth story and Zambian economic strengths should support and build on each other.  

Before the banquet, President Kovind called on Mr Kenneth Kaunda, the founding President of Zambia, at his residence. In an emotional meeting with the 93-year-old Mr Kaunda, the President appreciated his statesmanship, struggle for human liberty and friendship for India and the Indian people. The two leaders discussed Mahatma Gandhi and how he was an inspiration for India and Zambia, and for other countries in Africa.

                The President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, addressed members of the Parliament of Swaziland today (April 10, 2018). He became the first visiting Head of State to address the Parliament of the country.

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that we are living in a digital and hyper-connected world that places immense challenges before parliamentarians. Local and day-to-day issues, related to jobs and the economy, are influenced by developments elsewhere, be it global food prices, climate change or security threats of various nature. The impact of globalisation and technology, and soaring aspirations of people, have added new dimensions to public policy. To legislate in such times demands even greater awareness and acumen. But with challenges come opportunities. Today, we see greater participation of people in debates and discussions. Legislators can get instant feedback on major issues. 

 

The President said that over seven decades India has developed a robust institutional architecture of parliamentary democracy. We would be happy to share this experience with this august House in Swaziland. The President offered concessional finance on the part of India for construction of a new parliament building in Swaziland.

 

The President said that Indian growth is fuelled by frugal and cost-effective innovation. Our technologies and institutional models can help reduce costs of production in Swaziland. We are keen to share our expertise and experience with Swaziland and indeed with all of the African continent. On this count, our approach has been to create local capacities, to move hand in hand, in solidarity and in partnership with our African brothers and sisters.

 

The President said that despite advances in new technologies, agriculture still remains the mainstay for a majority of both our populations. He was happy to note that India has already shared some of its experiences with Swazi farmers. This has helped them to achieve a multi-fold increase in maize productivity. He announced that India would facilitate establishing a Centre of Agricultural Excellence in Swaziland. He also said that India would develop an irrigation system in the Lubuyane region. 

 

The President observed that climate change is one of the most critical challenges for our world. He noted that Swaziland has itself struggled with the El Nino phenomenon, leading to drought for two years. To support the Swaziland National Disaster Management Agency, India has offered US$ 1 million as well as foodgrains.

 

In another event, the President inaugurated the Royal Science and Technology Park this morning.  The Park has been developed and built with the assistance of India. He also received a presentation on the Technology Park as a location for IT education and capacity building as well as for IT-enabled services.

 

The President had landed in Swaziland yesterday (April 9, 2018) at the King Mswati III International Airport, where he was received by the Prime Minister of Swaziland and other dignitaries. He proceeded directly to talks with the King of Swaziland on bilateral and global issues. The King also conferred the Order of the Lion on the President. This is the highest civilian honour Swaziland bestows on a non-citizen. 

 

Speaking after the ceremony, the President renewed India’s commitment to Swaziland and announced that an Indian embassy would be opening in the kingdom shortly. In the presence of the President and the King, India and Swaziland signed two agreements — on health cooperation; and on visa waivers for those travelling on official and diplomatic passports. Later in the evening of April 9, the King hosted a banquet for the President.

 

Following the conclusion of his visit to Swaziland, the President today (April 10, 2018) will leave for Zambia. This will be the final leg of his journey to three African nations – Equatorial Guinea, Swaziland and Zambia. In the evening, he will meet and address the Indian community in Lusaka.

                Good morning

Buenos dias


	I am extremely privileged to have the opportunity to address this House. This is myfirst visit to Equatorial Guinea. All three of my state visits since taking over as President of India in July 2017 have been to Africa. This is acknowledgement of India’s close and abiding relationship with your continent. And as it happens, Equatorial Guinea is the furthest west that I have travelled from India since becoming President of my country. 


 


	Not far from here, in the Gulf of Guinea, is the point where zero degree latitude meets zero degree longitude, where the Equator and the Prime Meridian intersect. In a sense this is the centre of the world. And this is where nature has located you – close to the geographical pivot of our world, of our sense of space and time, and our notion of direction and navigation. These are the very qualities we look to in Equatorial Guinea as it rises as a force for stability in this region. Both the location and, much more than that, the warm welcome I have received have made this visit truly special. Thank you.


 


	I am especially happy to be here in the year in which you celebrate the 50th anniversary of your independence from colonialism. We in India can appreciate your sentiments. Only a few months ago, in August 2017, India celebrated the 70thanniversary of its Independence from imperial rule. It was an unforgettable and emotional moment for us. And an occasion to look back at the challenges and struggles that previous generations faced to bring us freedom. 


 


	I am sure such memories and such experiences are still fresh in the minds of all of you, and of the people of Equatorial Guinea. And I am sure they inspire you to strive harder to secure and build on that hard-won freedom, to fulfil the dreams of all your citizens. Towards that endeavour, I come with the greetings, friendship and commitment of the 1.3 billion people of India. The waters of the oceans have united our civilisations. Diplomacy is catching up. I am happy to announce that very soon India will be opening its embassy in Equatorial Guinea, in fact in this city.


 

Honourable Members


	Our histories are similar; our recent exchanges too have been purposeful. I was honoured to host His Excellency, the President of Equatorial Guinea during his visit to India in March 2018 for the inaugural summit of the International Solar Alliance. We were seated next to each other at the banquet and had a very meaningful conversation. Your President’s dedication to thecause of clean energyis impressive and infectious. Sustainable development is only possible through judicious use of our planet’s finite resources. This requires combating climate change for not only ourselves but for future generations. Due to its oceanic location, Equatorial Guinea understands this better than many others.  


 


	I am particularly heartened that Equatorial Guinea has shown such commitment to renewable energy and to addressing climate change. This is despite your country being a significant producerand exporter of crude oil. You have placed a long-term global vision above short-term gains. This is evidence that Equatorial Guinea has the enlightenment and the strategic generosity of a leader nation – a leader nation for Africa and beyond.


 


	In this context, I congratulate your country for having been elected to the United Nations Security Council for a two-year term that began in January this year. We wish to work with you to make the UN more effective, more equitable, and more reflective of today’s realities. We are confident that you will play an active role in highlighting issues related to Africa and to developing countries in general – as well as challenges that are of a global nature.


 


	The menace of terrorism – and its ancillaries such as drug-trafficking and money laundering – are a sad reality of our times. Terrorism is a global challenge, but it is being dealt with piecemeal. A comprehensive global strategy needs to be established. In this regard, we in India seek your support for early adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism at the UN. 


 

Honourable Members


	Equatorial Guinea and India have shared attributes and challenges. You represent one of Africa’s strongest economies. India is the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The aspiration for both of us is to take the urgent and necessary steps to become developed countries, to bring the benefits of our economic growth to all sections of our societies, and to create an environment for young people to realise their potential. In this India is ready to support Equatorial Guinea as per your developmental priorities, and as per a process shaped and led by you.


 


	We have strong bilateral trade in energy. Equatorial Guinea is an important and trusted source of natural gas for India. On its part, India has robust and established capacities in refining of crude oil and manufacture of petroleum products. We would like to share this knowledge and this learning with you, as you develop and build refineries in your country. It is crucial that Equatorial Guinea and local communities here gain from the value addition to natural resources that are found in your country.


 


	As you seek to diversify your economy, you will find India a credible partner. We can work together to build capacities in agriculture and mining, in fisheries and public health, in food processing and telecom and IT. Geologists from India can assist your technical specialists in surveying and mapping natural resources. Our agricultural technologists can help analyse the composition of soil on a particular farm or in a particular region. Such knowledge can enable farmers to identify the right nutrients for the soil – and improve productivity. This will give farming families and communities higherincomes.


 


	Equatorial Guinea has been blessed with fertile land and natural resources. But your greatest assets are your people. Enhancing and sustaining the prosperity and well-being of your beautiful country requires enhancing the capacities of ordinary citizens, especially young people. Thousands of African students study in Indian universities. They come as students but they graduate as friends and ambassadors of India in their home countries. We would like more and more students from Equatorial Guinea to access our institutions of higher learning.


 


	India is also happy to cooperate in vocational training, skill development and incubation of entrepreneurship, especially in small and medium enterprises. As we have found in India, the SME sector can be a big job creator and an effective mechanism to distribute prosperity. In other areas too, such as building English-language centres, there is much that India can unhesitatingly contribute.


 

Honourable Members


	The Equatorial Guinea-India partnership is for both our countries, but it is also a partnership for the world. As sea-faring societies, we are equally conscious of the safety and security of our oceans – and of the continued need for a transparent and rules-based order of maritime governance. The Atlantic and Indian Oceans are sisters. Their oceanic systems are interlinked – and so are their security challenges and, often, the threats of humanitarian disasters. 


 


	These challenges have to be met with concerted efforts. Our countries must collaborate more on maritime security. We must work together to ensure that the seas spread harmony, create friendships and promote trade and commerce. In defence as much as in disaster planning and preparedness, India would be glad to cooperate still more with Equatorial Guinea, and offer its technical and other capacities. These are our oceans and our challenges. Let us address them ourselves – and not cede that space, as we once did, to others.


 


	Our world is sometimes likened to a village. We are all stakeholders. There are global commons that we must care for and there are global concerns that we must take care of. As colonialism has receded on the ground, we need to work together to ensure that some variant does not return in other dimensions – whether outer space or cyberspace. As a member of the Security Council, Equatorial Guinea has a responsibility here.


 


	India stands with you as you work towards fulfilling that responsibility – and as you march towards your national developmental goals. On behalf of the people and government of India, as well as in my personal capacity, I once again assure the people and government of Equatorial Guinea of our enduring partnership.


 

Thank you all.

Muchasgracias

Later, the President met and addressed the Indian community in Malabo at a community reception hosted by Shri Sushil Kumar Singhal, Ambassador of India to Equatorial Guinea.

 

Addressing the gathering, the President said that every member of the Indian community was critical to strengthening relations between India and Equatorial Guinea. There is only one diplomatic ambassador appointed by the Government of India, but all members of the Indian community in this country are cultural ambassadors of India. He urged the community to help enhance business and cultural links between the two countries.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, reached Equatorial Guinea yesterday evening (April 7, 2018) on the first leg of his State Visit to three African nations –Equatorial Guinea, Swaziland and Zambia. This is the first ever visit of a Head of State from India to Equatorial Guinea. The President was received at the Malabo airport by Mr Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the President of Equatorial Guinea, along with his cabinet colleagues and other dignitaries.

The President formally commenced his engagements today (April 8, 2018) when he met his counterpart, President Obiang, at the Presidential Palace in Malabo. President Kovind was conferred with the Condecoracion, the highest honour accorded to a non-citizen by the government of Equatorial Guinea, and previously given to select Heads of State from friendly countries.

During the subsequent discussions, the President thanked President Obiang for his warmth and hospitality. He said President Obiang has played a key role in African affairs to promote stability in the continent, and India very much appreciates this. The President said that, under the leadership of President Obiang, Equatorial Guinea has seen rapid growth and progress. He congratulated President Obiang on Equatorial Guinea achieving the highest per capita GDP for any country in the African continent. He stated that India is ready to partner Equatorial Guinea which is diversifying its economy and reducing its dependence on oil and gas exports.

Subsequently, the President led delegation-level talks between the two sides. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the two countries have enjoyed warm and cordial relations. India attaches the highest importance to its relationship with Equatorial Guinea. It is in that spirit that the government of India has decided to open an embassy in Equatorial Guinea. This will give a major boost to our relations.

 

The President said that the economies of our two countries are complementary. Equatorial Guinea is endowed with hydrocarbons and mineral resources, and India with human and financial capital and low-cost technical expertise. The full potential of our bilateral engagement is far from realised. India looks forward to partnering with Equatorial Guinea in facilitating government-to-government development cooperation as well as business-to-business contacts.

 

The President said that during the India-Africa Forum Summit of 2015, India had announced concessional lines of credit of US$ 10 billion over five years for African countries. He urged the government of Equatorial Guinea to avail of this facility. He said that India would be happy to assist in developing project proposals in various sectors of Equatorial Guinea’s economy.

The President also attended a luncheon banquet hosted in his honour by President Obiang. In his remarks at banquet, President Kovind said India and Equatorial Guinea have both emerged from the shadows of a colonial past and are committed to peace, prosperity and the well-being of our people. Today, India and Equatorial Guinea are engaged in the task of ensuring accelerated growth and distributing its benefits to all sections of our societies. In this regard, Equatorial Guinea’s National Horizon 2020 programme has a vital role to play.

The President said that India is keen to enhance its development cooperation partnership with Equatorial Guinea. It is in that spirit India has offered assistance to set up an Entrepreneurial Development Centre and an English Language Laboratory in Equatorial Guinea. It will also do its best to support Equatorial Guinea in agriculture, mining, health, telecommunications and Information Technology.

Later in the day, the President will address members of the Parliament of Equatorial Guinea. This evening he will also meet and address the Indian community in Malabo.

The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 34th annual session of FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO) today (April 5, 2018) in New Delhi. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that women constitute half our country. They contribute to our economy at work and at home, in many diverse ways. Yet, when it comes to business and commerce, it is regrettable that women have not been given their due. We need to create conditions for more and more of our daughters and sisters to come into the workforce. We need to push harder to ensure appropriate, encouraging and safe conditions at home, in society and at the work-place to enhance the percentage of working women.

 

The President said that if more women become part of the workforce, both household incomes and our GDP will rise. We will become a more prosperous nation. Much greater than that, we will become a more equal society.

 

The President said that we need to take the magic of entrepreneurship to – and facilitate the start-ups of – our sisters and daughters at the bottom of the pyramid. The government has a role here, but so do civil society and business – and organisations such as FLO.

 

The President said that the government has taken decisive steps to promote a culture of enterprise among ordinary citizens, especially women. The Stand-Up India initiative was launched in April 2016 to encourage entrepreneurship among women, SCs and STs. About 45,000 loans have been disbursed, mainly to sole proprietors. Almost 39,000 of these have gone to women – an overwhelming proportion. Under the MUDRA scheme, over the past three financial years, about 117 million loans have been sanctioned. Close to 88 million of these loans have gone to women entrepreneurs and he was happy to note that, as of December 2017, the number of NPAs in the MUDRA scheme is less than eight per cent of the loans sanctioned.

 

The President said that genuine business failures can happen. But when there is a wilful and criminal default on a bank loan, then it is families of our fellows Indians that suffer. The innocent citizen loses out, and ultimately the honest tax-payer bears the burden. It is admirable that at the grassroots of our country – in small hamlets and among traditionally underprivileged and deprived communities – MUDRA entrepreneurs are striving to pay back their loans.

 

The President urged the members of FLO to see how they can make these businesses – largely run by women – integral to their value chains. How can they partner these humble start-ups – as vendors, ancillaries, suppliers, distributors or in any other form. He stated that our corporate sector must take determined steps towards creating women-friendly and gender-sensitive supply chains – to empower women in our economy, rather than just accommodate them.

 

The President said that this is a moment of enormous opportunities for India. If our institutions and our society can be true to both the letter of the law and the spirit of justice, we can help every Indian realise her potential. And we can construct a developed India. There may be disagreement, but there must be respect for the other person’s dignity. Dignity and civility; order and rule of law; fairness and justice; entrepreneurship and aspirations – we have to achieve all of these. We cannot pick and choose.

 

Each of us has a role here, the President said. Each member of FLO as an individual and FLO as an institution can make a big difference – to Indian business and to Indian society.

 

Text of speech of the President on the occasion is attached.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, planted a Baobab sapling in the gardens of Rashtrapati Bhavan today (April 3, 2018). This sapling was gifted by the University of Madagascar as a gesture of goodwill in return for the Neem tree that the President planted at the University campus in Antananarivo during his State visit to Madagascar in March. 

 

The Baobab tree has a life span of over 2000 years. It is high in medicinal and nutritional properties, quite like the Neem tree. The exchange of these plants spotlights the value both India and Madagascar attach to traditional knowledge and medicine in their respective cultures.

                Separate groups of officer trainees of the Central Engineering Service (Roads) and Central Public Works Department together called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (April 2, 2018) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 

Addressing the officer trainees, the President said that their services provide them an enormous platform for serving the nation. All of them would be literally engineering the country’s growth and development. This should be the primary reason for celebrating their success in the Engineering Services Examination.

 

The President said that as future leaders of our infrastructure projects, the officer trainees should practice engineering with a social conscience. For instance, they must ensure that the public infrastructure they build – be it offices, residences or roads – is accessible to our differently abled fellow citizens. While formal codes in this regard may exist, projects on the ground need to do more to ensure ease of access. This aspect should not be treated as an add-on to an infrastructure project but should become integral to planning and implementation. 

 

The President said that as young engineers, they are all aware of the ills of climate change and the benefits of energy efficiency. All of them must ensure that buildings, roads and other infrastructure they create are energy efficient and environment friendly. He was happy to note that CPWD has taken initial steps towards construction of Net Zero Energy green buildings. It should strive to ensure that green buildings become the norm. He was confident that the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways too shall continue to accord increasing importance to environmental aspects while undertaking projects. 

 

The President said that the officer trainees have joined institutions that provide them a unique opportunity to serve the nation and touch the lives of millions of fellow citizens each day. If they ever doubt what they can do for the nation and society, they should simply think of stalwart technocrats like Shri M. Visvesvaraya and Shri E. Sreedharan. Like them, the officer trainees should nurture a spirit of innovation and emerge as solution providers in the midst of challenges.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received a copy of a special issue of the ‘Think India’ journal, devoted to the late philosopher-politician Deendayal Upadhyay, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (April 2, 2018). The copy was given to the President by Dr Murli Manohar Joshi, MP, in the presence of Shri D P Tripathi, MP, and editor of the special issue. Among others Dr Shashi Tharoor, MP, and Shri Pawan Verma, former MP, were also present.  

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Deendayal Upadhyay remains an important national figure who enriched Indian politics and public thought with his writings and ideas. There is need for a broader consciousness as well as a need to rise above party politics to evaluate him and his work. The President said he considers the special issue of the journal an attempt in this direction. The compilation of articles of writers belonging to different generations, political parties and persuasions is commendable. The President appreciated Shri D. P. Tripathi for putting together this special issue.

 

The President said that Deendayal Upadhyay advocated cooperation in the interests of the nation, and sought to place the developmental process above narrow partisanship. Mahatma Gandhi, Dr B.R. Ambedkar, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia and the late Deendayal Upadhyay carried forward Indian thought and kept it relevant to grassroots development. Along with formulating ideas, these eminent personalities worked on the ground and had practical achievements. In the same vein, Jawaharlal Nehru’s book ‘Discovery of India’ was also an important attempt to understand India's philosophical and cultural traditions. 

 

Despite conceptual distinctions, the President said, a certain unity and ethos is the hallmark of India. In this compilation, efforts have been made to understand Deendayal Upadhyay’s contributions through this prism.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkakaih Naidu has said that our country has celebrated plurality, diversity and inclusivity and we must collectively strengthen this unique perspective. He was addressing the Civic Reception meeting being organised in honour of His Grace Dr. Philipose Mar Chrysostom & inaugurate the diamond jubilee celebrations of Holy Ordination of the Most Rev. Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan, in Thiruvalla, Pathanamthitta district of Kerala today. The Deputy Chairperson of Rajya Sabha, Dr. P.J. Kurien, the Minister for Water Resources, Kerala, Shri Mathew T. Thomas and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that Kerala state has traditionally welcomed all religions and is the land of Adi Shankara, the greatest exponent of Advaita philosophy, the land of Cheraman Juma Masjid, the very first mosque in India, the land of Thomas the Apostle who walked this land in the sixth century AD and the land where the Hindu rulers like Sthanu Ravi Varma of Venad gifted a plot of land in the 9th century AD to build a church. He further said that it is the land where Judaism, Jainism and Buddhism co-existed over so many centuries.  No wonder it is now called “God’s own country” where divinity has been worshipped in multiple forms by different sects exemplifying the ancient Indian vision of welcoming noble ideas and ideals from across the globe, he added.

The Vice President said that it gives him immense joy to be with the people of Kerala on this very happy occasion celebrating two important landmarks in the lives of two illustrious sons of our great country - Padmabhushan Dr. Philipose Mar Chrysostom Valiya Metropolitan and His Grace The Most Rev. Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan. He also congratulated the Metropolitan Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma who is celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of his holy Ordination. The people have benefited from his visionary leadership and enduring passion for the health and well being of suffering humanity, he added. 

The Vice President said that it is time to re-discover the treasure within. Churches, Temples, Mosques, Gurudwaras and other religious shrines are places of devotion, pious places of spiritual regeneration and catalysts of intergenerational transmission of cultural values. He further said that they are potentially the sites of social and community education and they serve to bring people together. However, if they stray from this path and dabble in politics and issue unwarranted divisive statements, they become dysfunctional, he added.

The Vice President hoped that these two strands of religion and politics are not mixed up and the religious leaders give spiritual guidance to every human being and the political leaders take inspiration from our noble heritage to provide a clean polity.  Today is an occasion for that process of recognizing goodness, recognising the spirit of creating a heaven on earth through pious thoughts and righteous action, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It gives me great joy to visit Kerala, the ever green state of the Republic of India, what we fondly call the ‘God’s own country’, a state of which we are proud because of the enduring and enterprising spirit. 

It is a unique state in India which has a literacy rate of 94%, the highest in the country, the highest human development index among all the states and the highest life expectancy and the highest sex ratio.  

It is a state which has traditionally welcomed all religions over the last twenty centuries and is the land of Adi Shankara, the greatest exponent of Advaita philosophy, the land of Cheraman Juma Masjid at Kodungallur, the very first mosque in India. It is the land of Thomas the Apostle who walked this land in the sixth century AD. It is the land where the Hindu rulers like Sthanu Ravi Varma of Venad gifted a plot of land in the 9th century AD to build a church.  It is the land where Judaism, Jainism and Buddhism co-existed over so many centuries.  No wonder it is now called “God’s own country” where divinity has been worshipped in multiple forms by different sects exemplifying the ancient Indian vision of welcoming noble ideas and ideals from across the globe.  

It is a matter of great pride that we have this illustrious cultural heritage in our country.  Ours is a country that has celebrated plurality, diversity and inclusivity. We must collectively strengthen this unique perspective. 

Today, we are celebrating the 101st birthday of His Grace Most Rev. Dr. Philipose Mar Chrysostom Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan and 60th anniversary of priestly ordination of His Grace Most Rev. Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan.

I am aware that the Mar Thoma Church is an ancient Church founded by Saint Thomas, one of the Apostles of Jesus Christ. It is also a national church with deep roots in the history of Independent India. The Church always stood for freedom and justice. Late Shri T.M. Varghese was among the trio who fought against the British in restoring Travancore State along with late Shri C. Kesavan and late Shri Pattom A. Thanu Pillai. I am also aware that when Emergency was declared, it was the Head of the Church, who wrote to the then Prime Minister protesting against Emergency and seeking its withdrawal. Thus, the Church always stood for freedom and liberty.

I am also happy that this ancient church has gifted to our nation several leaders of eminence and great stature, like Dr. M. M. Thomas former Governor of Nagaland, Justice K. T. Thomas Former Supreme Court Judge, freedom fighter late Shri T M Verghese and my colleague Prof. P. J. Kurien, the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha. 

It gives me immense joy to be with the people of Kerala on this very happy occasion celebrating two important landmarks in the lives of two illustrious sons of our great country - Padmabhushan Dr Philipose Mar Chrysostom Valiya Metropolitan and His Grace The Most Rev. Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan.  

I congratulate Rev. Dr. Philipose Mar Chrysostom who has completed 100 years of active service to God and God’s devotees. I applaud his achievements and appreciate his contributions for the well being of the people of our nation.

I am reminded of the prayer in Atharva Veda which says – “Let us live for a hundred years and beyond, with good health, intelligence and everwidening thoughts”. His Grace Philipose Mar Chrystostam Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan is truly blessed that he has been given this vast and unique opportunity to serve humanity for so many decades.  We are blessed to be in his presence today. 

Many of you are well aware that Rev. Dr. Philipose Mar Chrystostam Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan has endeared himself to his devotees because he showers his blessings through good humour and pleasant demeanour. Rev. Dr. Philipose Mar Chrysostom Valiya Metropolitan, possibly one of the longest living bishops in the world and a devout idealist, believes that the way to the creator is through the creations of God. He has internalised the essence of Christianity and propagated its tenets through his words and action. 

When Rev. Dr. Philipose Mar Chrysostom Valiya Metropolitan completed 90 years, I am very happy to note that the Mar Thoma Church through the Navathy Project reached out to the people in the margins and more than 2,500 houses were gifted to them. I came to know that Navathy celebration was inaugurated by veteran leader, Shri L K Advaniji and at that time, he had wished Metropolitan a life of more than 100 years and also assured to attend his 100th birthday. I am happy to know that he came and inaugurated the centenary celebrations last year. 

I am happy to know that a biographical film has been made on centenarian Metropolitan Emeritus Philipose Mar Chrysostom, Who served as a bishop for nearly 66 years. Helping the needy and poor has been his sole mission and continues to be. 

I also congratulate the Metropolitan Dr Joseph Mar Thoma who is celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of his holy Ordination. I am happy that the people have benefited from his visionary leadership and enduring passion for the health and well being of suffering humanity. 

I am told that he is also a champion of environmental protection and I understand that through the great Maramon Convention, he is instrumental in taking up a large scale plantation programme. 

It is indeed heartening that as part of Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma’s 80th  Birthday, the Mar Thoma church has initiated a challenging project called 'Snehakaram' (hand of love) to give help for the people who suffer from life threatening diseases like cancer. Dialysis is being given free of cost to people in need of help and support. With a funding of more than one crore rupees annually, this Project is undoubtedly of great help and succour to people who suffer financial hardship. I am happy that this help is extended to all people, regardless of caste or creed. 

I congratulate Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma for his ecclesia and ecumenical leadership in national and international arena. 

I wish him many more years of leadership in the paths shown by Dr. Juhanon Mar Thoma and other great leaders of the Mar Thoma Church. My best wishes are with you all for the success of the Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma Diamond Jubilee Project also.

My best wishes are with the people of Kerala with its rich cultural heritage and wide range of religious traditions. 

As I mentioned earlier, this state is a pace-setter for the nation in many ways. 

It is fortunate to have an enlightened leadership for a long period. 

The Maharaja of Travancore’s visionary leadership, the reformist zeal of Sri Narayana Guru, the invaluable contribution by the Church leaders like Rev. Dr. Philipose Mar Chrysostom Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan and Rev. Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan as well as other spiritual and cultural leaders have enriched the cultural capital of India.

We are deeply indebted to these visionary leaders who had an underlying belief that service to humanity leads one towards divinity.  

It might be worthwhile to remember what another great exponent of Indian thought, Swami Vivekananda had said in the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago on 27th September 1893:

“The seed is put in the ground, and earth and air and water are placed around it.  Does the seed become the earth, or the air, or the water? No. It becomes a plant. It develops after the law of its own growth, assimilates the air, the earth, and the water, converts them into plant substance, and grows into a plant.

Similar is the case with religion.  The Christian is not to become a Hindu or a Buddhist, nor a Hindu or a Buddhist to become a Christian.  But each must assimilate the spirit of the others and yet preserve his individuality and grow according to his own law of growth.”

Mahatma Gandhiji, the father of our nation, also had said:

“The golden rule of conduct ... is mutual toleration, seeing that we will never all think alike and we shall always see Truth in fragment and from different angles of vision. Even amongst the most conscientious persons, there will be room enough for honest differences of opinion. The only possible rule of conduct in any civilised society is, therefore, mutual toleration.”

As we remember these ennobling statements and recognise today the outstanding work done by two of the blessed sons of India, we have a rejuvenated sense of well being.  

We feel a new energy pervading in ourselves and the world around us. 

A positive energy, a source of harmony, understanding, respect, a perennial fountain head of the timeless values that India has stood for.  

It is time to nourish these roots. It is time to re-discover the treasure within.  

Churches, Temples, Mosques, Gurudwaras and other religious shrines are places of devotion, pious places of spiritual regeneration and catalysts of intergenerational transmission of cultural values. 

They are potentially the sites of social and community education. 

So long as they fulfil this role, they serve to bring people together. However, if they stray from this path and dabble in politics and issue unwarranted divisive statements, they become dysfunctional. 

I hope these two strands of religion and politics are not mixed up and the religious leaders give spiritual guidance to every human being and the political leaders take inspiration from our noble heritage to provide a clean polity. 

Today is an occasion for that process of recognizing goodness, recognising the spirit of creating a heaven on earth through pious thoughts and righteous action.  

Once again, thank you all for inviting me to be a part of this event. 

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India has the chance to re-emerge as the global powerhouse in the field of education and called for revamping the syllabi and improving the infrastructure to impart world class quality education.

He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the new campus of the Central University of Kerala and dedicating the educational institution to the nation, in Kasargod, Kerala today. He said that India was once known as ‘Vishwaguru’ and people from across the globe used to come here to study and acquire knowledge and expertise in different domains.

The Vice President said that from private educational institutions to Central Universities like this, every academic organization must work in a mission mode to revamp the educational architecture in tune with the requirements of the 21st century to make India a leading nation in the field of education and innovation.  

He said the education system should aim at the creation of a new, inclusive society, non-violent and non-exploitative, consisting of highly cultivated and motivated individuals inspired by love for humanity and guided by wisdom. He asked the students to be the torch bearers of our culture, traditions, ethos and customs. There is nothing wrong in adopting and assimilating good practices from elsewhere, but always remain rooted to our age-old culture and heritage, he added.

The Vice President recollected the famous words of the Father of the Nation - “I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any”.

The Vice President said that Education must lay the foundation for the progress of a nation adding that higher education, in particular, has an important role in building a knowledge-based society of the 21st century. He further said that higher education system should expand qualitatively and quantitatively for the betterment of the nation and society.  Graduates need to be competitive not only in a local or national context, but in an increasingly global market, he added.

The Vice President said that in this ‘global village’ our graduates as future leaders need a new kind of intercultural understanding, respect for common rules and fair play, an understanding of different interests, views and ways of thinking, and the ability to analyze and synthesize, he added.

The Vice President expressed the hope that in future various courses, including science & technology, will be taught in respective local languages in various States.

Expressing his concern over the increasing atrocities on women and girls, he said that the mindset has to be changed to address this menace. He emphasized the need for people to collectively fight against social evils like atrocities on women and caste discrimination.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am extremely delighted to inaugurate the new campus of the Central University of Kerala at Tejaswini Hills and dedicate the educational institution to the nation.

I extend my greetings to all the eminent educationists, faculty members, non-teaching staff, students and the civil society of Kerala on this momentous occasion. I 

also take this opportunity to congratulate the academic and administrative leadership of the university.

At the very outset I would like to convey my deep sense of appreciation to the people of Kerala for making the State a pioneer in education and social development. Enlightened leadership of persons like Sree Chithira Thirunal, inspiration from reformers like Sri Narayana Guru and a long history of investment in education by missionaries and local social reform bodies has made Kerala almost a fully literate society. Yet there are persistent challenges too.

Kasaragod district is rich in culture and history. It was part of Dakshina Kannada before state reorganization which took place on November 1, 1956. Kasragod was part of Kannur district until 1984 and since then it became the northern most district of Kerala. Kasaragod has several popular arts and traditions like Theyyam, Poorakkali and Yakshaganam. It is rich in languages and reflecting the multi lingual tradition,

Kasaragod is also known as Sapthabhasha Bhumi.

The presence of Central University of Kerala in Kasaragod is a blessing for the people of North Malabar. The region requires a thrust in education, health and infrastructure. I am sure that the presence of the Central University of Kerala will not only meet the educational requirements but also contribute towards improving the quality of life in Kasaragod in particular and Kerala in general.

Opening of  a new campus today will hopefully open new vistas for the students and the faculty as they continue their quest for academic excellence and ensure that this institution on the Tejaswini Hills spreads its ‘tejas’ or illumination far and wide, transforming the world view and also the world.

 Sisters and Brothers, education lays the foundation for the progress of a nation. Higher education, in particular, plays an important role in building a knowledge-based society of the 21st century. All the higher educational institutions, including Central Universities have an onerous responsibility in transforming the country into an focal point of knowledge and innovation.

If you recall, India was once known as “Vishwaguru” and people from across the globe used to come here to study and acquire knowledge and expertise in different domains. However, the situation changed following foreign invasions and the British rule and India lost its pre-eminent position in the field of education. Today, the country has a chance to re-emerge as a global powerhouse in the field of education. But this requires tremendous transformation from reorienting the syllabi to improving the infrastructure with the sole objective of imparting world class quality education.

Although there are more than 800 universities in India, none of them figures in the top-ranking educational institutions in the world. We cannot adopt ‘business as usual’ approach if we want to change the situation. From private educational institutions to Central Universities like yours, every academic organization must work in a mission mode to revamp the educational architecture in tune with the requirements of the 21st century to make India a leading nation in the field of education and innovation. Owing to the scope and pace of change, society has become increasingly knowledge-based and the institutes of higher learning and research are the main vehicles for cultural and socio-economic development of individuals, communities and nations.

Even though, India has the third largest higher education system in the world, its Gross Enrolment Ratio is only 25.2%. Considering the huge demographic dividend the country is blessed with, it is imperative that higher education system should expand qualitatively and quantitatively for the betterment of the nation and society. Ultimately, it should aim at the creation of a new, inclusive society, non-violent and non- exploitative, consisting of highly cultivated and motivated individuals inspired by love for humanity and guided by wisdom.

Education is not only for employment and the purpose of education is to enlighten, empower and develop a holistic individual whose moral compass will never swerve from the righteous path. Education must build character, caliber and capacity, besides promoting rightful conduct.

Dear students, always remember that you are inheritors of a great culture and heritage with a rich civilizational history. You should be the torch bearers of our culture, traditions, ethos and customs.  There is nothing wrong in adopting and assimilating good practices from elsewhere, but always remain rooted to our age-old culture and heritage. Here, I would like recall the famous words of the Father of the Nation : “I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any”. 

Higher Education has profoundly changed in the past two decades. While it may not yet be possible to think of higher education as a global system, a considerable convergence can be seen among the world's universities and higher education systems.  As a result of globalization, our graduates need to be competitive not only in a local or national context, but in an increasingly global market. In this ‘global village’  our graduates as future leaders need a new kind of intercultural understanding, respect for common rules and fair play, an understanding of different interests, views and ways of thinking, and the ability to analyze and synthesize.

I am glad to know that since its inception in 2009, Central University of Kerala has carved a niche for itself by giving impetus to education in this backward region. The students’ enrolment went up from 17 in 2009 to 1426 during the year 2017-18. It is projected to achieve student enrolment of 5000 by 2022. Coming from 16 States, the students represent the national character of this university. 

I am happy to know that the university is providing the best teaching and learning environments to the students. The right atmosphere will facilitate their creativity to flourish. I would like the University to give thrust to research in a big way as also establish linkages with industry so that the courses are in tune with the requirements of the industry. 

As we all know, today’s universities are models of teaching excellence, research, innovation and collaboration.  The barriers to the advancement of education must be removed to fulfill the full potential and for the students to take full advantage of their educational opportunities and credentials. For bringing about a substantial change and development, the solution to major challenges require strong involvement not only of the government and the institution, but also of all stakeholders including students and their families, teachers and community as a whole. 

I was informed that the University was accredited to the NAAC in the year 2016 and awarded B++ in its first cycle of evaluation. The NIRF ranking is between 100 and 150 and rated in top 5% of all educational institutions of our country. While appreciating these recognitions, I would like to remind all the stake holders to be conscious of improving the NAAC grade in the next cycles.

The university must implement specific teaching and learning strategies and design mechanisms and instruments to improve the quality of education. With diminishing resources and increasing competition, the challenges may seem insurmountable. Nevertheless, the institutions must continue their efforts to foster quality teaching and improve student learning outcomes. The Central university of Kerala has still a long way to go. While on the one side there is a great need to have dedicated teams with focused vision and mission to take the current activities to surmountable heights, on the other hand, we continuously need to be open-minded for reaching new heights.

Thank you all once again for your esteemed presence and attention on this eventful occasion!

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu advised the doctors to Treat Patients with Patience, Empathy and Compassion. He was addressing the 8th Convocation of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, here today. The Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare, Shri J.P. Nadda, the Ministers of State for Health & Family Welfare, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Smt. Anupriya Patel and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that education and healthcare are the two pillars of nation building. He further said that India has made rapid strides in various sectors, including the medical field. However, even after 70 years, we are facing many challenges including poverty, illiteracy, atrocities on women and girls, problem of drinking water in many rural and urban areas, lack of hygiene and sanitation, casteism, corruption and urban-rural divide, he added.

The Vice President said that while the Government is committed to providing universal health coverage to all, the urban-rural divide is more glaring in the healthcare sector. To overcome the problem of manpower shortage in rural areas, he advised to make it mandatory for MBBS graduates to work in the rural areas before getting their first promotion. This would enable the rural population to get better medical care and at the same time sensitize the medical fraternity to the healthcare concerns of rural population, he added.

The Vice President said that several State Governments have designed their own health insurance schemes. He further said that the aim is to ensure that no person is denied the right to affordable medical care. The private sector must join hands with the government to ensure that healthcare is accessible and affordable, he added.

The Vice President said that the graduating doctors have chosen this profession casts an onerous responsibility in building not only a ‘Swasth Bharat but also a Shresth Bharat’. He further said that they have been trained under a very proficient faculty and a world-class postgraduate teaching program and research facility.  In this temple of learning, they have been exposed to frontline medical technology, witnessed state of the art operations like organ transplant, limb re-implantation, neonatal operations, brain and cardiac surgery, participated in investigation and treatment of challenging ailments, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“It is indeed a pleasure to preside over the Convocation of one of the best medical institutions in the country. This hospital, located in a heritage building, has been serving the people for the past 75 years. Starting with 50 beds initially, it has now grown into a 1427 bedded state-of-the-art tertiary care medical institute.

I am glad to learn that the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, which was, established in 2008 with 28 PG seats and two super-specialty seats, has expanded into an institution with 160 PG and 25 super-specialty seats. 

I am sure the students who are passing out today will be proud of having undergone training in this august institute.

Education and healthcare are the two pillars of nation building. The fact that you have chosen this profession casts an onerous responsibility in building not only a ‘Swasth Bharat but also a Shresth Bharat’.  As members of a noble profession, the Hippocratic oath taken by you must be the guiding light for you at all times. Always maintain the highest standards of ethics and morals and never compromise on them. You are next to God for patients, who come to you. Never betray their trust. Always, treat them with patience, empathy and compassion.   

Dear students! India has made rapid strides in various sectors, including the medical field. However, even after 70 years, we are facing many challenges including poverty, illiteracy, atrocities on women and girls, problem of drinking water in many rural and urban areas, lack of hygiene and sanitation, casteism, corruption and urban-rural divide.

While the Government is committed to providing universal health coverage to all, the urban-rural divide is more glaring in the healthcare sector. 

As you all are aware, the country is facing an acute shortage of doctors, nurses and other paramedical staff. The growth and expansion of medical facilities have been extremely lop-sided with most of the hi-tech and modern hospitals located in cities in government as well as private sector. Although governments have been addressing this problem, concerted efforts are needed from all stakeholders to remedy the situation and ensure adequate and proper healthcare facilities in rural areas. The private sector, NGOs and doctors organizations need to supplement the efforts of the governments in this regard. 

To overcome the problem of manpower shortage in rural areas, I have been wondering if we should make it mandatory for MBBS graduates to work in the rural areas before getting their first promotion. This would enable the rural population to get better medical care and at the same time sensitize the medical fraternity to the healthcare concerns of rural population. 

Another area of concern is the affordability of medicare. It is a fact that medical costs are met by people though out-of-pocket expenditure most of the time. Time and again, high treatment costs have virtually forced innumerable families into debt traps and reduced them to penury. The government had recently announced Ayushman Bharat National Health Protection Scheme to provide universal health coverage through insurance. The scheme is envisaged to benefit 10 crore families. In view of the low penetration of health insurance, I am sure institutions like yours will act as nodal centers for such an initiative in providing quality health care to all. In another major initiative, the government also announced plans to eliminate TB. 

Several State Governments too have designed their own health insurance schemes. In the end, the aim is to ensure that no person is denied the right to affordable medical care. As I have stated earlier, the private sector must join hands with the government to ensure that healthcare is accessible and affordable.

It is heartening that the Government is also providing low cost and high quality medicines to all patients and the Amrit Pharmacy in Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital is an endeavor in this direction. Since many patients hail from far off place and even from different states, the hospital has commissioned a Dharamshala for them.  I am happy to learn that besides a number of such patient-centric initiatives, you are carrying forward the Swatch Bharat initiative of the Prime Minister in true spirit, linking health with sanitation and hygienic practices.

It is heartening to note that the associated Dr. RML hospital is also making steady advances in improving patient care. The hospital has also inducted latest state of the art technology like Multi Tesla MRI, New CT Scan and Tholium laser.  We must fully harness the power of advanced technology to improve diagnostics and treatment.

As I have stated earlier, you-- medical practitioners are the pillar for a healthy India. You are part of the academic cream of the society and now when you are passing out, the whole nation has great expectations from you. At the same time, you must realize that this degree is a dividend of an immense investment the nation has made on you. So, with the knowledge, skills and talent you have acquired in this institute, you must be the torchbearer in mitigating the sufferings and ailment of the people.

This hospital attracts patients from the city and from neighboring states as well. They visit this hospital with unwavering belief that they will be cured by the marvel of modern medicine. The poorest of poor are among those who come to this hospital. They are the ones who not only need your knowledge and skill but also your kind words and a patient ear.  At the same time they are ones who treat you only next to the almighty and give you the opportunity to further deepen your knowledge about the mysteries of human body and the marvel of medical science. 

I am sure you have been trained under a very proficient faculty and a world-class postgraduate teaching program and research facility.  In this temple of learning, you have been exposed to frontline medical technology, witnessed state of the art operations like organ transplant, limb re-implantation, neonatal operations, brain and cardiac surgery, participated in investigation and treatment of challenging ailments. 

Surely, the knowledge you have gained here will equip you to confidently face the future challenges. I congratulate you all for having the illustrious institutions like PGIMER & Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital as your alma mater. 

Tomorrow when you walk out of these gates to build a career, you must fulfill the aspirations of your family, society and the nation. In this vast country, opportunities are plenty for a good doctor. Equally numerous are your options. You can be a clinician, surgeon, researcher, a health care administrator or a forensic investigator. Whatever be your choice, follow ethics and keep learning so that you are always abreast of the latest advances in medical sciences. Remember that this noble profession is a unique blend of science and humanity. Never leave your human aspect while treating a patient.

You are the trailblazers of a Healthy India. My best wishes for all your future endeavors! 

Thank you. Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that a possible solution to address the shortage of doctors in rural areas could be mandatory posting of fresh MBBS graduates in rural areas before granting them their first promotion. He was addressing the inaugural session of 15th World Rural Health Conference with the theme “Healing the Heart of Healthcare – Leaving no one behind”, organized by the Academy of Family Physicians, here today. The Minister of State for Health & Family Welfare, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

The Vice President said that the rural-urban divide in terms of providing effective healthcare services is more pronounced in the low income countries and developing countries due to shortage of infrastructure and manpower. He further said that extreme rural-urban inequities exist in Asia and the Pacific regions, while 83 per cent of Africa’s rural people have no entitlements to health care. The ILO report also mentioned that there was a shortfall of seven million health workers in rural areas across the globe as compared to three million workers in urban areas, he added.

 

The Vice President said that there has to be concerted efforts from all stakeholders in the health sector to remedy the situation and a comprehensive and systematic approach can address these inequities and ensure access to affordable healthcare services. He further said that the private sector, NGOs and doctors’ organizations like Academy of Family Physicians of India can play a bigger and more participative role in supplementing the efforts of the governments in ending the urban-rural divide. A possible solution to address the shortage of doctors in rural areas could be mandatory posting of fresh MBBS graduates in rural areas before granting them their first promotion, he added.

 

To overcome major bottlenecks in the delivery of an effective healthcare system like low doctor-patient ratio, lack of skilled paramedics and poor infrastructure, the Vice President said that there is a need to have strong political commitment and strong advocacy from relevant national and international organizations with support of nongovernmental organizations.

 

Highlighting the need to promote the concept of family doctor in a big way, the Vice President said that a family doctor provides primary and continuing care to the entire family within the communities; addresses physical, psychological and social problems; and coordinates comprehensive health care services with other specialists, as needed. Family physicians deliver a range of acute, chronic and preventive medical care services, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am happy to inaugurate the 15th World Rural Health Conference organized by the Academy of Family Physicians of India under the aegis of WONCA, World Organization of Family Doctors, a non-profit organization.

 

The conference’s theme “Healing the Heart of Healthcare – Leaving no one behind” is indeed appropriate and timely.

 

Approximately half of the global population lives in rural areas, but those areas are served by only 38% of the total nursing workforce and by less than a quarter of the total physician workforce. Globally it has been found that health inequity exists regardless of economic development. I am told that high income countries too are facing the shortage of health workers in remote and rural areas. For instance, only nine per cent of registered physicians in the USA practice in rural areas where 20 per cent of the people live.

 

While the rural-urban divide in terms of providing effective healthcare services exists in many countries, it is particularly more pronounced in the low income countries and developing countries. This is due to shortage of infrastructure and manpower. According to a 2015 report of the ILO, 56 per cent of rural residents worldwide are without legal health coverage as against 22 per cent of urban population. Extreme rural-urban inequities exist in Asia and the Pacific regions, while 83 per cent of Africa’s rural people have no entitlements to health care. 

 

The ILO report also mentioned that there was a shortfall of seven million health workers in rural areas across the globe as compared to three million workers in urban areas.

 

The report highlights that nearly 63% of the world’s rural population do not have access to health care because of underfunding, compared to 33% of the urban population. 

Deficits in per capita health spending are twice as large in rural areas as in urban areas. The deficits observed result in unnecessary suffering and death, as reflected for example in rural maternal mortality rates that are 2.5 times higher than urban rates. 

 

Sisters and Brothers,

 

It is also a matter if concern that the South Asian countries fare poorly on Human Development Index. Home to one quarter of world’s population, South Asia is a high-priority region due to many public health concerns. 78 percent of expectant mothers throughout the developing world receive at least one antenatal checkup, that number falls to 68 percent in South Asia, and it is compounded by lack of health services and malnutrition leading to one of the highest maternal mortality in the world. South Asians are also more prone to develop heart diseases and diabetes than others.  

 

Burden of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria in South Asia is high. Development and resurgence of drug resistant cases make it more difficult to manage. Poor funding, low skilled staff, lack of infrastructure, and poor access to diagnostic and treatment facilities are some of the reasons for the situation. Non communicable diseases have put huge burden on health system. NCDs account for sizeable proportions (from one third to two thirds) of all death and disability in the region.

 

In India too, the rural areas are lagging behind urban areas in terms of medical services. I think the time has come for us in India to treat this unhealthy gap in providing preventive and curative medical services in the rural areas on a war footing. Low doctor patient ratio, poor access to health services and low utilization of health services are some of the major problems. 

 

There has to be concerted efforts from all stakeholders in the health sector to remedy the situation. A comprehensive and systematic approach can address these inequities and ensure access to affordable healthcare services. According to Rural Health Statistics 2016, about 4.6 per cent of functional PHCs in India are un-electrified. In other words, over 38 million rural households are dependent on health facilities that have no electricity.   

 

The private sector, NGOs and doctors’ organizations like yours can play a bigger and more participative role in supplementing the efforts of the governments in ending the urban-rural divide. The scope is unlimited and what we need is a collaborative approach to meet the shortage in terms of medical personnel and infrastructure, especially in the remote and far-flung areas. It requires willingness and commitment on the part of doctors and paramedical personnel to serve in rural areas as most prefer to work in urban areas.

 

A possible solution to address the shortage of doctors in rural areas could be mandatory posting of fresh MBBS graduates in rural areas before granting them their first promotion. 

 

Major bottlenecks in the delivery of an effective healthcare system are low doctor-patient ratio, lack of skilled paramedics and poor infrastructure. To overcome this, there is a need to have strong political commitment and strong advocacy from relevant national and international organizations with support of nongovernmental organizations.

 

We see this happen in India in recent times. The Government has announced a massive health insurance programme to benefit 10 crore families under Aayushman Bharat. Similarly, as part of improving the well being of the people, the government proposes to set up 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres across India.

                                     

National Health policy 2017 objectives seek to progressively achieve universal health coverage, reinforce trust in public health system and align the growth of private health care sector with public health goals.  

 

Finally, the perception that the public health sector is mostly for preventive health and not for curative health needs to change at the ground level, particularly in rural areas. Today, India has one of the most privatized health systems in the world with 72% of health expenditure made in private sector. Out of pocket expenditure is a major area of concern with about 80% of population spending on health services from their personal expenses and only 3% of the population, especially in the formal sector, is getting some type of health insurance.

 

There is also a need to promote the concept of family doctor in a big way. 

 

A family doctor provides primary and continuing care to the entire family within the communities; addresses physical, psychological and social problems; and coordinates comprehensive health care services with other specialists, as needed. Family physicians deliver a range of acute, chronic and preventive medical care services. 

 

We should also explore how efficiently we can utilize the expertise of AYUSH doctors in strengthening rural health care. 

 

With people in rural areas also falling prey to lifestyle diseases like diabetes, cancers and stroke, it has become highly imperative to provide an effective, affordable healthcare delivery services to the rural people. This can be achieved through public-private partnership.

 

I hope this conference will come out with some practical suggestions on ways to improve the well being of people living in rural areas.

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the Smart Cities Mission is the beginning of India’s urban renaissance. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the Book ‘Smart Cities Unbundled’ authored by Dr. Sameer Sharma, here today. The Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs (I/C), Shri Hardeep Singh Puri and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that a Smart City is a liveable city to the people with required amenities like clean drinking water, sanitation, toilets, infrastructure etc. He further said that it as a renaissance because there has been a paradigm shift in both the planning, approach and implementation of Smart City mission.

 

The Vice President said that while the government has a Constitutional mandate to devolve funds, functionaries and functions on local bodies, the progress has been slow. He further said that the urban agenda prepared by the present Government aims to address this gap by integrating several types of plans at the city level. People's participation in any programme is crucial for its success, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the Smart Cities Mission, which was described as ‘Mission Transform nation’ by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, seeks to transform cities into sustainable centres of economic activity and provide improved quality of life to citizens. He further said that another remarkable feature of the mission was to take up credit rating of cities. One more important strategic element of the Smart Cities Mission is the use of digital technology to bring about transparency and accountability, as well as improving the service delivery to its citizens, he added.

 

The Vice President said that a novel feature of Smart Cities Mission is Area Based Development - cities pick up one area, develop it fully and then proceed to develop all other areas of the city one by one. He further said that making the Urban Local Bodies financially self-sufficient is very important for sustainable development. This new initiative requires a new skill set, an ability to access and utilize the state of the art from around the world and an attitudinal shift where we forge new partnerships and collaborations rather than executing project only by the government, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“For me, Smart Cities Mission is the beginning of India’s urban renaissance. I am describing it as a renaissance because there has been a paradigm shift in both the planning, approach and implementation of this mission. 

From this ‘top down’ planning approach to a ‘bottom-up’ planning approach, from merely waiting for funds to flow from the Union and State governments to creatively generating funds through bonds and value capture finance and public private partnership, it has been a paradigm shift.

While the government has a Constitutional mandate to devolve funds, functionaries and functions on local bodies, the progress has been slow. However, it is heartening that in a threefold increase over that of the 13th Finance Commission, the 14th Finance Commission awarded total grants of Rs.87,114 Crore to Urban Local Bodies.

Post independence, economic planning was done at the national level by the Planning Commission. Earlier, there was hardly any connection with spatial planning at the city and regional levels.  The urban agenda prepared by the present Government aims to address this gap by integrating several types of plans at the city level. 

The vehicle to do this is the Smart City Challenge – a competition in which more than 14 million people participated to discuss and decide on the future of cities. This was a unique concept as it enabled a participatory role to the people in deciding about the future of their cities.

I am happy to note that the City of Bhubaneswar which stood first in the competition has been given an international award by the American Planning Association.  In the top 20 global Smart Cities ranked by the British market research agency Juniper Research, Bhubaneswar again finds a place.

The Smart Cities Mission, which was described as ‘Mission Transform nation’ by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, seeks to transform cities into sustainable centres of economic activity and provide improved quality of life to citizens. The Mission saw a complete shift in the urban development planning in the country as “bottom-up” approach was adopted as against Delhi-driven ‘top-down’ method which used to be followed till then. 

Another remarkable feature of the mission was to take up credit rating of cities. The Government have started a campaign to do the credit rating of cities. This exercise to understand the financial health of our urban local bodies by credit rating has been completed in 348 cities. I am happy to note that 146 cities have “Investment Grade” with more than BBB(minus) grades and 30 cities with more than A(minus) grades.

One more important strategic element of the Smart Cities Mission is the use of digital technology to bring about transparency and accountability, as well as improving the service delivery to its citizens.   In the Smart Cities Mission, cities are rolling out fast network of sensors and cameras to collect data, which is then analysed by using artificial intelligence to make predictions and decisions regarding collection of solid waste, traffic management, control of crime, etc. 

In fact, cities are using digital technology to build a nervous system for our cities. This is an invisible and magical weapon which will make life more convenient for all the people. I am happy to note that Smart City Centres have already been completed in 8 cities; Ahmedabad, Kakinada, Visakhapatnam, Nagpur, Pune, Rajkot, Surat, and Vadodara.  15 more Smart City Centres are under construction and another 31 are in the tendering stage.

Another novel feature of Smart Cities Mission is Area Based Development - cities pick up one area, develop it fully and then proceed to develop all other areas of the city one by one.  The reason is that,“Areas” in India are so different --  the local plan for development of Paharganj in Delhi will be very different from that of Greater Kailash.  The selection of Areas and the components to be developed within the area are done by the citizens.  Work has started in Udaipur and Ujjain on integrated Area Based Development.

Several cities have started to develop smart streets as part of Area Based Development.  In smart streets, different activities on the streets are re-organised so that all get a place.  In the completed streets of Pune and Surat, there is marked difference in the visual aesthetics and optimal utilisation of space.

Making the Urban Local Bodies financially self-sufficient is very important for sustainable development.  I am happy to note that Pune and Ahmedabad have issued Municipal Bonds and the proposals of another eight cities are in an advanced stage to issue the bonds.

Another financial tool, having a large potential is Value Capture Finance (VCF). Government invests a lot of money in cities, which leads to increase in property values.  Government policies also have a positive effect on house values.  In Value Capture Finance, a small share of this increase in property value due to actions by Government is taken by the local bodies for constructing public projects.  I am happy to note that 17 cities are in an advanced stage of formulating Value Capture Finance policies and creating bye-laws to implement them.

Smart cities have caught the imagination of the world. Countries are attempting to make a couple of cities smart or, perhaps, half-a-dozen.  India has set itself a target of 99 Smart Cities which will act as Lighthouses for other cities to follow.  The programme and its multiplying effects are much larger. 

Clearly, this new initiative requires a new skill set, an ability to access and utilize the state of the art from around the world and an attitudinal shift where we forge new partnerships and collaborations rather than executing project only by the government.

The wave of urbanization is unstoppable.

All that we have to do is to use this as an opportunity to transform the way we manage this historical trend. 

In many ways, we have lost a lot of time, probably, but it is never too late. 

We have to give a new impetus to systematic urban planning, sustainable funding and swifter execution. 

There is a need for upgrading the professional competence of civil servants to enable a more competent handling of urban management.

A more people-centric, transparent governance using technological tools as well as a humane, and objective, interface is the need of the hour. 

The essence of ‘smartness’ is efficiency, effectiveness, excellence and empathy. It is governing our cities with people at the very centre of the whole system.

Dr. Sameer Sharma, who was the Mission Director for Smart Cities Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Capacity Building programme from 2014 to 2017 is publishing the story of this journey. The book is aptly titled as Smart Cities Unbundled because we have to tell India and the world what an Indian Smart City is and what constitutes Smart Cities Mission of India.

 

Thank you, Jaihind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkakaih Naidu has said that Environment protection and Economic development must go together. He was addressing the Convocation 2018 of Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy, in Dehradun, Uttarakhan today. The Governor of Uttarakhand, Dr. Krishna Kant Pal, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat, the Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

The Vice President said that fundamental principle of forest management should be based on conservation and sustainable utilization of natural resources. He further said that we need to employ environment friendly approach and we must live with nature for better future. It should be the sacred duty of everyone to plant and protect trees, he added.

 

The Vice President said that states must be incentivised for increasing forest Cover. He further said that Niti Ayog, and the Centre must have provisions to encouraging states doing well, and top most priority must be given to the forest, rivers and the Mother Nature. Tree plantation and environment protection should become mass movement, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the symbiotic association of man and forest is deeply embedded in the religious and the socio-cultural mind set of our countrymen and it is getting disturbed in recent times due to increasing demand of natural resources and lack of understanding about Mother Nature. He further said that the Indian culture has traditionally revered trees as holy symbols of divinity. It was considered as a sin to cut trees like Peepal which is called ‘Ficus Religiosa’, he added.

 

The Vice President said that there is a need to guide, provide knowledge to tribal or local communities on conservation techniques. He further said that foresters must be development facilitators and a growth enabler without compromising the national interest and the welfare of the people especially the tribal groups who depend on forests for their livelihood. India has come a long way in changing the management strategies from keeping people away from the forests for protection purposes to managing the forest with cooperation of people in the form of Joint Forest Management, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am extremely delighted to be with you today at the convocation of 2016 batch of Indian Forest Service officers. I am also glad to note that two officer trainees from our neighboring country Bhutan are also passing out today. I have no doubt in saying that the contribution of Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy in training these foreign trainees will further strengthen the ties between the two nations and foster joint collaboration  in combating wildlife related offences which are often trans-border crimes.

You are entering the forest service at a crucial time in which India is trying to carve out an important and rightful position in the world. 

India is among the fastest growing economies in the world today. It is now paying much more attention to environment than earlier. 

While before 1980, almost 150,000 hectares of forest land was being diverted to non-forestry activities every year, it is heartening to note that this rate of diversion has been reduced to 15,500 hectares per annum after 1980. 

In terms of forest cover, India has shown an increasing trend in comparison to the global trend of decreasing forest cover during the last decades.  As per the India State of Forest Report, 2017, India is ranked 10th in the world with 24.4% of land under forest and tree cover. 

It is heartening that India is placed 8th in the list of top ten nations reporting the greatest annual net gain in forest area. There has been an increase of 8,021 Sq. Km. in the total forest and tree cover during 2015-17.

You will have a great opportunity as IFS officers try and to reach the ideal of increasing the forest areas to one third of the total land area as was envisaged way back in the National Forest Policy 1952. 

You all are aware that we are making rapid strides to enhance our human development ranking in the global scale. This requires accelerated developmental activities. However, these developmental activities need to have in built safety nets to safe guard our natural resources that support millions of poor people.

In the present context, as IFS officers, you play the role of a magistrate in regulating the developmental works for safeguarding the ecological security of the country. 

The unique aspect of our civilization is that Indian culture has, since time immemorial, glorified nature and emphasized the coexistence of man, animal and plant life. This natural association of man, animal, and plant life is manifested in our religious texts, in our rich literatures and ancient philosophies. 

Some of the greatest religions of the world that sprang from this soil had preached nonviolence, taking even animals into the ambit of this doctrine. Such sublime ingredients of our culture have made the Indian civilization a repository of universal values and timeless ideals.

The symbiotic association of man and forest deeply embedded in the religious and the socio-cultural mind set of our countrymen and emphasized since time immemorial, is getting disturbed in recent times due to increasing demand of natural resources.

The Indian culture has traditionally revered trees as holy symbols of divinity. It was considered as a sin to cut trees like Peepal which is called ‘Ficus Religiosa’. 

Infact, Lord Krishna identifies himself as the Ashwatha, or the peepal tree among all the trees. 

There have been, in recent past, a number of movements to enhance awareness of forest protection, like the ‘Chipko’ movement which took root in Uttarakhand region in 1973 led by Gaura Devi, Sudesha Devi, Bachni Devi, Chandi Prasad Bhatt and Sunderlal Bahuguna. 

In this context, I would like to recall what our father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi, had said, to constantly remind ourselves that destroying forests is destroying ourselves.  He had said:

“What we are doing to the forests of the world is but a mirror reflection of what we are doing to ourselves and to one another.”

Therefore, it is now recognized worldwide that the fundamental principle of forest management should be based on conservation and sustainable utilization of natural resources, without affecting its productive and ecological functions. 

That’s where, you, the youngest generation of forest officers passing out today, have a unique opportunity and responsibility of meeting the forest needs of the people on the one hand and improve the forest cover on the other.

Environment protection and Economic development must go together.

Tree plantation and environment protection should become mass movement.

Sisters and Brothers, 

I have been told that scientific forest management in India is more than a century old. 

We have come a long way in changing the management strategies from keeping people away from the forests for protection purposes to managing the forest with cooperation of people in the form of Joint Forest Management. 

Therefore, as a Forester, your management approach should be as a development facilitator and a growth enabler without compromising the national interest and the welfare of the people especially the tribal groups who depend on forests for their livelihood. 

Overgrazing, shifting cultivation and fires have resulted in elimination of many species. We need to work with local communities to rehabilitate the degenerated forests and encourage farmers to adopt ecologically sustainable practices. This is not an easy job and best brains and hearts are needed to make this fine balance. 

I am confident that your two years of professional training, knowledge, and skills you imbibed in your field exposures would come handy to meet the challenging task. 

On this occasion, I remember the recent supreme sacrifice made by valiant IFS officer late Manikandan of Karnataka Forest Department in the line of duty on the 3rd March 2018, which is a World Wildlife day. There are many other IFS officers and forest department staff who have laid down their lives while attending to their perilous duty to safe guard the forest resources. They are undoubtedly etched in the nation’s memory forever.  

Man-animal conflict is increasing in our country and it is a cause of concern for poor people living in the vicinity of forests.  You should try to devise innovative solutions to overcome this conflict to reduce life and property of people as well as animals.

Sisters and Brothers, 

I know that forest service is a very challenging service and you have to work in difficult terrains and face life-threatening situations in the forests every day from wild animals and vicious forces and unscrupulous smugglers who try to plunder the forest products. 

You are an army of green soldiers committed to maintain our rich natural heritage to secure our collective future. I am genuinely impressed by your grit and passion to choose this difficult and coveted profession, despite knowing the hardships associated with it. 

You have a difficult task ahead of you, a very challenging, delicate balancing act.  

You have to foster development, not impede it. 

At the same time, you have to ensure that the natural resources and bio-diversity are protected.  

You will have tough decisions to make as you will have to think of people and the planet as a unified eco-system. 

You will undoubtedly have a number of opportunities to access the state of art knowledge in managing forestry in a scientific sustainable manner. 

You will also be able to hone your skills in adroitly reconciling the economic needs of people with the preservation and improvement of environment.  

In India, we say – “Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitaha” (If you protect Dharma, then Dharma will protect you).  

Similarly with the forest and tree cover, there is an adage which says “Vruksho Rakshati Rakshithaha” (If you protect trees, they will protect you). 

Keeping in view this symbiotic relationship between nature and mankind, the government has drawn up plans to introduce agro-forestry and support farmers to enhance their incomes through forestry. You are passing out today from Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy, after acquiring technical managerial and administrative skills to manage the forest sector.  

The knowledge and skills, which you have mastered during your training should be a strong foundation as you begin a fulfilling professional career. 

You have to constantly learn and grow professionally acquiring and updating your knowledge as learning is a never-ending process. 

Along with knowledge and professional excellence, please keep the moral compass always handy.  

Strong ethical bias lends greater credibility and respectability to the work you do. 

My best wishes are with you. 

I am sure you will shape your careers in the best possible manner, serving Mother Nature and her children in a way that people thrive and the planet keeps reviving. 

I once again compliment all the offices trainees of 2016 batch and the trainees from Bhutan, and especially those who have won awards for their merit and achievement. It is, indeed, recognition of your hard work. 

I also congratulate Dr. Shashi Kumar and the faculty for training yet another set of fine officers to serve the nation.  I wish you all the success in your career and in your endeavor in preserving and developing forest wealth of this great country.

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Share and Care has been the core of our philosophy. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple renovated by Hare Krishna Foundation, in Hyderabad today. The Minister for Housing, Law and Endowments, Telangana, Shri A. Indra Karan Reddy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that temples have been the centres of India’s cultural ethos and they have been centres of music, dance and spiritual upliftment of the masses. They have spread awareness of religious and spiritual thoughts through traditions like Harikatha and Purana Pravchana, he added.

The Vice President said that temples have had a central place in India’s cultural life and we revere every action that serves humanity. He further said that there is a sanctity attached to many of our daily activities which is why we have words like “Vidyalaya”, “Chikitsalaya”, “Bhojanalaya” and even “Shauchalaya”.  We see divinity everywhere because we believe that all living and non-living beings are manifestations of the same divine principle and energy, he added.

The Vice President said that Krishna symbolizes the eternal values of love, compassion, empathy and righteous behaviour. He further said that if we can bring about the Krishna consciousness in society, we can usher in a huge transformation in the lives of people. We can fosterpeace, prosperity, fraternity and bring Vaikuntha or anxiety free environment in each and every family, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am blessed to be amidst all of you today and partake of the divine blessings of Lord Krishna and the spiritual radiance of SrilaPrabhupada.

SrilaPrabhupada gave practical spiritual life by which people can adopt the principles of Krishna Consciousness in their lives and thus benefit by the ancient wisdom of India in the form of Bhagavad-Gita and SrimadBhagavatam.

Temples have been the centres of India’s cultural ethos from time immemorial.  They have been centres of music, dance and spiritual upliftment of the masses. They have spread awareness of religious and spiritual thoughts through traditions like Harikatha and PuranaPravchana. They have also encouraged philanthropy and fostered a sense of concern for fellow beings through charitable actions. Share and Care has been the core of our philosophy. 

Hare Krishna Movement has focused on a temple centric transformation of the society based on the teachings of Bhagavad-Gita and SrimadBhagavatam. 

I am impressed by the whole gamut of services being rendered by the Hare Krishna Movement. Food distribution Programs like Akshaya Patra, Bhojanamritha, SaddhiMoota (feeding farmers and hamalis in market yards) and AkshayaAlpaharam are indeed very laudable initiatives taken up by your organization.

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

Temples have had a central place in India’s cultural life. In the Indian tradition, we revere every action that serves humanity. There is a sanctity attached to many of our daily activities which is why we have words like “Vidyalaya”, “Chikitsalaya”, “Bhojanalaya” and even “Shauchalaya”.  We see divinity everywhere because we believe that all living and non-living beings are manifestations of the same divine principle and energy. 

Krishna symbolizes the eternal values of love, compassion, empathy and righteous behaviour. If we can bring about the Krishna consciousness in society, we can usher in a huge transformation in the lives of people. We can fosterpeace, prosperity, fraternity and bring Vaikuntha or anxiety free environment in each and every family.  A temple such as this educates the people in the principles of happiness and plays a pivotal role in bringing inner peace and a positive, healthy attitude towards life.

I am happy to be among the devotees of Lord Krishna today.

May this temple become a source of direction and joy for millions in the days to come. I pray to Lord Krishna, the Jagadguru or the guru for the entire universe, to continue to bless the entire humanity with his infinite grace. Let the world be a better place with each passing day. 

Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum!

Hare Krishna!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that urban rural divide in providing medical care must end adding that people living in rural areas must have access to affordable and quality healthcare. He was addressing the gathering at First Graduation Day function of Malla Reddy Institute of Medical Sciences & Malla Reddy Institute of Dental Sciences in Hyderabad, Telangana today.

Highlighting the shortage of doctors and nurses all over the country, the Vice President said that rural areas are under-served in terms of medical facilities and personnel. Working in rural areas for MBBS Graduates must be made mandatory before they get their first promotion, he added.

The Vice President said that India needs a multi-pronged strategy to improve the well-being of our people. He suggested the government to increase budgetary allocations for healthcare and address infrastructure and manpower shortages. Setting up more medical, dental and nursing colleges and providing affordable and accessible treatment as well as education is also crucial, he added.

Addressing the students, the Vice President said that medical students and doctors must ensure that their trust is never broken and maintain the highest credibility. He further said that not only credibility, they must also have empathy and compassion. They have taken up a noble profession where they don’t distinguish between a poor and rich patient while providing treatment and a good human being will always make a good doctor too, he added.

The Vice President said that India needs to become world leader in education and reduce brain drain. He complimented the Union Government for launching ‘Study in India’ programme to promote India as a destination for higher studies and attract foreign students.

The Vice President said that in the modern times, certain aberrations have crept into our social life and we are witnessing barbaric incidents like rapes, female feticides and dowry killings. He further said that no civilized society can tolerate such inhuman acts and the most stringent punishments have to be meted out to criminals who perpetrate those crimes. Gender equality must begin at home and families play a big role in shaping the attitude of children and boys must be made to treat girls with respect, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am extremely pleased to attend the First Graduation Day function of the Malla Reddy Institute of Medical Sciences & Malla Reddy Institute of Dental Sciences and share my thoughts with all of you. 

Dear students, all of you will be naturally elated to acquire the coveted medical degrees marking a milestone in your careers. I would like to congratulate all those who graduated today. Remember to uphold the Hippocrates oath as you step out of the corridors of this institution. From now on you will be serving the society and the country as a full-fledged healthcare professional—a doctor, who is treated as a demigod by the patients and their families. Therefore, ensure that their trust is never broken and maintain the highest credibility. Not only credibility, you must also have empathy and compassion. You have taken up a noble profession where you don’t distinguish between a poor and rich patient while providing treatment. A good human being will always make a good doctor too.

As India transits from a developing nation to a developed nation with the country achieving remarkable progress in various fields, the health status of Indians too has improved over the years. The life expectancy which was around 40 years in 1960 has increased to 70 years now. We have also successfully eradicated some of the major communicable diseases like polio and tetanus. There has been steady decline in IMR and MMR rates, although there is wide variation between the States. 

Today India has emerged as the sixth largest economy and the GDP growth rate is expected to be 7.4 per cent this year and 7.6 per cent next year. The Asian Development Bank has projected India to be the fastest growing economy in Asia. The World Bank too has forecast a growth rate of 7.3 per cent for India this year and said that the country’s economy has recovered from the effects of demonetization and GST.

The GST collections were expected to touch Rs.93,000-Rs.95,000 crore by the end of last month as against the average of Rs.87,000 crore during the previous five months. 

Even, the IMF praised India for using the right policies for lowering its level of debt to GDP ratio, which was quite high. On the other hand, IMF pointed out that China alone has contributed 43 per cent to the increase in global debt since 2007.

However, despite the economic progress, India has not done as well as it could have on various health indicators and there is scope for vast improvement.  

The country is facing the twin burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases; the rural areas are under-served in terms of medical facilities and personnel; there is shortage of doctors and nurses all over the country. Although successive governments at the Centre and in various States have been trying to address this issue, we are still short of meeting the WHO norms of one doctor for every 1,000 people. 

Our rural areas, where majority of the people live, are badly under-served in terms of medical professionals and facilities. Most of the urban areas are served by swanky, state-of-the-art private hospitals, apart from government hospitals.  However, the situation is not the same in the rural areas and this urban-rural divide has to be bridged so that people living in villages are not deprived of timely medical care. In fact, former President, Dr. Abdul Kalam always used to stress upon the need to create urban facilities in rural areas under PURA (provision of urban amenities in rural areas) concept.

Dear students, we have to adopt multi-pronged strategy to improve the well-being of our people. Firstly, budgetary allocations for healthcare have to be stepped up by both the Central Government and various State Governments with focus on addressing infrastructure and manpower shortages. In fact, there has to be a pronounced bias for rural areas in policy making if we have to remedy the situation. Secondly, we need to set up more and more medical, dental and nursing colleges to ensure the availability of well qualified medical professionals. While facilitating the private sector to set up hospitals and colleges, the governments must ensure that the treatment as well as education provided by them is affordable and accessible.

As regards accessing medical care, it is estimated that about 62s per cent of healthcare costs in India are met through out-of-pocket expenses. As a result of high medical expenses, there have been instances where families from lower middle classes and middle classes were driven to penury. Lack of health insurance coverage is the main reason for this situation. I would like to compliment the Union Government for launching Aayushman Bharat and various State Governments for starting similar schemes. I am sure all these schemes will promote the well being of people and prevent poorer sections from slipping into penury.

Of course, the most important of all aspects is preventive healthcare. All stakeholders in the healthcare sector should launch multimedia campaigns to educate people on the dangers of lifestyle diseases. Modern lifestyles are the leading cause for the spurt in non-communicable diseases in the country. Unless people are made to give up physical inactivity, bad dietary habits, harmful use of alcohol and tobacco, the NCDs are bound to rise. From schools to offices, people have to be made aware of the importance of regular physical exercises.  

Finally, as regards medical education, we have to ensure that the faculty constantly upgrades its knowledge and teaching skills. Special refresher courses for faculty need to be conducted wherever required so that the education is in tune with the evolving requirements of the modern society. 

As you all are aware, India was known as ‘Vishwaguru’ in ancient times and the world’s top learning centres like Nalanda, Takshashila, Pushpagiri and Vikramshila were located here. We need to become world leaders in education and reduce brain drain. In this connection, I would like to compliment the Union Government for launching ‘Study in India’ programme to promote India as a destination for higher studies and attract foreign students.

In the modern times, certain aberrations have crept into our social life and we are witnessing barbaric incidents like rapes, female feticides and dowry killings. No civilized society can tolerate such inhuman acts and the most stringent punishments have to be meted out to criminals who perpetrate those crimes. Gender equality must begin at home and girls must not be made to feel inferior to boys or ill-treated. Families play a big role in shaping the attitude of children and boys must be made to treat girls with respect.

Of late, we are witnessing a disturbing trend of young girls committing suicide unable to withstand pressure of studies.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naiud has said that Online Dispute Resolution Mechanism is a laudable initiative to fast-track dispute resolution and it shall go a long way in resolving disputes, attracting more foreign investment by projecting India as an investor-friendly country and strengthen economy. He was addressing the National Conference on ‘Online Dispute Resolution Mechanism’, organized by the Construction Industry Arbitration Council (CIAC), here today. The retired Secretary, Ministry of Law & Justice, Shri P.K. Malhotra and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President complimented the Ministry of Law & Justice for taking the initiative in evolving this system and said this will help courts to concentrate on access to justice to people in better manner. He further said that the rapid development of the Internet and electronic commerce, Online Disputes Resolution has been labeled “a logical and natural step” as it facilitates expeditious resolution of disputes.

The Vice President said that the CIAC has been closely associated with UN Commission on international trade and law. He further said that domestic and international trade and commerce has spurred competition provide more opportunities and imputed risks. The commercial arbitration in India is witnessing a steady transition and it should become more simpler, he added. 

The Vice President said that country like India having a sound legal framework and ease of doing business can become a natural choice for investors. He further said that flagship programs like establishment of Smart Cities in India would require a techno-legal smart dispute resolution mechanism. People should also be made aware of the avenues available, he added.

The Vice President said that Online Dispute Resolution mechanism is the need of the hour keeping the increase of e-commerce and e-businesses in view. He welcomed the measures taken by Ministry of Law and Justice to introduce Online Dispute Resolution through mediation, arbitration and conciliation. This results in saving a lot of time and cost, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It is a pleasure to inaugurate the first National Conference on “Online Dispute Resolution Mechanism” organized by Construction Industry Arbitration Council (CIAC) and their prime partner AICTE. 

With the increase of e-commerce and e-businesses, many disputes arise between parties across borders and Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) is, therefore, the need of the hour. It basically seeks to fast track solutions.

I welcome the measures taken by Ministry of Law and Justice to introduce Online Dispute Resolution through mediation, arbitration and conciliation. I must say that this  is a laudable step to fast track dispute resolution in the country.

The nation has embarked upon an ambitious program of building the physical infrastructure, highways, roads, and other related structures, to enable surface transportation sector. In the next five years, these are likely to cost the nation around Rs.105,000 crore. Housing would need an investment of Rs.65,000 crore, civic services, another Rs.45,000 crore, Core Sector construction and power sector require at least another Rs.200,000 crore. The impact of these investments and the performance of the Construction Industry on the economy of the country cannot, therefore, be overstated.  

Analysis of the causes of delay in contracts shows that the major reasons resulting in time over-runs, and resultant cost over-runs, are the ineffectiveness of Dispute Resolution Mechanism and the penalty clauses in contract documents. Although several modifications have been made in existing arbitration procedures, they have brought little comfort. 

A Survey conducted by Construction Industry Development Council (CIDC) shows that disputes amounting to a large sum ( over Rs. 3, 50,000 crores) are pending with Arbitrators / Conciliators for periods ranging between 2 and 10 years. 

A substantial portion of Plan funds go into construction and the government is rightly disturbed over cost and time over-runs. 

In order to ensure speedy resolution of commercial disputes and facilitate effective conduct of international and domestic disputes, it is necessary to adopt various dispute resolution mechanisms. This shall also encourage foreign investment by projecting India as an investor-friendly country having a sound legal framework and ease of doing business in India

With the rapid development of the Internet and electronic commerce, Online Disputes Resolution has been labeled “a logical and natural step” as it facilitates expeditious resolution of disputes. 

Despite increasing inflow of foreign capital in the Indian economy, India’s potential to attract Foreign Direct Investment from the world has not yet been sufficiently tapped. This is happening because India lags behind other countries in having an effective dispute resolution system. Even flagship programs like establishment of Smart Cities in India would require a techno-legal smart dispute resolution mechanism.

I am happy to note that to provide technical support to  Arbitrators in ODR, CIAC is creating a pool of “Arbitration Systems Specialists” who would be young IT savvy engineers and post-graduates of MBA. I am told that as per projections, at least two lakh jobs would be created in this field in the next three years. It is heartening to see many of the young budding Arbitration Systems specialists in the audience.

 I am glad that the first major online portal for ODR, supported by CIAC and National Highways Authority of India is being launched today. This will help NHAI to expedite dispute resolution and speed up road construction. 

I wish all the very best for the day long deliberations.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that education should not only prepare our youth to face challenges of a technologically-driven knowledge society, but also make them analyze critically and come out with innovative solutions to the problems faced by people. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the IILM University Gurugram Campus from IILM Lodhi Road Campus, here today.

The Vice President said that students should be confident of dreaming big and exploring uncharted territories and remain rooted to our culture, traditions, customs and history. He further said that they should never neglect their parents, mother tongue, motherland and native village. They should always believe in co-existing harmoniously with nature for a better future, he added.

 

The Vice President expressed concern over the global ranking of Indian Universities and said that there are more than 800 universities in the country and none of them figures in the top ranked global institutes.

The Vice President said that merely expanding infrastructure with sleek-looking buildings will not make an institution excellent unless it imparts education of highest standards without compromising on quality. Liberal and interdisciplinary education is must to get a holistic perspective of the increasingly knowledge-centric and interdependent world, he added.

Vice President said that education in silos will not equip students for future. Liberal education with focus on technology, skill development and entrepreneurship will serve well the students, industry and the society, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am extremely delighted to inaugurate IILM University. My best wishes to everyone associated with this institution.

I am also glad to know that the university’s mission is in sync with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to create a New India on the basis of inclusive economic development through education and skill development among students. 

I am sure that IILM University is going to make an important contribution in realizing the dream of an educated and skilled India.

However, it should be remembered that the education of an individual does not end by merely acquiring degrees or employable skills. Education is meant to develop a holistic personality with qualities of head and heart. As Swami Vivekananda had said “Education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man”.

Education should not only prepare our youth to face   challenges of a technologically-driven knowledge society, but also make them analyze critically and come out with innovative solutions to the problems faced by people. They should be confident of dreaming big and exploring uncharted territories.

At the same time, students should remain rooted to our culture, traditions, customs and history. They should never neglect their parents, mother tongue, motherland and native village. They should always believe in co-existing harmoniously with nature for a better future. 

There is a need to revamp and reorient the higher education system in the country to equip students with the demands of knowledge-driven world. While, there are more than 800 universities in the country, it is a matter of concern that none of them figures in the top ranked global institutes. Merely expanding infrastructure with sleek-looking buildings will not make an institution excellent unless it imparts education of highest standards without compromising on quality.

Our universities should move in that direction by making necessary changes in the methods of pedagogy. 

I am glad to learn that the Vision of this University is to be Global, Inclusive and Responsible. Indian civilization has always considered the world as its family (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam). Our commitment to the cause of climate change, solar energy and conserving nature, will hopefully, get reflected in educating students and making them globally responsible citizens. Mahatma Gandhi was foremost proponent of this philosophy of being responsible. His seven sins -Wealth without Work, Pleasure without Conscience, Knowledge without Character, Commerce without Morality, Science without Humanity, Religion without Sacrifice and Politics without Principle – are a guiding principle for shaping the ethical ethos of individuals, society, country and the world.

I hope the university will try to inculcate such values.  The university has to be inclusive given India’s diversity and inequality. While diversity is our strength, the huge inequality poses lots of challenges. Focus on entrepreneurship, technology and skill development will help develop an inclusive, just and equal society. 

Today’s world is becoming increasingly knowledge-centric and interdependent. To get a holistic perspective liberal and interdisciplinary education is must. I am glad to know that University intends to pursue this objective with vigor. Education in silos will not equip students for future. Liberal education with focus on technology, skill development and entrepreneurship will serve well the students, industry and the society.

Information technology coupled with various scientific advances is changing our lives like never before. Therefore, the focus should be on futuristic technologies and students need to be prepared for jobs which do not exist. I am happy to know that students doing a major in fashion or design or economics can also study Artificial Intelligence or robotics at IILM University. We need more and more such multi-disciplinary and multi-skilled youngsters to meet future challenges.

I am happy that you already started an Incubation Center. Entrepreneurship is the need of the hour. Students must be motivated to start their own businesses and not depend on jobs alone. India is a land of entrepreneurs and given the right opportunity our youngsters can excel and create global businesses. With about 65 percent of our population aged below 35 years, we need to take full advantage of this demographic dividend in building a prosperous and inclusive New India and educational institutions like IILM have a pivotal role to play in achieving that goal. 

I am pleased to note that IILM has been part of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Management Education initiative since its inception in 2008. The University’s focus on the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity), and working closely with the UN Global Compact India will allow it to be a responsible provider of higher education

Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, India’s first Vice President, famously said “The true teachers are those who help us think for ourselves”. I hope the university will have such teachers and researchers and it will also create such future teachers which we need in vast numbers.

I wish the university well and may it rise to greater heights in achieving academic excellence.

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that translating “legislative intent” into “programmatic content” and demonstrating to the common citizens what “Surajya” actually looks like in day to day administration, the civil services have an enormous opportunity today. He was delivering the inaugural address at the 2-day event of the 12th Civil Services Day, here today. The Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that a clean, competent, people-friendly, proactive administrative leadership is the need of the hour. He further said that ‘Swarajya’ has to be meaningful for each Indian and, for this ‘Surajya’ is inevitable. There is a need for honest introspection into the effectiveness and efficiency of our administrative structures and processes, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the focus has shifted to “implementation” and “innovation” and it is becoming increasingly clear that “business as usual” approach will not do. We must collectively transform India into a nation that we can all be proud of, he added.

 

The Vice President called on officers of Civil Services to reorient their approach to look upon themselves as catalysts of change, as facilitators of change, as inspirational leaders for an aspirational India. He further said that it is the collective responsibility of the executive, the legislature, the judiciary and the media to identify, combat and root out evils including casteism, communalism, corruption, inequality, discrimination and violence. We need to be sensitive to these unpleasant realities and try to alter them by being unbiased and evenhanded, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

 

“It is indeed a great privilege to be a part of the two day celebration of Civil Services Day and address this gathering of change makers. 

Today is a day of celebration, a day that reaffirmsthe competence, commitment and confidence of the civil services to make a difference to the governance landscape of our country. 

I am happy to be with the officers who are being recognized for their quest for excellence. I compliment them as well as those who are engaged in similar innovative initiatives across the country. 

Our country’s civil services are among the best in the world. 

They constitute the best and the brightest minds of our country.  

They have the ability to absorb new information and knowledge, adapt to a rapidly changing socio-political environment and address the key challenges in contemporary society. 

Many of them have the forward looking, strategic vision to guide policy formulation and the drive to make a difference in service delivery. 

The essential gap today is between the grandiose conception and the ground level implementation. 

There is an urgent need to re-think our existing governance paradigm. 

There is a need for honest introspection into the effectiveness and efficiency of our administrative structures and processes. 

It is this introspection and reflection that has made many civil servants, some of whom are getting awards today, to come up with alternative strategies for improving the system. 

I wish and hope that many more civil servants would also think afresh and keep raising the bar through innovative solutions.  

After all, even for the best, there is always a possibility to become better. 

And there is no better time than now. 

There is an unmistakable air of buoyant optimism today.

The clarion call of the Prime Minister to “Reform, Perform and Transform” has found a rare resonance everywhere.

The focus has shifted to “implementation” and “innovation”. It is becoming increasingly clear that “business as usual” approach will not do.

Age –old institutions like the Planning Commission are being reinvented. The overarching idea is clear. We must collectively transform India into a nation that we can all be proud of.

‘Swarajya’ has to be meaningful for each Indian. And, for this ‘Surajya’ is inevitable. Nothing short of a paradigm shift in governance will be adequate. 

A clean, competent, people-friendly, proactive administrative leadership is the need of the hour. 

Translating “legislative intent” into “programmatic content” and demonstrating to the common citizens what “Surajya” actually looks like in day to day administration, the civil services have an enormous opportunity today, like never before, to serve the country and our people.

With the mantra of ‘Reform, Perform and Transform’ and focusing on ‘Gaon, Garib, Kisan, Mahila aur Yuva’ government has taken up several schemes and programs like Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri, Atal Pension Yojana, Sukanya Sammriddhi Yojana , Ujjwala Yojana, BetiBachao, BetiPadhao ,JAM- Direct Benefit Transfer, Mudra Yojana, Start up India, Stand Up, Skill India, , Swachh Bharat , Housing for all, Ayushman Bharat, Mission Indradhanush, Power for All, Ujala Scheme (Led’s), Make In India, Swadesh Darshan, Smart Cities, Amrut, Hriday, Namami Gange, Sagarmala, Look east, Khelo India,

Government E Market place – GEM to root out corruption in Government Procurements, GST: One Nation, One Tax and may more.

 

All these schemes and programmes are building blocks of a new resurgent India we wish to build, for the renaissance we are ushering in. Effective and timely implementation of these schemes and programmes are huge managerial challenge.  

We have the strength within our country to achieve results. We have only to get our act together. 

As the Vedic sages have said, “Samgachadhvam”, let us walk together. 

As the Prime minister has envisaged, we should work as Team India with people as the main agents of change. 

We must aspire for a new India where everyone will become part in the developmental process and get the fruits of it. 

Civil Services have to reorient their approach to look upon themselves as catalysts of change, as facilitators of change, as inspirational leaders for an aspirational India.

Sisters and Brothers, 

This I said was a renaissance and resurgence. Probably, I should add that this is probably the second renaissance, the first one occurred when India became independent and the all India Services were established.

Modern Indian civil service initially established by the British underwent a metamorphosis after independence. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the chief architect of an integrated India and the visionary ‘Iron’ man who established the ‘steel frame’ of all India services had succinctly envisaged this metamorphosis in his stirring address to the civil service probationers at Metcalfe House in New Delhi on 21st April, 1947:

“The service will now be free to or will have to adopt its true role of national service without being trammelled by traditions and habits of the past; officers must be guided by a real spirit of service in their day-to-day administration, for in no other manner can they fit in the scheme of things.”

This is the expectation expressed by the founder of India’s civil services nearly seventy years ago.  

As we commemorate that extraordinary speech of the great legendary unifier of the country, we need to examine how far we have lived upto those expectations.  

The shift and the transformation that Sardar Patel envisaged was a shift in attitude, a shift in our behavior.  

It is a shift from doing a ‘job’ to ‘serving the people’.  The job has a higher objective, a different yardstick for success. It should have ‘people’ at the centre and it should be done with a “spirit of service”.

The first is ‘empathy’. The civil service is the most visible ‘face’ of the government since citizens contact the civil servants for various services. The government’s image depends to a large extent on the image of the civil service and the manner in which it responds to people’s needs and aspirations. Empathy and courtesy at the cutting edge level can really enhance customer satisfaction. In fact, the hallmark of a well-functioning civil service is the ability to ‘serve’ the citizens with respect and alacrity.

What does this spirit of service to people entail? It necessitates, in my view, a number of attitudinal shifts.  Let me mention just a few important ones. 

First and foremost, it requires us to have the ‘humility’ to hear the voices of the people, the humility to learn from different people and the humility to accept if there are deficiencies.

Second is the ‘agility’, the ability to access information and knowledge and creatively apply them to new situations.  Keeping our eyes and mind open and our ears and feet to the ground, we need to innovate and improvise to suit the life contexts of the people we are serving. 

Third, is to re-define “accountability” and shifting the focus to ‘outcomes’ and not merely concentrating on ‘activities’. If we have to serve the people, we must know what the real concerns are and be able to address them.  We must have the ability to measure our success by the tangible outcomes, by the changes we are able to bring about in the lives of our people. 

In this context, it is good to recall Mahatma Gandhiji’s wise counsel:

“Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man [woman] whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him [her]. Will he [she] gain anything by it? … Then you will find your doubts and yourself melt away.”

When we talk of ‘service to people’, it is good to look at the segmentation of our society and shift our focus towards those segments of people which are marginalized and voiceless.  We ought to be especially attentive to these feeble but important voices. As Dr. B.R. Ambedkar said in his speech to the Constituent Assembly on December 9, 1946:

“If we wish to preserve the Constitution in which we have sought to enshrine the principle of Government of the people, for the people and by the people, let us resolve not to be tardy in the recognition of the evils that lie across our path and which induce people to prefer Government for the people to Government by the people, nor to be weak in our initiative to remove them. That is the only way to serve the country. I know of no better.”

The evils that Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had hinted at are the social evils including casteism, communalism, corruption, inequality, discrimination and violence.  These evils continue to raise their ugly heads in different parts of the country at different times. They are a blot on our country’s history.  

As leaders in country’s governance, it is the collective responsibility of the executive, the legislature, the judiciary and the media to identify, combat and root out these evils.  

We need to be sensitive to these unpleasant realities and try to alter them by being unbiased and evenhanded. This can accelerate the building of a new India, an inclusive India, an integrated India and an innovative India. Sardar Patel’s exhortation to the All India Service probationers, on April 21, 1947, to maintain utmost impartiality in administration is as relevant today as it was then. He cautioned: “A civil servant cannot afford to, and must not, take part in politics. Nor must he involve himself in communal wrangles. To depart from the path of rectitude in either of these respects is to debase public service and to lower its dignity”.

Sisters and brothers,

You, as civil servants, have been the sheet anchor of our democratic polity. You have provided the ‘continuity’ and ‘stability’ we need in governance.  Now, I am happy that you are also revamping the system to induce greater ‘predictability’, ‘accountability’ and ‘agility’. 

We are living in interesting times. On the one hand, we have formidable challenges, some of them seemingly intractable ones.  On the other, we have new frontiers of knowledge, science and technology opening up new possibilities. You are uniquely positioned to find the best fit between the problem and ideal solutions. 

This is, I realize, a constant search because the nature of the problems as well as the range of solutions keep changing very rapidly.  

But, if you keep the constitutional mandate of civil services in view and the larger picture of serving India as the overarching objective of your mission, a lot of good ideas can emerge and get translated into people-centered policies and programmes. 

Sisters and Brothers,

We are an aspirational young democracy, the largest in the world and in the throes of a socio-economic transformation. We need to blend the competencies of diverse stakeholders to achieve a synergistic momentum towards inclusive growth.  

I know that many of you have been thinking and acting on these lines. India needs more of your kind. India needs a civil service that constantly refines itself and delivers the finest service at the cutting edge level effectively and efficiently. 

I am glad that you are conducting a number of sessions today focused on the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Agriculture, Housing, Skilling and Digital Payments. I hope the discussions will lead to substantive recommendations which will help further advance the cause of developing strong responsive public administration and governance systems. I shall be delighted to hear of the outcomes of your deliberations. 

I once again congratulate all the civil servants on their tireless efforts to make our country and our planet a better place to live and work. As our ancient sages have said “Shubhaaste Panthaanah Santu” (Let your path be full of goodness).

Thank You!

Jai Hind!”

The Vice President said that Shri Kedar Nath Sahani was a writer, freedom fighter, social reformer and an icon who inspired others all over his life. He further said that during his long public life, he ensured freedom to his writers or scholars while he was an editor.

The Vice President said that that compilation of letters of Shri Kedar Nath Sahai is an important source of research for younger generation. The Compilation allows to get the author's unbiased personal views on the then political, social scene, he added.

The Vice President lauded the efforts of Shri Sahni in empowering the downtrodden and weaker sections of society and said that he had planned a forum for providing affordable capital to entrepreneurs belonging to downtrodden and weaker sections.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address in Hindi:


डॉ. मुकर्जी स्मृति-न्यास द्वारा केदारनाथ साहनी जी के पत्रों का संकलन 'भवदीय' प्रकाशित करने के लिए, प्रधान संपादक श्री भगत सिंह कोश्यारी जी, संपादक अवनिजेश अवस्थी और सहसंपादक रूद्रेश नारायण मिश्र एवं प्रकाश चंद्र को शुभकामनायें और बधाई देता हूँ।

मुझे ज्ञात हुआ है कि प्रकाशन की प्रेरणा माननीय प्रधानमंत्री नरेन्द्र मोदी जी से मिली। 

मुझे यह भी ज्ञात हुआ है कि पत्रों का संकलन एक कठिन प्रयास रहा जिसके लिए संपादकीय टीम को सुदूर लेह लद्दाख तक यात्रा कर, पत्रों का संकलन करना पड़ा। इन महान प्रयासों के लिए मैं संपादकीय टीम को भी धन्यवाद देता हूँ। 

मैं केदारनाथ साहनी जी के उन सभी सहयोगी साथियों को भी धन्यवाद देता हूँ जिन्होंने इस प्रकाशन के लिए केदारनाथ जी के पत्रों को उपलब्ध करवाया और इस संकलन को समृद्ध बनाया।

अपने लंबे सार्वजनिक जीवन में केदारनाथ जी प्राय: संगठन से जुड़े रहे। उन्होंने अप्रवासी भारतीयों को, उनके पूर्वजों के देश से जोड़ने के लिए 'ओवरसीज फ्रेंडस आफ बीजेपी' संस्था के साथ व्यापक कार्य किया। वे इस संस्था के अंतर्राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष भी रहे। इस क्रम में उन्होंने विदेश में रहने वाले प्रवासी भारतीयों से व्यापक पत्राचार किया था। मुझे हर्ष है कि इंग्लैंड, अमेरीका, केन्या आदि सुदूर देशों से भी साहनी जी के सहयोगियों ने पत्रों को साझा किया है।

पत्रों को विषयों के आधार पर 17 अध्यायों में संकलित किया गया है। इसके अतिरिक्त, साहनी जी द्वारा अंग्रेजी, हिंदी और उर्दू में हस्तलिखित पत्रों की प्रतिलिपियाँ भी संकलन में सम्मिलित की गई हैं। संकलन के दौरान, सहायक संपादकों को साहनी जी के ऐसे सहयोगी भी मिले जिन्होंने साहनी जी से संबंधित मार्मिक संस्मरण सुनाए। ये ऐसे संस्मरण हैं जिनका कोई दस्तावेज नहीं है। फिर भी साहनी जी के विराट व्यक्तित्व, उनकी कार्यशैली और ऐसी विषम परिस्थितियाँ जिनमें उन्होंने कार्य किया, उनका परिचय कराने के लिए इन संस्मरणों को पुस्तक में सम्मिलित किया गया है, जिससे यह संकलन और समृद्ध हो गया है। 

कम लोगों को ज्ञात होगा कि साहनी जी के पिता तत्कालीन ब्रिटिश भारतीय वायुसेना में स्क्वाड्रन लीडर थे। पिता की भाँति पुत्र ने भी भारतीय वायुसेना में कमीशन प्राप्त किया परंतु देश में तत्कालीन सामाजिक और राजनैतिक विप्लव को देखते हुए, वे सेना की नौकरी छोड़ कर राष्ट्रीय स्वयंसेवक संघ के प्रचारक बन गये।

साहनी जी के लंबे सार्वजनिक जीवन का आयाम भी विस्तृत था। उनके सार्वजनिक जीवन का प्रारंभ जम्मू से हुआ। देश के विभाजन और उसके बाद कश्मीर पर कबायलियों के आक्रमण के समय वे जम्मू कश्मीर में राष्ट्रीय स्वयंसेवक संघ के देशसेवा के कार्यों में तत्पर रहे। मुझे ज्ञात हुआ है कि तत्कालीन गृहमंत्री सरदार पटेल के आग्रह पर संघ के सरसंघचालक गोलवलकर जी के साथ साहनी जी भी कश्मीर के महाराजा हरि सिंह से मिले थे और कश्मीर के भारत विलय के विषय में चर्चा की थी।

यद्यपि साहनी जी का जन्म रावलपिंडी में हुआ था, तथापि अपने सार्वजनिक जीवन के आरंभ से ही वे जम्मू कश्मीर से बड़ी निकटता से जुड़े रहे। इसलिए स्वाभाविक है कि इस संकलन में सर्वाधिक पत्र जम्मू-कश्मीर से संबंधित हैं या फिर संगठनात्मक विषयों पर हैं।       

1954 में साहनी जी दिल्ली आ गये थे और दिल्ली में संगठन का कार्य करते रहे। 1959 के चुनावों के बाद, साहनी जी दिल्ली के उपमहापौर बने, जबकि श्रीमती अरूणा आसफ अली महापौर बनीं।

1977 के बाद साहनी जी दिल्ली के मुख्य कार्यकारी पार्षद बने। इसी दौरान दिल्ली को विकट बाढ़ ने ग्रस्त किया। बांध टूटने से पूर्वी दिल्ली के डूबने का खतरा था। ऐसे में मुख्य कार्यकारी पार्षद के तौर पर साहनी जी ने पूर्वी दिल्ली के निचले इलाकों से आबादी को विस्थापित किया। बांध तो टूटा परंतु समय रहते विस्थापन होने के कारण जानमाल की हानि होने से बच गई। 

अपने लंबे सार्वजनिक जीवन में, साहनी जी भारत प्रकाशन के मानद महाप्रबंधक भी रहे। महाप्रबंधक के रूप में साहनी जी ने विद्वान संपादकों की विद्वत् स्वतंत्रता में कभी हस्तक्षेप नहीं किया।

 

इतिहास के शोधकर्ताओं की तरह मेरा भी मानना है कि इस प्रकार के पत्रों का संकलन इतिहास शोध का महत्वपूर्ण स्रोत है जिसमें लेखक द्वारा तत्कालीन राजनैतिक, सामाजिक परिदृश्य पर उसके बेबाक निजी विचार होते हैं। साथ ही यह भी ज्ञात होता हे कि लेखक के सहयोगियों के उन विषयों पर क्या विचार थे।

मैं चाहूँगा कि इस विषय पर शोध करने वाले इस पत्राचार को विद्वत् समाज के सामने लाएं।

इस संकलन में साहनी जी द्वारा लिखे गये ऐसे अनेक पत्र हैं जिनमें उन्होंने कश्मीर के तत्कालीन राज्यपाल, मुख्यमंत्री, तथा तत्कालीन प्रधानमंत्री का ध्यान कश्मीर में पनप रही हिंसा, सुरक्षा बलों की भूमिका, विस्थापितों का पलायन तथा उनकी दयनीय स्थिति जैसे विषयों पर बार-बार आकर्षित किया है।

साहनी जी संगठन के कार्य से प्राय: जम्मू कश्मीर का दौरा करते थे। संवेदनशील राज्य में अपने व्यापक दौरों के दौरान जमीनी तथ्यों को संकलित कर उन्होंने समय-समय पर राज्य तथा केंद्र के नेतृत्व को अवगत कराया। साहनी जी ने राज्य में अपने सहयोगियों और मित्रों का एक विस्तृत दल बनाया था जो समय-समय पर साहनी जी को वहाँ की स्थिति से अवगत कराता था तथा उनसे मार्गदर्शन प्राप्त करता रहता था। उनका यह पत्राचार जम्मू-कश्मीर की स्थिति समझने के लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण स्रोत है।

मित्रों, आज भी कश्मीर की समस्या हमारे लिए एक चुनौती है। वहाँ शांतिपूर्ण वातावरण के लिए हम सभी को सामूहिक प्रयास करने होंगे। साहनी जी जैसे कर्मठ और निष्ठावान कार्यकर्ताओं की पुण्यस्मृति में यही हमारी सच्ची श्रद्धांजलि होगी।

साहनी जी ने दलित एवं कमजोर वर्गों के सशक्तिकरण के लिए सराहनीय प्रयास किये। उन्होंने दलित और कमजोर वर्ग के उद्यमियों को सस्ती पूँजी उपलब्ध कराने के लिए 'चौपाल' नामक योजना प्रारंभ की थी, जिससे इन उद्यमियों को लघु और माइक्रो ऋण 1-2% की मामूली दर पर उपलब्ध कराया जाता था। इस योजना से हजारों उद्यमी लाभान्वित हुए।

इस योजना के लिए पूँजी एकत्रित करने के लिए साहनी जी ने अपने शुभचिंतक सहयोगियों को पत्र लिख कर सहयोग देने का अनुरोध किया। ऐसे कुछ पत्र इस संकलन में सम्मिलित भी किये गये हैं जिनसे इस योजना के पीछे उनके महान मानवतावादी विचार का पता चलता है।  

आज जब देश में लघु उद्यमिता और Start Up जैसे कार्यक्रमों को प्रोत्साहित किया जा रहा है, ऐसे में पूँजी उपलब्ध कराने में साहनी जी की 'चौपाल' योजना का माडल कारगर सिद्ध हो सकता है। 

यह संकलन 80 के दशक के बाद के पत्रों का ही है, जबकि साहनी जी का सार्वजनिक जीवन 1947 के विभाजन के दौर से ही प्रारंभ हो गया था। इस संकलन में 1950 से 70 के दशक तक, जब वे कश्मीर और फिर दिल्ली में कार्यरत रहे, उस महत्वपूर्ण दौर के पत्र सम्मिलित नहीं हैं। अगर संभव हो तो उस कालखंड पर साहनी जी के विचार और दृष्टिकोण का संकलन करने का प्रयास करें।

मैं आदरणीय साहनी जी की पुण्य चिरस्मृति में उनके पत्रों के संकलन 'भवदीय' का लोकार्पण करता हूँ। धन्यवाद।

जय हिंद!”

Following is the text of Vice President’s address in Hindi:

 

“माननीय उपराज्यपाल जी एवं कुलपति, कुरूक्षेत्र विश्वविद्यालय, माननीय मुख्यमंत्री  जी, माननीय शिक्षा मंत्री जी, माननीय उपकुलपति जी, अति विशिष्ट अतिथिगण, कुरूक्षेत्र विश्वविद्यालय के सभी सम्मानित शिक्षकगण, सभी छात्र  एवं छात्राएँ और उपस्थित सम्मानित मित्रों,

कुरूक्षेत्र विश्वविद्यालय के इस 31वें दीक्षांत समारोह के सुअवसर पर आप सभी के बीच उपस्थित होकर मुझे बेहद प्रसन्नता हो रही है।  

यह मेरा सौभाग्य है कि आज मुझे इस पावन कर्मभूमि व गीता की जन्मस्थली में आप सभी के बीच आने का अवसर प्राप्त हुआ है। इस पुण्य भूमि का न केवल हरियाणा राज्य में अपितु संपूर्ण भारतवर्ष  एवं करोड़ों भारतीयों के मानस में एक विशेष स्थान है। 

कुरूक्षेत्र, जिसे गीता में 'धर्मक्षेत्र' की संज्ञा दी गई है, सदियों पुरानी हमारी सभ्यता की सांस्कृतिक, आध्यात्मिक और भौतिक समृद्धि का परिचायक है। कुरूक्षेत्र के इस गौरवशाली इतिहास पर हम सभी भारतवासियों को अत्यंत गर्व है। 

भारतीय जनमानस में गीता के शाश्वत महत्व से हम सभी परिचित हैं। मुझे खुशी है कि हरियाणा सरकार इस महान कृति  की धरोहर को सजो कर रखने के लिए प्रति वर्ष कुरुक्षेत्र में एक अंतर्राष्ट्रीय गीता महोत्सव आयोजित करती है। मुझे ज्ञात हुआ है कि हाल ही में आयोजित किए गए इस महोत्सव के दौरान कुरुक्षेत्र विश्वविद्यालय ने भी गीता पर एक अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सेमिनार का आयोजन किया। 

आप सभी अध्यापकगण तथा छात्र एवं छात्राएँ भाग्यशाली हैं कि पवित्र ब्रह्म सरोवर के दक्षिणी तट पर स्थित इस विश्वविद्यालय के अभिन्न अंग हैं। मुझे पूरा विश्वास है कि आप सभी इस दीक्षांत के पश्चात् भी इस भूमि और इस पर स्थित विश्वविद्यालय से प्राप्त मूल्यों का अनुसरण व प्रचार-प्रसार जीवनपर्यंत करते रहेंगे।

मुझे ज्ञात हुआ है कि इस दीक्षांत समारोह में 1500 से अधिक विद्यार्थी विभिन्न विषयों में उपाधियाँ व अपनी विशेष उपलब्धियों के लिए पदक प्राप्त कर रहे हैं। मैं इन सभी  विद्यार्थियों  को उनके नए जीवन की शुरूआत पर हार्दिक शुभकामनाएँ देता हूँ और आशा करता हूँ कि ये सभी अपने जीवन के उद्देश्यों को पूरा करने में सफल होंगे। साथ ही जिम्मेदार नागरिक के रूप में राष्ट्र निर्माण में सक्रिय भूमिका निभायेंगे।

मुझे यह जानकर हार्दिक प्रसन्नता हुई है कि कुरूक्षेत्र विश्वविद्यालय हरियाणा राज्य का पहला ए-प्लस श्रेणी प्राप्त विश्वविद्यालय है। मानव संसाधन विकास मंत्रालय ने हाल ही में न केवल आपके संस्थान को देशभर के राज्य सरकारों से अनुदान प्राप्त विश्वविद्यालयों की प्रथम श्रेणी  की सूची में रखा है बल्कि उन 60 चुने हुए संस्थानों की सूची में भी रखा है जिन्हें स्वायत्तता प्रदान की गई है। 

मुझे पूर्ण विश्वास है कि कुरूक्षेत्र विश्वविद्यालय भारत सरकार की शिक्षण संस्थाओं को स्वायत्तता प्रदान करने की इस पहल का भरपूर लाभ उठाएगा और आगामी वर्षों में हरियाणा ही नहीं अपितु पूरे देश में एक आदर्श स्वायत्त संस्था के रूप में अपनी पहचान बनाएगा।

1956 में अपनी स्थापना के पश्चात्, कुरूक्षेत्र विश्वविद्यालय ने एक लंबी यात्रा तय की है। किसी भी संस्थान के लिए छ: दशकों से भी अधिक, एक विश्वसनीय व प्रतिष्ठित शिक्षण संस्था के रूप में बने रहना, एक सराहनीय उपलब्धि है। मैं चाहूँगा कि  आप सभी  मिलकर अपने विश्वविद्यालय को आने वाले वर्षों में भारत सरकार के मानव संसाधन मंत्रालय के 'राष्ट्रीय संस्थागत श्रेणी ढांचे' (National Institutional Ranking Framework) की अग्रिम पंक्ति में खड़ा करने का भरपूर प्रयास करेंगे।

जैसा कि आप सभी को ज्ञात है कि भारत सरकार एक नई शिक्षा नीति का निर्माण कर रही है। नई नीति का नारा है ""नई शिक्षा नीति करे साकार - ज्ञान, योग्यता और रोजगार""।  

शिक्षा और उद्योग के बीच एक सीधा संबंध है। इस संबंध को और अधिक कारगर व उपयोगी बनाने की आवश्यकता है। भारत को एक आर्थिक शक्ति के रूप में उभारने के हमारे प्रयास में अच्छे शिक्षण और प्रशिक्षण की महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका है। अच्छे ढंग से शिक्षित और प्रशिक्षित मानव संसाधन,  विशेषकर उच्चतर स्तर पर, देश के आर्थिक विकास के लिए पहली आवश्यकता है। 

मेक इन इंडिया, स्किल इंडिया, स्टार्ट-अप इंडिया तथा स्टैण्ड अप इंडिया जैसी भारत सरकार की महत्वाकांक्षी योजनाओं  के संदर्भ में एक विकसित और संगठित उच्चतर शिक्षा के ढाँचे का होना अति आवश्यक है। इन सभी योजनाओं की दूरगामी सफलता के लिए हमारे देश में उच्च शिक्षा प्राप्त मानव संसाधन की भूमिका निर्णायक होगी। 

21वीं सदी में अनुसंधान, नवरचना और तकनीकी ज्ञान सफलता के मूल मंत्र हैं। एक ज्ञान आधारित समाज की स्थापना की दिशा में हमें इन तीनों की आवश्यकता होगी। इसलिए हमारे शिक्षाविदों और छात्रों को इन तीन मूल मंत्रों को अपनी कार्य संस्कृति का हिस्सा बनाने की जरूरत है।

वर्तमान में भारत विश्व का सबसे युवा देश है। हमारी जनसंख्या लगभग 65 प्रतिशत हिस्सा युवा शक्ति है। इतनी बड़ी संख्या में युवाओं की उपस्थिति किसी भी देश के लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण बात है। समय की माँग है कि हम अपनी जनसंख्या के इस लाभांश (demographic dividend) का सदुपयोग कर अपनी राष्ट्र निर्माण की प्रक्रिया को गति प्रदान करें। इस दीक्षांत समारोह में उपाधियाँ और मेडल प्राप्त करने वाले सभी विद्यार्थी भी इसी लाभांश का अभिन्न अंग हैं। इन सभी के लिए यह दीक्षा का अंत नहीं है, बल्कि निरंतर विकास की सतत यात्रा में एक पड़ाव मात्र है।  इस शिक्षण संस्थान में औपचारिक शिक्षा ग्रहण करने के पश्चात् आप सभी व्यावहारिक जीवन में प्रवेश करने जा रहे हैं जहां आपके द्वारा अर्जित ज्ञान का व्यवहारिक परीक्षण होगा। इस यात्रा में आप अपने लक्ष्यों को प्राप्त करें और राष्ट्र निर्माण में अपना सकारात्मक योगदान दें, ऐसी मेरी मनोकामना है।

जब हम राष्ट्र निर्माण में जनसंख्या के इस लाभांश के प्रयोग की बात करते हैं तो हमें यह भी ध्यान रखना चाहिए कि राष्ट्र निर्माण प्रक्रिया में समाज के सभी वर्गों विशेषकर सामाजिक व आर्थिक रूप से कमजोर वर्गों और महिलाओं की भागीदारी पर भी ध्यान देने की आवश्यकता है। समाज के सभी वर्गों का समग्र विकास राष्ट्र निर्माण का एक आवश्यक पहलू है। 

हम सभी को यह ध्यान रखना होगा कि एक युवा देश के मानव संसाधनों का समुचित उपयोग वर्तमान और आने वाले समय की सबसे बड़ी चुनौती है। हम अपनी युवा पीढ़ी को अगर सही दिशा दे सके तो आने वाले समय में भारत एक विश्व शक्ति के रूप में उभर सकेगा। 

हमारी इस युवा पीढ़ी का आधा हिस्सा हमारी बेटियाँ हैं। बदलते भारत की पहचान बनकर उभर रही हमारी बेटियाँ राष्ट्र निर्माण की प्रक्रिया में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभा रही हैं। अपनी बेटियों को शिक्षा और वह भी गुणवत्तापूर्ण शिक्षा प्रदान करना हमारे समाज  की सबसे बड़ी चुनौतियों में से एक है। इस दिशा में ""बेटी पढ़ाओ-बेटी बचाओ"" अभियान एक मील का पत्थर सिद्ध हुआ है।  

शिक्षा और खेलों के बीच किस प्रकार सांमजस्य स्थापित किया जा सकता है हरियाणा राज्य उसका एक आदर्श उदाहरण है।

औपचारिक शिक्षा के साथ-साथ खेलों को प्रोत्साहन देने के लिए हरियाणा सरकार जो आधारभूत सुविधायें प्रदान करने का प्रयास कर रही है, मैं उसकी प्रशंसा करता हूँ। हाल ही में आस्ट्रेलिया के गोल्ड कोस्ट में संपन्न हुए कॉमनवेल्थ गेम्स में हरियाणा के खिलाड़ियों द्वारा अर्जित की गई ख्याति इस बात का एक और प्रमाण है।  

वर्तमान समय में एक नए भारत के निर्माण की प्रक्रिया जारी है। इस उद्देश्य की पूर्ति के लिए भारत सरकार ने युवाओं  को केंद्र में रखकर विभिन्न योजनाएँ बनाई हैं। मैं युवाओं का आह्वान करता हूँ कि वह अपने उत्साह और ऊर्जा का सही उपयोग करते हुए इन योजनाओं की सफलता के लिए एकजुट होकर कार्य करें तथा एक नए भारत के निर्माण में अपना महत्वपूर्ण योगदान दें। 

वास्तव में हम जब एक नए भारत की बात करते हैं तो हमारा आशय आज के युवा भारत से है। मैं आप सभी युवाओं से आह्वान करता हूँ कि आप इस देश का वर्तमान और भविष्य दोनों ही हैं। आप अपने विश्वविद्यालय, शिक्षकों, अभिभावकों, संस्कृति व मूल्यों पर गर्व करते हुए अपने जीवन के लक्ष्यों को प्राप्त करें। 

नव भारत का निर्माण आप कर सकते हैं। प्राचीन भारत की ज्ञान संपदा से प्रेरणा लेकर भविष्य की भव्य भारती को साकार बनाने की क्षमता आप में है। सारा जीवन वास्तव में कुरूक्षेत्र है, धर्म क्षेत्र है। काम करना अनिवार्य है। काम अच्छी तरह, कुशलता से करेंगे तो वह “योग” बन जाता है। जब जीवन में रास्ता चुनना पड़ता है तब आप धर्म के रास्ते को चुनिए। सच्चाई, ईमानदारी और भलाई का रास्ता चुनिए।

विद्या हमें विनयशील बनाना चाहिए, योग्य व्यक्तित्व को विकसित कराना चाहिए, सक्षम बनने का साधन बनना चाहिए, इस क्षमता को विश्व को सुंदर, समृद्ध, समरस बनाने का संस्कार हमें देना चाहिए। यही भगवद् गीता और अन्य भारतीय तत्वचिन्तन के मूल अंश रहे हैं। इन विचारों से प्रेरणा लेकर एक नए भारत की परिकल्पना करके आविष्कृत कीजिए।

मैं आप सभी को सफल व उद्देश्यपूर्ण भविष्य के लिए शुभकामनाएँ देता हूँ। एक बार फिर आप सभी को इस दीक्षांत समारोह के लिए बधाई देता हूँ।

जय हिंद!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said that India must equip farmers with knowledge, insights and products. He was addressing the Valedictory Session of the One Day State Level Workshop on Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture for Doubling of Farmer’s Income” organized by the Government of Manipur and the Central Agricultural University, in Imphal, Manipur today. The Governor of Manipur, Dr. Najma Heptulla, the Chief Minister of Manipur, Shri N. Biren Singh, the Minister for Agriculture & Animal Husbandry, Shri V. Hankhanlian and others dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

Vice President said that water conservation is crucial for sustainable agriculture, and said that there is an urgent need to conserve resources. He further said that, in his view, not only should we construct ponds for water conservation but also convert these artificial water storage structures into active fresh water ecosystems which in turn will be biodiversity spots for the aquatic wealth of the state, he added.

The Vice President said that global warming is real and is affecting our lives in every way. He further said that it should be our endeavour to sustain the agricultural production by mitigating the effects of global warming while conserving the biodiversity in ways that are sustainable. You must ‘dialogue’ with farmers, ‘discover’ new products and practices and ‘disseminate’ new insights and knowledge for development, he added.

The Vice President said that agriculture sector needs a big boost in India and efforts are needed to make it sustainable, economical and attractive.  We need to focus on the farmer’s incomes as well as on the farm productivity and long term environmental sustainability, he added.

The Vice President said that best practices from the traditional farming with the latest know-how can play vital role in improving productivity in agriculture. He further said that apart from intensification of agriculture, we must go in for greater diversification. Farmers should be encouraged to go in for a greater variety of alternative crops like high value fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am really happy to be with all of you today.

The state of Manipur, which is referred to as Jewel of the East by the first Prime Minister of India Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, is true to its core a jewel. The state is in the Eastern Himalayas which is one of the ten biodiversity hot spots of the world.  Though the state is geographically small, it has a number of natural endowments. It is bestowed with varied geographical and climatic regions which have helped in evolving a great array of diverse species of both flora and fauna. Even the ethnic diversity is striking.

The people of Manipur have not only realized the importance of biodiversity but it is heartening that they have been helping conserve this unique boon given by nature. 

The unique black scented rice of Manipur or the perennial vegetables, the tree bean or the tree tomato and many fruits which are endemic speak volumes about the diversity of the flora. Siroy lily the state flower is unique to the State of Manipur. The aqua diversity is also unique. Pengba fish, the most favorite fish in Manipur, is also endowed with several medicinal benefits. The floating islands on the largest fresh water lake of North East India are also home to several unique aquatic fauna and the forest adjoining the lake is the home of the state animal “Sangai”.

The state is also fortunate to receive very heavy rainfall throughout. 

Agriculture has been and continues to be the main occupation of the majority of Manipuris. Over millennia, the farmers have developed agricultural production systems which blended well with nature and maintained the ecological balance. 

The agricultural production is largely organic because it is based on traditional methods therefore making it highly organic in nature. The tribes in the hilly region still follow Jhum cultivation which in its natural way does not adversely affect the natural resources. In recent times, however, reduced rotational periods of jhuming (Jhum cycle) is putting pressure on the natural resources. 

I am told that the rotation has come down to 3 to 4 year cycle from its traditional 12 year cycle. This has its ramifications and negative impact on the environment. The changing weather pattern with reduced rainfall (which is almost 50% compared to 3 decades earlier) with its erratic distribution is partly ascribed to this reduced Jhuming cycle. 

It would be important to study this problem and find a practical solution to ensure sustainability of the production systems as well as address social issues like improving the socio economic status of the jhum farmers. Alternate economic activities should be developed so that the jhum farmers are encouraged to lengthen the jhum cycles and ultimately bring them to the earlier length of 12 years or even more. 

Sisters and Brothers, 

Adoption of modern agricultural methods is still rudimentary in Manipur and there is a need for bringing the state of the art knowledge and agricultural skills to the farmers’ doorsteps. 

I am happy that Central Agricultural University and the ICAR Regional Centre at Imphal have developed several useful farmer friendly technologies which have a great potential to boost the agricultural production of the region while conserving the mother nature.  This knowledge must reach all farmers. The department of agriculture therefore has a greater role in transferring this accumulated treasure of knowledge to the farmers for adoption. In my view, the extension activities of the department of agriculture should be geared up to step up the process of dissemination of this accumulated knowledge. 

Sisters and Brothers, 

We must blend the best practices from the traditional farming with the latest know-how. Central Agricultural University, ICAR and IBSD have a great role to play. They should maintain the diverse collection of rice germplasm so that they are available for the development of varieties blending with location specific genes.The Central Agricultural University and ICAR should also develop organic pesticides using local flora so that the pests are controlled without the use of toxic chemicals. This will reduce the pollution of the precious soil and water bodies. 

Along with sustainable agriculture, we need to focus on using our water resources also in an optimal fashion.  Although the state is bestowed with good rainfall, there is an urgent need to conserve these resources. In my view, not only should we construct ponds for water conservation but also convert these artificial water storage structures into active fresh water ecosystems which in turn will be biodiversity spots for the aquatic wealth of the state.

When we talk of biodiversity and its conservation, we should also address the global warming and its effect on biodiversity of the region. Global warming is real and is affecting our lives in every way. It should therefore be our endeavour to sustain the agricultural production by mitigating the effects of global warming while conserving the biodiversity in ways that are sustainable. 

Sisters and Brothers,

Agriculture sector needs a big boost today.  We should make it sustainable, economical and attractive.  We need to focus on the farmer’s incomes as well as on the farm productivity and long term environmental sustainability.

Enhancing productivity is important. Providing quality seeds of high yielding varities of crops to farmers at the right time and increased farm mechanization will be helpful. The Agricultural University can be a catalyst in this transformation. 

Apart from intensification of agriculture, we must go in for greater diversification. Farmers should be encouraged to go in for a greater variety of alternative crops like high value fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants.  

Allied occupations like dairy and aquaculture add to the farmer’s incomes and cushion them against the uncertainties of traditional agriculture. Infact, the entire agriculture sector must be seen in an integrated manner. The post-harvest operations, warehousing, cold storage, marketing and food processing, credit and insurance facilities are interlinked parts of the larger eco-system.  We must effectively strengthen these linkages. 

Efforts should also be made to conserve the endangered Manipuri cattle and pony which are unique to this region. Also, simultaneously there has to be a constant research on improving the breeds of dairy animals, poultry birds, fish and duck suitable for the region.

I am happy to participate in this State level Workshop that has focused on themes that are close to my heart.  

I have always held that agriculture has been at the heart of our culture.  Most of our festivals and folksongs have roots in the agricultural practices. 

We must rejuvenate agriculture, preserve our culture, conserve nature, reform our work culture. If we can do this we can transform our future.  

We need to create our tomorrow through our actions today.  You have the ‘Manis’, the ‘jewels’ in your state in the form of the vast natural and human resources.  Let us celebrate and conserve the rich diversity nature has endowed you with and add further shine to the already splendid nature’s treasures. 

I wish you all success in your collective endeavors. 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that there is a need to create health coverage schemes that provide widest coverage to the young, aged and infirm and those suffering from both critical acute and chronic ailments. He was addressing the gathering after launching the Atal Amrit Abhiyan by Assam Government, which seeks to provide access to quality medical care to 3.2 crore people, in Guwahati, Assam today. The Governor of Assam, Prof. Jagadish Mukhi, the Chief Minister of Assam, Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, the Minister for Health & Family Welfare, Assam, Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President called on the private sector to supplement the efforts of the government in a big way in reaching out medical care to the people in rural areas. He further said that quality of health services should be good enough to improve the health of those receiving services. People should be protected against financial-risk, ensuring that the cost of using services does not put people at risk of financial harm, he added.

The Vice President said that modern day lifestyle is leading to various non-communicable diseases and said that efforts are needed to arrest the growing incidence of such disease which is affecting even the young.  There has to be concerted efforts from all stakeholders in healthcare to raise awareness among the people on the dangers of leading sedentary lifestyles, eating junk food, harmful use of alcohol and tobacco, he added.

The Vice President stressed on the need to change school curriculum include lessons on NCDs and physical exercises should be made mandatory for school and college students. Wherever possible, yoga asanas should also be taught to children, he added.

The Vice President said that north-eastern States like the rest of India are facing shortage of medical manpower and medical facilities in rural areas. This shortage has to be bridged by opening more medical colleges and setting up more number of healthcare facilities in the rural places, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

"" I am extremely pleased to launch Assam Government’s Atal Amrit Abhiyan, one of the largest health cover schemes, which seeks to provide access to quality medical care to 3.2 crore people.

I would like to compliment the Assam government for initiating this scheme with the objective of providing health cover to 92 per cent of the State’s population by including BPL and APL ( above poverty line with an annual income up to Rs. 5 lakh) families. I am told that those covered by the scheme will get quality tertiary medical care for six specialties requiring hospitalization for surgeries and therapies. They will be getting the medical care through an empanelled network of hospitals—public and private hospitals within and outside the State.

I am also told that 438 procedures with the six specialties have been approved for treatment in empanelled network hospitals. The six disease groups identified for financial support are:  Cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, neurological disorder, neonatal diseases and burns. The enrolment is free for those from BPL families while members from APL families will have to pay a nominal sum of Rs.100 for enrolment and renewal.

As you all are aware, out of pocket medical expenses make up about 62% of all healthcare costs in India. This is extremely high and leads to catastrophic financial, social and emotional consequences, often reducing our poor and low income families to penury.

According to a new report from the World Bank and the WHO, at least half of the world’s population cannot obtain essential health services. And each year, large number of households is being pushed into poverty because they must pay for health care out of their own pockets. Currently, world over 800 million people spend at least 10 percent of their household budgets on health expenses for themselves, a sick child or other family member.

It is estimated that the number of Indians falling below the poverty line (BPL) due to health spending may run as high as 63 million people: almost 7% of the nation’s population. The need of the hour is to safeguard people from this catastrophic health care expenditure while providing comprehensive care at the time of need.

India is embarking on an ambitious target of achieving Universal Health Coverage by ensuring equitable access for all Indian citizens, regardless of income level, social status, gender, caste or religion.

The aim is to provide affordable, accountable, appropriate health services of assured quality (promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative) as well as public health services to individuals and populations, with the government being the guarantor and enabler, although not necessarily the only provider, of health and related services.

Achieving universal health coverage is the goal of most countries. WHO stated that UHC embodies three objectives: “Equity in access to health services - everyone who needs services should get them, not only those who can pay for them; The quality of health services should be good enough to improve the health of those receiving services; and people should be protected against financial-risk, ensuring that the cost of using services does not put people at risk of financial harm”.

Therefore, there is a need to create health coverage schemes that provide widest coverage to the young, aged and infirm and those suffering from both critical acute and chronic ailments.

Sisters and brothers, India is facing a peculiar twin burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. While, we have done fairly well in eradicating some of the communicable diseases like polio and tetanus, we cannot remain complacent and must continue the fight against all communicable diseases with renewed vigour, especially MDR-TB, which is posing a major health concern. Similarly, we cannot lower our guard against HIV and the opportunistic infections caused by it due to weakened immune systems.

At the same time, we have to arrest the growing incidence of various non-communicable diseases, which are affecting even the young--diabetes, heart ailments, stroke, cancers, obesity and chronic respiratory diseases. Modern day lifestyle is leading to NCDs, which surprisingly are not confined to urban areas alone.

There has to be concerted efforts from all stakeholders in healthcare to raise awareness among the people on the dangers of leading sedentary lifestyles, eating junk food, harmful use of alcohol and tobacco. The school curriculum should include lessons on NCDs and physical exercises should be made mandatory for school and college students. Wherever possible, yoga asanas should also be taught to children. According to WHO, the NCDs are the world’s largest killer with an estimated 38 million deaths annually. Of them, 16 million are premature deaths (under 70 years of age).

Therefore, it is important to minimize the risk factors to reduce the deaths caused by NCDs.

The National Family Health Survey IV shows that about 29.8 per cent children below the age of 5 years in Assam are underweight, while 35.7 children between 6-59 months are anaemic. The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) in Assam stands at 44 per 1,000 live births as against national average of 37. The Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) is 300 per 1,00,000 live births as against the national average of 167. I am sure the Assam government is taking the needed measures to   bring down IMR and MMR further.

The north-eastern States like the rest of India are facing shortage of medical manpower and medical facilities in rural areas. This shortage has to be bridged by opening more medical colleges and setting up more number of healthcare facilities in the rural places. Besides, there is also a need to impart training to more number of para-medical personnel. One of the ways to address this problem is to make it mandatory for MBBS graduates to serve in rural areas. Doctors, who serve in rural areas should be given preference in admission to PG medical courses.

Sisters and Brothers, India has less than one doctor for every 1,000 population, which is below the WHO norm. The doctor-population ratio is estimated to be 0.62:1 as per current population, while the number of hospital beds is estimated to be 0.5 per 1,000 people.

The private sector must supplement the efforts of the government in a big way in reaching out medical care to the people in rural areas.

While there is every need to increase health insurance penetration in India, I am happy that the Government has recently announced Aayushman Bharat to provide health cover to 10 crore families and plans to set up 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres. Ayushman Bharat is aimed at providing affordable healthcare to 500 million economically deprived people and will cost the exchequer Rs.12,000 crore annually.

I am sure Atal Amrit Abhiyan will be dovetailed with Ayushman Bharat to increase the well being of the people of Assam.

Before concluding, I would like to once again compliment the Assam Government for launching this innovative scheme by including 438 procedures within six specialties. However, I would like to caution the government to monitor its implementation with a hawk eye as there is a danger of its misuse by those implementing it.

JAI HIND!""

The Vice President said that Science and Technology can make farmers get more income and enable them to optimally utilize resources like soil and water. Technology can also help protect forest wealth, reduce pollution and help us lead healthier lives, he added.

The Vice President said that one must strive to be among the leaders in the field, accessing applying and adding to the wealth of scientific knowledge. We need to continuously draw inspiration from this lineage and forge ahead in the current world which is witnessing phenomenal changes mediated by science and technology, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to be with all of you at the CSIR – North East Institute of Science and Technology in Jorhat. 

I am glad to note the tremendous work done by this Institute right from its inception in 1961 as a multi-disciplinary laboratory harnessing science for development. 

Glancing at the 120 technologies developed by you, I am impressed at the wide range of activities taken up by you in the fields of biological sciences, material sciences, geo-sciences, engineering sciences and chemical sciences. 

You have researched and come up with healthcare herbal formulations like anti-lung cancer, anti-arthritis and anti-fungal products as well as mosquito repellents.  

I am happy that your research findings have great relevance to farmers. The bio-organic fertilizer and bacterial formulations for crop enhancement and yield improvement as well as bio-remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soil can contribute to enhanced farm productivity. 

I am equally impressed by the ‘Aroma Mission’ you have undertaken since 2017.  This will bring significant value addition to the existing agricultural practices in the region and augment farmers’ incomes.  This is an initiative that holds great promise and needs to be pursued with great zeal and devotion in the next few years. 

Your research into seismicity of the north east region and your networking of 27 seismic stations is generating valuable data that will be most useful for hazard communication and disaster preparedness.

Institutes like yours have a vital role in ensuring that science and technology brings tangible benefits to the people of our country. 

You have undertaken a challenging mission and you are doing a commendable job. I notice that you are not only focussing on research and product development but also on training and skill development.  

Your training programmes on mushroom cultivation, vermin compost production, weaving and textile products manufacturing and banana fibre extraction can transform the agrarian economy in many ways. 

In keeping with the spirit of ‘Antyodaya’ you have taken up science and technology interventions to improve the nutritional status of women and children in underserved areas.

I congratulate the Director and the entire team for making significant progress in your mission.  The north eastern region has vast natural resources and incredible bio-diversity.  If we can tap into the power of science and technology, we can add considerable value to existing occupation and processes. 

Science and technology has a powerful transformational potential.  

It can make farmers get more income, it can enable us to optimally utilize the scarce natural resources like soil and water, it can help protect forest wealth, it can reduce pollution, it can make us lead healthier lives. 

I am happy that scientists like you are working hard to push the frontiers of science and technology still further.  

We are a country with long, illustrious scientific heritage. 

We need to continuously draw inspiration from this lineage and forge ahead in the current world which is witnessing phenomenal changes mediated by science and technology.  

We must strive to be among the leaders in the field, accessing applying and adding to the wealth of scientific knowledge. 

I wish you all success in this noble endeavour. The new India we are dreaming of will be built in the laboratories like yours which connect science with societal development.  So as long as you keep this connection alive, you will stay relevant, you will stay energized and take up newer challenges with each passing day.  

My greetings to each one of you on your achievements and best wishes for your continued success. 

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said that innovative practices must come into farm sector to make it sustainable and profitable. He was addressing the inauguration of year long Golden Jubilee Celebrations of Assam Agricultural University, in Jorhat, Assam today. The Governor of Assam, Shri Jagadish Mukhi, the Minister for Agriculture, Assam, Shri Atul Bora and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that achieving self sufficiency in the pulses and oilseed sector is challenge before the country. I am sure that with the dedication demonstrated by our agriculturists and the cutting edge research being conducted in our laboratories, we will achieve self sufficiency even in these two crops soon, he added.  

The Vice President said that India needs to respond effectively to the changing needs of our farm sector for a sustained food security. He further said that contemporary realities like climate change, fatigued soil health, diminishing water resources and endangered bio-diversity are affecting the farm sector. Farming profession is becoming increasingly uneconomical and, therefore, unattractive, he added. 

The Vice President said that fewer people than earlier are now opting for agriculture. We need highly skilled and motivated human resources, persons who will think out of box and institutions that will foster innovation, he added.

The Vice President called on scientists and governments to encourage farmers to diversify and take up allied activities like poultry, dairy and fisheries adding that increase only production may not encourage people to join farming. He further said that there a big unmet demand for dairy and meat products in the entire north eastern region and there is a need to turn this challenge into an opportunity. Farmers who toil on the farms should be empowered with knowledge, financial credit, warehousing and insurance facilities and we need to re-think and revitalize agricultural education and research, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It is indeed a great pleasure for me to be a part of the Golden Jubilee year celebration programme of Assam Agricultural University. It is a joyous moment that marks fifty years of glorious journey of this institution.

I have been informed that this was the only agricultural university for the entire NE region till the year 1988 when the Central Agricultural University was established. Even with that university in place now, Assam Agricultural University still continues to welcome students not only from the region but also from the country and overseas. 

It is heartening to know that students from 7 different countries are pursuing their higher studies in this university and that the students from this university are availing foreign fellowships enabling them to study in 6 European universities. 

I am happy to note that this university has developed as many as 113 different crop varieties, 2 animal varieties and 1 poultry breed in the last 50 years. 

I am delighted at the rapid progress being made by this university making it one of the top 100 institutions of India. 

What is most remarkable is the fact that the University has opened its doors to the farming community and is working hand in hand with the farmers supporting them in their efforts to augment productivity and profitability. I complement and congratulate each one of you for your contribution to the growth of agriculture sector over the last five decades. 

However, we in this country, have a long and arduous journey ahead to be undertaken in collaboration with all stakeholders. There are numerous challenges we need to collectively address in our country.  You must build on your past achievements and address these new challenges and tap into newer opportunities. We, as a country, have come a long way from being food deficient country six decades back to a country that has achieved substantial home grown food security. One of our challenges now is to achieve self sufficiency in the pulses and oilseed sector. I am sure that with the dedication demonstrated by our agriculturists and the cutting edge research being conducted in our laboratories, we will achieve self sufficiency even in these two crops soon.  

All of us are aware that for our sustained food security, we need to respond effectively to the changing needs of our farm sector. These needs are emerging out of contemporary realities like climate change, fatigued soil health, diminishing water resources and endangered bio-diversity. Most significantly, the farming profession is becoming increasingly uneconomical and, therefore, unattractive. Fewer people than earlier are now opting for agriculture. In order to meet these challenges effectively, we need highly skilled and motivated human resources, persons who will think out of box and institutions that will foster innovation.  

  Over the last decade and half, the agriculture sector in Assam is marching ahead slowly but steadily. 

Presently, I believe it is growing at around 5 percent. Rice production increased from 3.8 million tonnes in 2001-02 to 5.2 million tonnes in 2016-17. This is still far below its potential of 12 million tonnes. Similarly, pulses production increased from 0.85 lakh tonnes to 1.08 lakh tonnes and Oilseed from 1.56 lakh tonnes to 2.15 lakh tonnes during the same year. While the state is self sufficient in rice, special efforts are needed for increasing production of oilseeds and pulses. I understand that wheat is not a popular crop with farmers of this state. The production is only 0.34 lakh tonnes though there is a demand for around 6 lakh tonnes. Apparently, a great scope exists in the wheat sector.  The university, state government and the farmers have to work collaboratively to realize the potential. 

Sisters and Brothers, 

We need to not only increase production but also encourage farmers to diversify and take up allied activities like poultry, dairy and fisheries. 

There is apparently a big unmet demand for dairy and meat products in your State as well as the entire north eastern region. I am told that there is about 60 percent milk deficiency, 80 percent egg deficiency and around 70 percent meat deficiency in Assam itself.  

We need to turn this challenge into an opportunity. 

I am happy that the government led by your Chief Minister, Sri Sarbananda Sonowalji, has planned to focus on animal husbandry and revitalize it. This is, in my view, the need of the hour.  Farmers should be encouraged to diversify and take up allied activities to cushion them against uncertain and uneven returns from farming. 

Along with supplementation of farm income, farmers should be given the encouragement and technical know- how to grow horticultural crops like fruits, vegetables, spices and plantation crops like areca nut, and floriculture. I recognize that some significant progress has already been made in this direction in your State.

Your land is the ‘Sonar Assam’, the golden Assam, a land of fertile lands, adequate rainfall and rich bio-diversity. 

These rich natural resources must be used optimally and sustainably to generate wealth.  

The farmers who toil on the farms should be empowered with knowledge, financial credit, warehousing and insurance facilities. They need to be provided the ‘know-how’ and ‘do-how’ to improve the farm productivity. That’s what the universities are expected to provide.  We need to ensure that they do so even more efficiently in the years to come.  We need to re-think and revitalize agricultural education and research. 

Sisters and Brothers, 

Knowledge makes all the difference. The educational institutions must generate new ideas, extend the frontiers of scientific knowledge and search for practical solutions to challenging problems. 

You must equip farmers with these knowledge, insights and products. You must ‘dialogue’ with farmers, ‘discover’ new products and practices and ‘disseminate’ new insights and knowledge.  This process of dialoguing, discovering and disseminating is a continuous pathway to excellence and greater professional heights. 

There have been many advances in farming practices like precision farming, vertical farming, hydroponic/ aeroponic farming and robotic farming. We must see if these innovations can be tried out in your state and in the regional context.  We must also simultaneously examine and re-discover promising practices that the farmers are already adopting on their farms. 

Sisters and Brothers,

India has a great heritage of agricultural science and has been the originator of path breaking discoveries over the last millennium. We have a responsibility to continue this scientific tradition. Young agricultural scientists will have to be encouraged to research and innovate. The universities must nurture young talent and mentor the students. Adequate opportunities for learning from the field and the ability to communicate research findings to the farming community must be an integral part of the curriculum. 

Our mother earth is a treasure house, a truly remarkable source of our sustenance. We must have the knowledge and wisdom to use this treasure for our livelihood and well being.  We must protect and preserve, rejuvenate and renew our natural resources. Agricultural universities like yours have an important role to play in making farming attractive, innovative and sustainable. 

You have been doing wonderful work in the last 50 years. I wish you many more successful years ahead in the service of the farming community and humanity at large.  

May your efforts be crowned with greater successes as you stretch your arms towards perfection and excellence. 

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu advised the Management Students to possess strong character, uncompromising honesty and integrity. He was addressing the 9th Convocation of Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Shillong, Meghalaya today. The Governor of Meghalaya, Shri Ganga Prasad, the Home Minister of Meghalaya, Shri James K. Sangma and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

 

The Vice President said that complete degeneration of values and the absence of fear of law are obviously leading to deviant and crooked behavior among the people. He further said that it is important to adhere to values of honesty, integrity, truthfulness and adopt the best practices. Corporate ethics should not be violated, he added.

 

The Vice President advised the students to remember the seven sins mentioned by Mahatma Gandhi - wealth without work, pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce without morality, science without humanity, religion without sacrifice and politics without principle. He further advised the students to possess strong character, uncompromising honesty and integrity, ethical values, patience and a sense of gratitude as they further their career prospects. Never forget that you will not only impact the lives of people in your organizations but also the lives of many others, who depend on the livelihood of your direct employees, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the qualities like gratitude, empathy and concern for fellow human beings seem to be missing in the modern world of materialism and consumerism and one must develop an attitude of caring and sharing. The quality of product, efficient service and ethical business practices are the hallmark of a positive global brand. Every decision taken by you as a thought leader should bear testimony to these qualities, he added.

 

The Vice President said that education is not only for employment, but also for enlightenment and empowerment. He has also asked management institutions like IIMs to give priority to research publications. Step up focus on research, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""It is a pleasure and privilege for me to be with you today at IIM, Shillong. Thank you Shri Shishir Kumar Bajoria, Chairman, Board of Governors, IIM, Shillong and Professor Amitabha De, Director, IIM, Shillong for this opportunity to be in the North East and at IIM, Shillong on this convocation day of the Institute.

 

My congratulations to the graduates, fellows, medal winners and their families! Earning a Post Graduate Diploma in Management and Fellow in Management from a premier institution like IIM, Shillong is an important milestone in your life. You will be treading a different path from now on. You will be applying the knowledge and skills you had acquired in this hallowed institution in real life situations to face new challenges and solve business problems that the corporate world expects of you. 

 

The education imparted to you over the years, the tough competitions you had faced, your hard work, the long hours of study you had put in and the knowledge acquired –all these had helped you to be what you are today. Apart from your knowledge, analytical  abilities and skills, you will need to possess strong character, uncompromising honesty and integrity, compassion, ethical values, patience and a sense of gratitude as you chart new and unexplored frontiers to further your career prospects. These qualities will not only help the Corporate India to flourish but contribute to building Brand India in global forums.

 

I want to touch upon your future role as a leader for Brand India--as a leader in a fast developing economic power with social and demographic challenges, your behavior must be exemplary through the display of highest moral and ethical standards. People always look up to leaders in different fields and when you assume the role of a leader of Brand India, you should become the trendsetter and a role model for others to emulate. You should make India proud.

 

This is all the more important in the wake of the recent bank scams in the country. Such scams will tarnish the image of the country. Why have such scams increased over the years? Complete degeneration of values and the absence of fear of law are obviously leading to deviant and crooked behavior among the people. Therefore, it is important to adhere to values of honesty, integrity, truthfulness and adopt the best practices. Corporate ethics should not be violated. Here, I would like you to always remember the seven sins mentioned by Mahatma Gandhi—wealth without work, pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce without morality, science without humanity, religion without sacrifice and politics without principle. 

  

Dear students, there is no finishing line to learning—it is a continuous process, in fact it’s a life-long process. Try to be erudite, but polite; creative but responsive; innovative but evocative. Be humane, inclusive and environmentally-conscious. You should also be socially conscious with a national outlook. Since most of you will be working for various businesses or commercial enterprises, the need to view every important decision or project from ecological and humanitarian angles is as important as it is from an economic angle.

 

This is all the more important when lands are acquired for new projects displacing people. Development and people’s welfare must go hand-in-hand. 

 

These days, all of us are experiencing the adverse impact of global warming and the resultant climate change. Frequency of extreme weather events is increasing—the message is loud and clear—we should never tinker with nature. We should protect nature and promote culture for a better future. That is my advice to all of you. We have to go back to our roots—traditions, culture and customs so that we can pass on to our future generations a planet of peace, plenty and prosperity. 

 

So what does it mean to each of you as you graduate from IIM, Shillong?  I have been told that Late Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, belovedly known to you as “Kalam Sir”, while giving lectures here, used to ignite your minds to dream for an India that would not only occupy a prime place in the world but would also to take care of the people living at the bottom of the pyramid.

 

I believe, this is what is needed. We all should develop an attitude of caring and sharing. Somehow, qualities like gratitude, empathy and concern for fellow human beings seem to be missing in the modern world of materialism and consumerism. In the olden days,  we used to have joint family system and as result of living with members of a larger family—grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and siblings, the children used to automatically develop caring and sharing attitude. 

 

Dear students, India is on the rise and there will be opportunities galore for youngsters like you. Just a few days ago, the Asian Development Bank stated that India’s economy will grow at 7.3 per cent this fiscal and expected to grow at 7.6 per cent next year, making India the fastest growing Asian economy. The Chief Economist of ADB was quoted as saying that despite short-term costs, the benefits of reforms such as the recently implemented GST will propel India’s future growth. Robust FDI flows attracted by liberalized regulations and the government steps to improve the ease of doing business will further bolster growth, he had said. 

 

I would also like to remind all of you that about 200 years ago India’s contribution to world GDP was 27 per cent. From 10th to 14th century, India was leading the world economy. Following repeated foreign invasions and the British rule, our economy lost its dominant position and remained in a state of decline for many years. In the field of education too, India was known as ‘Vishwaguru” and people from all over the world used to come and study at ancient centres of learning like Nalanda and Takshashila. Today, India is predominantly young as 65 per cent of people are below the age of 35 years. We need to convert this rich human capital into a ‘demographic dividend’ and make India the knowledge and economic hubs of the world.

 

I am sure, prestigious institutions like IIMs will give priority to research publications. There is a need for management institutions to step up focus on this aspect, According to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) for the year 2018, India’s overall share in world publications is only about 4 per cent. Of the total 83,09,449 research publications in 2016-17, only 3,36,978 are from India. In the management discipline, the share is just two per cent. 

 

I am told that during your study at IIM, Shillong you have not only learned the various development models and the policy related issues, which are key for the economic growth of a nation in particular and world in general, but that you have also been taught that the development should be sustainable in the long run. There is no “one size fits all” formula and India needs to have an economic model that specifically suits its requirements. 

 

I am sure that you must have also learned the nuances of managing business in a globalised world. Your career will bring you in contact with businesses and peers from across the globe. Your products and services will find global customers. As you interact with the world, show your leadership that represents modern India. You need to take on the challenges and shoulder responsibilities to transform India into a global economic power. Please keep in mind that the quality of product, efficient service and ethical business practices are the hallmark of a positive global brand. Every decision taken by you as a thought leader should bear testimony to these qualities. 

 

India has progressed on multiple fronts in the last few  decades. But we are still saddled with many challenges like poverty, illiteracy, social discrimination, atrocities against the weaker sections and women, lack of sanitation, imbalanced development with rural areas lagging far behind their urban counterparts. We need to overcome these challenges and build a prosperous, inclusive new India. We need to progress faster.

 

I am sure IIM, Shillong must have instilled in you the zeal to work diligently and with passion to create wealth. Change cannot be effected by the government alone. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have to play a key role in making India a strong economic power. 

 

All of you must understand that you are among the privileged few, who got an opportunity to study in one of the premier management Institutes of the country. Equipped with new management skills, knowledge and ideas, you can become entrepreneurs and create jobs instead of seeking jobs. 

 

Never forget that you will not only impact the lives of people in your organizations but also the lives of many others, who depend on the livelihood of your direct employees. Livelihood opportunities, especially for the bottom of the pyramid, are going to be more and more competitive, if not scarce. You have to be courageous to take actions that not only create jobs but also help in preserving jobs. 

 

Let me remind you of the invaluable contributions made by your parents, near and dear ones, teachers and your alma mater IIM, Shillong for what you are today.  Let me also stress upon the importance of managing work-life balance and equanimity of mind. This can be achieved by doing yoga on a regular basis. Yoga has nothing to do with religion.

 

Finally remember that education is not only for employment, but also for enlightenment and empowerment.

 

Congratulations once again and best of luck in all your future endeavors!

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that every person in the reserved category should get the fruits of development. He was addressing the gathering during the release of the book titled 'Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar: Vyakti Nahin Sankalp', edited by Shri Kishor Makwana and handing over the first copy to the President, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan here today. The Speaker of Lok Sabha, Smt. Sumitra Mahajan, the Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thaawar Chand Gehlot and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that there should be equitable representation among the reserved categories in education and employment in accordance with their population. Paying rich tributes to Dr. Ambedkar, he said he was a symbol of excellence and inspired every Indian. He said “Dr Ambedkar is an icon for New India and his thoughts are the guiding ideal for us”. He symbolized how every individual despite hardships can achieve great heights. 

The Vice President said that Dr. Ambedkar also epitomized how one’s talents can be used to shape the lives of millions of people by dedicating oneself to nation building.  As the Prime Minister says, “every poor man and woman from marginalized sections of society who has succeeded owes it to Babasaheb and his work. As he said, there would be no Modi, without Ambedkar” he added.

The Vice-President said that the Prime Minister was not only inspired by Dr. Ambedkar's grand vision but has made it a mission to integrate his vision into the overall governance of the country. 

The Prime Minister's call for building a New India was an amplification of Dr. Ambedkar's vision of a society that is not torn apart by casteism, communalism and other fissiparous tendencies, he said. 

Observing that Dr. Ambedkar was an unabashed and vocal supporter of industrialization, the Vice President said “Make in India along with promoting Ease of Doing Business has finally unlocked this latent potential”, he added.  India has become the second largest steel producer and the fourth largest automobile market. “India is the second largest producer of mobile phones and this is just the beginning of the India story”.

Recalling that Babasaheb had worked extensively on infrastructural issues, particularly that of power, he said that India was now the world’s third largest electricity producer. Stating that Dr. Ambedkar was also the Architect of India’s Water Policy, he termed the massive Hirakud project as a gift from Babasaheb to India. 

The Vice President said Dr. Ambedkar also worked on issues relating to women. He was the first person to think of making workplaces more women-friendly and fought for 8 weeks of maternity leave for women which now have been increased by the government to 26 weeks.

The Vice President said that the youth want an India “that is inclusive, peaceful and forward looking.  It is an India that cares for each individual and moves ahead as Team India. And true enough, we as a nation have taken rapid strides in the recent years. We must keep up the momentum”, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

"" Dr. Ambedkar is an icon for New India.

A lawyer, an economist, a teacher, a philosopher, a social visionary and a statesman - Dr. Ambedkar is the symbol of excellence that every Indian is inspired by. 

Dr Ambedkar's thoughts have left an indelible, lasting footprint on the sands of contemporary Indian history. 

He symbolizes how every individual despite the hardships in his life can achieve great heights. And more than that, he epitomizes how one’s talents can be used to shape the lives of millions of people by dedicating oneself to nation building. 

Dr. Ambedkar is an icon for New India and his thoughts are the guiding ideal for us. 

As the Prime Minister says, every poor man and woman from marginalized sections of society who has succeeded owes it to Babasaheb and his work. As he said,  there would be no Modi, without Ambedkar. 

Celebrating Babasaheb’s Life and Message

PM Modi does not see Babasaheb only as a symbol. Rather he sees his life and his work as a roadmap towards the ‘Prabuddha Bharat’ that he aimed for. 

PM Modi decided to develop 5 locations associated with the life of Dr. Ambedkar as the PanchTeerth to let more people, especially the youth know about his vision and draw from it. 

Babasaheb’s Vision Being Fulfilled by Modi Government

We are indeed fortunate that the country is being led by a visionary leader like Narendrabhai Modi who has not only been inspired by Dr Ambedkar's grand vision but has made it a mission to integrate this vision into the overall governance of the country. 

Babasaheb was an unabashed and vocal supporter of industrialization. 

Make in India along with promoting Ease of Doing Business, has finally unlocked this latent potential. 

World’s second largest steel producer and fourth largest automobile market. India is the 2nd largest producer of mobile phones and this is just the beginning of the India story. 

Dr. Ambedkar worked extensively on infrastructural issues particularly that of power - India is now the world’s third largest electricity producer. 

Babasaheb Stressed on education and economic empowerment of the Dalit communities - 5.7 crore underprivileged students received scholarship in the last 4years. Nearly 50% beneficiaries of the MUDRA Yojana are from the SC-ST-OBC communities

Babasaheb -believed India of the future should be one where people have the best opportunities to move to urban areas and prosper-  Today, programs like the smart city mission and AMRUT intended to build inclusive and sustainable cities where human dignity, 

Dr. Ambedkar is also the Architect of India’s Water Policy. The massive Hirakud project is a gift from Babasaheb Ambedkar to India.

He imagined an India with vibrant waterways, expanded irrigation facilities and surplus power. From the Jal Marg Vikas Project to the Ro-Ro Ferry to 111 inland waterways across 24 states, the government is committed to fulfilling Babasaheb’s dream of India as a strong maritime country.

Our constitution is one of the most women-empowering constitutions. 

Dr. Ambedkar who was the first person to think of making workplaces more women-friendly, fought for 8 weeks of maternity leave for women which now have been increased by the government to 26 weeks. 

In fact, the government has carried forward Dr. Ambedkar’s vision of Women led development. 

Ujjwala giving smoke free lives to nearly 3.5 crore poor women relieving them of their daily drudgery. 

Nearly 9 crore women entrepreneurs and mostly from the SC-ST-OBC backgrounds have changed their lives through the MUDRA Yojana and have also been creating jobs for others.

The BetiBachao, BetiPadhao Yojana has helped in changing the skewed sex ratio

Matritva Suraksha Yojana has given a life of dignity and security to lakhs of pregnant and lactating mothers. 

The government's sharp focus on social and economic inclusion, education, employment, entrepreneurship, women's empowerment, infrastructure and industrial expansion and optimum utilization of water resources have their basis in Dr Ambedkar's vision. 

The Prime Minister's call for building a new India is an amplification of Dr Ambedkar's vision of a society that is not torn apart by casteism, communalism and other fissiparous tendencies. 

It is an India we all want to see, especially the youth. It is an India that is inclusive, peaceful and forward looking. 

It is an India that cares for each individual and moves ahead as Team India. And true enough, we as a nation have taken rapid strides in the recent years. We must keep up the momentum. 

As Narendrabhai Modi keeps translating the dreams of our founding fathers like Dr Ambedkar into reality, let us, on this auspicious day, rededicate ourselves to improve the quality of our polity, to be attentive to the feeble voices, to enrich the quality of life of all Indians.

Jai Hind.""

The Vice President said that India was once known as the Vishwaguru and people from across the globe used to come and study in ancient centres of learning like Nalanda, Takshashila.  He further said that today the world is again looking at India, and our education system must produce youngsters who will be able to confidently face global challenges. Education must empower, enlighten and enhance knowledge, he added.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the Centre and States must work as a team to develop the nation and country cannot progress without States. He was interacting with the students of Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE), in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh today. 

Talking on the need to bridge the gap between Rural and Urban areas, the Vice President said that development must reach people in rural areas. Connectivity is crucial in developing rural areas, he added.

The Vice President said that the right energy mix of Solar, Thermal, Hydel, Wind, Oil and Gas will be a solution for India's growing energy demand.  He further said that IIPE intends to promote the quality and excellence in the education and research in the petroleum and hydrocarbons and it plans to fill in the skill gap in the Oil and Gas sector. Petroleum and its products provide fuel for heating and lighting, lubricants for machinery and raw materials for a number of manufacturing industries, he added.

The Vice President said that Industrialization, Rapid Urbanization, Rising Income Levels, and other factors are spurring demand for oil and gas. He further said that India has 18% of world population and the per capita energy consumption is estimated only about 5.5% of the world’s energy. Every Indian citizen aspires for better living standard and hence the requirement of energy is bound to increase in India, he added.

That Vice President said that there is huge potential for solar energy and we have not exploited even one percent of the Solar Energy potential in the Country. He quoted the Prime Minister as saying India’s Energy Future has four pillars – Energy Access, Energy Efficiency, Energy Sustainability and Energy Security. 

That Vice President said that India today has a predominantly young population, and the time has come to tap the skills and talent of the youngsters to achieve what is commonly described as demographic dividend. He further said that India has a very rich heritage, culture and traditions. We must go back to our roots to find solutions to the modern day challenges, he added.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has serving in rural areas must be made mandatory for Doctors and they should have empathy, compassion and a caring attitude to enhance their effectiveness. He was addressing the 20th  Convocation of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, in Bengaluru today. The Governor of Karnataka, Shri Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President asked students to become full-fledged healthcare professionals who can take on the real and continuous challenges that are going to become an integral part of your life. He said that despite making rapid strides in the last two decades, continuing rise in communicable diseases and a spurt in non-communicable or “lifestyle” diseases pose greater challenge to the nation. The evolution of the sector calls for active involvement and participation of all stakeholders and the use of innovation to bridge intent and execution to overcome change at all its stages – prevention, diagnosis and treatment, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the urban-rural divide in India needs urgent attention and action and said that collaborative public-private partnership to remedy the situation. However, the private sector health facilities must not only be accessible to the needy and poor, but must also be affordable, he added.

 

The Vice President said that India can leverage the demographic dividend by improving the quality higher education adding that education system needs to reinvent itself to respond to the emerging challenges of a rapidly changing knowledge economy. Excellence should be the watchword.  Agility and alacrity should be the norm, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""It is indeed a great pleasure for me to deliver the convocation address on the occasion of the 20th Convocation of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, Karnataka. 

 

Convocation marks a culmination, a milestone, a moment of celebration. 

 

It is a day to which all students look forward to because they acquire a degree after years of hard work and study. 

 

It is a day that is precious to the faculty as it marks yet another important milestone in their mission. 

 

It is a celebration that the parent eagerly await as their rejoice at the progress made by their children.

 

I would like to congratulate all those who are graduating. My special appreciation to those who have received awards, medals and distinctions. I also offer my greetings to the parents and appreciation to the faculty, staff and leadership of this great institution. 

 

Dear Students, this is a transition time when you are at the threshold of becoming full-fledged healthcare professionals ready to take on the real and continuous challenges that are going to become an integral part of your life. 

We are now at a defining moment of our country’s history.  It is a moment of formidable challenges. It is also a moment of widening opportunities.

 

By 2030, India is likely to be the youngest nation in the world with nearly 140 million people ready to enter the institutions of higher education.  

 

One in every four graduates in the world will most likely be a product of the Indian higher education system.  

 

If we in India can improve the quality of higher education, we can leverage the demographic dividend for the benefit of the society and community. 

 

The Indian higher education system needs to reinvent itself to respond to the emerging challenges of a rapidly changing knowledge economy. 

 

Excellence should be the watchword.  

 

Agility and alacrity should be the norm.

 

I am happy to note that Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, with the largest network of affiliated institutions in the world has pioneered many innovations in the field of healthcare education. It has emerged as a globally credible brand due to the unstinting efforts made by the leaders of this University since its inception. 

 

Sisters and Brothers, 

India has made rapid strides in the last two decades. The proportion of people living in poverty fell by half.  However, this period of rising prosperity has been marked by a “dual-disease burden”, a continuing rise in communicable diseases and a spurt in non-communicable or “lifestyle” diseases. We have to address both these health concerns. 

 

Healthcare delivery in India is now uniquely poised to undergo a change at all its stages – prevention, diagnosis and treatment. No single entity in the healthcare sector can deliver results and achieve health outcomes. The evolution of the sector calls for active involvement and participation  of all stakeholders and the use of innovation to bridge intent and execution.

 

Dear students, as you all are aware, there is an acute shortage of doctors as also healthcare facilities in the rural areas.  India has less than one doctor for every 1000 population. The rural areas are much less covered as compared to urban areas.  There is an urban-rural divide that needs urgent attention and action. 

 

We cannot have two Indias, with the cities having the state-of-the-art facilities and the rural areas lagging behind.  There has to be a collaborative public-private partnership to remedy the situation. However, the private sector health facilities must not only be accessible to the needy and poor, but must also be affordable. 

 

Dear students, 

You have acquired new knowledge, new skills and new attitudes during your stay in this reputed institute.  

 

You are graduating as a certified medical professional, as a doctor with a commitment to care for the sick and the infirm, to cure the illnesses and restore human beings to good health.  

 

There cannot be a more noble profession than what you have chosen because you are the one who can heal, who can cure, who can add ‘life’ to ‘years’.  

 

You can bring good cheer to a depressed person, you can provide hope to those who are losing hope. 

 

In short, you have the capability to change the lives of people.  

 

Which is why people look upon doctors as demi-gods or as the ancient Indian saying goes ‘Vaidya’ is truly a ‘Narayana or Hari’.

 

Dear Students,

Your entry into the noble profession today opens up for you unforeseen and unprecedented opportunities for serving humanity.  

 

It depends on you as to how you use these opportunities. 

 

As I said earlier, India offers you immense opportunities with ever expanding state of the art healthcare infrastructure and responsive health insurance system.  

 

You can grow as sound professionals by practicing what you have learnt.  

 

You can keep learning and refining.  

 

You can improvise and innovate.  

 

You can chart out new path breaking trajectories. 

 

Serving in Rural areas must be made mandatory for Doctors. 

 

Doctors must educate people on the adverse affects of Lifestyle diseases.

 

The demand for healthcare services in our country will undoubtedly be growing and the range of healthcare issues you will be addressing in India will be among the broadest in the entire world.  When you treat a large volume of patients, your experience will broaden your professional skills.  If you can keep updating your knowledge and skills by learning from the latest advances across the globe, you can certainly emerge as the leaders in your profession. 

 

Let me remind you, as the Hippocratic oath states, 

“there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy and understanding may outweigh the surgeon’s knife or the chemist’s drug.”

 

Clearly, your healing touch goes beyond your medical knowledge. Please master both the ‘art’ and the ‘science’ of medicine. Charaka in his Charaka Samhitha has described the ideal medical student as one who is 

“of mild disposition, never mean in his acts, humble, with strong memory, devoted to truth and study, devoted to theory and practice, thoughtful and compassionate, seeking the good of all creatures.” 

 

Empathy, compassion and a caring attitude enhance your effectiveness. 

Ethical behaviour enhances your credibility and stature. 

As Charaka again says, ‘you must be reasonable in charging for your service and only do what is “calculated to do good to the patient” without any other ulterior motives.’

 

Medical science like all other fields of knowledge is evolving rapidly and recent technological advances including imaging and robotics have brought in an unprecedented revolution in diagnostics and treatment.  Improved drugs have made treatment of hitherto untreatable diseases possible. 

 

You all need to keep abreast of these developments and lead the world towards future developments in the medical field. Along with this, I would urge you to focus on preventive medicine as well and more work with communities to bring about lifestyle changes. 

 

Our country has a long history of ayurveda, yoga and a holistic approach to health and well being. You would do well to draw inspiration from some of these traditions and integrate them with your medical practice. As our ancient seers have said: “Sarve Santu Niraamaya” (Let everyone be free from illness) should be our ultimate objective. 

 

I once again wish you all the very best in the future. 

 

I hope that the Vice Chancellor and the faculty members will set their sights higher with each passing year and keep achieving new milestones on their institutional journey towards excellence. 

 

Jai Hindi!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that real education must help to build the character, capacity, calibre and conduct. He was addressing the Annual Convocation 2018 of the Birla Institute of Management and Technology, in Noida, UP today.

 

The Vice President said that India’s very young human resource capital is our greatest wealth and the country must be able to effectively harness nation’s demographic dividend. He further said that this is rich human potential can turn into a force multiplier only when the youngsters acquire adequate skills and expertise in tune with the requirements of various sectors like industry, agriculture and services.

 

The Vice President asked educational institutions to reorient their syllabi and methods of pedagogy to prepare tomorrow’s students, who will not only be articulate and self-confident, but also well-equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century. He further said that we need to have a stable and expanding educational infrastructure at all levels and the Government of India is very much alive to this pressing need. The need to increase focus on research publications in Management institutions like BIMTECH, he added.

 

Underling the importance of skill development, the Vice President said government is implementing various schemes in association with institutions like NASSCOM to implement skill upgradation programmes in association with educational and professional bodies. He further said that skilling in different vocations is very crucial for India to emerge as one of the top countries in the manufacturing and services sectors. The Skill India programme seeks to bridge skills deficit in various areas and the progress of such initiatives is being monitored constantly and course corrections are being made wherever needed, he said.

 

Saying that it is the best time for talented youth to not only look for opportunities but also create their own businesses in India, the Vice President said that management students must aspire to be job creators and not job seekers. He further said that the youth must take advantage of the opportunities created by the government to push for entrepreneur-based employment. Various initiatives like Startup India, Stand Up India and Make in India will help in tapping the entrepreneurial talent in the country, he added.

 

The Vice President said that Education does not end with the acquisition of degrees or completion of college curriculum and the real education must help to build your character, capacity and calibre and ensure that you always conduct yourselves with dignity and equanimity, irrespective of the daunting challenges. Education is not only for employment but for empowerment and enlightenment of an individual, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am delighted to address the Annual Convocation-2018 of the Birla Institute of Management and Technology. At the outset, let me convey my greetings and good wishes to all students, parents and faculty, who assembled here today. 

 

It is always an uplifting feeling when one is in a campus of higher learning. I am, therefore, happy to spend time with you all this morning. 

 

All educational institutions from schools to universities are engaged in the noble mission of transformation. The same is true of institutions of higher education like BIMTECH. We often hear that India is a rich country, of not so very rich populace.  But in truth, we are blessed with all kinds of natural resources starting with our great Himalayas, the Vindhyas, other mountains across the country, the legendary Ganga, Indus, Cauvery, rich forests in the Himalayan foothills, the Western and Eastern Ghats in peninsular India. We are also endowed with great mineral riches.

 

We have huge natural skills, sun and wind energy as well, but in my view, our greatest wealth is that of a very young human resource capital.  A strikingly young population where every alternate person is below 30 years and this makes us one of the world’s youngest major developing nations.

 

However, the crucial question is: Are we able to effectively harness this immense human capital?  As management students, all of you might be familiar with the words “demographic dividend” in the context of India’s young population. But this rich human potential can turn into a force multiplier only when the youngsters acquire adequate skills and expertise in tune with the requirements of various sectors like industry, agriculture and services.

The educational institutions from elementary schools to universities need to reorient their syllabi and methods of pedagogy to prepare   tomorrow’s students, who will not only be articulate and self-confident, but also well-equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century. 

 

This would call for a stable and expanding educational infrastructure at all levels and the Government of India is very much alive to this pressing need. It took many initiatives to promote literacy, high school education, vocational education, science education, besides art and commerce education. The government also accorded top priority to skill development and co-opted institutions like NASSCOM to implement skill upgradation programmes in association with educational and professional bodies.

 

The progress of such initiatives is being monitored constantly and course corrections are being made wherever needed. The task being of great magnitude, the Union Government is working in conjunction with State Governments as well as various institutions in this mighty nation-building task.  

Management institutions like BIMTECH must also focus on research publications. The Recent report by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) for the year 2018, notes that India’s overall share in world publications is only about 4%.

 

Of the total 83,09,449 research publications in 2016-17, only 3,36,978 are from India. In the management discipline, the share is just 2%. In engineering, it is 6% and pharmacy 5%. Indian institutions must strive to significantly increase the number of publications in peer reviewed international journals.

 

India’s economy is projected to grow by more than 7 per cent this year. It is expected to become the third largest economy in the world in 10-15 years and also a $10 trillion economy in the future. The growing economy will open a world of opportunities for young Indians, who constitute the majority of our population. Already India has become one of the favorite destinations for FDI in different sectors. This is the best time for talented youth to not only look for opportunities but also create their own businesses. Management students must aspire to be job creators and not job seekers.

 

Various initiatives like Startup India, Stand Up India and Make in India will help in tapping the entrepreneurial talent in the country. 

 

The youth must take advantage of the opportunities created by the government to push for entrepreneur-based employment. Some well-known India startups have shown the way to others by proving that one can build a good business by combining entrepreneurial talent with technology.

 

Skilling in different vocations is very crucial for India to emerge as one of the top countries in the manufacturing and services sectors. The Skill India programme seeks to bridge skills deficit in various areas.

 

Earlier, I referred to the transformative role of education, especially higher education. You know the world is at the cusp of Industrial Revolution 4.0. For us to succeed, our nation needs huge numbers of trained manpower in all areas. It is, therefore, imperative that we all work together and make our schools, colleges and trained institutes excellent centres of learning – not only of academic knowledge but also of skills of diverse kinds.

 

Here, I would like to recall that India was once known as ‘Vishwaguru’. Dear students, India was famous for its celebrated seats of learning in ancient times. Knowledge-seekers from various parts used to come to Takshashila, Nalanda and other centres of learning. Many subjects, including astronomy, archery and warfare were taught at Takshashila. It was stated that more than 10,000 students used to study at Nalanda.

 

We need to recapture the past glory and become the global knowledge hub of the 21st century. Our institutions of higher learning must maintain excellent standards without compromising on the rigors of teaching and research. I am confident that institutions like BIMTECH will be in the forefront of providing world class education.

 

Education does not end with the acquisition of degrees or completion of college curriculum. Real education must help to build your character, capacity and calibre and ensure that you always conduct yourselves with dignity and equanimity, irrespective of the daunting challenges. Education is not only for employment but for empowerment and enlightenment of an individual.

 

Education should also instil values of honesty, integrity and a sense of empathy. As you all are aware, modern day lifestyle in today’s fast-paced, competitive world is leading to lifestyle diseases like diabetes, heart attacks and cancers. 

 

We need to reverse this trend by returning to our roots— eat time-tested traditional food, take up regular physical activity like yoga and spend more time in the lap of the nature. In fact, we have age-old tradition and culture of respecting trees, rivers and animals. Never tinker with nature and preserve culture for a better future.

 

Dear students! I would also like to advise you to always remain rooted to our culture and traditions, irrespective of whether you are in India or abroad.  Never neglect your parents, mother tongue, motherland and the place of birth—be it village or city.

 

I am happy to learn of the various initiatives taken by BIMTECH like imparting computer literacy, empowering girl children in nearby villages and taking up adult literacy programmes in prisons in Uttar Pradesh. I particularly commend your initiative to familiarize students with the realities of the rural India. .

 

The world has recognised our prowess in many areas of technology, including software applications and related skills. I am sure that institutions like BIMTECH would focus on areas like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Analytics. This alone would enable the would-be-managers to take on the emerging challenges.

 

We have a long way to go in catching up with the advanced countries and aspiring managers like you must be in the forefront of this transformative effort, especially in a building a knowledge-centric, new India.  

 

Knowledge has no frontiers, no boundaries. You must develop the ability to access the state-of-the-art in the field you have chosen. You must be able to learn from your seniors and peers. You must have the ability to apply different bits and pieces of information and convert them into useful knowledge. You must be a problem-solver, innovator, who constantly seeks solutions to challenges in the contemporary world. 

 

It is often said that intelligence plus character is the goal of true education.  I am sure that BIMTECH would have helped you to build on these traits.  I am also sure that you will uphold ethical values, inclusive mindset and the passion to lead from the front in all your endeavours.

 

In conclusion, I wish you all the very best in your career and life and hope that you will use your knowledge for the betterment of the society and the nation.

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that democracy is the ideal system of governance and Shri Atal ji has succeeded in preserving it. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the Books on former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, ‘Sarvapriya Atalji’, ‘Jannayak Atalji’ and ‘Atal Jeevan Gatha’, here today. The Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Statistics & Programme Implementation, Shri Vijay Goel and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that Books have been the ideal mirror of society and in that mirror, the image of the ideals of society is influenced, so any book is full of its true meaning. He further said that it is the greatness of the life of Shri Atal ji that it is a challenging task in him to crimp it in words. But one thing is true that Shri Atal ji was a good poet first and later an ideal politician, he added.

The Vice President said that everyone knows that the personality of Shri Atal ji fulfilled all the resolutions taken for this country and persisted on all his promises. He further said that Shri Atal ji has been the patron of the values of democracy and the value of voting and he always went on to serve the nation and went about unity and consent in all the circumstances. Because of his qualities, he became the first politician of the country who first formed a coalition government, he added.

The Vice President said that Shri Atal ji always preferred public welfare and he was always worried about farmers, poor people, uneducated, destitute and neglected classes. For this, he initiated several welfare schemes which, in its own right, were made for new development for the country, he added.

The Vice President said that democracy is the ideal system of governance and Shri Atal ji has succeeded in preserving it. For this reason his rule was remembered as good governance, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address in Hindi:

“मैं इन अनन्य और अमूल्य ग्रन्थों के प्रकाशन के लिए डॉ. सुरेश चंद, किंगशुक नाग एवं डॉ. रश्मि को हार्दिक बधाई देता हूँ और इन पुस्तकों के प्रकाशन के लिए प्रकाशक – ग्रंथ अकादमी, प्रभात प्रकाशन और ज्ञान गंगा को मेरी अनंत शुभकामनाएं।

पुस्तकें समाज का आदर्श दर्पण रही हैं और उस दर्पण में समाज के आदर्शों की छवि प्रतिभासित हो, तो कोई भी पुस्तक अपने सही अर्थ में चरितार्थ होती है।

ऐसे ही आदर्शों  की प्रतिमूर्ति हैं, हमारे भूतपूर्व प्रधानमंत्री पद्मविभूषण और भारतरत्न श्री अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी।

रश्मि जी ठीक कहती हैं कि ये अटल जी के जीवन की विराटता ही है कि उसे शब्दों में समेटना अपने आप में एक चुनौती भरा काम है। पर एक बात सच है कि अटल जी पहले एक सुकोमल कवि हैं और बाद में एक आदर्श राजनेता।

उन्होने यह साबित कर दिया कि कोई कवि और विद्वान भी राजनीति में न केवल प्रवेश कर सकता है बल्कि उसमें शीर्ष स्थान तक पहुँच सकता है। और देश को भी साहित्य के अनुरूप हित साधन के आदर्श मार्ग पर उन्मुख कर सकता है।

ये तीनों पुस्तकें अटल जी को समर्पित हैं। एक में उन्हें सर्वप्रिय कहा गया है, एक में उन्हें जननायक के रूप में याद किया गया है। और एक में उनकी दीर्घ जीवनयात्रा का स्मरण किया गया है।

सब जानते हैं कि अपने नाम के अनुरूप अटल जी का व्यक्तित्व भी अटल ही रहा है। उन्होने अपने देश के लिए, लिए गए सभी संकल्पों को निभाया और अपने सभी वचनों पर सदा कायम रहे।

उन्होने राजनीति में भी कुछ ऐसे कार्य किए जो अपने आप में नवीन उदाहरण बनें। 

जैसे अटल जी देश के पहले ऐसे गैर- कांग्रेसी प्रधानमंत्री बने जिन्होंने बतौर प्रधानमंत्री पूरे पांच साल सरकार चलाई। अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी इतने लोकप्रिय थे कि उन्होंने राजनीति में अलग कीर्तिमान स्थापित किए।

और वह पहले ऐसे सांसद बने जिन्हें चार राज्यों यूपी, एमपी, गुजरात और दिल्ली से चुना गया। यह उनकी लोकप्रियता का प्रत्यक्ष सबूत है। 

अटल जी लोकतन्त्र के सम्मान और मतदान के मूल्य के संरक्षक रहे हैं। वे सदैव देश सेवा के लिए आगे बढ़े और सभी हालातों में एकता और सम्मति को लेकर चले। उनके इस गुण के कारण ही वे देश के पहले ऐसे राजनेता बने जिन्होंने पहली बार गठबंधन की सरकार बनाई। उनके इस सफल प्रयास ने भारतीय राजनीति को हमेशा-हमेशा के लिए बदलकर रख दिया।

अटल जी की हित साधना अपनी पराकाष्ठा पर रही है। उन्होने सदैव जनकल्याण को ही वरीयता दी। वे हमेशा किसानों, निर्धन लोगों, अशिक्षित, बेसहारा और उपेक्षित वर्ग के लिए चिंतित रहे हैं। इस हेतु उन्होने अनेक ऐसी कल्याणकारी योजनाओं का आरंभ किया जो अपने आप में देश के लिए नवीन विकास की हेतु बनीं। 

अटल जी ने सदैव देश को आर्थिक रूप से सशक्त बनाने का प्रयास किया। वे चाहते थे कि देश का प्रत्येक परिवार का उचित भरण पोषण हो और आर्थिक रूप से सभी सशक्त हों। इस हेतु की पूर्ति की लिए उनकी कुछ योजनाएँ मील के पत्थर साबित हुई। जैसे स्वर्णिम चतुर्भुज योजना अपने आप में एक ऐसी योजना रही जिसे न केवल भारत में बल्कि पूरे विश्व में सराहा गया। यह भारत का एक प्रसिद्ध राजमार्ग है जो कई औद्योगिक, सांस्कृतिक एवं कृषि सम्बन्धी नगरों को जोड़ता है। ऐसा माना गया है कि अटल जी के शासनकाल में भारत में जितनी सड़कों का निर्माण हुआ इतना केवल इतिहास में शेरशाह सूरी के समय में ही हुआ था। यह निश्चित ही भारत की एक अभूतपूर्व उपलब्धि है। 

अटल जी ने संतुलित वेदेश नीति का पालन करते हुए अपनी परमाणु नीति को स्पष्ट रूप प्रदान किया। अटल जी ने बहुमत सरकार न होने पर भी अपनी समन्वयकारी योजनाओं से परमाणु बम का सफल परीक्षण किया, और देश को विश्व में अपने आत्मसम्मान की रक्षा के लिए गौरवान्वित किया। अटल जी ने पड़ौसी देश के साथ संबंध सुधारने की दिशा में भी सदा पहल की और विपरीत स्थिति से निपटने के लिए करगिल जैसे युद्धों में भारत को विजयी बनाने एवं दिल्ली और लाहौर के बीच बस सेवा शुरू करवाने जैसे कई असंभव कार्य किए। और शिक्षा का अधिकार योजना पर बल देने और देश में दूरसंचार के क्षेत्र में क्रांति लाने का श्रेय भी अटल जी को ही जाता है। 

अटल जी सदैव अपनी विनोदी प्रकृति से सबको आश्चर्यचकित करते रहे हैं, इसलिए उनका राजनीति का जीवन भी मनोविनोद से भरपूर रहा है। उन्होने सभी को सब स्थितियों में शांतचित्त और आनंदित रहने की शिक्षा दी। उन्होने संसद के गलियारों को भी किसी विश्वविद्यालय के प्रांगण या किसी आदर्श संगोष्ठी का रूप प्रदान किया। इसलिए उनके भाषणों में उनकी प्रेरक और रसमय कविताएं घुली होती थी। 

लोकतन्त्र शासन की आदर्श प्रणाली होती है और अटल जी इसी आदर्श को प्रतिष्ठित करने में सफल रहे हैं। इस कारण उनके शासन को सुशासन के रूप में याद किया जाता है। इसमें कोई संदेह नहीं है कि अटल जी ने शासन और सेवा इन दो शब्दों को पर्याय के रूप में सिद्ध किया है। इस कारण वे सच्चे भारतरत्न हैं।

ये तीनों पुस्तकें अपने आप में अनुपम हैं। मेरे विचार से ये पुस्तकें केवल अटल जी के द्वारा देश के लिए किए गए योगदान को और गहराई से जानने का माध्यम ही नहीं है बल्कि ये पुस्तकें लोकतंत्र के आदर्श और सुशासन की उत्तम विधि से अवगत होने का आदर्श साधन हैं। ये सभी ग्रंथ अवश्य ही भारतीय साहित्य और राजनीतिक शोध के उपकरण सिद्ध होंगे। 

में आशा करता हूँ कि भविष्य में भी ऐसी अमूल्य पुस्तकों का लेखन और प्रकाशन जारी रहेगा।

अटल जी के लिए सुरेश जी की कुछ पंक्तियाँ बहुत समीचीन हैं :

 

युगपुरुष यशस्वी जननायक,

इतिहास पुरुष, लो अभिनंदन,

तुम स्वाभिमान, तुम समाधान,

                 शत शरद जियो, लो अभिनंदन।             

 

सुरेश जी, नाग जी और रश्मि जी को, एक बार फिर से, मेरा विशेष साधुवाद।

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has hailed the Prime Minister MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) as a revolutionary scheme and was aimed at empowering the neglected and underprivileged sections of the society. Interacting with the beneficiaries of the PMMY on the completion of three years of the launching of the scheme here today, the Vice President said that a record number of 12 crore beneficiaries have received loans under the scheme.

The Vice President said that the main objective of the MUDRA Yojana was to make people stand on their own legs. A majority of those who received loans were from the underprivileged sections like fishermen, toddy tappers, weavers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths and others, he added. 

Emphasising the need to promote self-employment, the Vice President said that the government alone cannot provide employment to all people and such schemes will empower people to stand on their own feet. The Mudra Yojana will also help the entrepreneurs to get loans at cheaper interest rates, he added.

The Vice President complimented the government for effectively implementing the scheme by creating awareness among the people.

The Vice President said that this historic scheme will be beneficial to women as it will make them self-reliant without depending on their parents or husbands. Such schemes will not only empower the people, but also promote financial inclusion in an effective manner, he added.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Swatch Bharat Leads to Swasth Bharat and Samruddhi Bharat. He was addressing the gathering on the occasion of World Homeopathy Day, here today. The Minister of State for AYUSH (Independent Charge), Shri Shripad Yesso Naik and other dignitaries are also seen.

The Vice President asked everyone concerned to take Homoeopathy to masses in the interior, remote places, where it is practically difficult to dispense medicines, owing to lack of logistics, or due to limited resources. He further said that Homoeopathy is one of the greatest discoveries of the 18th century and the mankind cannot thank Dr. Hahnemann, who created the system of alternative medicine called Homeopathy, enough for gifting it to us! Since Homoeopathy is cost-effective, easy to administer and has no side-effects, it provides an apt solution for many challenges we are facing in health due to paucity of resources today, he added.

The Vice President said that scientific validation is a must, a checkpoint for everything adding that we need scientists and health researchers to give their thumbs up on the effectiveness of homeopathy. He further said that scientists from Physics, Chemistry, Biogenetics and Pharmacology have taken the onus of bringing out many little or yet unknown facts of Homoeopathy to the fore for everyone to see. Science is science, and it is nobody’s friend and nobody’s enemy and it only demands evidence, he added.

The Vice President has asked Homoeopathy students, aspiring doctors to further spread reach of Homoeopathy by their work. It is a relatively novel science and it is used by over 80 countries in the world, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“Minister of AYUSH, Sh. Sripad Naik Ji, Secretary (AYUSH) Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha Ji, Joint Secretary Sh. Roshan Jaggi Ji, Padmashri Dr. V.K. Gupta, Director General of Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy, Dr. Raj K. Manchanda, and all the learned scientists, doctors and enthusiastic students of Homoeopathy— I deem it an honour to be present here on the occasion of World Homoeopathy Day. 

I always feel privileged when I attend a gathering of doctors as they are the crusaders of building a healthy nation. Nowadays, when we talk of health, we don’t talk of freedom from disease alone. It is not how world looks at it anymore. WHO says ‘Health is inclusive of all three components of well being– physical, social and mental. But where do you find this ‘whole health’? I know your answer and mine is same – holistic methods of treatment – what we call complementary medicine, alternative medicine, traditional systems, and in India, we refer to them very precisely through the acronym AYUSH systems. Each of the AYUSH systems, be it Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Yoga or Unani are unified on this concept of ‘holistic treatment’. 

Homoeopathy had its origin in the late 18th century and by the mid 19th century, it had created a wave in Germany, USA, UK and even India. Many people in India grew accustomed to its use for their day-to-day and chronic complaints eventually necessitating the enactment of Homoeopathy Central Council Act in 1973. As the demand for homoeopathy grew, there was institutionalisation for education, research and registration of Homoeopathic practitioners.

Homoeopathy treatment is now offered in many primary and secondary health centres in India as also in some tertiary setups. At many places, it is an integral part of health programmes like Swasthya Rakshan Programme.

I am told that the program on ‘Homoeopathy for Healthy Child’ is aimed at screening, early diagnosis and management of common diseases of children and adolescents. Under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke (NPCDCS), homoeopathy has been integrated in some districts to prevent and treat lifestyle-based, non-communicable diseases.

I am aware that Homoeopathy is witnessing a major demand in India. Of the total AYUSH dispensaries of the central Government, 30% are Homoeopathic dispensaries. The number of institutionally qualified registered practitioners is also going considerably up, and now we have about 2.8 lakhs homoeopathic doctors in our country. As regards its acceptance among people, I think it has got a lot to do with its similarity to Indian ethos, which always propagated the concept of treating man and not only the disease. Even its basic tenet ‘Let likes be treated by likes’ is mentioned as ‘“Vishaya Vishmoshashi” in ancient Indian text, meaning poison annihilates the poisons. 

As part of strengthening our traditional and complementary medicines, we have to take Homoeopathy to masses in the interior, remote places, where it is practically difficult to dispense medicines, owing to lack of logistics, or due to limited resources.  Homoeopathy is cost-effective, easy to administer and has no side-effects! It provides an apt solution for many challenges we are facing in health due to paucity of resources today. Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, whose birthday we celebrate as World Homoeopathy Day, was a man of great insight and one of the most analytical minds of his times. He put into exercise the law of simila, which means ‘let likes be treated by likes’, the hint of which we see in ancient Indian and Greek literature too. Homoeopathy is one of the greatest discoveries of the 18th century and the mankind cannot thank this great man enough for gifting it to us!

But, at the same time, we have to remember, that in the world where everything you use is science-based, right from your latest mobile phone to the GPS-technology we are all so glued to these days, scientific validation is a must, a checkpoint for everything. And more so, when we are dealing with lives and health of people. 

I want to ask you all – Do you think Homoeopathy is scientifically validated? Most of you would nod, because you are practitioners and you have tried it on hundreds or thousands of patients. But it is not the nods that matter. We need scientists and health researchers to give their thumbs up on its effectiveness. 

I congratulate the Ministry of AYUSH and CCRH for organizing this convention with the stimulating theme: ‘Innovate; Evolve; Progress’. Yes, we all need to innovate, progress and evolve with the changing times and contribute to health research.

I am delighted to know that many homoeopathic doctors have digitalized themselves and are using software for better record keeping. I am told that there are homoeopathy-based mobile apps to guide you in your case studies, literature review and you even have internet-based clouds for storing, and sharing your cases with the homoeopathic community worldwide. This is really commendable, as this is what I would call real-time adaptation. 

I am informed that scientists from Physics, Chemistry, Biogenetics and Pharmacology have taken the onus of bringing out many little or yet unknown facts of Homoeopathy to the fore for everyone to see, and that some of them are present with us in this hall today. Science is science, and it is nobody’s friend and nobody’s enemy. It only demands evidence. 

This year also marks the completion of 40 years of untiring work of Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy. I am aware of the Council’s achievements, and how it has evolved and grown with branches in 26 states, tie-ups with national and international organisations for research and development in the field of Homoeopathy. Over the years, Council has revolutionised its approach towards conducting research by adopting internationally accepted research designs and by constituting committees and sub-committees of experts from various fields for technical auditing at every stage. I am particularly glad to note that Council’s laboratories in Kolkata and Noida have state-of-the-art facilities for cutting edge research. It’s collaborations with reputed institutes of science, like IIT Bombay, School of Tropical Medicine and Bose Institute, Kolkata, are just a few examples of many such collaborations. Of course, there is a lot more that can be done in the field of homoeopathy research, and you know this better than I do. So keep up the good work!

Before concluding, I would like to say a few words for the Homoeopathy students, our aspiring doctors. I can only say that conventions like these are your window to future. As youngsters, you have the energy and the zeal to pick your area of interest and work on it. Find out the scope from your seniors, identify mentors who can guide you to your goal, and most importantly, be confident about your vision. Homoeopathy is a relatively novel science, but its used by over 80 countries in the world! And you have to further spread its reach, by your work. I know that each one of you is capable of delivering if you set your goals right.

In the end, I would like to compliment the Ministry of AYUSH and Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy for organising this scientific convention and I hope each delegate of this convention will go back with a pledge to innovate, evolve and progress for the sake of Science!

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that CRPF is truly the strongest pillar of the country’s internal security apparatus. He was addressing the gathering after decorating CRPF officers and men with Gallantry Medals on the occasion of Valour Day, here today. The Director General, CRPF, Shri R.R. Bhatnagar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that the CRPF is indeed a glorious Force and he was proud of the rich tradition of Valour, Courage and Professionalism that it has always stood for. He congratulated all officers and men who have been decorated today with Gallantry Medals. 

The Vice President lauded the immense contribution made by CRPF in upholding the unity and integrity of the country and the very critical role it continues to play in cementing the internal security framework of the country. He further said that responding to the evolving demands over time, the force has been expanding and carrying forward its tradition of professionalism and setting new benchmarks of bravery and Valour over the years.

The Vice President said that the sacrifices at Hot Springs, the Battle of Sardar Post in the Rann of Kutch, safeguarding the pillars of democracy in the Parliament attack, averting the attack of Ayodhya are the events which have no parallel in the history of Armed Police Forces. He further said that CRPF personnel have set many unprecedented examples of gallant action fighting against anti-national elements and upholding the integrity and sovereignty of the Nation. This saga of gallantry and Valour will continue to inspire all of us, he added.

The Vice President said that besides playing a key role in assisting the states in maintaining public order, CRPF is also guarding several vital installations and the Parliament House. It is truly the strongest pillar of the country’s internal security apparatus, he added.

The Vice President said the CRPF played a commendable role while operating in Jammu & Kashmir where the Force launched many operations during the last one year. He further said that by controlling terrorism effectively, they have put in place Community Action Programmes that enhance their credibility and acceptability. It is a matter of great relief that due to these continuous operations, there is a significant decrease in terrorist activities, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:


	I feel honoured to stand here today to pay homage and salutations to the brave Martyrs of this great Force on the occasion of Valour Day for their supreme sacrifice. This is indeed a glorious Force and I am proud of the rich tradition of Valour, Courage and Professionalism that the CRPF has always stood for. I congratulate all officers and men who have been decorated today with Gallantry Medals. 


I am happy to note the immense contribution made by CRPF in upholding the unity and integrity of the country and the very critical role it continues to play in cementing the internal security framework of the country. The Force which started off as a single Battalion in 1939 was renamed as the Central Reserve Police in 1949. Responding to the evolving demands over time, the force has been expanding and carrying forward its tradition of professionalism and setting new benchmarks of bravery and valour over the years.

The sacrifices at Hot Springs, the Battle of Sardar Post in the Rann of Kutch, safeguarding the pillars of democracy in the Parliament attack, averting the attack of Ayodhya are the events which have no parallel in the history of Armed Police Forces. CRPF personnel have set many unprecedented examples of gallant action fighting against anti-national elements and upholding the integrity and sovereignty of the Nation.

Today, we recall the tale of valour of almost five decades ago. On 9th April, 1965, a heavily outnumbered small contingent of CRPF created an unparalleled feat in history by holding at bay the Army Infantry Brigade of Pakistan for over 12 hours.  The manner in which CRPF men stood their ground against the enemy, adopting right tactics and deployment, forced the Pakistani Brigade to retreat. Eight CRPF men laid down their lives fighting the onslaught by enemy forces. This saga of gallantry and valour will continue to inspire all of us.

I am extremely glad to note the multifarious duties being carried out by CRPF ranging from counter-insurgency and counter-terrorist to anti-naxal operations in the conflict torn theatres.

Besides playing a key role in assisting the states in maintaining public order, I know that CRPF is also guarding vital installations, including the Shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi in Jammu, Ram Janam Bhoomi/Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, Kashi Vishwanath Temple /Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, Krishna Janam Bhoomi and Shaheedgah Masjid in Mathura and the Parliament House. It is truly the strongest pillar of the country’s internal security apparatus.

Sisters and Brothers,

It is heartening to hear of the significant operational achievements of your Force in the recent years in terms of area domination, ventures in Naxal infested terrains of Jharkhand and Chhatisgarh and harnessing technology for effective Operations.

Equally commendable has been your operation in Jammu & Kashmir where the Force launched many operations during the last one year. Controlling terrorism effectively, you have put in place Community Action Programmes that enhance your credibility and acceptability. It is a matter of great relief that due to these continuous operations, there is a significant decrease in terrorist activities.

Today, once again, Kashmir is regaining its past glory as a major tourist attraction because of the hard work and sacrifice of CRPF personnel. The peaceful conduct of Shri Amaranth Ji Yatra is yet another testimony of the dexterous professional approach of the Force and its capabilities. I am happy that CRPF has also started a helpline named as ‘Madadgar’ for the people of Jammu and Kashmir which operates 24x7 for providing help in cases of natural calamities, harassment by mischief-mongers, eve-teasing, domestic  violence etc. This will further strengthen the bond between the people and the Force.

Sisters and Brothers,

Ballot is infinitely more powerful than the bullet and Terrorism, the enemy of humanity must be rooted out.

You have demonstrated exemplary courage over the years.  You have faced innumerable threats to your life bravely.  You have done your duty with devotion and determination.

The country is proud of your achievements.  We recognize the valiant efforts and the supreme sacrifices you have made. The 1693 Gallantry medals you have been awarded are an eloquent testimony of your professional excellence.

I am pleased that there are 5 women Battalions and Women squads have also been formed for controlling riots.

Sisters and Brothers,

You have enabled peaceful conduct of elections. You have won a number of medals and awards in various National and International Sports events. You have been taking active part in the important national programmes on sanitation and clean environment like Swach Bharat and the ‘Namami Gange’ project. I would like to congratulate Captain Harinadh who got the award in the short film category in a competition organized by Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.

I am delighted that CRPF is taking part in ‘Digital India’ campaign of our Hon’ble Prime Minister and that in a survey conducted by Intelligence Bureau with the help of National Institute of Electronic and Information Technology, CRPF website was declared the best website.

Sisters and Brothers

You have demonstrated that your Force has the ‘strength’ to fight enemies of humanity but also the ‘heart’ to serve the needy. You have brought the sick and pregnant women to nearby city hospitals, you have held medical camps, imparted vocational training to youths, constructed community centres and provided sports and other utilities items to villagers.

You have been providing security cover for construction of 18 major roads in Chhattisgarh.

Your commitment to accelerate development is indeed laudable. We cannot have progress without peace. Peace is the pre-condition for progress and development.

Through your actions, you create the right conditions for fostering peace and development. Your work strikes fear in lawless hearts and removes the fear from the hearts of law abiding citizens.

Sisters and Brothers,

This day is a day of commemoration, a day of recollection of past glory and a day of reaffirmation of our firm commitment to national security. 

I offer you my sincerest greetings and commend you on your outstanding achievements.

I am hopeful that your valour and courage will make our country a more peaceful place in the years to come.

Jai Hind.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that ae must move beyond seeing women as beneficiaries of schemes and encourage them to be participants in designing and implementing their vision for the country. He was addressing the gathering after giving away Women Exemplar Awards to Smt. Munni Begum, Smt. Asha and Smt. Vechulou Kanuo and the Lifetime Achievement Award to Shri Y.C. Deveshwar, constituted by the Confederation of Indian Industry, here today.

The Vice President said that India has the rich culture of respecting and honouring women. He further said that right from ancient times; women in India have been treated as equals and with respect. Many of our rivers are named after women and whenever given an opportunity, they have excelled in different fields from sports to flying combat aircraft, he added.

The Vice President said that women exemplars who have fought against all odds and flourished. They flourished not for their own benefit, but showed the way to thousands of others, he added.

The Vice President said that we must ensure equitable distribution of the fruits of our economic prosperity. He further said that the poor and weaker sections should not be left behind in the growth narrative of India. It is the duty of those who are better off to think of the disadvantaged sections and help in their uplift, he added.

The Vice President said that empowerment of women, who constitute almost half of India’s population, is very crucial for the country to make progress and achieve economic prosperity. He further said that in a bid to empower women, the government has launched initiatives such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, Ujjwala and other schemes to promote women entrepreneurship. Niti Aayog also set up a women entrepreneurship cell to promote women’s participation in our economy, he added.

The Vice President said that Indian industry has a major role to promote inclusive growth from the grass root level and we need visionary business leaders to provide resources, ideas, energy and the drive in this regard.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to participate in this celebration to honour outstanding individuals—women who have transformed the lives of people at grass-root level and an industrialist, who created an enterprise dedicated to serving national priorities. I compliment the Confederation of Indian Industry for instituting these awards.

CII has been a strong partner of the government, industry and civil society in creating and sustaining an environment conducive for the development of India.

Although, the recipients of the awards are from different fields, they represent the same set of values—those of placing others before self, working for social good and providing outstanding leadership. Such felicitations will not only help in reinforcing those values but also help in serving as an inspiration to others.

Shri YC Deveshwar has been recognized worldwide for his legendary stewardship. He led ITC to create multiple drivers of economic growth for our country. I congratulate him on this award for Lifetime Achievement.

I also want to congratulate the women exemplars who have fought against all odds and flourished. They flourished not for their own benefit, but showed the way t thousands of others. Their work is an inspiration for others to emulate. The downtrodden people are the most vulnerable and bringing a transformation in their lives is truly an exemplary achievement.

Friends, India is transforming at a fast pace. Our economy is poised to grow at 7.3 per cent of the GDP in 2018-19 and projected to become the third largest economy in the next 10-15 years. While this is good news, what is important is to ensure equitable distribution of the fruits of economic prosperity. In other words, the poor and weaker sections should not be left behind in the growth narrative of India.

It is the duty of those who are better off to think of the disadvantaged sections and help in their uplift. Empowerment of women, who constitute almost half of India’s population, is very crucial for the country to make progress and achieve economic prosperity.

Education is the foundation and the basic tool for women to be empowered. Even 70 years after Independence, literacy rate among women is only 65.4 only per cent. It is estimated that about 68 per cent of adult illiterates in the country are women. How can we allow this situation to continue if India aspires to emerge as one of the major economies?

As has been quite aptly said educating a woman is equivalent to educating an entire family. An educated woman will not only be in a position to support the family economically but will also ensure proper nutrition and education to children. Therefore, education is vital for women’s economic, social and political empowerment.

In a bid to empower women, the government has launched initiatives such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, Ujjwala and other schemes to promote women entrepreneurship. Niti Aayog also set up a women entrepreneurship cell to promote women’s participation in our economy. We must move beyond seeing women as beneficiaries of schemes and encourage them to be participants in designing and implementing their vision for the country.

Right from ancient times, women In India have been treated as equals and with respect. Many of our rivers are named after women. Whenever given an opportunity, they have excelled in different fields from sports to flying combat aircraft. Maitreyi, who lived in Vedic times, is considered as a symbol of the intellectual prowess of Indian women. Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi, Legendary singer, Lata Mangeshkar, Astronaut, Kalpana Chawla, badminton sensation, P. V. Sindhu, boxing champion Mary Kom, cricketer Mithali Raj, Tennis star Sania Mirza and weightlifter Malleshwari, just to name a few, are among the many women who brought name and fame to India. In the ongoing Commonwealth Games too, Indian women are doing the nation proud.

Today women are heading Defence, External Affairs and Information and Broadcasting Portfolios.

However, in the modern times, the degeneration of value system is leading to undesirable trends and we are witnessing barbaric incidents like rapes, female feticides and dowry killings. No civilized society can tolerate such inhuman acts and the most stringent punishments have to be meted to the criminals, who perpetrate those crimes.

Irrespective of how many legislations we frame and implement, there has to be a change in the attitude of the people. The change must begin at home with the parents treating both boys and girls as equals and not discriminating against the girl child. If the right environment is created from childhood, attitudes will change and negative tendencies will be curbed.

As someone standing on the dais today, I see in this room and in the people present here, the ideal mix for promoting inclusive growth and development in our country.

I am aware that through their CSR initiatives, corporates are already reaching out to communities. The CSR outreach also provides an opportunity to the industry to partner with women, especially those who are leading the change at the grass-root level. These women who came here today are working with marginalised groups.

While we have 15 finalists and three winners with us today, what is truly heartening is that there were 227 applications from across the country. Just imagine- 227 hubs of courage, vision and development in small cities and villages across the country. The governments, corporates and civil society must focus on these communities.

Shri Deveshwar and other industry leaders have shown their social commitment through Rs. 9,000 crore that they have spent on CSR.  Given the magnitude of the challenges before our country, partnerships are important to collaborate to find solutions to complex problems and achieve the desired results.

Indian industry has a major role to promote inclusive growth from the grass root level and we need visionary business leaders to provide resources, ideas, energy and the drive in this regard.

To herald a new dawn in our nation, we must leverage the strengths of all sectors: the resolve and resources of governments; the compassion and outreach of non-profits; the innovation, know-how, and capabilities of the private sector; and the determination and aspiration of communities especially the women. They lead differently and focus on development of their communities.  Investing in women has a multiplier effect-- the good impact always goes beyond them to envelop their families and communities.

My compliments to CII for felicitating women who are leading the social change at grassroots. I am delighted that this is being undertaken through a dedicated CII Foundation set up for the purpose.

I once again congratulate all the winners and convey best wishes for all your future endeavours.

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has advised the Foreign Correspondents to not to depend on what appears in our hyper critical English media and form opinions. He was addressing the gathering at the 60th anniversary of The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of South Asia, here today.

The Vice President said that Foreign Correspondents must be well acquainted with that particular country’s culture, history, ethos, traditions and the ways of living of its people, before covering developments or any events in a country. He further said that the entire country cannot be described as intolerant on the basis of some stray incidents of communal violence. If a handful of religious fundamentalists indulge in violence, the entire country cannot be described as intolerant and that majoritarianism is being imposed, he added.

The Vice President said that understanding a flourishing and vibrant parliamentary democracy like India, with free press and complete religious freedom to its people is a bit challenging for outsiders. He has asked external media agencies working in India to understand India by travelling in the region and meeting people. One should not depend on what appears in our hyper critical English media and form opinions, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

“I am extremely delighted to be with you on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of South Asia. 

I am told that this organization was established in 1958 by a handful of foreign correspondents based in India. Today, it has grown into an active and vibrant club of more than 700 foreign and Indian journalists covering South Asia. The fact that the membership has grown from a handful to 700 underscores the important role India is playing in South Asia and in world affairs.

As you all are aware, ours is one of the oldest multi-cultural, multi-religious, multi-linguistic societies with a rich tradition of accepting and assimilating every culture and custom. Today, India is a melting pot of different cultures, religions and languages with people from diverse backgrounds co-existing peacefully. 

As foreign correspondents, each of you has an onerous task on your hands. Firstly, before covering developments or any events in a country, you must be well acquainted with that particular country’s culture, history, ethos, traditions and the ways of living of its people. You might face quite a few culture shocks during your stint as you process events and experiences around you.

Truth and objectivity will become casualties if you cover any happening or development from a purely subjective perspective rather than looking at it from a broader cultural, historical, social and economic context in which it is taking place. I am not in any manner suggesting that as seasoned professionals you are not aware of this basic journalistic tenet. But many a time for a variety of reasons, including paucity of time, all the elements that fully connect a story might be missing.

 Contextualization becomes all the more important when a journalist from a developed nation is reporting on the affairs of a developing country. Your ‘text’ will be richer if you can get the ‘context’ right. 

For instance, the stride made by India’s space programme is something spectacular, given the constraints of resources and technology when compared to a developed nation. India sent a rover to Mars at almost one-ninth the cost of a similar mission of an advanced nation. Though it received coverage abroad, a reputed foreign daily published a cartoon lampooning the success. It had to apologize after readers expressed their outrage at the cartoon. 

Another aspect that is of relevance to all and needs a wider debate is about the variation in the reportage on terrorist violence. A terrorist is a terrorist irrespective of whether he kills innocents in Kashmir or Kentucky. But surprisingly some media organizations describe those indulging in terrorism in Kashmir as separatists or militants, while any similar incident in the West is immediately dubbed as a terror attack and the perpetrators as terrorists.

Generally, the charge of people from many developing countries, including India is that the foreign media projects only the negative news and deliberately ignores anything positive. I have already cited the example of Indian space programme. Well you might say good news is no news, but it cannot be bad news all the time either. As you are well aware, it is always better to avoid the pitfalls of stereotyping and magnifying only the negative realities.

Of course everyone carries his own baggage of perceptions and views. “What we see and report can never be fully objective but it is always good to be mindful of our limitations. One will gain credibility if distortions are avoided and different voices are captured in a balanced manner.

In a vast country like India, some stray incidents of communal violence might occur. At best, those are aberrations. If a handful of religious fundamentalists indulge in violence, the entire country cannot be described as intolerant and that majoritarianism is being imposed. Nothing is farther from the truth. India is a flourishing and vibrant parliamentary democracy with a free press and complete religious freedom to its people.

Today, India is on the move. India has been the world’s fastest growing large economy for several years now. We hope to maintain and improve on our growth rate in coming years to improve the quality of life for our 1.35 billion people and eradicate poverty. It is, no doubt, a challenging task in a country like India, where people speak 122 languages and 1,599 dialects, and where every fifth person is illiterate. 

What is fascinating, however, is that while newspapers are shutting down elsewhere, they are doing quite well in India. We have a vibrant press. There are over 1,14,000 publications in India today, and their circulation is a staggering 488 million!

And the world’s largest circulated English language newspaper happens to be an Indian daily. With literacy increasing year after year, more and more new newspapers are being published. Last year alone, 4,000 new publications were born. 

Over a billion Indians now have mobile phones. Five hundred million Indians are using the internet. There are 1,600 satellite channels; more than 400 of them are news channels. And India makes some 1,500 films every year in 30 languages. Indian films are becoming increasingly popular abroad, not just in countries where South Asian diaspora is substantial, but even in countries like China. Films like Dangal and Bahubali have made more money in China than in India itself!

FCC members represent the world’s leading newspapers, news agencies, magazines, radio and television networks. Based in New Delhi, you travel all over India and South Asia and report to the world what is happening in this part of the globe. And it is on the basis of what you write and broadcast that millions of your readers, listeners and viewers form their opinions about India and its neighborhood. In other words, you are the world’s eyes and ears, and the world depends on you to know what is happening in South Asia. 

So, I am sure you must be finding it a bit of a challenge to understand a vast country like India and explain it to your readers, listeners and viewers across the globe. Quite a few of you make an effort to understand India and South Asia by travelling in the region and meeting people, while many of you tend to depend on what appears in our hyper critical English media and form opinions.

In this digital era when one can get to know what is happening around the globe with a click of the mouse, it is all the more important for foreign correspondents to provide nuanced, balanced and objective coverage. 

I would urge you, and encourage you to go around our region, meet people, see things for yourselves and present a true picture of India and South Asia to the world. 

Ancient Indian writer, Mammata had explained the purpose underlying his writings. He had said that he writes to earn fame, make a living but more importantly to reduce the negative trends in society that impede progress. May be this can serve as an inspiration to all of us who are in the business of using the media to change the world. Let us try to mirror the world to change it for better.

We are proud that several hundred leading media organisations have set up their regional headquarters here in India. Whatever is published or broadcast about India and South Asia globally will have been put out by one of you!

Last October, the BBC launched its services in four more Indian languages. Today, the BBC broadcasts in eight Indian languages, and its bureau in New Delhi is the biggest outside its home country, the UK.

I am also happy to know that your club has been hosting press conferences with dignitaries from India and abroad, conducting discussions on latest books, and arranging cultural events to promote a better understanding of India and our neighbors.

On this happy occasion of the FCC’s 60th anniversary, my greetings to you all.

 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we need a scientific renaissance in our country and the excellence and quest for the best should be the goal posts of the new India. He was addressing the 9th Indian Youth Science Congress at Career Point University in Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh today. The Governor of Himachal Pradesh, Shri Acharya Dev Vrat, the Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, Shri Jai Ram Thakur, the Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare, Shri J.P. Nadda and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that the spirit of enquiry and the spirit of enhancing public well being should be the guiding principles. He called on young minds to creatively engage with issues like poverty, illiteracy, ill health, poor returns from agriculture and others. He further said that we need governments that focus on science for development. We need a transformation in the way we run our educational and scientific institutions, he added.

The Vice President said that the young India has the ability to see beyond the obvious and ask the relevant questions that a scientist will ask and we need more young people to develop these abilities. The new India that we collectively dreaming of will be possible only if the children and youth of our country develop the scientific attitude, he added.

The Vice President said that new India can only be built with new ideas and new ways of making them real through effective implementation. He further said that the new India will be a scientific India and it will be a technological India. It will be an India that will be sustained by knowledge and science, what is called as ‘Gyana’ and ‘Vigyana’ in Indian parlance, he added.

The Vice President said that country needs total revamp of school education as well as higher education adding that science should be an integral component of the curriculum. Scientific approach that relies on evidence and raising relevant questions and seeking answers should be internalized, he added.

The Vice President said that students should be encouraged to ‘discover’ rather than be ‘told’ the answers and rote memorization should be discouraged. He further said that we have to bring back the fun into the learning process and the joy of knowing, the joy of discovering, and the joy of innovating lies at the core of scientific temper. This should be the heart of the schooling and educational processes at various levels, he added. 

 

Quoting Confucius, the Vice President said that teaching, learning process should be reoriented keeping in view the basic principles encapsulated in his famous saying “I learn and I forget; I see and I remember; I do and I understand”. He asked higher education institutions must focus on research and problem solving and children should be given ample opportunities to ‘do’ experiments not merely read about them from a book. We need more laboratories and project-based, problem-based teaching approaches, he added. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am very happy to be here in the  inaugural ceremony of  9th Indian Youth Science Congress  on the ‘Role of Young Scientists in developing new India’ being organized by Career Point University Hamirpur, in collaboration with  SRM University Chennai, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Youth Development Beemanthanga Tamil Nadu. 

I am delighted that Dr. M.S. Swaminathanji, the doyen among Indian scientists, who has been the fountain head of inspiration to millions of youth and young scientists is with us.  His passion for popularising science is evident in the excellent initiative he has taken to organise these Science Congresses.

Sisters and Brothers,

Demographically, our country is a young democracy. Nearly 65% of our population is less than 35 years of age. This is a huge asset.

We have many bright young people with the knowledge and skills who are creating a new world, a better world, in many ways, as compared to what they inherited. 

They are able to change the world because they are able to ask the relevant questions that a scientist will ask. 

They have the ability to see beyond the obvious.  

We need more young people to develop these abilities.  The new India we are collectively dreaming of will be possible only if the children and youth of our country develop the scientific attitude.  

The Indian Youth Science Congress can provide a useful springboard for motivating young scientists to pursue their passion. 

Sisters and Brothers,

Our country is a country with a long, illustrious heritage of scientific thought and achievements.  

We remember with legitimate pride great scientists like Baudhayana who calculated the value of ‘pi’, Aryabhata who discovered the concept of ‘zero’, Kanad who researched on atomic particles, Varahamihira who made remarkable contributions to hydrology, geology and ecology, Nagarjuna who specialised in chemistry, Susruta and Charaka pioneers in surgery and Patanjali who gave the science of Yoga to the World. 

Of course, the legacy of scientific excellence continues even till this day.  We have amidst us Dr. M.S. Swaminathan who ushered in green revolution and laid the foundation of our country’s food security.  We have scientists across the length and breadth of our country discovering new drugs to cure diseases, advancing the frontiers of knowledge in various fields like information technology, bio-technology, earth and material sciences, life sciences and medical sciences. 

The new India will be a scientific India.  It will be a technological India. It will be an India that will be sustained by knowledge and science, what is called as ‘Gyana’ and ‘Vigyana’ in Indian parlance. 

Forums like the Science Congress enable young minds to share knowledge, information and draw inspiration to come up with new ideas that will power the India of the future. 

New India can only be built with new ideas and new ways of making them real through effective implementation.  

I imagine that youth will be in the vanguard of this knowledge and scientific revolution.  

The government has the responsibility to collaborate with academic institutions and intellectual leaders to create a congenial environment for creative minds to thrive.  

Science festivals like this can provide a boost.  However, these annual events are not enough. 

We need to revamp school education as well as higher education. 

Science should be an integral component of the curriculum. Scientific approach that relies on evidence and raising relevant questions and seeking answers should be internalized. 

Students should be encouraged to ‘discover’ rather than be ‘told’ the answers.  Rote memorization should be discouraged.  

We have to bring back the fun into the learning process.  The joy of knowing, the joy of discovering, the joy of innovating lies at the core of scientific temper.  This should be the heart of the schooling and educational processes at various levels.  

The teaching-learning process should be reoriented keeping in view the basic principles encapsulated in the following quotation of Confucius: “I learn and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand”. 

Children should be given ample opportunities to ‘do’ experiments not merely read about them from a book. 

So, we need more laboratories and project-based, problem-based teaching approaches.  

The higher education institutions must focus on research and problem solving. 

I do hope organisations like Dr. M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation will trigger this educational reform. 

We have numerous challenges in our world today for which we have to find solutions.  Poverty, illiteracy, ill health, poor returns from agriculture, environmental degradation and lack of water and sanitation are a few of these.  These impact the quality of life of our people and therefore need urgent attention.  We need concerted efforts by all.  We need young minds to be creatively engaged with these issues. We need governments that focus on science for development. 

We need a scientific renaissance in this country.  

We need a transformation in the way we run our educational and scientific institutions. 

The spirit of enquiry and the spirit of public well being should be the guiding principles.  

Excellence and quest for the best should be the goal posts of the new India. 

I do hope events like this will spur all stakeholders to come up with bright and creative ideas for action. I hope this Science Congress will usher in greater progress and development by fostering scientific temper among our youth. 

Jai Hind!”

                My colleagues from the Cabinet present here, Dr. Mahesh Sharma Ji, Mr. Kiren Rijuju Ji, Secretary General of the International Buddhist Foundation, Dr. Dhammapiya Ji, pilgrims from all over the country, ladies and gentlemen!

There's a belief that when a mantra is enchanted by thousands of people together, energy is created. Today we can feel the same energy. When our eyes are open, we can see each other; but at the same time the name of Lord Buddha is echoing in our minds every moment. 

The devotion towards Lord Buddha cannot be expressed in words.

Just like people are enchanted by mantras, they are also enchanted by Lord Buddha. I am fortunate to have got this opportunity to be present among you to seek the blessings of the revered religious heads on this sacred occasion of Buddha Purnima.

Just now Mahesh Sharma ji and Kiren Rijuju ji were saying that it’s my second visit. I would have come last year as well but I had to attend a similar event in Sri Lanka for Baisakh. I had got the opportunity to celebrate Buddha Purnima with the Sri Lankan people, Sri Lankan Government and the Buddhist religious leaders who had come from across the world.

We all are very busy and have our own responsibilities. But amidst everything we can get salvation just by chanting Lord Buddha’s name. But the monks present here have dedicated their entire life to spread the message of love and harmony of Lord Buddha. They are walking on the path shown by Lord Buddha. On this occasion, I bow down to all the great souls who are spreading the message of Lord Buddha across the world. I welcome all the people who have come here from different parts of the country. I have got this opportunity to also congratulate those Institutions and individuals who have made efforts and contributions to this work. My best wishes for their future endeavours. I would specifically like to congratulate Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies at Sarnath and All India Bhikshuk Sangh at Bodh Gaya for receiving the Baisakh honour.

Friends,

This part of the world i.e. our India, has a bountiful of invaluable heritage which can hardly be found elsewhere. 

A lot of things has been said and written about Gautam Buddha’s birth, education and Mahaparinirvana over the past several centuries. Fortunately for the present generation, part of it has survived despite several difficulties.

We are proud of the fact that the central theme of all the ideas that have emerged from the soil of our country is human welfare. We are also proud of the fact that in this era of new ideas no one has ever encroached upon other’s rights or feelings. We do not discriminate against each other's ideologies or religion.

We are proud of the fact that all the ideologies that were born out of India have been taken forward upholding the interests of the entire humanity. We have never said and will never say that only those who follow us will be benefitted. Lord Buddha's ideas have not only created a new consciousness; but today his ideas are defining the national character of many countries of Asia.

Friends,

This is the speciality of this land. Therefore our country and every Indian can proudly say that our tradition is a witness to the fact that India has never encroached upon the interest of any other country. India has never invaded other countries.  Our country has been traversing this path and this ideology for the past thousands of years.

Friends,

The journey from Siddhartha to becoming Gautam Buddha is not just the story of achieving Nirvana. This is the story of the truth that anyone who tries to alleviate the pain and suffering of others with his knowledge and wealth walks on the path of becoming Buddha from Siddhartha. He can walk on that path to achieve wisdom.

On the occasion of Buddha Purnima, every moment we remind ourselves of compassion and brotherhood. At a time when terrorism, racism and separatism are covering the message of Buddha under black clouds, the message of compassion and friendship become all the more relevant and indispensable. Life is not about winning battles with destruction, violence and hatred. Life means winning over hatred, violence and injustice with friendship and compassion.

It is a fact that those who have won over the angry mind with Buddhist meditation could succeed and become immortal. The confluence of truth and compassion can only enlighten the Buddha within us.

Buddha means to turn a violent mind into a pure and calm one. The wrong message of discrimination between human beings on the basis of caste, colour and language will never be given out by India or the Buddha. People of any caste, colour, class or religion have always been accepted with their respective individualities. For example, the Jews or the Parsis, have inter-mingled with us for several thousands of years and have become an integral part of the society. We have never imagined about discriminating against them. Following the principle of equality in our lives in itself means living the life of the Buddha. Buddha became the most admired Mahapurush of the world due to the same harmony and equality. Even Babasaheb Ambedkar had walked on the path shown by Lord Buddha by following his principles.

Today, India is known as the land of Lord Buddha along with its advancement in the mundane fields. It also enhances the greatness of India in the world. 'Budhham sharanam gachhami, Dhammam sharam gachhami, sangham sharanam gachhami' has become the Mantra of the people who teach the lessons of humanity from the holy land of our country to the entire world. Therefore the greatest message on the occasion of Buddha Purnima is ' before you try to change others start transforming yourself; you will also become the Buddha. Before finding faults in others, try to win your inner war; you will also become the Buddha.' 'Apo deepah Aap bhava' which means if you search for the light within yourself then you will also become a Buddha.

Lord Buddha had always been inspiring and spreading the message of compassion and peace. Equality, justice, freedom and human rights are the key values of today's democratic world. But Gautam Buddha had given a clear message regarding these principles about 2500 years ago. In India, it was not a separate idea and was a part of the whole world's vision.

According to Lord Buddha’s philosophy, equality means that every person has a dignified presence on this earth. Every person should be given equal opportunities to access resources and avail the rights without any discrimination.

Friends,

In every country, every challenge such as terrorism and casteism and other such inequalities have been created by none other than the human beings. These inequalities are the root cause of injustice, exploitation, atrocities, violence and social disharmony. On the other hand, the principles of justice, independence and human rights have emerged from the principle of equality. This means that equality is the basic element of these principles.

If the feeling of equality strengthens in our society then the path towards Social Justice, freedom, Human Rights, social change, personal rights, peace, harmony, and prosperity will open up and we will be able to move forward at a faster pace.

Lord Buddha has discussed 'Ashtang' in his teachings. I believe that without knowing the path of Ashtang it is very difficult to achieve the ideals of Buddha. Lord Buddha’s eightfold path include right views, right thoughts, right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, right efforts, right consciousness and right consultation.

It is possible to solve the problems that we are facing in today's time by following the path shown by Lord Buddha. In order to save the world from the impending danger it is indispensable to follow the message of love and compassion given by Buddha. Lord Buddha had also said that one can gain strength only by walking on this path.

Friends,

Lord Buddha was among those philosophers who had understood the need for reasoning. He had emphasized upon the logical test of the principles of his Dharma.

He even used to ask his disciples to test and measure his own ideas based on logic and reasoning without any ego. In the 2nd century, the advice given by Nagarjuna to king Uday for giving shape to Lord Buddha’s messages is still relevant today.

He had said- 'provide the blind, the sick, the deprived, the helpless and the poor with compassion and the provision of food and water in an uninterrupted manner. The patients should be taken care of and the distressed farmers should be provided with assistance such as seeds and the other necessary things’.

The global vision of Lord Buddha was focused on the question that how the suffering of the entire world will come to an end forever? He used to say that it is better to make a person capable of overcoming his sufferings and sorrows than to be sad by looking at that person's misery.

I am glad that our government is moving on the path of compassion and service taking inspiration from Lord Buddha. We give top priority to solutions for reducing the hardship and sorrow of the people.

The government has undertaken several tasks to empower the poor such as opening more than 31 crore bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana at a premium of just 90 paise per day and Rupee 1 per month. Approximately 19 crore insurance have been provided to the poor and more than 3 Crore 70 lakh poor women have been provided with free gas connection. More than 3 Crore children and more than 80 lakh pregnant women have been immunised under Mission Indradhanush. More than 12 crore loans have been sanctioned without bank guarantee under the Mudra Yojana. Now under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana the government will be providing 5 Lakh rupees annually to 50 crore poor families to facilitate their treatment.

Friends,

The ideas of inclusiveness and togetherness had completely transformed Lord Buddha. He was the son of a king. He had all the luxuries in his life; but when he used to see a person suffering and in pain he used to think that he was not different from them and was the same as them.

This truth gave him a vision - a sense of wisdom, rationality, cognition, ethics and charisma began to emerge as a power within him.

The more we absorb this feeling today, the more we will be able to become true human beings first. It is necessary to do this for the sake of humanity and to make the 21st century as the most important century of the world.

Brothers and sisters,

Even after such a long period of enslavement, proper efforts were not made to save the cultural heritage of our country. The country that cannot preserve its history and does not bequeath to its future generations the same grandeur of the heritage can never achieve perfection. Keeping this in view, our government is also working on a great vision for its cultural heritage and for preserving the memories related to Lord Buddha.

There are about 18 such states in our country where there is some or the other pilgrimage centres associated with Lord Buddha. Some of them are more than 2000 years old and attract tourists from across the world. In such a scenario, it is indispensable to develop world class facilities in these places according to the needs of the people. Keeping this in view, Buddhist circuit is being developed under the Swadesh Darshan scheme.

The government has sanctioned more than Rs. 360 crores for the Buddhist circuit. Buddhist sites in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat are being developed.

Besides, the Ministry of Road Transport has been developing the necessary facilities on the roadside of Gaya-Varanasi-Kushinagar route. International conclave on Buddhism is also being organised every 2 years by the Ministry of Tourism. This year, scholars from different parts of the world will be attending this programme. The objective of similar programmes is to inform maximum people about our cultural heritage so that people from the other countries also come and visit the Buddhist sites and obtain knowledge about them. Besides, the central government is also assisting the neighbouring countries for protection of the Buddhist heritage. The Restoration and chemical preservation of Myanmar's Bagan and Ananda temples is going on at a rapid pace by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). This temple was devastated due to the earthquake that had occurred 2 years ago.

The ASI is also involved in conserving the temples of other countries like Bamiyan of Afghanistan, Cambodia's Angkor Vat and Ta Prohm, Vat Phou of Laos and Vietnam's My Son Temple. It is also engaged in conserving the Gandan monastery's manuscripts and their digitisation in Mongolia.

Today I want to request from this platform to some central government Ministries. How to bring all the translation and preservation work of Buddha’s teaching compilation – ‘Tripitaka’ associated with the Buddhist philosophy being done by the various institutions on a single platform? Can we develop a new portal where we can get the teachings of Lord Buddha in simple words and also the work done by these institutions? I would like to appeal to Mr Mahesh Sharma ji to take the leadership of this project and make efforts to complete this project within a specific time frame.

Friends,

It is a privilege to all of us that even after 2500 years the teachings of Lord Buddha are still with us. When I say that it is a privilege then also think about the reasons why I am saying this.

Of course our ancestors have had a major role in their preservation. Thanks to the contribution made by our previous generations that we are able to organize such events on the occasion of Buddha Purnima. Our previous generations had made ceaseless efforts in preserving this heritage for 2500 years in order to bequeath it to the future generations. Now the upcoming human history is waiting for your active role and for your resolutions.

After going back, I want you all to think of 5 or 10 resolutions that you want to fulfil by the year 2022 when our country will be celebrating 75 years of Independence. These resolutions can be associated with anything such as protection, preservation of our cultural heritage or spreading the teachings of Gautam Buddha. However, it is my request that every person, institution and organization present here today should make some resolutions to be fulfilled by the year 2022. Your efforts will help in fulfilling the resolution of a New India. We are aware of the challenges. We have the blessings of Lord Buddha. Therefore I believe that we will definitely fulfil our resolutions.

Today on the sacred occasion of Buddha Purnima I have got this opportunity to sit beside the feet of Lord Buddha, to seek his blessings and to meet you all. I consider myself blessed. 

Once again my best wishes to you all for Buddha Purnima. With this I end my speech.

 

Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the medal winners of the recently concluded Commonwealth Games, who called on him at Lok Kalyan Marg.

The Prime Minister congratulated all medal winners, and complimented those who could not win medals but had performed creditably.

He said that accomplishments in the sporting arena inspire everyone. He told the medal winners that their sporting feats have raised India’s stature. He said that whenever an Indian sportsperson wins on the global sporting stage, it is the Indian flag that rises.

The Prime Minister said that today, the life of a sportsperson can span several decades. In this context, he gave the example of Mary Kom, who is winning gold medals even as she is Member of Parliament. He also mentioned Pullela Gopichand, who is mentoring and coaching many different players, after an immensely successful career as a player.

The Prime Minister said that besides talent, training, concentration and hard work, mental toughness is also important for sportspersons today. In this context, he mentioned the benefits of Yoga.

The Prime Minister urged the sportspersons to remember, and keep in touch with the various Gurus, mentors and teachers, who have guided them right from childhood.

Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports, Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore, was present on the occasion.

                        My dear countrymen, Namaskar. Just a while ago, from the 4th of April to the 15th of April, the 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia. 71 countries, including India, participated therein. With an event of such scale & magnitude, which saw the participation of thousands of sportspersons from myriad corners of the world, can you imagine the mood that must have pervaded the atmosphere there? An air of excitement, zeal, enthusiasm, hope, aspirations, the determination to achieve – who would want to stay away from an atmosphere like that? These were the times when people all over the country pondered eagerly everyday on the line-up of sportspersons, scheduled for their respective performances. How will India’s performance be, what will our medal tally look like? These questions were but natural. Our sportspersons too lived up to the countrymen’s expectations and displayed stellar performances, winning one medal after another. Shooting or Wrestling, Table Tennis or Badminton, it was a record performance for India. 26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze, India bagged a tally of around 66 medals. This success makes every Indian swell with pride. Of course, winning medals is a moment of joy & glory for a sportsperson; it is equally so as a festival of laurels for the country & her countrymen. After the conclusion of a match, representing India, when the athletes draped in the tricolor rise, displaying their medals, the notes of the National Anthem being played evoke a sense of joy and fulfillment, glory and honour. This is very, very special in itself. It is a touching moment that fills one’s heart with thrill; it is a moment full of zest & warmth. It is a wave of emotions that engulfs all of us simultaneously. Perhaps, to express those sentiments I’ll run short of words. But I want to share with you what I heard from these heroes. I feel immensely proud; you too will feel so. 

        India’s performance in the Commonwealth Games was par excellence. At the same time, it was special. Special in the sense that this time there were many pathbreaking ‘firsts’. Are you aware that out of the wrestlers who represented India, each one of them returned with a medal? Manika Batra won a medal in each of the events that she competed in. She is the first Indian woman to win a gold in the individual table tennis category too. India clinched the maximum number of medals in shooting. Deepak Lather of Haryana became the youngest Indian Weight-Lifter to win a medal at Commonwealth games. 15 year old Indian shooter Anish Bhanwala became the youngest sportsperson to win a gold for India. Sachin Chowdhary is the sole Indian Para Power Lifter to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games. 

        This edition of the games was special on one more count- a majority of the medalists was women athletes. In squash, boxing, weightlifting and shooting – the performance of women turned out to be par excellence. The final contest in Badminton took place between two Indian Shuttlers, Saina Nehwal and P.V. Sindhu. Everyone was thrilled for the fact that despite there being competition, the ultimate medal winner had to be India. The whole country watched it with abated breath. I too enjoyed watching the match. This year, India fared well in Athletics too. Indian sprinters Mohammad Anas & Hema Das missed a medal narrowly, but their record performance has brought glory to the nation. I congratulate them too… my best wishes to them. Athletes who participated in these games hail from various parts of the country, even from smaller towns. They have reached this pinnacle, crossing a great deal of hurdles and hardships. Today, the positions they have secured for themselves, the targets they have achieved, owes a lot to the efforts & contribution of their parents, guardians, coaches, support staff, schools, teachers, the atmosphere provided by their Schools, during this journey in their lives. Even their friends have contributed by boosting their morale under all circumstances. I also congratulate them along with the sportspersons, my good wishes to them. I feel all these athletes have brought laurels to the country with their stellar performances; the fact is, their performances are not mere displays… they are sources of encouragement for upcoming Sportspersons and the young generation of the country alike.

        Last month during ‘Mann Ki Baat’, I had urged our countrymen, especially the youth to espouse ‘Fit India’. I had invited everyone to join ‘Fit India’, lead ‘Fit India’. I was overjoyed to see people getting connected to it with a lot of enthusiasm. Expressing support for this, many people have written to me, sent me letters, shared ‘fitness mantra- Fit India’ stories on social media. 

        A gentleman Shriman Shashikant Bhonsale, sharing his photo by the swimming pool, has written, ‘My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming’. 

        Rooma Devnath writes, “I truly feel happy & healthy through my Morning Walks. She further adds,” For me, fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy. 

        Devnathji, indeed, happiness is fitness, and there’s no doubt about it.

        Dhawal Prajapati, sharing a photograph of himself trekking, has written; ‘For me, travelling & trekking is ‘Fit India’.

        It was heartening to see many eminent personalities encouraging our youth in interesting ways for Fit India. Cine artiste Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter. Even I have gone through it, you too should view it- it shows him exercising with wooden beads. He has mentioned that this exercise benefits muscles of the back and the stomach, to a great extent. Another video of his has gained popularity; in this he’s trying his hand on the volleyball with others. Many other young people have shared their experiences, having joined the ‘Fit India’ efforts. I feel movements like these are beneficial for all of us, for the entire country. I would additionally like to mention, that the movement of ‘Fit India’, without any expense, is called ‘YOG’. Yog has a special significance in the ‘Fit India’ campaign. You too must be busy with preparations… the significance, the merit of 21st June, International Yog Day has been accepted & welcomed globally. Do begin preparing for the Day rightaway. And not just yourself- your city, village, neighbourhood, school, college, men, women, everyone should make an attempt to connect with yog. Nowadays, the benefits of yog in one’s holistic physical & mental development does not need to be told… neither in India nor elsewhere in the world. You must have viewed an animated video depicting me, that has been widely circulated. I congratulate those from the field of animation for highlighting nuances, just the way a teacher does. You too will benefit from it. 

        My young friends, you now must be out of the tread mill of exams, exams & more exams; you must be wondering about spending your holidays. You must be contemplating on ways to enjoy your vacations and places to travel to! I would like to talk to you today, to invite you on a new task. I’ve seen a lot of young people these days, spending time in learning new things. The significance of Summer Internship is soaring; as it is, an altogether new experience in itself. One gets an opportunity to experience life anew, away from closeted walls, away from paper & pen and computers. Dear young friends, today I urge you to undergo a special internship. Three Ministries of the Government of India; maybe four- Sports, HRD, Department of Drinking water have come together to launch a ‘Swachch Bharat Summer Internship 2018’. College students, young people from the NCC and Nehru Yuva Kendra, whoever want to do something substantial & learn something for the sake of society, & the country, those who want to get connected with transforming the country and be a reason for it, those who want to do something or the other for society with a positive energy- for them, there is a great opportunity! Even the cause of the cleanliness campaign will get a boost, and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we’ll surely attain a sense of fulfillment. And let me tell you, the best out of the best interns who have strived in schools & colleges with excellent work will be rewarded with recognition at the national level. Not just that, those interns who accomplish their tasks well, will be awarded two credit points each, by the UGC. Once again, I invite students & young people, boys & girls to avail of the benefits of the internship. You can register yourselves for the ‘Swachch Bharat Summer Internship’ on Mygov. I hope our youth will lend a hand in taking this movement of cleanliness forward. I too am eager to know more about your efforts. Do send in your learning experience, do post your stories, photos and videos. Come. Let us turn this vacation into a learning opportunity, for a totally new experience.   

My dear countrymen! I try to watch “Good News India” programme on Doordarshan whenever I get a chance and I would appeal to my countrymen that we all should also watch this “Good News India” programme wherein we get to know as to how many people in various parts of our country are doing many good things and that such good things are happening. 

Recently, I saw that they were presenting the story of some youth from Delhi who are selflessly working in a dedicated manner to help in educating the poor children. This group of youngsters has started a big campaign in Delhi for providing education to the street children and slum dwellers. Initially, shocked to see the condition of children begging around or doing some menial jobs that this group of youngsters got dedicatedly, selflessly involved into this creative mission. Starting with just 15 children from the slums near Geeta Colony in New Delhi it is now being run at 12 places and two thousand children have been brought under its fold. Young teachers associated with this campaign find out a free time of two hours from their busy schedule and contribute in this stupendous mission of bringing out a social transformation.

Dear brothers and sisters, in this very way, some farmers from hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country. With their collective efforts, they have not only changed their own fortunes but have changed fortunes of the whole region. In Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, main crops sown are Mandwa, Chaulai, Corn or Barley. This being a hilly area, the farmers did not get a fair price of their produce. But, the farmers in Kapkot tehsil decided to come out of this situation and adopted a value- addition process and changed the loss incurring equation into a profit-earning one. What they did was that they started production of biscuits from their agricultural produce and sold those biscuits directly in the market. Consequently, Chaulai which the farmers were forced to sell at Rs. 25 per Kg was now selling at Rs. 50 per Kg as biscuits.

Besides, there is a strong belief that the land in this area is iron-rich and these iron rich biscuits are very good for pregnant women as they overcome the deficiency of iron. These farmers have formed a cooperative society in Munar village and set-up a biscuit factory there. Impressed by the bold initiative of these farmers, the administration has also linked this to the National Livelihood Mission. These biscuits are now being supplied upto Almora and Kousani besides being sold to about fifty Aanganwadi kendras in Bagheshwar district. With the hard work of these farmers, the annual turnover of the society has gone up from 10 to 15 lakh rupees and with more than 900 families getting employment here, people have stopped migrating to other places.

My dear countrymen, we often hear that in, times to come, the world will face a war because of water. Everyone talks about this but do we not have any responsibility towards conservation of water? Do we not feel that water conservation must be a social responsibility? This must be a collective responsibility. How can we conserve each single drop of rain water? And, we all know this. And, water conservation is not a new topic for us; it is neither a part of the academic curriculum nor a part of our languages. Our forefathers have lived this as a way of life for centuries together. They gave due priority and importance to each single drop of water. They found out newer methods in order to conserve every single drop of water. Those of you who might be getting a chance to visit Tamilnadu might have noticed that in some temples in the state, there are carvings on stone depicting irrigation system, water conservation methods and drought management. There are vast stone inscriptions in these temples and devotees get a chance to read these educative messages. May it be Mannarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai – you will get to see massive stone inscriptions to this effect. Several baodis (stepwells) are famous as tourist spots but please do not forget that these are the living symbols of the water conservation campaigns which our forefathers had accomplished.

Adalaj and Patan Ki Raniki Vaav (Baodi) in Gujarat is a UNESCO World Heritage site and its grandeur is to be seen to be believed. Baodis are water temples in a way. If you happen to go to Rajasthan, you must visit Chand Baodi. This is one of the biggest and the most beautiful baodis of India and the point to be noted is that this is situated in a water-scarce area. April, May, June and July is the most suitable time when rain water harvesting can be done and if we make preparations in advance, we can reap a rich harvest. Budget under MNREGA is also utilized for this water conservation activity. During the last three years, everyone in his or her own way has contributed towards water conservation and water management. An average of 32,000 crore rupees have been spent besides the MNREGA budget each year on water conservation and water management. If we talk of 2017-18, 55 percent of the total outlay of Rupees 64 thousand crores, which comes to around rupees 35 thousand crores, has been spent on works like water conservation. In last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land got more benefit through water conservation and water management measures. Some people have really benefitted very well from MNREGA budget provisions made by the Government of India for water conservation and water management works. A project of reviving the rivers which had dried out was undertaken in Kerala. Seven thousand workers under MNREGA worked very hard for seventy days and finally succeeded in reviving Kuttumperoor river there. The Ganges and the Yamuna have plentiful of water but there are many other places in Uttar Pradesh like Fatehpur district where two small rivers namely Sasur-Khaderi got dried out. After receiving the reports of Remote Sensing Imagery and Inter Department Coordination, the district administration took up the responsibility of soil and water conservation on a massive scale. They succeeded in reviving the dried out Sasur Khaderi river with the help and cooperation of people from 40-45 villages of the area. This grand achievement is a big boon for animals, birds, farmers, crops and villages. I emphasis that once again April, May, June and July are before us and we must also take up some responsibility for water harvesting and water conservation, we should also chalk out some schemes, we should also do and show something. 

My dear countrymen! When “Mann Ki Baat” approaches  I receive messages, letters and phone calls from all sides. Aayan Kumar Banerjee from Devi Tola village of North 24 Parganas in West Bengal in his comment on My Gov has written – “We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people are not aware of the Nobel Laureate Rabindra Nath’s philosophy of living peacefully, aesthetically and with integrity. Kindly discuss this point in “Mann Ki Baat” programme so that more and more people may get to know about this.”

I thank Aayanji for drawing the attention of all listeners of “Mann Ki Baat” towards this point. Gurudev Tagore was a personality full of knowledge and intellect whose writings left an indelible mark on everyone. Rabindra Nath was a personality full of talent, a multi – directional personna but a teacher in his inner self can always be felt. He has written in Gitanjali – “ He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students.” 

I do not know Bangla but had the habit of rising early since my childhood and in Eastern India, radio broadcasts start early while in Western India these start a bit late. I have a faint memory that probably around 5:30 in the morning, Rabindra Sangeet used to be broadcast on radio and I had developed a habit to listen to Rabindra Sangeet on radio. And, whenever I got a chance to listen to poems like Anandloke and Aaguner, Poroshmoni, I used to feel as if my mind was being energised. You must also have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems. I pay my respectful homage to Rabindra Nath Tagore.

My dear countrymen! Within a few days from now the holy month of Ramazan will dawn upon us. The month of Ramazan is celebrated with full reverence and respect throughout the world. The sociological and collective aspect of fasting is that when a person experiences hunger himself, he comes to realize the hunger of others. When he is thirsty, he realizes the thirst of others. This is an opportunity to remember the teachings of Prophet Muhammad-peace be upon him- and his message. It is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood as morals from his life. Once a person asked the Prophet (peace be upon him): ""Which is the best thing in Islam?"" The Prophet Saab said, ""feeding a poor and needy and meeting everyone cordially, whether you know him or not!""

Prophet Mohammad Sahib (peace be upon him) believed in twin principles of knowledge and compassion. He did not possess an iota of ego regarding himself. He preached that knowledge alone defeats ego. Prophet Mohammad Sahib(peace be upon him) believed that if you possessed anything more than your requirement, then donate it to the needy, thus donation or giving alms is important during Ramzan. People donate generously to the needy during this holy month. Prophet Muhammad Sahib believed that a person is rich because of his inherent spirituality, and not materialistic wealth. I wish all the citizens an auspicious month of Ramazan and I hope this opportunity will inspire people to follow the Prophet’s message of peace and goodwill.

My dear countrymen! Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian. We must be proud of the fact that India is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the very synonym of power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world. This Buddha Purnima reminds us of all of our obligation to emulate Lord Buddha’s teaching as well as, pledge ourselves to follow his footsteps. Lord Buddha was the fountainhead of egalitarianism, peace, harmony and brotherhood. These are human values, which are most desired in the world today. Baba Saheb Dr. Ambedkar stressed that Lord Buddha has been a great inspiration in his social philosophy. Baba Saheb had said –“My Social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words; liberty, equality and fraternity. My Philosophy has roots in religion and not in political science. I have derived them from the teaching of my master, The Buddha.” 

Baba Saheb strengthened the oppressed, exploited, deprived and crores of people standing on the brink of marginalization via the Constitution of India. There cannot be a bigger example of compassion than this. This form of compassion was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha for the alleviation of suffering of the people. The Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries carrying with them the rich ideals of Lord Buddha and this has been occurring throughout the ages. We have inherited the wisdom of Lord Buddha throughout Asia as part of our legacy.

It forges a link between us and many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar where Buddhist traditions and his preaching are a part of their origins. And this is the very reason that we are developing Infrastructure for Buddhist Tourism, which is going to connect Southeast Asia with the important Buddhist sites of India. I am also very pleased that the Government of India is a partner in the restoration of many Buddhist temples which also includes the centuries old magnificent Anand Temple in Bagan in Myanmar. Today, when there is confrontation and human suffering prevalent everywhere in the world, Lord Buddha's teachings show the way to rid hatred from the world with compassion. I wish people spread all over the world who revere Lord Buddha and believe in the principles of compassion- I wish all of them an auspicious Buddha Purnima.

I seek benediction from Lord Buddha for the entire world, so that we can fulfill our responsibility in building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings. Today, as we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the idols of laughing Buddha, it is said that laughing Buddha brings one good fortune, but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in India's defense history. Now you will be wondering what is the connection between smiling Buddha and India's military might?

You must remember, 20 years ago today, on 11th May 1998, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said while addressing the nation and his words filled the whole country with pride, courage and elation. The Indian diaspora was infused with new confidence. That day also was the day of Buddha Purnima. On May 11, 1998, at India’s western end a nuclear test was conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan. It has been 20 years since Pokhranand this test was done on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha. India's test was not only successful but in a way, India had demonstrated its might in the field of science and technology. We can also say 11 May 1988 is engraved in the history of India as a demonstration of her military power.

Lord Buddha has shown the world- that the power of inner strength or that of the soul is necessary for peace. Similarly, when you are sturdy as a nation, you can be at peace with others. The month of May, 1998 is not just important for the country from the aspect that nuclear tests were conducted this very month, but the manner in which they were carried out is also important. It has revealed to the entire world that India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can reach loftier destinations and earn new laurels. On that day, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra - ""Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan, Jai-Vigyan.’

Now that when we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Pokhran test conducted on May 11, 1998, I ask the younger generations of our nation to imbibe the mantra of 'Jai-Vigyan' given by Atalji for enhancing the might and the power of India, to build a modern India, a powerful India and a self-reliant India. Synergize your energy with the strength of India. Witnessing the journey that Atal ji started, we while continuing onwards on that very path with a renewed joy will derive great satisfaction in getting ahead.

My dear countrymen, looking forward to our conversation when we will meet for another episode of Mann Ki Baat. 

Thank you very much.

                Prime Minister of India, H.E. Shri Narendra Modi and President of People's Republic of China, H.E. Mr. Xi Jinping held their first Informal Summit in Wuhan on April 27-28, 2018, to exchange views on overarching issues of bilateral and global importance, and to elaborate their respective visions and priorities for national development in the context of the current and future international situation. 

They believe that the simultaneous emergence of India and China as two large economies and major powers with strategic and decisional autonomy, has implications of regional and global significance. They shared the view that peaceful, stable and balanced relations between India and China will be a positive factor for stability amidst current global uncertainties. They also agreed that proper management of the bilateral relationship will be conducive for the development and prosperity of the region, and will create the conditions for the Asian Century. To this end, they decided to strengthen the Closer Development Partnership in a mutually beneficial and sustainable manner, in pursuit of national modernization and greater prosperity for their peoples.

Prime Minister Modi and President Xi reviewed developments in India-China relations from the strategic and long-term perspective. They agreed to significantly enhance efforts to build on the convergences through the established mechanisms in order to create the broadest possible platform for the future relationship. They also agreed that both sides have the maturity and wisdom to handle the differences through peaceful discussion within the context of the overall relationship, bearing in mind the importance of respecting each other's sensitivities, concerns and aspirations.

The two leaders expressed their support for the work of the Special Representatives on the India China Boundary Question and urged them to intensify their efforts to seek a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable settlement. The two leaders underscored the importance of maintaining peace and tranquility in all areas of the India-China border region in the larger interest of the overall development of bilateral relations. To this end, they issued strategic guidance to their respective militaries to strengthen communication in order to build trust and mutual understanding and enhance predictability and effectiveness in the management of border affairs. The two leaders further directed their militaries to earnestly implement various confidence building measures agreed upon between the two sides, including the principle of mutual and equal security, and strengthen existing institutional arrangements and information sharing mechanisms to prevent incidents in border regions.

The two leaders agreed to push forward bilateral trade and investment in a balanced and sustainable manner by taking advantage of complementarities between their two economies. They also discussed ways to promote greater cultural and people-to-people exchanges and agreed to explore establishing new mechanisms in this direction.

Prime Minister Modi and President Xi underlined that as two major countries India and China have wider and overlapping regional and global interests. They agreed on their need to strengthen strategic communication through greater consultation on all matters of common interest. They believe that such strategic communication will have a positive influence on enhancing mutual understanding and will contribute to regional and global stability.

The two leaders agreed that India and China have separately made major contributions to global peace and prosperity through their respective growth and economic development, and would continue to act as engines for global growth in the future. They reiterated the importance of building an open, multipolar, pluralist and participatory global economic order which will enable all countries to pursue their development and contribute to the elimination of poverty and inequality in all regions of the world. They spoke of their respective efforts to contribute to the regional and global economic development. 

The two leaders also shared views on their respective foreign policy visions of achieving global prosperity and security. They agreed to jointly contribute in a positive and constructive way in facilitating sustainable solutions for global challenges including climate change, sustainable development, food security etc. They underscored the importance of reform of multilateral financial and political institutions to make them representative and responsive to the needs of developing countries.

The two leaders agreed that as two major countries and emerging economies, India and China, given their vast developmental experiences and national capacities, should join hands to take lead in offering innovative and sustainable solutions to challenges faced by humankind in the 21st century. These include combating diseases, coordinating action for disaster risk reduction and mitigation, addressing climate change and ushering digital empowerment. They agreed to pool together their expertise and resources in these areas and create a global network dedicated to these challenges for the larger benefit of humanity.

Prime Minister Modi and President Xi recognized the common threat posed by terrorism, and reiterated their strong condemnation of and resolute opposition to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. They committed themselves to cooperate on counter-terrorism. 

The two leaders highly assessed the opportunity for direct, free and candid exchange of views offered by the Informal Summit and agreed on the utility of holding more such dialogues in the future. The forward-looking dialogue raised the level of strategic communication about the perspective, priorities and vision that guide their respective policy choices domestically, regionally and globally. It also helped them in forging a common understanding of the future direction of India-China relations built upon mutual respect for each other's developmental aspirations and prudent management of differences with mutual sensitivity.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his twenty-fifth interaction through PRAGATI - the ICT-based, multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation.  

The 25 PRAGATI meetings have seen a cumulative review of 227 projects with a total investment of over Rs. 10 lakh crore. Resolution of Public Grievances has also been reviewed across a range of sectors.   

The Prime Minister congratulated all stakeholders on the completion of 25 PRAGATI interactions. He said that coordination between the Centre and the States has increased as a result of the PRAGATI mechanism. He said the PRAGATI initiative is a great positive force for our federal structure. He said that besides stalled projects, the platform has also helped in the review and improvement of several social sector schemes.

Today, in the twenty-fifth meeting, the Prime Minister reviewed the progress towards handling and resolution of grievances related to the welfare of ex-servicemen. He stressed on the importance of improving the speed of grievance disposal, so that the problems of ex-servicemen can be positively resolved in the shortest possible time.

The Prime Minister reviewed the progress of ten infrastructure projects in the railway, road, petroleum, power, coal, urban development, and health and family welfare sectors. These projects are spread over several states including Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Assam, Sikkim, West Bengal, Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand.

The Prime Minister reviewed the progress in implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana. He also reviewed the programme for National Fellowships and Scholarships for Higher Education of Scheduled Tribe Students.

                Madhya Pradesh's Governor Smt. Anandiben Patel, state's Chief Minister Shivraj Singh, Union Minister Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, Shri Purushottam Rupala, Minister of State Gopal ji, Mr. Om Prakash, Mr. Sanjay, my colleague in the Parliament Mr. Faggan Singh Kulaste, Smt. Sampatiya Uikey, BJP leader and an MP from Jabalpur Shri Rakesh Singh ji, Head of Zila Panchayat of Mandla Smt Saraswati Marawi ji. I would also like to proudly announce the presence of Deputy Chief Minister of Tripura. He has done a commendable job during the Tripura elections. BJP won a majority in assembly elections. It was a historic decision taken by the people of Tripura.

Most of the population of Tripura is tribal. Just like there is a long history of Gonds in your state, there has been a long rule of tribal people in Tripura. I am glad that today the newly elected Deputy Chief Minister of Tripura Mr. Jishnu Deb Burman is present among us. He belongs to a tribal community and comes from the royal family that had once taken up arms against the British. Today I'm proud to welcome him here on the soil of Madhya Pradesh.

Brothers and sisters,

Today we have gathered on the banks of mother Narmada. About 1300 km long mother Narmada that starts from here and flows till the coasts of Gujarat, taking care of crores of people, aiding in agricultural activities, animal husbandry, rural livelihood, has been supporting our lives for centuries. I salute that mother Narmada!

 

I consider myself fortunate to have got the opportunity of visiting this region even before. Stories of Rani Durgavati’s courage and sacrifice have always been inspiring us. This is the uniqueness of our country. The stories of Rani Durgavati and Rani Avanti Bai have taught us that we should always struggle for the sake of the society and should never accept defeat from foreign rulers; we should not only live with pride but also die with the same pride. Recalling this tradition today we begin this programme celebrating the pride of tribal people on this land.

This day also marks the Panchayat day. This is an important occasion for realizing the dreams of respected Bapu; because Mahatma Gandhi had identified India with its villages. Mahatma Gandhi had encouraged us to realize the dream of 'Gramoday to Rashtroday'. Today on the occasion of Panchayati raj Divas I offer my salute and best wishes to about 2.5 Lakh panchayats, the crores of people in this panchayat, more than 30 lakh representatives of these Panchayats of which one third are our mothers and sisters who have taken the leadership.

I want to assure them that the government of India will support them for the development of their villages, the empowerment of the people of your villages and to fulfill the resolutions so as to get rid of the issues faced by your villages. Our dreams will be associated with your dreams. We will together fulfill the dreams of 125 crore Indians. With this spirit, we should make resolutions to do something for the welfare of the village.

Earlier whenever we used to come and visit Mandla, it was identified with the fort constructed by the Gond Kings. We used to say proudly that, centuries ago, the Gond kings had established such a great system. At that time the princely states, the princes and the rulers used to do something or the other for the welfare of the people that is still remembered and about which we can tell our future generation with immense pride. Such kind of a system used to be there in that era.

We have democracy in place. The people of the villages have given us a responsibility for a certain period of time. They have trusted us. Which elected leader of the panchayat won't have the desire to accomplish 5 or 10 or 15 good tasks for the welfare of the people in the 5 years provided to him or her? 20 years or 25 years or 30 years later during your old age you will be able to tell your grandsons and granddaughters about the work that you had accomplished when you were the head of the Panchayat; like the pond was created under you, the well was dug, the trees were planted in the school during your tenure. Even you would like to tell your grandsons and grand-daughters about the work accomplished under your leadership 25 years or 30 years ago that you were satisfied about. Which head of Panchayat won't have such a desire?

I wish to infuse that strong desire in your heart. If we intend to do something for the public in the limited time period of 5 years and if that desire is extremely strong, you will definitely be able to defeat any challenge or obstacle in your way.

Sometimes when it comes to the development of the village, people talk about budget. There was a time when budget was a problem; but today it is not the major concern. Today the concern is about the proper utilization of the money within the specified time limit for the actual beneficiaries. There has to be honesty and transparency about the work done in the villages. Everyone should know about the amount of money that goes into a project and the explicit outcome. The issue is not about the lack of funds but about priority.

Now you tell me. There is a proper school building in a village with a qualified teacher; the teacher gets regular salary; it operates on a regular basis but if my village's 5 -25 students don't go to school, if they go and hide in the agricultural field or go and sit under the trees, and as a result they remain illiterate, then who is to be blamed for this? Is it the problem of lack of funds? Is it the problem of teachers? Not at all! We need to make the people of villages understand that there is a school; there are teachers available, the government is paying the fees, and the government is paying for the uniform of the students and also providing mid-day meal to the students. Come, not a single child in our villages should be out of school. Not even a single child in these villages should remain illiterate. Can't we take this pledge?

 

Our parents might have been illiterate due to the lack of opportunities and facilities. They might not have got the opportunity of studying because of the governments of that time. However, after getting elected in the Panchayat, in the state as well as at the Centre, we are keen to provide education to the students, especially the daughters. Isn't it our responsibility as representatives of the people that after coming to power for 5 years, this time should be utilized for providing education to the children so that not a single child should remain illiterate? Just imagine, when that child gets good education, after growing up he would say that he used to be a son of a poor mother, who used to work in the agricultural fields but the village head had dragged him out of the agricultural fields and had told him that this was not the time for working in the fields and rather he should go and study in schools. He would say- 'Thanks to my village head that I have become a doctor, an engineer, an IAS officer today. The life of my family has transformed.' If a single life is changed because of one head, the entire country moves in the direction of change.

Therefore my dear representatives, the Panchayatiraj Day should be the day of taking resolutions. Just see, in today's time, there have been several positive changes in the field of Health Care. If our children get timely vaccines against polio, they are not likely to be affected by the disease. You tell me that even today there could be a 40 or 50 year old person who is living with the condition of polio as a physically-challenged person, as a Divyang. Wouldn't you be pained to see him or not? Wouldn't you feel sympathetic towards him for his condition? You will definitely feel this way.

My brothers and sisters,

Probably that 40-50 year old person was not fortunate enough to have timely protection against the disease. But today the Polio vaccine helps in protecting every child of your village from the deadly disease. No child will catch Polio. Different governments do the campaign for immunization against polio through televisions and newspapers; the dates are announced continuously for administering polio drops. Shouldn't I, an elected representative of the Panchayat, do this job of ensuring vaccination against the disease?

But sometimes these representatives feel that this job is for the bureaucrats to implement. No my dear brothers and sisters. We are the servants of the public and not of the government. We are elected to form the government for serving the people. Therefore, if our power and time is put to the same work we can transform the face of our villages.

I emphasize upon these little things because usually people talk of big things but the real change comes from doing these little things with which we can change our villages.

We are well aware of the fact that if the health of the soil of the field that helps the farmer to fill not only his own stomach but also of the society, is poor then definitely mother Earth will be unhappy some or the other way. She will stop producing enough crops like she used to. We all will die starving. Our future generations will also be compelled to live in poverty. Have we ever thought of calling the group of farmers and telling them how their indiscriminate use of Urea is deteriorating the quality of their land? Sometimes a farmer sees that others are putting one or two bags of urea in their soil and does the same. Sometimes he sees the other farmer using the red boxed fertilizer and copies him.

Can't the villagers decide that if the village receives 50 bags of urea, only 40 will be utilized? In this manner don't you think that the money for the 10 additional bags will be saved? In this way we will play an active role in conserving the health of the soil, the mother Earth that is getting degraded due to urea. Our mother earth will be pleased with us and shower her blessings on us since the son that was killing me by putting excessive urea has now understood his mistake. Now I will produce more to fill his stomach. You tell me, can we do this or not?

I want to ask my tribal brothers, can we do this work or not?

Now the government has made a great law. Today I am standing in the forests of Mandla. Bamboo is cultivated here. There was a time when bamboo was categorized as tree. While I was going through the files, I was confused as to how could bamboo be considered as a tree for such a long time? As a result, my tribal brothers who live in forests could not cut the bamboo and sell them. If the forest officer catches him carrying bamboo, he will be in trouble. These were the problems that they had to encounter.

The government made a crucial decision of removing bamboo from the category of trees and putting it under the category of grass so that the farmer can cultivate bamboo on the boundaries of his farm, sell the bamboo; make different things out of bamboo and sell them in the market. This will create a new avenue of employment in villages. 

You will be surprised to know that despite having such a huge forest of bamboo in the country, we are importing bamboo worth 12-15 thousand crore rupees. For making incense sticks, match sticks, or even for making kites we are importing bamboo from other countries. For constructing our houses, we don't have the permission to cut bamboo. Thousands of crores of Rupees are flowing out of the country.

Now I urge my tribal brothers and the farmers of the villages to plant good quality Bamboo in their fields. They can cultivate their usual crops and along with that they can plant Bamboo on the edges of the field. They will be able to earn extra in next 2 or 3 years. The income of the farmers is bound to increase. They can get additional income from the land that is lying unutilized at the edges.

I appeal to you all and to the representatives of Panchayat. Can we make our farmers in the agricultural sector to be self-reliant? The Governor of Himachal Pradesh, Dev Vrat ji devotes his time to teach zero budget agriculture to the farmers. Can my representatives of the panchayat learn these things and prepare the farmers of their villages or not?

We are currently running a campaign for increasing Honey production and for beekeeping. If a small farmer keeps even 50 boxes for bee-keeping in his agricultural field, he can sell honey worth Rs.1.5-2 lakh annually. Even if he is unable to sell that honey and consumes himself, it will be beneficial for his health. You tell me whether the farmer's income will increase or not? Is it necessary to accomplish this job through budget? Not at all! These things can be done automatically, on one's own initiative. We just need to decide.

The government provides the funds for the wages of the laborers under MGNREGA scheme. For accomplishing the MGNREGA work for 2-3 months, say in the months of April, May and June, we can decide the work that needs to be done before hand. For example, deepening a pond or stopping the water through check dams or preserving the rainwater. The MGNREGA funds can be put to the specified work.

You tell me that if the water of the village is preserved, then don't you think that underground water levels that is going down will ultimately rise? Won't the cost of water extraction be reduced? So, in the future even if there is less rainfall, the agriculture will get a new lease of life from the preserved water. The village will not starve in such a scenario.

The problem is not about the lack of schemes or funds. I would like to appeal to the representatives of the villages to take strong decisions regarding education, healthcare, water conservation or modernizing agriculture. There is no need for a new budget in these areas. Even without a new budget the people of the villages can move ahead and bring changes.

I would also like to emphasize upon another aspect. We had started a scheme for opening bank accounts- Jan Dhan Yojana. Second scheme was regarding insurance with a premium of 90 paise. I don't believe that even the poorest of the poor cannot afford to spend 90 paise. If he has an addiction to bidi, he will spend at least Rs. 2 per day on bidi. So he can very well afford 90 paise for insurance.

You may have seen here on the stage that I had the privilege of handing over Rs. 2 lakh to the mother of a tribal community. What was this Rs. 2 lakh for? She had purchased Life Insurance with a premium of 90 paise. Her family had objected to it. Unfortunately the head of the family died and thanks to the 90 paise, she is getting Rs.2 lakh insurance today. The poor mother has received Rs. 2 lakh. Now you tell me, this initiative will help the person during this bad phase or not?

My representatives and heads of the Panchayat, there shall not be any family in the village that will not have a Jan Dhan bank account and insurance with minimum premium of 90 paise. If that family meets with an unfortunate incident, it will get a financial assistance of Rs. 2 lakh. The family will not be a burden on the village. Can you not do this work?

Brothers and sisters,

I want to draw your attention to three things- 

One is Jan dhan, secondly Van dhan and thirdly gobardhan. We can bring about a great economic transformation in villages through these three things. With the help of Jan Dhan Yojana we can bring every citizen into the mainstream of the economy.

Van dhan- we have abundant natural resources and forest resources. If there are neem trees in a village and  understanding its value if a group of women collect the Neem pods that fall from Neem trees and churn out its oil, they can be used for coating urea. It will be a new source of income for these women. The neem pods that once used to get wasted in the soil can now be a resource – a van dhan. Can't we bring about these changes?

I would like to tell all my tribal brothers living in forests and the governments that today the Madhya Pradesh government has launched a big scheme for the tribal community of which Van dhan is of great importance.

Thirdly, Gobardhan Yojana- villages have abundant livestock. Their ‘gobar’ or excreta is not utilized scientifically. If we look at the waste and garbage of the villages as an asset, we can produce gas, electricity and fertilizer out of it. Even without urea, the village can prepare good quality Fertilizer in this way. Moreover, it will prevent diseases from affecting the village and this can be done without money. This can be done by taking advantage of the government's schemes.

Therefore brothers and sisters,

I appeal to all the panchayats across the country, to the 2.4 Lakh villages from the land of mother Narmada, Mandla with the blessings of mother Durgavati, come and take a resolution, to fulfil Mahatma Gandhi's dreams by the year 2022 that will mark 75 years of India's Independence. This year, 2nd October will mark 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. This will be a great opportunity for all of us to fulfil Gandhi's dream of an ideal village. All of us should strive to change the villages to change the country. All of us should make proper use of funds in the villages.

I launched a program today in which a new technology has been used through which the citizens will be able to track the government's work progress on their mobile phones ranging from the amount of money sanctioned, the purpose for which it has been allotted, whether that job has been accomplished or not, the place where it was supposed to be done, so on and so forth. Suppose you see that the well that was supposed to be constructed out of the allocated money has not been constructed yet, you can ask the government officials about it. They will be compelled to get it done within a month. You tell me, in this manner the system will become transparent or not? And environment of honesty will prevail in the villages. The government officials will be accountable. 

So my dear brothers and sisters,

We should do the right thing at the right time. These 5 years of your governance can turn into a golden period. The village would remember your work that transformed the condition of the village. We should move ahead with this resolution. Today I got the opportunity of inaugurating an LPG plant here. You must have seen that we are delivering gas cylinders to the people for free. Now we are establishing factories for gas cylinders. This factory will be established with an investment of Rs. 120 crores. The work of delivering gas cylinders to the nearby districts like Satna, Rewa, Singrauli, Shahdol, Umaria, Dindori, Anuppur, Mandla, Balaghat, Jabalpur Katni, Damoh etc. will become easier. The people here will get new employment opportunities. I got this opportunity to do this work among you today.

Brothers and sisters,

We can talk about several topics. But I want all of us to move ahead with the mantra of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai vigyan' in the villages.

 

I just heard Shivraj ji saying that the government of India has now come out with a law that provides capital punishment for those monstrous men who harass the daughters. I saw that when the Chief Minister was saying this the entire pavilion was echoing with the applause from the people. The applause was not fading away. The government in Delhi is the one that listens to your heart and then makes decisions.

I would say that we should learn to respect our daughters in the family. We should give priority and importance to the daughters in our families and also teach our sons to be responsible. If we start teaching our sons to be responsible then it will never be difficult to keep our daughter safe. Whoever commits a heinous offence shall be hanged to death. But in our families as well we should take the responsibility of ensuring the safety of our daughters. We need to start a mass movement. All of us can get the country rid of these troubles. I want all of you to take these things forward.

Brothers and sisters,

The government has envisaged an important task. Unfortunately the fight for Independence was limited only to a few people and a few families. I don't know why the stories of the real sacrifices have not been included in the pages of history.

Even before 1857 for several years during the period of colonization several ancestors from India had made sacrifices for self-respect, culture or freedom. Even after 1857, very few people are aware because it has been erased from the memory of the people that my tribal brothers and sisters had made several sacrifices for freedom of the country. They had fought several great wars for the honour of India. Great personalities like Durgavati, Avantibai, Birsa Munda had sacrificed their lives for the country.

It is my dream that a museum would be created in every state for the ancestors from the tribal community who had fought against the British rulers. The school students will be taken to these museums and will be told about the tribal brothers who had sacrificed their lives for our country's culture and history. This work will be undertaken even in Madhya Pradesh in the future.

 

Therefore my brothers and sisters,

Commemorating mother Durgavati from the land of Mandla, I offer my heartfelt best wishes to the people who have organized the tribal festival for the empowerment of Panchayati Raj so as to strengthen our democracy and for the welfare of the mother earth and the villages. I congratulate Mr Tomarji,  Rupalaji  and all the officials of his department for initiating the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan in the entire country.

On 30th April, an awareness program will be organized regarding Ayushman Bharat. Workshops will be organized for the farmers on May 2nd. All the issues related to the village life will be taken up. I request you all to participate with a new enthusiasm and hope.

With this expectation, I wish you all good luck, thanks a lot!

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan today, at a public meeting, in Mandla in Madhya Pradesh. He unveiled a Road Map for overall development of tribals during the next five years.

He laid the foundation stone of an LPG bottling plant of Indian Oil Corporation at Maneri, Mandla District. He also launched a Local Government Directory.  

The Prime Minister felicitated the Sarpanches of villages which have achieved 100 percent smokeless kitchens, 100 percent vaccination under Mission Indradhanush, and 100 percent electrification under Saubhagya Scheme.

Addressing Panchayati Raj representatives across the country, from Mandla, the Prime Minister recalled Mahatma Gandhi's call for Gramoday to Rashtroday, and Gram Swaraj. He said he is delighted to be in Madhya Pradesh on National Panchayati Raj Day. He added that Mahatma Gandhi always highlighted the importance of villages and spoke about 'Gram Swaraj'. He called upon everyone to reaffirm the commitment to serving our villages.

The Prime Minister said that while talking about rural development, budgets are important. But, he added, there is a shift in the discourse in the last few years. People are now talking about the need to ensure that money allocated for a project is utilised and it is done in a timely as well as transparent manner, he said.

He urged people to focus on the education of their children, and added that this is essential for the child's future.

The Prime Minister underscored the efforts towards self-reliance in the agriculture sector. He urged the Panchayat representatives to pay attention to water conservation, and to ensure that every drop of water is conserved.

Shri Narendra Modi spoke of the importance of Jan Dhan Yojana for financial inclusion; Van Dhan Yojana for empowering tribal communities; and Gobar-Dhan Yojana for making farmers more self reliant, besides converting waste into energy.

He said that a transformation of villages would ensure a transformation of India.

The Prime Minister also said that the recent steps taken by the Union Government will be beneficial in furthering the safety of women.

                The dignitaries present on the dais, officers present in the VigyanBhawan, the other officers of civil services busy tendering their service to the nation in remote corners of the country, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations and best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Civil Services Day. 

Once again I got the opportunity to talk to you. Today’s occasion is important in several ways, it is for appreciation, evaluation and the most importantly, it is also for introspection. Today’s occasion is also for reflecting on those resolutions and directions which had been made in the past to see how far we have moved ahead and to what extent we have succeeded and how much change we could bring about in the life of the common man.

Friends, be it an individual or a system, howsoever capable and effective it may be it requires constant motivation for better results. An attempt is made through giving of awards. Prime Minister’s Awards are one such attempt in this series. 

Today, several officers have been honored with the Prime Minister’s Award for doing good work in their respective fields. I congratulate all those who have received this award today and I also convey my best wishes to them to perform even better in future. 

Friends, one of the objectives of these awards is to motivate but at the same time it also aims at how to expand, how to make it more comprehensive and to do more; in a way it also reflects the priorities of the government. And this year a provision was also made for giving awards in the categories of priority programs and innovation. Under the priority programs, the awards have also been given for publicizing Prime Minister’s Crop Insurance Scheme, DeenDayalUpadhyay Skill Development Scheme, Prime Minister’s Housing Scheme and digital payments. 

The schemes for which awards have been given are very important to realize our dreams for a New India. These are very important for our economy and for improving living conditions of the common man. Be it World Bank or global rating agencies, they keep discussing about the ease of doing business but a country like India cannot stop by just achieving the ease of doing business. For us it is like how to bring about ease of living in the life of the common man. We cannot forget that despite having such a large number of public servants, long experience of years and good work done by people down the generations; the common man still has to struggle with the government every single moment, he has to look for his space within the governance to get his rights. And this is the biggest hurdle in the way of ensuring the ease of life. 

If we can accomplish this much that he does not have to ask for his right then I think the kind of change that will come into the lives of 1.25 billion countrymen, will not take much time to transform the country. The people themselves will change the country andwe will just keep watching. When the son goes out for a few years and then returns even his mother wonders that she did not have an inkling of when her son turned into a full grown youth.  

I have been told about the applications that have been received for this year’s awards. The people sitting here are very happy. But, I can’t be happy right away. Because there could be such districts, such officers in our country who do not want to participate in this contest. They don’t feel the urge to make an effort. I welcome those who have come but I’m concerned about those who have not come. 

It means that there is stagnation in their lives; their internal energy has ebbed away and this can’t be the life. If there is no determination or enthusiasm to do something new till the last moment of life, if no effort is being made then there cannot be any bigger end to the life. 

And I don’t believe that at district level there are people who are aged and who have been bogged down with difficulties. I don’t believe in this. Those people are full of energy and they had come with the courage to do a lot of things. I don’t believe that I can have such colleagues who believe in status quo, who believe that it will be like this only, we have spent lifetime like this; such kind of person can’t be my colleague. There must be some spark in his heart. But if someone amongst us tries to revive the spirit of the person where some dust has settled. You see that those who are in the last 25, if they get a chance then perhaps the next time they will be the ones who will be in the top 25. 

Eventually, the human touch is more important than schemes in achieving the success and it is the human touch which creates team spirit. And it is human touch alone that strengthens the determination to realize the dreams. And that’s why I have said that it is our effort to get an opportunity to reward those who are good but those who are difficult then they should be called here in a positive environment and they should be given more love and encouragement. I too will understand this, because no one is lazy or worthless. Everybody has come with energy. What is required that we (harness) that energy.

Sometimes we would have seen that some electric bulb in the house doesn’t work. Sometimes the thought that straight away comes to mind is that its fuse is blown off. This bulb is useless. However, some wise person says: ‘just a minute, let’s check whether it’s disconnected?’ He repairs the plug and the bulb starts working. Whether that person sitting in the corner has got disconnected from us? Let’s check one more time, let’s connect a bit more and then again he will again start shining like electricity and will start giving the full light which is capable of changing others lives. 

Today, I have got the opportunity to dedicate two books here. One contains all the finer details of those who have been awarded with the Prime Minister’s Award and the other one is about aspirational districts. Now I believe that a large number of our officers are going to districts from our place. In a way the movement of going back to basics is going on. 

Even they would not have thought that there would be this kind of Prime Minister who would put them into the same kind of work. However, I see that nearly 1,000 officers should go to those remotest districts those that have been lagging behind according to the average of that state, and nearly 1,000 people have come forward. And these people have not come forward because of some order, they have come forward because of their self-inspiration. And it is this self-inspiration that makes me see that aspirational districts in the leading role. You see if we work for three years, if we work for three years by setting a target within that time frame then these one hundred and fifteen districts will become the driving force for the states and the country; this kind of strength is there in them. 

And everyone feels that whatever parameters we wanted to improve upon, because this experience is there if there is a district in the system and if it is pushed then our record improves whenever we need to present them. Brother! We had a target of 100 and we have achieved 80, but this 80 have been done in just one corner. 

The age of bicycles has gone, but during the earlier times when we used to fill air in our bicycles there used to be a meter to measure that how much air has been filled, so we came to know that now the bicycle will run. However, sometimes, there used to develop a balloon at one side of the bicycle’s tube and the meter used to show that the air has been filled in the right quantity. The meter was working well but whether the bicycle will run or not? Because on one side there is a balloon and the rest of the tube remained empty; and that balloon used to become an impediment. Sometimes, one or two districts in some states perform so well that the particular state looks very impressive in terms of statistics but that in itself becomes an impediment in the entire journey of development. 

Our effort is to push the journey of development in these one hundred and fifteen districts in an even manner. You see there will be results very soon. The biggest psychological impact which is created is that you people would have noticed that if there are three-four kids in a family and if one or two of them perform well then parents always focus on those children. If a guest comes then they present that child that it had secured so many marks in the 10th. He has got admission in the 12th. He is very good, he will become a doctor. And what about the rest two! Let’s not talk about them. But, what happens to those two kids ? They go down the path of despair because of our actions and then they end up losing the courage to stand up. 

The same thing has happened to these districts in our country as we presented performing districts so many times, we brought them up to the Prime Minister’s Awards. However, those which face difficulty there must be some reason behind it; there must be some local issues with them; now they feel that: ‘just leave it friends, we are not counted anywhere, we will somehow pass two-three years.’ And then he used to think about getting transferred from that place with the help of some politician and more lengthy the politician’s kurta, the more influential he will be. 

And, that’s why I believe that it’s very much needed for us that we just don’t give statistics. Instead of a big number in our graphics system a kind of strategic thinking is extremely essential for the success. If there is a strategic thinking then people keep drawing towards that automatically with a proper planning, and experience plays a role into that. And you would have seen that only those people succeed who have a tendency of working in detail. 

Have you ever seen a mother to measure salt in a weighing machine like gold while cooking vegetables? No, it doesn’t happen.  Even if she puts salt with her eyes closed, it will be the right quantity because at one point of time she had done the detailing and now that practice is there. Now she does these things with ease. If we develop a habit in our system then I believe that we can bring about a huge change. 

We need to bring up these aspirational districts in every parameter. We don’t have to make them a show piece by improving just one or two things. However, if it could have been done through the government system then it would have already been done long ago. It’s not like that there would not have been good officers in those districts. Even today it is possible that an officer who had  started his life in one of the aspirational districts and now perhaps, he has become the chief secretary of the same state. It means that the officer was talented; it means that he was outstanding; he might be in Delhi as a secretary of a very good department. It’s very much possible that there will be some officer who would have been praised by all around and he would be from the same backward district, and he would have come here by spending 25-27-30 important years of his career there. It does not mean that there was a dearth of talent. Every issue will be there. 

In a country like India, our democratic system is not a contract system for five years. Our democratic system, it means the relationship between us and the people, this thinking, this is one of the biggest hurdle. And that is why people’s participation is basis for the success for the countries like India - participatory democracy. We have seen, all of you would have worked at district level as an officer, that during the times of natural calamities we can do those things very easily what is called ‘quantum of work’. The system remains the same but it happens because during the times of calamities the entire society joins us. Everybody lends his hand and because of that we are able to come out of that problem. And I feel that how could we improve people’s participation in taking forward the country? How could we realize its importance? 

Unfortunately, this thing has been considered the job of an elected body; of the political leaders. This is the biggest flaw in our thinking. They will keep doing what they are required to do but we are the people in the system of governance about whom a common man never feels that he is doing something for himself. If I do anything then the first of all then: ‘Hmm, friends, 2019 is coming that’s why Modi Ji has come.’ It will instantly strike in their minds and this is the job of 24x7 that they keep injecting this thing. 

But if you go then it doesn’t look like this. If you go then they feel that: ‘it’s not like this, sahib has come, he is working so hard, it must be something worthwhile.’ He (common man) immediately connects with you people. And that is why the people those who are today at different level of our administrative system they should come forward to provide leadership. This is a new aspect and we should reflect upon it. 

Before independence, it was the job of administration to protect the British Raj. After the independence, the job of people related to administrative system is to make the common people prosperous and to rehabilitate them. If this is the dream then I believe that we can realize those dreams with which we have started our journey. And the objectives with which we have come out, this is the dream of a New India. It’s true that when Mahatma Gandhi launched the Champaran movement, when he sounded the bugle for independence then it did not appear that the independence would be achieved the next morning. And because independence was not to be achieved the next morning so Gandhi Ji should have kept quiet. It’s not like that. Today, independence is not to be achieved but there is hope, aspiration, desires, dreams and optimism in the heart of the common man which connects him with us for marching ahead. 

What could be a bigger inspiration than this that 75 years of independence will complete in the year 2022? We experience this thing in our family life, we know that the birthday of our kid will fall in the month of May so planning starts from February-March that what we should day on the birthday. Wise parents say that: ‘look this time your birthday is to be celebrated in a very grand manner. You should do this one thing, you should do this thing this month.’ He also feels that: ‘it’s my birth day, I should do this thing.’ If there is a marriage in the family then people feel that whitewash has not been done for several years, a fresh coat of paint has not been applied; it’s marriage time we will do this thing this time as there is a marriage. 

In everybody’s life there are this kind of milestones and due to those milestones the pace is being determined. For us there cannot be a bigger milestone than 2022 because the freedom fighters had sacrificed their lives for independence. There can’t be any bigger inspiration than this. 

Let us once again remember those whom we love and should remember whatever dreams they had. And we should march forward, we can do a lot for the country in the next five years. We can do a lot.  Those who would have fought for the independence they would not have thought that when the country would be free then I would become something. No. They also knew that by the time independence would be achieved they might or might not be there. However, he continued to sacrifice for his dreams. And since they sacrificed so we became fortunate to get independence. We also have some responsibility for the next generation. And that is why we should move forward with the system we have. 

Also, we will have to accept this thing that there will be a structure for us, there might be procedures for our decision making. I have experienced one thing, because I was fortunate to get the opportunity to work in state for a long period. In a way, I have been brought up amongst you people in the last 20 years. And I continued to learn from the experience of you people because I have spent time amongst you people. However, I have experienced this thing that despite an old structure if there is no innovation, if we do not speed up our decision making process, and, today, fortunately technology can compensate for our shortcomings, it can become our additional strength, we can thoroughly utilize technology for simplifying things. Can we accept those things?

You would be aware that when I had just come amongst you people then I had insisted a lot on this thing that: ‘how could we utilize the space technology in our governance?’ I had given this task to a joint secretary level officer and I kept pressing on that task during the weekends. So our officers paid attention to it. It’s not like that they don’t have any understanding of technology but they feel like going with the existing procedure; they feel like why should they change it, who will listen to them so they feel isolation in bringing about changes and they were not institutionalizing it. 

Now gradually it has been realized that ultimately space technology is an useful thing in governance. Whosoever applied his mind, he got one or two youth with him and asked them to apply their minds. Space technology has been playing a big role in doing the planning in detail.  

All these facilities were not there during the times of those officers who were there 20-25 years ago; we are fortunate that now these facilities are available to us. Can we use all kind of technologies that are available to us for our capacity building, for expanding our capacity and for expanding our reach? Can we do it? If we do those things then I’m confident that we can get the desired results and that is why the time demands…, when we were hearing that 21st century was about to approach; you people would have been junior officers at that time; you would have been working in the states. 

And a very interesting cartoon was published and it became very famous at that time. A gentleman was standing on a railway platform and a train was approaching from a distance so someone said to him: ‘brother, you don’t have to run, it’s about to reach here.’ It means that the 21st century was about to begin so you didn’t have to run. Two decades of 21st century are about to be completed, have we made any effort to change our decision making process and our systems as per the needs of the 21st century? 

Today, artificial intelligence has been discussed in a very detailed manner before you people. If you talk about artificial intelligence with people then by and largeit is confined to driverless cars. The world has changed a lot. It’s possible that we might not be able to do those things but it’s also a tool which can be of use and we will hire experts for that. But if we don’t have an open approach towards these things then what will they say. 

And today if we are not able to cope up with the changing technology for the biggest challenges facing the world and to realize the dreams of development then perhaps we will thoroughly lag behind. 

There is a perception in the world about India that we have made a huge contribution in the IT revolution. But it is unfortunate that if we became complacent because of that as we thought that we had achieved a very big thing. We became complacent at very basic level but the world has created a different world altogether by creating their own things from those things.  

It’s not going to work for us if we continue to sit and praise what is good with us.  I believe that it is going to play an extremely important role in the life of the common man and in the system of governance. If we can utilize those things then it will not only make our work easier but it will also create a long-term positive impact. 

When I had said: minimum government – maximum governance, then it’s the basis of any government’s success. Sometimes, it should be considered in your award giving process that which are the departments that have been implementing this thinking of the government - minimum government – maximum governance? 

Perhaps, I had said this thing somewhere. I don’t remember in which forum I had said this thing. Perhaps, it was a small meeting but when I was new here then I talked about it. 

It is being said in Hindu mythology that if you perform the pilgrimage of the four sacred places then you will attain salvation. I don’t know exactly where it has been mentioned. However, a file doesn’t reach to its logical conclusion even after moving to 32-32 desks. Don’t we feel that we should find some other way? And I don’t use the term shortcut because, perhaps, you people might not be getting a chance to travel in railways, but I have spent my entire life on railway tracks so I know that it used to be written there: ‘shortcut will cut you short.’ If there was a place from where a track could be crossed then it used to be written there that is why I’m not asking you people to adopt shortcuts. But don’t we feel that so many things that this file must come back from the other desk only it is foolproof? How long we will keep working like this? 

Is it a must that everybody should stamp on every file? Is it a must? Can we simplify these procedures? Whether the person who has worked on it in a proper manner? Whether it can become even more foolproof? It’s not like that if the procedures have been simplified then they will not remain foolproof. However, we are not able to get rid of these habits. We don’t change our habits. 

Even if it was a time of Whatsapp, even if it was a time of SMS and we would have sent a SMS to home: ‘today evening we will have guests; there will be two people for dinner.’ We would have sent the SMS at 3 in the noon but even then at 5 pm we will ask: ‘have you read my SMS?’ It means that we are not ready to trust the system and that’s why we have been spending extra energy. 

It is civil services day. It should be for doing introspection that whether in comparison with the world we have been working in the same direction or we have deviated from that path. Whether we are lagging behind too much in terms of speed in comparison with the world? Whether we will be in 2070 by thinking over the things that they will achieve in 2030? 

You can imagine that lest it happens in the eyes of the world that we reach to the situation of that aspirational district during our times. It’s a country full of potential, it is full of power and capability, it’s a country which has tendency to accept new things and it’s a country which has the strength to face the changing situation. Are we keeping ourselves alert for it? Whether the arms of a clock are driving my life or the dreams of a common man have been driving me? If the arms of a clock has been driving me then the salary will be credited on the first day of every month, the amount would be deposited in the bank account and the life will stuck there only. But if every moment of my life attaches itself with the common man then not only his dreams will be realized in any case but I will also go back after experiencing a kind of satisfaction generation after generation. If this kind of belief is there in me then I think that I can do a lot for the country. 

And that is why urge you people; some of you would have two years and someone will have one year or six months; someone will have five years or ten years and my young colleagues those who have been listening to me at remote locations with the help of technology, I would like to assure you that I am one of your colleagues. I don’t know what used to happen earlier but that thought has not even crossed my mind. I am not of that kind. I am a common man and your friend. I want to work with you people shoulder to shoulder. 

When I was required to visit Masoori then according to the program that was prepared I would visit the place, deliver a lecture and would come back. I said: ‘I will go there and I will spend time with them. At least I would see those people, at least I will see what kind of energy is there, what kind of dreams those people have who are going to be in-charge of at least 20 per cent districts of India in the next three years. At least I will discover myself, I will understand myself.’ And I came back from there after being filled with energy because everyone of them was young, full of energy. 

And I am prepared to work in this manner. And therefore I want to work with you people as a colleague. And we will together…and I don’t work for the elections, and please don’t worry about this, there will not be a single officer among you in any part of the country, I have not indicated for doing a single work to anybody by calling him over the phone despite spending 20 years in the system of governance. This is the hallmark of my life. And it is because I have no other dream in my life except my country. 

There is no other intention except to bring about change in the lives of 1.25 billion people. Wherever I was, in whichever system I got the opportunity to work then this was the effort to lead the life with this feeling of dedication. And friends, that is why I say that you are an exceptional lot in my life, you are full of capability and you have come with your experience. Your strength, your capability, your dreams, I want to make them my own so that we can see the realization of the dreams of 1.25 billion Indians. 

And with this sentiment let us dedicate this Civil Services Day today to the common man of the country and to his dreams. We should march ahead with this pledge. May the year 2022 become the year for taking India’s hopes and aspirations to a new high. I convey my best wishes to all of  you with this expectation. 

Thank you very much.

धरती के अंतस: में जो गहरा उतरेगा, उसी के नयनों में जीवन का राग दिखेगा

जिन पैरों में मिट्टी होगी, धूल सजेगी, उन्‍हीं के संग-संग इक दिन सारा विश्‍व चलेगा।’

‘रेलवे स्‍टेशन’ से आपका सफर शुरू होता है और आज ‘रॉयल पैलेस’ में आप खास मेहमान बने।

इस सफर को मोदीजी कैसे देखते हैं आप?

प्रधानमंत्री–प्रसून जी मैं सबसे पहले तो आप सबका आभारी हूं कि इतनी बड़ी तादाद में आपके दर्शन करने का मुझे सौभाग्‍य मिला है और आपने धरती की धूल से अपनी बात को शुरू किया है। आप तो कविराज हैं तो ‘रेलवे’ से ‘रॉयल पैलेस’, ये तुकबंदी आपके लिए बड़ी सरल है; लेकिन जिंदगी का रास्‍ता बड़ा कठिन होता है। जहां तक रेलवे स्‍टेशन की बात है, वो मेरी अपनी व्‍यक्तिगत जिंदगी की कहानी है। मेरी जिंदगी के संघर्ष का वो एक स्‍वर्णिम पृष्‍ठ है, जिसने मुझे जीना सिखाया, जूझना सिखाया और जिंदगी अपने लिए नहीं, ओरों के लिए भी हो सकती है। ये रेल की पटरियों पर दौड़ती हुई और उससे निकलती हुई आवाज से मैंने बचपन से सीखा, समझा; तो वो मेरी अपनी बात है। लेकिन ‘रॉयल पैलेस’, ये नरेन्‍द्र मोदी का नहीं है। ये मेरी कहानी नहीं है...

प्रसून जोशी– और जो भावना आपके अंदर....

प्रधानमंत्री– वो ‘रॉयल पैलेस’ सवा सौ करोड़ हिन्‍दुस्‍तानियों के संकल्‍प का परिणाम है। रेल की पटरी वाला मोदी, ये नरेन्‍द्र मोदी है। ‘रॉयल पैलेस’ सवा सौ करोड़ हिन्‍दुस्‍तानियों का एक सेवक है, वो  नरेन्‍द्र मोदी नहीं है। और ये भारत के लोकतंत्र की ताकत है, भारत के संविधान का सामर्थ्‍य है, कि जहां एक ऐसा एहसास होता है, कि वरना जो जगह कुछ परिवारों के लिए रिजर्व रहती है, और लोकतंत्र में अगर जनता-जनार्दन, जो ईश्‍वर का रूप है; वो फैसला कर ले तो फिर एक चाय बेचने वाला भी उनका प्रतिनिधि बन करके ‘रॉयल पैलेस’ में हाथ मिला सकता है।

प्रसून जोशी– ये जो व्‍यक्ति और नरेन्‍द्र मोदी, जो प्रधानमंत्री, देश का प्रतिनिधित्‍व करते हैं, ये दोनों एकमय हो जाते हैं, जब ऐसी जगह में आप होते हैं, या आप  स्वयं को देखते हैं कि मैं एक सफर कर चुका हूं या वो एकरस हो जाता है, सब मिल जाता है, और एक ही व्‍यक्ति रह जाता है?

प्रधानमंत्री–ऐसा है मैं वहां होता ही नहीं हूं। और मैं तो आदिशंकर के अद्ववैत के उस सिद्धांत को, किसी जमाने मेंउससे जुड़ा हुआ था तो मैं जानता हूं कि जहां मैं नहीं, तू ही तू है; जहां द्ववै नहीं है वहां द्वंद्व नहीं है, और इसलिए जहां द्ववैत नहीं है, और इसलिए अगर मैं मेरे भीतर के उस नरेन्‍द्र मोदी को ले करके जाता हूं तो शायद मैं देश के साथ अन्‍याय कर दूंगा। देश के साथ न्‍याय तब होता है कि मुझे अपने-आपको भुला देना होता है, अपने-आपको मिटा देना होता है। स्‍वयं को खप जाना होता है और तब जा करके वो पौधा खिलता है। बीज भी तो आखिर खप ही जाता है, जो वटवृक्ष को पनपाता है। और इसलिए आपने जो कहा वो मैं अलग तरीके से देखता हूं।

प्रसून जोशी– लेकिन जब देश की बात आती है तो आप उसको बहुत फोकस होकर देखते हैं और सब लोग आज बदलाव की बात करते हैं।  बदलाव पहले सोच में आता है फिर एक्‍शन में आता है, फिर एक प्रक्रिया से गुजरता है। आपसे बेहतर कौन जान सकता है इस बात को। पर बदलाव अपने साथ एक चीज और लेकर आता है, मोदीजी- अधीरता, आतुरता, बेसब्री, impatiens.

प्रधानमंत्री, अभी हम सबने देखा था और टविटर पर प्रशांत दीक्षित जी हैं, जिन्‍होंने एक प्रश्‍न पूछा भी है कि बहुत काम हो रहा है, roads बन रही हैं, रेलवे लाइन्‍स बिछ रही हैं, घर रफ्तार से बन रहे हैं। वो कहते हैं कि पहले अगर हमें दो कदम चलने की आदत थी, तो मोदीजी अब हम कई गुना ज्‍यादा चल रहे हैं, पर फिर भी बेसब्री- अभी, अभी, अभी क्‍यों नहीं की impatiens, इसे कैसे देखते हैं आप?

प्रधानमंत्री– मैं इसको जरा अलग तरीके से देखता हूं। जिस पल संतोष का भाव पैदा हो जाता है- बहुत हो गया, चलो यार इसी से गुजारा कर लेंगे, तो जिंदगी कभी आगे बढ़ती नहीं है। हर आयु में, हर युग में, हर अवस्‍था में कुछ न कुछ नया करने का, नया पाने का मकसद गति देता है, वरना तो मैं समझता हूं जिंदगी रुक जाती है। और अगर कोई कहता है कि बेसब्री बुरी चीज है तो मैं समझता हूं कि अब वो बूढ़े हो चुके हैं। मेरी दृष्टि से बेसब्री एक तरुणाई की पहचान भी है और आपने देखा होगा, जिसके घर में साइकिल है उसका मन करता है स्‍कूटर आ जाए तो अच्‍छा है; स्‍कूटर है तो मन करता है यार four wheeler आ जाए तो अच्‍छा है; ये अगर जज्‍बा ही नहीं है तो कल साइकिल भी चली जाएगी, तो कहेगा छोड़ो यार बस पर चले जाएंगे; तो वो जिंदगी नहीं है।

और मुझे खुशी है कि आज सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के दिल में एक उमंग, उत्‍साह, आशा, अपेक्षा, ये उभर करके बाहर आ रही है। वरना एक कालखंड था निराशा की एक गर्त में हम डूब गए थे। और ऐसा था, चलो छोड़ो यार, अब कुछ होने वाला नहीं है, होती है, चलती है। और मुझे खुशी है कि हमने एक ऐसा माहौल बनाया है कि लोग हमसे ज्‍यादा अपेक्षा कर रहे हैं। आपमें से जो लोग बहुत पहले भारत से निकले होंगे, शायद उनको पता नहीं होगा, लेकिन आज से 15-20 साल पहले जब अकाल की परिस्थिति पैदा होती थी तो गांव के लोग सरकारी दफ्तर में जा करके memorandum देते थे, और क्‍या मांग करते थे- कि इस बार अकाल हो जाए तो हमारे यहां मिट्टी खोदने का काम जरूर दीजिए, और हम रोड पर मिट्टी डालने का काम करना चाहते हैं ताकि हमारे यहां कच्‍ची सड़क बन जाए। उस समय उतनी ही बेसब्री थी कि जरा- एक तो अकाल आ जाए, अपेक्षा करते थे, अकाल आ जाए, और मिट्टी के गड्ढे खोदने का काम मिल जाए; और फिर एक रोड पर मिट्टी डालने का अवसर मिल जाए।

आज मेरा अनुभव है, मैं जब गुजरात में मुख्‍यमंत्री था, जिसके पास single lane road है, तो वो कहता है, अरे क्‍या मुख्‍यमंत्री जी, अब डबल रोड बनाइए ना। डबल बना था, अरे साहब, अब तो, ये क्‍या है, पेबल रोड होना चाहिए, पेबल रोड होना चाहिए।

मुझे बराबर याद है, मैं उच्‍छल निझर, गुजरात के एक दम आखिरी छोर के तहसील थे, वहां से कुछ tribal लोग एक बार मुझे मिलने आए। वो कहते हैं हमें पेबल रोड चाहिए। मैंने कहा, यार मैं तुम्‍हारे इलाके में कभी स्‍कूटर पर घूम रहा था, मैं बस में आता था। मैं सालों तक जंगलों में काम किया हूं। तुम्‍हारे यहां तो रोड तो है। बोले साहब, रोड तो है, लेकिन अब हम केले की खेती करते हैं और केले हमारे एक्‍सपोर्ट होते हैं। तो इस रोड पर हम जाते हैं तो ट्रक में केले दब जाते हैं। हमारा 20% नुकसान हो जाता है, हमें पेबल रोड चाहिए ताकि हमारे केले को कोई नुकसान न हो। मेरे देश के ट्रैवल के दिल में ये पैदा होना, ये बेसब्री पैदा होना, ये मेरे लिए प्रगति के बीज बोता है। और इसलिए मैं बेसब्री को बुरा नहीं मानता।

दूसरा, आपने परिवार में भी देखा होगा- तीन अगर बेटे हैं- मां-बाप तीनों को प्‍यार करते हैं। लेकिन काम होता है तो एक को कहते हैं, अरे यार जरा देख लो। जो करेगा, उसी को तो कहेंगे ना। अगर आज, आज देश मुझसे ज्‍यादा अपेक्षा रखता है, इसलिए रखता है कि उनको भरोसा  है, यार, आज नहीं तो कल, उसके दिमाग में भर तो, कभी तो करके रहेगा ही।

तो मैं समझता हूं कि- और ये बात सही है कि देश ने कभी सोचा नहीं था कि ये देश इतनी तेज गति से काम कर सकता है। वरना मान लिया था, पहले incremental change हो जाए तो भी संतोष हो जाता था, यार, चलो यार हो गया। अब उसको नहीं होता है, उसको होता है, अरे साहब, और पहले एक दिन में जितने रास्‍ते बनते थे, अब करीब-करीब तीन गुना हम बना रहे हैं, पहले जितना काम एक दिन में होता था, वो आज तीन गुना होने लगा है। रेल की पटरी डालनी हो, रेल की डबल लाइन करनी हो, solar energy लगानी हो, टॉयलेट बनाने का काम हो, हर चीज में। और इसलिए स्‍वाभाविक है कि देशवासियों को अपेक्षा है क्‍योंकि भरोसा है।

प्रसून जोशी– जी, तो ऐसा लगता है कि जब पहले रोड उन तक पहुंचती है और जब उन तक रोड पहुंच जाती है तो वो दुनिया तक पहुंचना चाहते हैं। तो ये आशाएं एक तरफ आप जगाने की बात करते हैं और इस बेसब्री को आपने बखूबी समझा और उसकी जो positive side है कि किस तरह से वो बेसब्री जो है, वो द्योतक है आगे बढ़ने की भावना का, वो आपने हमें समझाया।

प्रधानमंत्री, लोगों की बेसब्री तो एक तरफ है, लेकिन क्‍या कभी आप बेसब्र हो जाते हैं, सरकारी व्‍यवस्‍था जिसके साथ आप का काम करते हैं। सरकारी कामकाज के तरीकों से, या कभी निराशा होती है कि चीजें मोदीजी के हिसाब से, उस स्‍पीड से नहीं चल रही हैं? वो बुलेट ट्रेन की स्‍पीड से, जिस तरह से आपके मन में घटित होती?

प्रधानमंत्री– मुझे पता नहीं था कि कवि के भीतर भी कोई पत्रकार बैठा होता है। मैं मानता हूं जिस दिन मेरी बेसब्री खत्‍म हो जाएगी, उस दिन मैं इस देश के काम नहीं आऊंगा। मैं चाहता हूं मेरे भीतर वो बेसब्री बनी रहनी चाहिए, क्‍योंकि वो मेरी ऊर्जा है, वो मुझे ताकत देती है, मुझ दौड़ाती है। हर शाम सोता हूं तो दूसरे दिन का सपना ले करके सोता हूं और सुबह उठता हूं तो लग पड़ता हूं।

जहां तक निराशा का सवाल है, मैं समझता हूं कि जब खुद के लिए कुछ लेना, पाना, बनना होता है, तब वो आशा और निराशा से जुड जाता है। लेकिन जब आप ‘सर्वजन हिताय, सर्वजन सुखाय’ इस संकल्‍प को ले करके चलते हैं; मैं समझता हूं कि निराश कभी होने का कारण नहीं बनता है।

कुछ लोगों को कभी लगता है, छोड़ो यार कुछ होने वाला नहीं है, सरकार बेकार है, नियम बेकार हैं, कानून बेकार है, ब्‍यूरोक्रेसी बेकार है, तौर-तरीके बेकार हैं; आपको ऐसे एक set of person मिलेंगे जो यही बातें बताते हैं। मैं दूसरे प्रकार का इंसान हूं। मैं कभी-कभी कहता था, अगर एक गिलास में आधा भरा हुआ है- तो एक व्‍यक्ति मिलेगा जो कहेगा  गिलास आधा है, दूसरा कहेगा गिलास आधा भरा हुआ है, एक कहेगा- आधा खाली है। मुझे कोई पूछता है तो मैं कहता हूं- आधा पानी से भरा है, आधा हवा से भरा है।

और इसलिए, अब आप देखिए, वही सरकार, वही कानून, वही ब्यूरोक्रेट, वही तौर-तरीके; उसके बावजूद भी अगर चार साल का लेखा-जोखा लेंगे और आखिरकार आपको; मैं किसी दूसरी सरकार की आलोचना करने के लिए मंच का उपयोग नहीं करूंगा, और मुझे करना भी नहीं चाहिए। लेकिन समझने के लिए comparative study के लिए आवश्‍यक होता है कि भई गत दस साल में काम किस प्रकार से होता था उसको देखेंगे तब पता चलेगा कि चार साल में कैसे हुआ। तो आपको ध्‍यान में आएगा कि तब की निर्णय प्रक्रियाएं, आज की निर्णय प्रक्रियाएं; तब के एक्‍शन, आज के एक्‍शन; आपको आसमान-जमीन का अंतर दिखेगा। मतलब ये हुआ कि इन्‍हीं व्‍यवस्‍थाओं से, अगर आपके पास नीति स्‍पष्‍ट हो, नीयत साफ हो, इरादे नेक हों और ‘सर्वजन हिताय, सर्वजन सुखाय’ करने का इरादा हो तो इसी व्‍यवस्‍था के तहत आप इच्छित परिणाम ले सकते हैं।

ये मूलभूत मेरी सोच होने के कारण, ये तो है ही नहीं कि मैं जो चाहूं वो सब होता है, लेकिन नहीं भी होता है तो मैं निराश नहीं होता हूं क्‍योंकि मैं सोचता हूं क्‍यों नहीं हुआ, आगे इसको करने का रास्‍ता- मैं इस तरफ गया था, जरा नए तरीके से करूंगा, मैं करके रहता हूं।

प्रसून जोशी– मोदीजी, यहां पर हम एक सवाल लेना चाहते हैं जो  वीडियो के माध्‍यम से हम देखेंगे। प्रियंका वर्मा जी हैं दिल्‍ली से, वो, उन्‍होंने एक सवाल आपके लिए भेजा है। देखते हैं-

Prinkya -  मोदीजी, I am Priynka from Delhi, और मेरा भी आपसे एक सवाल है कि हम Government क्‍यों choose करते हैं ताकि सरकार हमारे लिए काम कर सके। लेकिन जब से आप आए हैं तब से तो सिस्‍टम बिल्‍कुल बदल ही गया है। आपने तो सरकार के साथ-साथ हम जैसे लोगों को भी काम पर लगा दिया है, जो कि बहुत अच्‍छी बात है। पर मेरा आपसे एक सवाल है कि ऐसा पहले क्‍यों नहीं होता था? Thank You.

प्रसून जोशी– ये जो सवाल पूछ रहीं हैं कि आप लोगों से लोगों को जोड़ते हैं, सरकार के काम के साथ। और चाहे वो गैस सब्सिडी की बात हो; कई चीजों में आप एक अपेक्षा रखते हैं जनता से, तो ये किस तरह का एक आपका?

प्रधानमंत्री–प्रियंका ने बहुत अच्‍छा सवाल पूछा है और देखिए आप 1857 से ले लीजिए 1947 तक। उसके पहले भी जा सकते हैं लेकिन मैं 1857पर जाता हूं। जब प्रथम स्‍वतंत्रता संग्राम हुआ 1857 का। आप कोई भी साल उठा लीजिए, सौ साल में कोई भी साल उठा लीजिए, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का कोई भी कोना उठा लीजिए। कोई न कोई देश की आजादी के लिए शहीद हुआ है, देश की आजादी के लिए मर-मिटने के लिए कुछ न कुछ किया है, किसी न किसी नौजवान ने अपनी जिंदगी जेल में बिता दी है। मतलब आजादी का संघर्ष किसी भी समय, किसी भी कोने में रुका नहीं था। लोग आते थे, भिड़ते थे, शहादत मोल लेते थे, आजादी की बात चलती रहती थी।

लेकिन महात्‍मा गांधी ने क्‍या किया? महात्‍मा गांधी ने इस पूरी भावना को एक नया रूप दे दिया। उन्‍होंने जन-सामान्‍य को जोड़ा। सामान्‍य से सामान्‍य व्‍यक्ति को कहते थे अच्‍छा भाई तुम्‍हें देश की आजादी चाहिए ना? ऐसा करो- तुम झाडू़ ले करके सफाई करो, देश को आजादी मिलेगी। तुम्‍हें आजादी चाहिए ना? तुम टीचर हो, अच्‍छी तरह बच्‍चों को पढ़ाओ, देश को आजादी मिलेगी। तुम प्रौढ़ शिक्षा कर सकते हो, करो। तुम खादी का काम कर सकते हो, करो। तुम नौजवानों को मिला करके प्रभात फेरी निकाल सकते हो, निकालो।

महात्‍मा गांधी ने आजादी को जन-आंदोलन में परिवर्तित कर दिया। जन-सामान्‍य को उसकी क्षमता के अनुसार काम दे दिया। तुम रेटियां ले करके बैठ जाओ, सूत कातो, देश को आजादी मिल जाएगी। और लोगों को भरोसा हो गया, हां यार, आजादी इससे भी आ सकती है।

मैं समझता हूं कि मरने वालों की कमी नहीं थी, देश के लिए मर-मिटने वालों की नहीं थी, लेकिन वो आते थे शहीद हो जाते थे, फिर कोई नया खड़ा होता था, शहीद हो जाता था।

गांधीजी ने एक साथ हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हर कोने में कोटि-कोटि जनों को खड़ा कर दिया जिसके कारण आजादी प्राप्‍त करना सरल हो गया। विकास भी, मैं मानता हूं जन-आंदोलन बन जाना चाहिए। अगर ये कोई सोचता है कि सरकार देश बदल देगी, सरकार विकास कर देगी; आजादी के बाद एक ऐसा माहौल बन गया, आजाद हो गए, सब सरकार करेगी।  गांव में एक गड्ढा भी हो, गड्ढा हुआ हो तो गांव के लोग मिलेंगे, memorandum तैयार करेंगे, एक जीप किराये पर लेंगे, तहसील के अंदर जाएंगे, memorandum देंगे। जीप किराये पर करने के खर्चे में चाहते तो वो गड्ढा भर जाता, लेकिन अब वो सरकार करेगी।

आजादी के बाद एक माहौल बन गया, से सब कौन करेगा, सरकार करेगी। इसके कारण धीरे-धीरे क्‍या हुआ, जनता और सरकार के बीच दूरी बढ़ती गई। आपने देखा- बस में भी कोई जाता है, आप लोगों ने अनुभव किया होगा- बस में अकेला बैठा है, अगल-बगल में कोई पैसेंजर  नहीं है, रास्‍ता काटना है तो वो क्‍या करता है- वो सीट के अंदर अंगुली डालता है। उसके अंदर एक छेद कर देता है, और धीरे-धीरे-धीरे उसको काटता रहता है बैठा-बैठा, ऐसे कुछ नहीं। लेकिन जिस पल उसको पता चले कि ये बस सरकार की है मतलब मेरी है, ये सरकार मेरी है, देश मेरा है, ये भाव लुप्‍त हो चुका है।

मैं चाहता हूं कि देश में ये भाव बहुत प्रबल होना चाहिए। दूसरा, लोकतंत्र, ये कोई contract agreement नहीं है कि मैंने आज ठप्‍पा मारा, वोट दे दिया, अब पांच साल बेटे काम करो, पांच साल के बाद पूछूंगा क्‍या किया है और न तो दूसरे को ले आऊंगा। ये labour contract नहीं है। ये भागीदारी का काम है और इसलिए मैं मानता हूं कि participative democracy, इस पर बल देना चाहिए। और आपने अनुभव किया होगा जब natural calamity होती है, सरकार से ज्‍यादा समाज की शक्ति लग जाती है और हम कुछ ही पलों में देखते हैं कि वो समस्‍या के समाधान निकालने में ताकत आ जाती है, क्‍यों? जनता-जनार्दन की ताकत बहुत होती है। लोकतंत्र में जनता पर जितना भरोसा करेंगे, जनता को जितना ज्‍यादा जोड़ेंगे, परिणाम मिलेगा।

सरकार बनने के बाद मैंने टॉयलेट बनाने का अभियान चलाया। आप कल्‍पना करें सरकार बना पाती? सरकार तो पहले पांच हजार बनाती होगी अब दस हजार बना लेती। कहेगी अरे पुरानी सरकार पांच हजार बनाती थी मोदी की दस हजार। दस हजार से काम कब पूरा होगा भाई?  जनता ने उठा लिया, काम पूरा हो गया।

और जनता की ताकत देखिए, भारत में सीनियर सिटिजन के लिए रेलवे के अंदरconcession है टिकटों में। मैंने आ करके सरकार में कहा कि भाई अंदर लिखो तो सही, आप जो रिजर्वेशन के लिए फॉर्म भरते हो, लिखो तो सही कि भई मैं सीनियर सिटिजन हूं, मुझे बेनिफिट मिलता है, लेकिन मैं मेरा बेनिफिट जाने देना चाहता हूं। सिम्‍पल सा था, प्रधानमंत्री के लेवल पर मैंने कभी अपील भी नहीं की थी। आप सबको आश्‍चर्य होगा, जो हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की विशेषता देखी है, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के सामान्‍य मानवी की देशभक्ति देखी है, अभी-अभी हमने ये निर्णय किया था, अब तक 40 लाख senior citizens, जो एसी में ट्रैवल करने वाले लोग हैं, उन्‍होंने voluntarily subsidy नहीं लेंगे, ऐसा लिख करके दिया और वो पूरी टिकट ले करके जाते थे।

अगर मैं कानूनन करता कि आप सीनियर सिटिजन को AC कोच में ये बेनिफिट बंद तो जुलूस निकलता, पुतले जलते और फिर? फिर popularity rating आता, मोदी गिर गया। ये दुकान जल जाती। लेकिन आपने देखा होगा 40 लाख लोग।

मैंने एक दिन लालकिले पर से कहा- कि जो afford करते हैं, उनको गैस सब्सिडी क्‍यों लेनी चाहिए? हमारे देश में गैस सिलेंडर की संख्‍या के आधार पर चुनाव लड़े जाते थे। कोई कहते थे कि मुझे प्रधानमंत्री बनाइए, अभी 9 सिलेंडर मिलते हैं, मैं 12 सिलेंडर दूंगा; ये घोषणा की गई थी 2014 में। मैंने लोगों को उलटा कहा, मैंने कहा भाई जरूरत  नहीं है तो छोड़ दीजिए ना सब्सिडी, क्‍या जरूरत है। और आप हैरान हो जाएंगे, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के करीब-करीब सवा करोड़ से ज्‍यादा परिवारों ने गैस सब्सिडी छोड़ दी। देश में ईमानदार लोगों की कमी नहीं है। देश के लिए जीने-मरने वाले, कुछ न कुछ करने वालों की कमी नहीं है।

हम लोगों का काम है देश के सामर्थ्‍य को समझना, उनको जोड़ना और मेरी ये कोशिश है कि हमने, सरकार ने ही देश चलाना है, ये सरकार को जो अहंकार है, उस अहंकार को सरकारों ने छोड़ देना चाहिए। जनता-जनार्दन ही शक्ति हैं, उनको ले करके चलें। हम चाहें, वैसा परिणाम जनता ला करके दे देगी और इसलिए मैं जनता के साथ मिल करके काम करने के विचार को ले करके आगे बढ़ रहा हूं।

प्रसून जोशी–वाह, मोदीजी, दो लाइने वो पुरानी याद आ रही हैं कि हम नीची नजर, जो ये सरकार और जनता के बीच की दूरी जो हो गई थी-

कि हम नीची नजर करके देखत हैं चरण तुमरे, तुम जाइके बैठे हो इक ऊंची अटरिया मां।

प्रधानमंत्री– मैं तो जनता-जनार्दन से यही प्रार्थना करूंगा कि आप हमें आशीर्वाद दीजिए, कम से कम मुझे वो आदत न आ जाए।

प्रसून जी – मोदीजी बिल्‍कुल ये। ये एक सवाल हम लेते हैं इसके बाद आते हैं। आप अभी, जी-जी जरूर आप कहिए-

ऑर्डियन्‍स में से एक सवाल की हमें रिक्‍वेसट थी- श्री मयूरेश ओझानी जी एक प्रश्‍न पूछना चाहते हैं। मयूरेश ओझानी जी अपना सवाल पूछें। कृपया इस तरफ आएं।

प्रधानमंत्री– शायद एंट्री नहीं मिली होगी, कोई भी कहेगा मैं मयूरेश हूं। और दो-चार थे, खड़े हो जाएंगे।

प्रश्‍नकर्ता - नमसते मोदी जी। जब आपने सर्जिकल स्‍ट्राइक करने का अति महत्‍वपूर्ण, ऐतिहासिक और हिम्‍मतभरा कदम लिया था तब आपके मन में कैसी भावना उछल रही थी?

प्रसून जोशी–सर्जिकल स्‍ट्राइक पर आपका सवाल है।

प्रधानमंत्री– मैं आपका आभारी हूं कि आप वाणी से अपनी भावनाओं को प्रकट नहीं कर पा रहे हैं लेकिन आपने एक्‍शन से अपनी भावनाओं को प्रकट किया और शब्‍दों से आपके साथी ने मुझे बात को पहुंचाया। एक तो ये दृश्‍य अपने-आप में हृदय को छूने वाला है, it touched me. भगवान रामचंद्र जी और लक्ष्‍मण का जो संवाद है, लंका छोडते समय, तब भी उन सिद्धांतों को हमने देखा है। लेकिन जब कोई टेरे‍रिज्‍म एक्सपोर्ट करने का उद्योग बना करके बैठा हो, मेरे देश के निर्दोष नागरिकों को मौत के घाट उतार दिया जाता हो, युद्ध लड़ने की ताकत नहीं है, पीठ पर वार करने के प्रयास होते हों; तो ये मोदी है, उसी भाषा में जवाब देना जानता है।

हमारे जवानों को, टैंट में सोए हुए थे रात में, कुछ बुजदिल आकर उनको मौत के घाट उतार दें? आप में से कोई चाहेगा मैं चुप रहूं? क्‍या उनको ईंट का जवाब पत्‍थर से देना चाहिए कि नहीं देना चाहिए? और इसलिए सर्जिकल स्‍ट्राइक किया और मुझे मेरी सेना पर गर्व है, मेरे जवानों पर गर्व है। जो योजना बनी थी, उसको शत-प्रतिशत तसू भर गलती किए बिना उन्‍होंने implement किया और सूर्योदय होने से पहले सब वापिस लौट कर आ गए। और हमारी नेकदिली देखिए- मैंने हमारे अफसर जो इसको ऑपरेट कर रहे थे, उन्‍हें कहा, कि आप हिन्‍दुस्‍तान को पता चले उससे पहले, मीडिया वहां पहुंचे उससे पहले, पाकिस्‍तान की फौज को फोन करके बता दो कि आज रात हमने ये किया है, ये लाशें वहां पड़ी होंगी, तुम्‍हें समय हो तो जा करके ले आओ।

हम सुबह 11 बजे से उनको फोन लगाने की कोशिश कर रहे थे, फोन पर आने से डरते थे, आ नहीं रहे थे। मैं इधर पत्रकारों को बुला करके रखा हुआ था, हमारे आर्मी अफसर खड़े थे, पत्रकारों को आश्‍चर्य हो रहा था कि क्‍या बात है हमको बुलाया है, कोई बता नहीं रहे हैं।

मैंने कहा, पत्रकार बैठे हैं उनको बिठाइए, थोड़े वो नाराज हो जाएंगे, लेकिन सबसे पहले पाकिस्‍तान से बात करो, हमने किया है; छुपाया नहीं हमने। 12 बजे वो टेलीफोन पर आए, उनसे बात हुई, उनको बताया गया- ऐसा-ऐसा हुआ है और हमने किया है, और तब जा करके हमने हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के मीडिया को और दुनिया को बताया कि भारत की सेना का ये अधिकार था न्‍याय को प्राप्‍त करने का और हमने किया। तो सर्जिकल स्‍ट्राइक, ये भारत के वीरों का तो पराक्रम था ही था, लेकिन टेरेरिज्‍म एक्‍सपोर्ट करने वालों को पता होना चाहिए कि अब हिन्‍दुस्‍तान बदल चुका है।

प्रसून जोशी– मोदीजी, जब आपने वीरता की बात की, सेना की बात की। सेना के इतने त्‍याग के बाद भी वहां पर हम राजनीति का प्रवेश होता देखते हैं। सेना की वीरता पर लोग प्रश्‍नचिन्‍ह लगाने को तैयार हो जाते हैं। ये, इसको कैसे देखते हैं आप?

प्रधानमंत्री- देखिए, फिर एक बार मैं इस मंच का उपयोग राजनीतिक प्रतिद्वद्वियों के लिए आलोचना करने के लिए उपयोग करना नहीं चाहता हूं। मैं इतना ही कहूंगा- ईश्‍वर सबको सद्बुद्धि दे।

प्रसून जोशी–मोदीजी, ये तो बात हुई, हमने बदलाव की की, बेसब्री की की। कहते है जहां न पहुंचे रवि, वहां पहुंचे कवि। कवि होने के नाते नहीं कह रहा हूं। सच्‍ची प्रगति वही है जो सब तक पहुंचे। कोई भी सभ्‍यता- आपने अभी कहा। जिस तरह से आपने बुजुर्गों की बात की, व्‍यंग्‍य की बात की। कोई भी सभ्‍यता स्‍वयं पर गर्व नहीं कर सकती अगर वो समाज के vulnerable ends  का ध्‍यान नहीं रख पाती है। कार्यक्रम के इस हिस्‍से में हम बात करना चाहते हैं उन वर्गों की जो शायद होकर भी हमें नहीं दिखाई देते थे। बड़ी-बड़ी योजनाओं के शोर में जिनके हित कहीं खो जाते थे। जैसे ढोल के स्‍वर में बांसुरी का स्‍वर कहीं मंथर लगता है।

प्रधानमंत्रीमोदीजी, आपने लालकिले से पहली बार टॉयलेट जैसे मुद्दे पर बात की। किसी प्रधानमंत्री ने पहली बार ऐसे अहम मुद्दे को, पर जो छोटा लगने वाला, छोटा दिखने वाला मुद्दा हो, पर बहुत अहम हो, उसे प्राथमिकता दी, ये हमने देखा। ये जो प्राथमिकताएं बदली हैं, ये प्राथमिकताएं जो आप decide करते हैं, ये किस तरह decide करते हैं, और ये issues कैसे ऊपर आए?

प्रधानमंत्री- देखिए, मैं ये तो नहीं कहूंगा कि आजादी के 70 साल में किसी सरकार का इन विषयों पर ध्‍यान ही नहीं था, ये कहना तो उनके साथ अन्‍याय होगा। तो मैं उस प्रकार से बात करता नहीं हूं और मैंने तो लालकिले से ये भी कहा था कि आज हिन्‍दुस्‍तान जहां है वहां देश आजाद होने से लेकर सभी सरकारों का, सभी प्रधानमंत्रियों का, सभी राज्‍य सरकारों का, सभी मुख्‍यमंत्रियों का, हर जन-प्रतिनिधि का कोई  न कोई योगदान है- ये मैंने लालकिले पर से कहा था और मैं इसको मानता हूं। लेकिन क्‍या कारण है कि इतनी योजनाएं हैं, इतना धन खर्च हो रहा है, सामान्‍य मानवी की‍ जिंदगी में बदलाव क्‍यों नहीं आता है?

महात्‍मा गांधी ने हम लोगों को एक सिद्धांत दिया था और मैं समझता हूं किसी भी developing country के लिए इससे बढ़िया कोई सिद्धांत नहीं हो सकता है। महात्‍मा गांधी ने कहा था, कोई भी नीति बनाएं तो उस तराजू से तोलिए कि उसका जो आखिरी छोर पर बैठा हुआ इंसान है,  उसकी जिंदगी में उस नीति का क्‍या प्रभाव होगा। मुझे महात्‍मा गांधी की ये बात मेरे गले उतर गई है कि हम नीतियां कितनी ही बढ़ाएं, बड़ी-बड़ी बात करें, लेकिन भाई जिसके लिए बना रहे हैं, वो समाज का आखिरी छोर का व्‍यक्ति, उस पर पहुंचने में हम कहां जा रहे हैं।

मैं जानता हूं मैंने ऐसे कठिन काम सिर पर लिए हैं, हो सकता है उन्‍हीं मेरे कामों को कोई negative paintभी कर सकता है, लेकिन क्‍या इसलिए इन कामों को छोड़ देना चाहिए क्‍या? गरीब जहां पड़ा है पड़े रहने देना चाहिए क्‍या? और तब जा करके आप मुझे कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं जब किसी छोटी बालिका पर बलात्‍कार होता है कितनी दर्दनाक घटना है जी। लेकिन क्‍या हम ये कहेंगे कि तुम्‍हारी सरकार में इतने होते थे, मेरी सरकार में इतने होते हैं? मैं समझता हूं इससे बड़ा गलत रास्‍ता नहीं हो सकता है। बलात्‍कार, बलात्‍कार होता है, एक बेटी के साथ ये अत्‍याचार कैसे सहन कर सकते हैं? और इसलिए मैंने लालकिले पर से नए तरीके से इस विषय को पेश किया था। मैंने कहा अगर बेटी शाम को देर से आती है तो हर मां-बाप पूछते हैं, कहां गई थी? क्‍यों गई थी? किसको मिली थी? फोन पर बात करते हुए मां देखती है, हे-बात बंद करो, किससे बात कर रही हो? क्‍यों बात कर रही हो?

अरे भाई, बेटियों को तो सब पूछ रहे हो, कभी बेटों को भी तो पूछो, कहां गए थे? ये बात मैंने लालकिले से कही थी। और मैं मानता हूं ये बुराई समाज की है, व्‍यक्ति की है, विकृति है, सब होने के बावजूद भी देश के लिए चिंता का विषय है। और ये पाप करने वाला किसी का तो बेटा है। उसके घर में भी तो मां है।

उसी प्रकार से आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं कि आजादी के इतने सालों के बाद भारत में sanitation का कवर 35-40 percent के आस-पास था। क्‍या आज भी हमारी माताओं-बहनों को, क्‍योंकि मैं, देखिए ये चीजें, का एक और कारण भी है- मुझे किताब पढ़के गरीबी सीखनी नहीं पड़ रही है।  मुझे टीवी के पर्दे पर गरीबी का अहसास करना नहीं है, मैं वो जिंदगी को जी करके आया हूं। गरीबी क्‍या होती है, पिछड़ापन क्‍या होता है, गरीबी की जिंदगी से कैसी जद्दोजहद होती है, वो मैं देखकर आया हूं।

और इसलिए, इसलिए मैं मन से मानता हूं- राजनीति अपनी जगह पर है, मेरी समाज नीति कहो, मेरी राष्‍ट्रनीति कहो, मुझे कहती हैं कि इनकी जिंदगी में कुछ तो बदलाव लाऊं मैं। और तब जाकर मैंने लालकिले से कहा कि हम 18 हजार गांव, जहां अभी तक बिजली नहीं पहुंची है, इसका मतलब बाकी गांवों में पहुंची है। जिन्‍होंने पहुंचाई है उनको सौ-सौ सलाम। लेकिन 70 साल के बाद 18 हजार में न पहुंचना, ये भी तो जिम्‍मेवारी हम लोगों को लेनी चाहिए।

और मैंने सरकारी दफ्तर से कहा, मैंने कहा- कब करोगे भाई? तो किसी  ने कहा सात साल लगेंगे। मैंने कहा- मैं सात साल इंतजार नहीं कर सकता। और मैंने लालकिले से घोषणा कर दी- मैं 1000 दिन में काम पूरा करना चाहता हूं। कठिन काम था, दुर्गम इलाके थे, कहीं तो extremist लोग, माओवादियों का इलाका था। 18 हजार गांवों में बिजली पहुंचाने का काम करीब-करीब पूरा हुआ। अब शायद डेढ़ सौ, पौने दो सो गांव बाकी हैं।, काम चल रहा है।

आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं कि गरीब मां शौचालय जाने के लिए सूर्योदय से पहले जंगल जाने के लिए सोचती हैं और दिन में कभी जाना पड़े, शारीरिक पीड़ा सहती हैं लेकिन सूरज ढलने तक का इंतजार करती हैं। वो शौचालय के लिए नहीं जाती हैं। उस मां को कितनी पीड़ा होती होगी? कितना दर्द होता होगा? उसके शरीर पर कैसा जुल्‍म होता होगा? क्‍याहम टॉयलेट नहीं बना सकते? ये सवाल मुझे सोने नहीं देते थे। और तब जा करके मुझे लगा कि मैं लालकिले पर से जा करके अपनी भावनाओं को बिना लाग-लपेट बता दूंगा, जिम्‍मेदारी बहुत बड़ी होगी। लेकिन मैंने देखा कि देश ने बहुत response दे दिया। जो मेरा करीब, आज तीन लाख गांव open defecation free हो गए और काम तेजी से चल रहा है। और इसलिए last miles delivery, ये लोकतंत्र में सरकारों की प्राथमिक जिम्‍मेवारी है।

और इसी प्रकार अभी जैसे मैंने एक बीड़ा उठाया है- पहले उठाया बीड़ा, गांव में बिजली पहुंचाऊंगा। अब बीड़ा उठाया है घर में बिजली पहुंचाऊंगा। चार करोड़ परिवार ऐसे हैं। भारत में टोटल 25 करोड़ परिवार हैं, सवा सौ करोड़ जनसंख्‍या है लेकिन करीब-करीब 25 करोड़ परिवार हैं। आजादी के 70 साल बाद चार करोड़ परिवारों में आज भी 18वीं शताब्‍दी की जिंदगी है। वो दीया जला करके गुजारा करते हैं।

मैंने बीड़ा उठाया है। सौभाग्‍य योजना के तहत मुफ्त में उन चार करोड़ परिवारों में बिजली का कनेक्‍शन दूंगा। उनके बच्‍चे बिजली में पढ़ेंगे, उनके घर में अगर कम्‍प्‍यूटर चलाना है, मोबाइल चार्ज करना है तो दुनिया से जुड़ेंगे। टीवी लाने का खर्चा मिल जाएगा तो टीवी देखेंगे, बदलती हुई दुनिया देखेंगे। वो दुनिया के साथ जुड़ने के लिए उनके अंदर भी बेसब्री मुझे पैदा करनी है। उनके अंदर वो बेसब्री पैदा करनी है ताकि वो भी कुछ करने के लिए मेरे साथ जुड़ जाएं और वही तो empowerment है। मैं गरीबों का empowerment करके गरीबी से लड़ाई लड़ने के लिए मेरे साथियों की एक नई फौज तैयार करना चाहता हूं, जो फौज गरीबों से निकली होगी और गरीबी के खिलाफ लड़ाई लड़ेगी और तब जा करके गरीबी मिटेगी। गरीबी हटाओ के नारे से नहीं होता है।

प्रसून जोशी–मोदीजी, आप पूरी मेहनत कर रहे हैं, ये सब मानते हैं पर क्‍या अकेले आप देश बदल पाएंगे?

प्रधानमंत्री- देखिए, मैं मेहनत करता हूं, ये बात आपने कही, मैं समझता हूं देश में इस विषय में कोई विवाद नहीं है। मैं मेहनत करता हूं ये मुद्दा ही नहीं है; अगर न करता तो मुद्दा है। मेरे पास पूंजी है प्रमाणिकता। सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों ने मुझे यहॉं बढ़ाया है। न मेरी कोई जाति है न मेरा कोई वंशवाद है कि- मेरे पिता जी कुछ थे या मेरे दादा जी कुछ थे या मेरे नाना जी कुछ थे। कुछ नहीं है जी, तो मेरे पास पूंजीएक ही है। कठोर परिश्रम। मेरे पास पूंजी हैप्रमाणिकता। मेरे पास पूँजी है मेरे सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों का प्‍यार और इसलिए मुझे ज्‍यादा से ज्‍यादा मेहनत करनी चाहिए। और मैं देशवासियों को कहना चाहूंगा कि मैं भी आपके जैसा ही एक सामान्‍य नागरिक हूं। मुझमें वो सारी कमियां हैं जो एक सामान्‍य मानवी में होती हैं।

प्रसून जोशी–जी 16 घंटे तो काम नहीं करते सामान्‍य

प्रधानमंत्री- कृपा करके कोई मुझे अलग न समझो। आप मुझे अपने जैसा ही मान लो, और हकीकत है। मैं किस जगह पर बैठा हूं, वो तो एक व्‍यवस्‍था का हिस्‍सा है, लेकिन मैं वही हूं जो आप हैं। आपसे मैं अलग नहीं हूं। मेरे भीतर एक विद्यार्थी है। और मैं, मेरे शिक्षकों का बहुत आभारी हूं कि बचपन में मुझे उन्‍होंने ये रास्‍ता सिखाया कि मेरे भीतर के विद्यार्थी को कभी मरने नहीं दिया। और मुझे जो दायित्‍व मिलता है उसे मैं सीखने की कोशिश करता हूं, समझने की कोशिश करता हूं। गलतियां नहीं होंगी, मैं जब चुनाव लड़ रहा था तो मैंने देशवासियों को कहा था, कि मेरे पास अनुभव नहीं है। मुझसे गलतियां हो सकती हैं। लेकिन मैंने देशवासियों को विश्‍वास दिया था कि मैं गलतियां कर सकता हूं लेकिन बदइरादे से गलत कभी नहीं करूंगा।

लंबे समय तक longest service Chief Minister के रूप में गुजरात में काम करने का मौका मिला, अब चार साल होने आए हैं, प्रधानमंत्री का, प्रधान सेवक का काम मुझे मिल गया है। लेकिन गलत इरादे से कोई काम नहीं करूंगा, मैंने देश को वादा किया है।

अब सवाल ये है, मैंने कभी नहीं सोचा है कि देश मैं बदल दूंगा, ये कभी नहीं सोचा है। लेकिन मेरे भीतर एक भरपूर विश्‍वास पड़ा है कि मेरे देश में अगर लाखों समस्‍याएं हैं तो सवा सौ करोड़ समाधान भी हैं। अगर मिलियन problems हैं तो बिलियन solutions भी हैं। सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की शक्ति पर मेरा भरोसा है और मैंने अनुभव किया है कि कोई कल्‍पना कर सकता है- नोटबंदी। आप अगर टीवी खोल करके देखोगे तो नोटबंदी मतलब मुझे अर्जेन्‍टीना के राष्‍ट्रपति मिले थे तो वो कह रहे थे मोदीजी- मेरे अच्‍छे दोस्‍त हैं। बोले मैं और मेरी पत्‍नी बात कर रहे थे कि मेरा दोस्‍त गया। मैंने कहा, क्‍यों, क्‍या हुआ?  अरे, बोले यार तुमने जब नोटबंदी की, तो क्‍योंकि वेनेजुएला में उसी समय चल रहा था, उनके पड़ोसी हैं लोग तो उनको पता था।

तो बोले, मेरी पत्‍नी और हम दोनों चर्चा करते थे कि मेरा दोस्‍त गया। 86% currency कारोबारी व्‍यवस्‍था से बाहर हो जाए, टीवी के पर्दे पर लगातार सरकार के खिलाफ धुंआधार आक्रमण हो, लेकिन ये देशवासियों के प्रति मेरा भरोसा था, क्‍योंकि देश, मेरा देश ईमानदारी के लिए जूझ रहा है। मेरा सामान्‍य देश का नागरिक र्इमानदारी के लिए कष्‍ट झेलने को तैयार है, करने को तैयार है। अगर ये मेरे देश की ताकत है तो मुझे उस ताकत के अनुरूप अपनी जिंदगी को ढालना चाहिए। और उसी का नतीजा है कि आज जितने भी परिणाम आप देखते हैं, मोदी तो निमित्‍त है और actually मोदी की जरूरत है यहां। जरूरत क्‍या है, किसी को भी पत्‍थर मारना है तो मारेंगे किसको भाई?  किसी को कूड़ा-कचरा फैंकना है तो फेंकेंगे कहां जी? किसी को गालियां देनी हैं तो देंगे किसको?

तो मैं अपने-आपको सौभाग्‍यशाली मानता हूं कि मेरे सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों पर कोई पत्‍थर नहीं पड़ रहे हैं, कोई कीचड़ नहीं उछाल रहा, कोई गालियां नहीं दे रहा है। मैं अकेला हूं, लेता रहता हूं, झेलता रहता हूं। और मैं आपकी तरह कवि तो नहीं हूं लेकिन हर युग में कोई न कोई कुछ तो लिखते ही रहते हैं। आपमें से सबने लिखा होगा। लेकिन हम सब कवि नहीं बन सकते। वो तो प्रसून ही बन सकते हैं। लेकिन मैंने कभी लिखा था।

प्रसून जोशी–जी

प्रधानमंत्री- क्‍योंक मैं ऐसी जिंदगी गुजार करके आया हूं तो मेरी जिंदगी में ये सब झेलना बड़ा स्‍वाभाविक था। हम ठोकरे खाते-खाते आए हैं जी। बहुत प्रकार की परेशानियों से निकल करके आए हैं तो मैंने लिखा था कि जो लोग मुझे – मुझे पूरी कविता के शब्‍द आज याद नहीं लेकिन किसी को रुचि होगी तो मेरी एक किताब है जरूर आप देख लेना। मैंने उसमें लिखा था-

‘’जो लोग मुझे पत्‍थर फेंकते हैंमुझ पर मैं उन पत्‍थरों से ही पक्‍थी बना देता हूं और उसी पक्‍थी पर चढ़ करके आगे चलता हूं।‘’

और इसलिए मेरा concept रहा है Team India, सिर्फ सरकार में बैठे हुए लोग नहीं। ब्‍यूरोक्र्रेसी है, राज्‍य सरकार है, federal structure के लिए मेरी बहुत बड़ी प्राथमिकता है। Co-operative federalism को मैंने competitive co-operative federalism की दिशा में ले जाने का प्रयास किया है

मैंने अभी देश के 115 districts, aspiration districts को identify किया है। मैं उनको प्रेरणा जगा रहा हूं कि आप अपने स्‍टेट की जो एवरेज है, वहां तक आ जाओ, मैं आपके साथ खड़ा हूं। मैं उनको उत्‍साह बढ़ा रहा हूं और वो कर रहे हैं। और उसी का परिणाम है कि टॉयलेट का लक्ष्‍य करता हूं, पूरा हो जाता है। 18 हजार गांवों में बिजली, कोई मोदी खंभा डालने गया था क्‍या? खंभा डालने के लिए मेरे देशवासी गए थे। बिजली पहुंचाने वाले मेरे देशवासी गए थे। और इसलिए महात्‍मा गांधी की वो बात जिसे मैंने एक मंत्र के रूप में लिया है कि आजादी के लिए दीवाने बहुत थे, आजादी के लिए मरने वाले लोग भी बहुत थे, और उनकी त्‍याग-तपस्‍या को कोई कम नहीं आंक सकता है, उनकी शहादत को कोई कम नहीं आंक सकता है। लेकिन गांधी ने आजादी को जन–आंदोलन बना दिया, मैं विकास को जन–आंदोलन बना रहा हूं।

मोदी अकेला कुछ नहीं करेगा और मोदी ने कुछ नहीं करना चाहिए, लेकिन देश सब कुछ करे और मोदी में। और सरकारें कभी-कभी तो मैं कहता था, जब मैं गुजरात में था तो बात करता था, मैंने कहा- हमारा देश ऐसा है कि सरकार रुकावट बनना बंद कर दे ना तो भी देश बहुत आगे बढ़ जाता है। उन मूलभूत विचारों से मैं चलने वाला इंसान हूं।

प्रसून जोशी–कविता की आपने बात की तो आपको सामने देखकर एक कविता मैं सुना देता हूं। जो कविता, मतलब मैं कहूंगा कि भारत पर तो बहुत ही खरी उतरती है। आप पर भी बहुत खरी उतरती है। कहीं आप समझें कि मैं क्‍या कह रहा हूं-

‘कि सर्प क्‍यों इतने चकित हो? सर्प क्‍यों इतने चकित हो? दंश का अभ्‍यस्‍त हूं।

सर्प क्‍यों इतने चकित हो? दंश का अभ्‍यस्‍त हूं, पी रहा हूं विष युगों से, सत्‍य हूं, आश्‍वस्‍त हूं।

सर्प क्‍यों इतने चकित हो? दंश का अभ्‍यस्‍त हूं, पी रहा हूं विष युगों से, सत्‍य हूं, आश्‍वस्‍त हूं।

ये मेरी माटी लिए है गंध मेरे रक्‍त की, जो कह रही है मौन की, अभिव्‍यक्‍त की।

मैं अभय लेकर चलूंगा, मैं विचलित न त्रस्‍त हूं।

सर्प क्‍यों इतने चकित हो? दंश का अभयस्‍त हूं।

है मेरा उद्गम कहां परऔर कहां गंतव्‍य है?

दिख रहा है सत्‍य मुझको, रूप जिसका भव्‍य है।

मैं स्‍वयं की खोज में कितने युगों से व्‍यस्‍त हूं।

सर्प क्‍यों इतने चकित हो? दंश का अभयस्‍त हूं।

है मुझे संज्ञान इसका बुलबुला हूं सृष्टि में,

है मुझे संज्ञान इसका बुलबुला हूं सृष्टि में।

एक लघु सी बूंद हूं मैं, एक लघु सी बूंद हूं मैं, एक शाश्‍वत वृष्टि मैं।

है नहीं सागर को पाना, मैं नदी सन्‍यस्‍त हूं।

सर्प क्‍यों इतने चकित हो? दंश का अभयस्‍त हूं।

प्रधानमंत्री- प्रसून जी हम लोग, आपकी भावना का मैं आदर करता हूं, लेकिन हमारी रगों में वही भाव रहा है- वयम अमृतश्‍य पुत्र:।

इसी भाव को लेकर हम पले-बढ़े लोग हैं और इसलिए हमारे देश में हर किसी  ने दंश भी सहे हैं, जहर भी पिया है, परेशानियां भी झेली हैं, अपमान भी झेले हैं लेकिन सपनों को कभी मरने नहीं दिया है।

और ये ज़ज्‍़बा ही है जो देश को नई ऊंचाइयों पर ले जाने ताकत रखता है और मैं इसको अनुभव करता हूं जी।

प्रसून जोशी–यहां पर कुछ सवाल ऑर्डियन्‍स से लेते हैं। श्री सेमुअल डाउजर्ट से लेते हैं एक सवाल , जो आपसे एक सवाल पूछना चाहते हैं। जी आप अपना सवाल जरूर आपके साथ कोई खड़ा होगा उसे दे दें लिखकर। वो आप तक पहुंचेगे, आप जरा लिखकर दे दें बस। आप दे दें, मैं पूछ लूंगा। मैं आपका नाम एनाउंस कर दूंगा

सेमुअल डाउजर्ट –Good Evening Mr. Prime Minister,in the Past Obamacare, in the recent there is a talk of Modicare in India, I wanted to ask, will this lead to major change in the health sector. thank You.

प्रसून जोशी–I think मोदी केयर, ऐसे ही ओबामा केयर, मोदी केयर्स के बीच में parallel draw किया है उन्‍होंने। तो उस विषय में कि हेल्‍थ सेक्‍टर के बारे में शायद बात करना चाहते हैं।

प्रधानमंत्री–देखिए, मैं अनुभव करता हूं कि तीन बातों पर मेरा एक आग्रह है, मैं कोई बड़ी-बड़ी बातें करने वाले लोगों में से नहीं हूं। मेरी जिंदगी का ब्रेकग्राउंड ही ऐसा है कि मैं, हमारे मेघनाथ भाई बैठे हैं यहां पर, मैं कोई उस प्रकार की बातें करने वाली मेरी परम्‍परा नहीं है। लेकिन तीन चीजें- बच्‍चों को पढ़ाई, युवा को कमाई, बुजुर्गों को दवाई- ये चीजें हैं जो हमें एक स्‍वस्‍थ समाज के लिए चिंता करनी चाहिए। मैंने अनभव किया है कि कितना ही अच्‍छा परिवार क्‍यों न हो, कोई व्‍यसन  न हो, कोई बुराइयां न हो, कुछ न हो, बहुत अच्‍छे ढंग से चलता हो परिवार, किसी का बुरा भी न किया हो; लेकिन उस परिवार में अगर एक बीमारी आ जाए। कल्‍पना की होगी कि चलो भाई बच्‍ची बड़ी हो गई है, बेटी के हाथ पीले करने हैं, शादी करवानी है, और घर में एक व्‍यक्ति की बीमारी हो जाए, पूरा प्‍लान खत्‍म हो जाता है। बच्‍ची कुंवारी रह जाती है, बीमारी पूरे परिवार को तबाह करके चली जाती है।

एक गरीब आदमी ऑटो रिक्‍शा चला रहा है, बीमार हो गया। ये व्‍यक्ति बीमार नहीं होता है पूरा परिवार बीमार हो जाता है। सारी व्‍यवस्‍था बीमार हो जाती है। और तब जाकर हमने कुछ सोचा, तो हमने health sector में एक बड़ा holistic approach लिया है। कुछ लोग इसको मोदी केयर के रूप में आज प्रचलित कर रहे हैं। मूलत: योजना है आयुष्‍मान भारत। और उसमें हमने preventive health की बात हो, affordable health की बात हो, sustainable chain की बात हो, इन सारे पहलुओं को ले करके हम आगे बढ़ रहे हैं।

इसके दो component हैं। एक- हम देश में करीब-करीब डेढ़ लाख से ज्‍यादा wellness centre create करना चाहते हैं ता‍कि अगल-बगल के 12-15 गांव के लोगों के लिए हेल्‍थ की सारी सुविधाएं उपलब्‍ध हों, और वो सारे technology driven हों। ताकि बड़े अस्‍पताल से जुड़ करे वहां पेशेंट आया है तो उसको तुरंत गाइड करें क्‍या दवाईयां चाहिए, व्‍यवस्‍था करें।

दूसरा- preventive health को बल दें। चाहे योगा हो, चाहे लाइफ स्‍टाइल हो, इन सारी चीजों को preventive health के लिए, चाहे nutrition हो। हमने एक पोषण मिशन शुरू किया है। Women and child health care के लिए, उसके द्वारा हमने काम किया है।

दुनिया के समृद्ध देशों में भी maternity leave के लिए आज भी उतनी उदारता नहीं है जितनी हमारी सरकार ने आ करके की है। मैं मानता हूं यूके के लोग भी जान करके खुश हो जाएंगे, हमने उन बच्‍चों के स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य की चिंता करते हुए, उस मां के स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य की चिंता करते हुए maternity leave, 26 week कर दिया है।

एक और पहलू है कि परिवार को एक ऐसी व्‍यवस्‍था दी जाए। भारत के करीब दस करोड़ परिवार, यानी 50 करोड़, पापुलेशन एक प्रकार से आधी जनसंख्‍या, उनको सालभर में पांच लाख रुपया तक की बीमारी का खर्चा सरकार भुगतान करेगी। एक साल में परिवार के एक व्‍यक्ति, सब व्‍यक्ति  अगर जितनी बीमारी होती हैं, पांच लाख रुपये तक का पेमेंट सरकार देगी। इसके कारण गरीब की जिंदगी में ये जो संकट आता है उससे मुक्ति मिलेगी।

मैं जानता हूं बड़ा भगीरथ काम है लेकिन किसी को तो करना चाहिए।

दूसरा- इसके कारण जो प्राइवेट हॉस्पिटल आने की संभावना है टायर-2, टायर-3 सिटी में, अच्‍छे हॉस्पिटल का नेटवर्क खड़ा होगा। क्‍योंकि उनको पता है कि पेशेंट आएगा, क्‍योंकि पेशेंट को पता है कि मेरे पैसे कोई देने वाला है, तो वो जरूर जाएगा।

थोड़ी सी बीमारी आएगी तो आज नहीं जाता है, वो कहता है छोड़ो यार दो दिन में ठीक हो जाऊंगा, वो झेल लेता है। लेकिन जब पता है तो जाएगा। अस्‍पताल को भी पता है कि भाई पेशेंट जरूरत आए क्‍योंकि पैसे देने वाला कोई और है। और इसके कारण नए हॉस्पिटल का चेन बनेगा।

और मैं मानता हूं निकट भविष्‍य में और आपमें से जो हेल्‍थ के क्षेत्र में काम करना चाहते हैं, एक हजार से ज्‍यादा नए अच्‍छे हॉसिपटल बनने की संभावना पैदा हुई है। ये permanent solution system से पैदा हुई है।

उसी प्रकार से दवाइयां- पैकिंग अच्‍छा होता है, दवाई लिखने वाले को भी कुछ मिलता रहता है। आप जानते होंगे डॉक्‍टरों की कॉन्‍फ्रेंस कभी सिंगापुर होती है कभी दुबई होती है, हैं। वहां कोई बीमार है इसलिए नहीं जाते हैं, फार्मास्‍यूटिकल कम्‍पनियों के लिए जरूरी है, करते हैं।

तो हमने क्‍या किया- जेनेरिक मेडिसिन्‍स, और वो उतनी ही उत्‍तम क्‍वालिटी की होती है। जो दवाई 100 रुपये में मिलती थी, वो आज  जेनेरिक मेडिकल स्‍टोर में 15 रुपये में मिलती है। करीब 3 हजार ऐसे हमने जन-औषधालय का काम किया है और, और भी हम बढ़ा रहे हैं ताकि सामान्‍य व्‍यक्ति, और उसको हम प्रचारित भी कर रहे हैं।

उसी प्रकार से अगर जाएंगे तो डॉक्‍टर बताएगा भाई हार्ट की बीमारी है। अब आपको तो पता नहीं चलता है। दिखता तो नहीं है अंदर। डर लगता है, हैं हार्ट, यार कुछ होगा तो?

तो डॉक्‍टर कहेगा, stent रखना पड़ेगा। तो कहता है भई चलो। फिर कहता है देखो ये दो stent हैं, ये रखोगे तो दो लाख का होगा, ये रखोगे तो एक लाख का होगा। तो वो सोचता है दो वाला क्‍यों और एक वाला क्‍यों? वो कहता है दो वाला लिया तो जीवन तक चलता है, एक वाला लिया तो 4-6 साल के बाद नया। तो फिर वो कहता है यार फिर यही लगवा लो दो वाला। तो बेचारा कर्ज से पैसा ले आता है।

मैंने जरा पूछा, मैंने कहा यार ये क्‍या चीज हैदो लाख रुपये की? मैंने negotiation शुरू किया। और आप हैरान होंगे करीब-करीब 60 से 80 पर्सेंट कीमत कम हो गई। जो डेढ लाख, दो लाख होता था, वो आज 20 हजार, 25 हजार में हो रहा है।

उसी प्रकार से knee plant, करीब-करीब अब लोगों को आदत तो रही नहीं आसन, योगा करने की। मैं कह-कहकर थक जाता हूं भाई योगा करो। अब ये चलता नहीं है तो कहते हैं चलो स्‍क्रू  फिट करवा दो। और वो बहुत पैसे लेते हैं। मैंने उनको बुलाया, वो भी खर्च....। तो ऐसे कई पहलुओं को लिया है हमने। पूरे हेल्‍थ सेक्‍टर पर holistic approach से हम काम कर रहे हैं, उसके साथ स्‍वच्‍छता भी जुड़ी हुई है।

वर्ल्‍ड बैंक का रिपोर्ट है कि भाई स्‍वच्‍छता पर अगर ध्‍यान दिया जाए तो एक परिवार का बीमारी के पीछे एवरेज साल का 7 से 12 हजार रुपये का खर्च बच जाता है। तो ऐसी कई चीजों को ले करके हमने योजना ब बनाई है। लोग इसको मोदी केयर कहें, हर एक की मर्जी है लेकिन मूलत: मेरी इच्‍छा है मेरे देशवासियों की मैं केयर करूं।

प्रसून जोशी- जी बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद। मोदीजी जो आपने क्‍योंकि हेल्‍थ केयर सेक्‍टर में इतने कदम आपने उठाए हैं और शायद जो कोलाहल होता है उसमें बीच में कहीं सारी चीजें खो जाती हैं। बहुत ही बड़ी जानकारी थी ये सबके लिए। और ये सवाल पूछने के लिए सेमुअल जी का बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद।

आपके और भी इसके बाद engagements हैं। मुझे मालूम है कि बहुत आपका आगे भी कार्यक्रम है रात का। तो एक और सवाल लेते हैं। ये संतोष पाटिल जी का नाम मेरे पास आया है। संतोष पाटिल जी एक सवाल पूछना चाहते हैं आपसे।

संतोष पाटिल जी अपना सवाल पूछें।

संतोष पाटिल – प्रधानमंत्री जी नमस्‍कार। मैं संतोष पाटिल कर्नाटक से हूं। आज कर्नाटक के लोगों के लिए बहुत ही खुशी का दिन है। आप आपको भी पता होगा कि जगतगुरू बसवेश्‍वर जी का जयंती है। पिछली बार जब आपने लंदन को आए थे तो तब आपने जगतगुरू बसवेश्‍वर जी का प्रतिमा का अनावरण किया था।

तो मेरा प्रश्‍न आपसे ये है कि आप उनके जीवन और उनके विचार, उनको कैसे देखते हैं? और आप क्‍या उनके विचारों को कैसे आगे ले जाने के बारे में सोचते हैं? थैंक्‍यू, धन्‍यवाद।

मोदीजी – देखिए, हमारे देश का एक दुर्भाग्‍य है कि आजादी के बाद भारत की महान परम्‍परा, संस्‍कृति, इतिहास, उसको भुला देने का भरसक प्रयास हुआ है। आपको एक परिवार से बाहर कुछ पता ही नहीं चलने दिया गया है। बहुत लोगों ने तो शायद बसवेश्‍वर जी का नाम आज पहली बार सुना होगा।12th century के महापुरुष, कर्नाटक के, और मैं आपमें से किसी को रुचि हो, तो भगवान बसवेश्‍वर के वचन पढ़ने जैसे, और आज सभी भाषाओं में उपलब्‍ध हैं। सभी भाषाओं में उपलब्‍ध हैं, आज उनकी जन्‍म जयंती है। तो मैंने आज मेरे busy schedule में भी थोड़ा समय निकाला था और यहां पर जो पिछली बार जब मैं आया था तो जिस statue का मुझे अनावरण करने का मौका मिला था, तो वहां जा करके मैं खुद आज नमन करने चला गया था।

देखिए हमें हमारे लिए करवई ही नहीं है, हमारा दुर्भाग्‍य ये है जी। हमें अपनी महानताओं का पता ही नहीं है। हम मेगनाकार्टरा के लिए जानते हैं, पढ़ते हैं। हम डेमोक्रेटिक वेल्‍यूज के लिए दुनिया से सारी बातें बताते हैं। आपको जान करके खुशी होगी कि 12th century में भगवान बसवेश्‍वर ने मेगनाकार्टरा के भी पहले, लोकतंत्र के लिए पूरा जीवन खपा दिया। उन्‍होंने एक अनुभवमंडपम नाम की व्‍यवस्‍था की और समाज के सब वर्ग के लोग वहां बैठते थे और सामाजिक समस्‍याओं का चिंतन करते थे और उस जमाने में compulsory महिला प्रतिनिधि रहती थी उसमें, 12th century में। और सामाजिक समस्‍याओं का निदान निकालते थे और फिर समाज का प्रबोधन करते थे।

हमारा देश जातिवाद, ऊंच-नीच, छूत-अछूत, इसमें ऐसा बिखरा पड़ा था। भगवान बसवेश्‍वर ने इन सबको एक छत्रछाया में ला करके ऊंच-नीच, जातिवाद को समाप्‍त करके सबको जोड़ने का बहुत बड़ा काम किया था। और अभी जो आपने बेसब्री वाली बात कही थी, मुझे भगवान बसवेश्‍वर जी की एक बात याद आती है- उनका एक वचन है- उस वचन में उन्‍होंने कहा है- कि जहां ठहराव है, मुझे शब्‍द मेरे होंगे, लेकिन मुझे भाव याद है- जहां ठहराव है, वहां जिदंगी समाप्‍त है और जहां पर गति है, वहां पर जिंदगी के  नए आयाम की संभावनाएं नित्‍य नूतन होती हैं।

इस प्रकार का भाव भगवान बसवेश्‍वर के वचन में है जहां ठहराव को मृत्‍यु माना है उन्‍होंने, उस जमाने में।और इसलिए मैं समझता हूं कि लोगतंत्र के‍ लिए, women empowerment के लिए, social consciousness के लिए जो काम भगवान बसवेश्‍वर ने किया है, आज भी हमारे देश को और दुनिया को मार्गदर्शक है। तो मुझे खुशी हई और आप तो स्‍वयं कर्नाटक के हैं।

आज मुझे उनकी जन्‍म-जयंती पर वहां जाने का सौभाग्‍य मिला था और हम सब, और मैं तो चाहूंगा हमारे स्‍कूलों के बच्‍चों को भी पता होना चाहिए कि अनुभवमंडपम नाम की democratic institute कैसे उस जमाने में डेवलप की होगी। कितनी बड़ी दीर्घ दृष्टि होगी उस महापुरुष की जिन्‍होंने इस काम को किया होगा।

प्रसून जोशी–बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद आपका बताने के लिए।

प्रधानमंत्री मोदी हमारे देश में साहस और  संकल्‍प की कमी नहीं है। संघर्ष करने की आदत है हमारे देश को। पर यही शक्ति कहीं और पहुंच जाती है, अगर कोई इसे दिशा दे, इसका हाथ थामे। अब हम इसी बारे में बात करना चाहते हैं। चलिए नजर डालते हैं- बहुत से सवाल आए थे और खासकर ये कि कैसे भारत एक, बस एक नज़ मांगता है, एक थोड़ा सा इशारा मांगता है और एक थोड़ा सा हाथ थामने की बात मांगता है और उसके बाद वो चल निकलता है और कई लोग हैं जो उससे लाभान्वित हुए हैं।

तो योजनाएं तो हर सरकार बनाती है, ये पूछा है किसी ने। पर आपकी सरकार की योजनाएं ये कैसे अलग हैं? ये Modi model of governance क्‍या है, जिसका हम काफी जिक्र सुनते हैं?

प्रधानमंत्रीमोदीजी –देखिए, कोई भी सरकार में आता है तो विफल होने के लिए तो आता नहीं है। हर कोई कुछ न कुछ करने के लिए ही आता है। पहले भी सरकारें आई हैं कुछ न कुछ करने के इरादे से आई हैं। लेकिन बहुत-एक देखा गया अगर हम analysis करेंगे तो एक ऐसा हमारे देश में सरकारों ने रवैया अपनाया, जिसमें लोग सरकारों पर आश्रित हो जाएं, dependent हो जाएं। सरकार के बिना उनका गुजारा ही न हो।

मैं समझता हूं ये concept समाज को अपाहिज बना देता है, दुर्बल बना देता है। अगर गरीबी हटानी है तो हम गरीबों को शक्तिशाली बना करके ही हटा सकते हैं न कि हम गरीबों को फीड कर-करके कर सकते हैं। और उनको शक्ति देने के लिए जो कुछ भी करना पड़े, करना चाहिए।

हो सकता है 100 रुपये के बजाय 200 रुपये का खर्च होगा लेकिन ultimately pay करेगा। और इसलिए मेरा मुलत: सिद्धांत जो रहा है वो ये है कि हम समाज में जो भी शक्ति है, उसको और अधिक अवसर कैसे दें? हम एक ऐसा eco-system तैयार करें, ताकि उसको कुछ साहस करने का मन कर जाए। कहीं रुकावट आ जाए तो उसको हाथ पकड़ कर कोई निकालने वाला मिल जाए। और अनुभव मेरा ये है-

अब जैसे हमने प्रधानमंत्री मुद्रा योजना बनाई- आपने सुना होगा किसी जमाने में हमारे देश में लोन मेले हुआ करते थे। और लोन मेले ऐसे होते थे कि political लोग अपने चेले-चपाटों को उस लोन मेले में कतार में खड़े रखते थे, अपनी राजनीतिक शक्ति पैदा करने के लिए। और वो फिर लोन मेले से पैसे ले जाते थे और बाद में कोई पूछने वाला नहीं था, गया सो गया। पैसा बैंक का था, देश का था, जनता का था, लोन मेला गरीब के लिए था; पहली नजर में बहुत अच्‍छा लगता है। लेकिन इन लोन मेलों ने जिंदगी बदली? नहीं बदली।

हमने किया, एक प्रधानमंत्री मुद्रा योजना लाए। जिसमें हमने बिना बैंक गारंटी  लोगों को पैसा देना तय किया। लेकिन ये लोन मेले से डिफरेंट था। और अलग-अलग स्‍कीम के, उसके काम के हिसाब से उसको पैसे देना, आप जान करके खुश हो जाएंगे, अब तक 11 करोड़ लोगों ने इस मुद्रा योजना का लाभ उठाया है। पांच लाख करोड़ रुपयों से ज्‍यादा पूंजी इन लोगों के हाथ में पहुंची है।

और आपको जान करके ये भी खुशी होगी कि 11 करोड़ में बैंक से मुद्रा योजना में पैसे जिनको मिले हैं, बिना गारंटी मिले हैं। कोई collateral गारंटी की जरूरत नहीं थी कि भाई तुम जमीन लाओ, ढिकना लाओ, फलानां लाओ, कुछ नहीं। 74% women हैं इसमें।

मुझे अभी इन मुद्रा योजना के तहत पैसे लेने वाले लोगों से मिलने का मौका मिला। और मैंने उनसे बातें कीं, क्‍या अनुभव आया। मैं हैरान था जी, ऐसी छोटी-छोटी चीजें उन्‍होंने शुरू की हैं और आज धीरे-धीरे वो, कोई पांच लोगों को रोजगार दे रहा है, कोई तीन लोगों को रोजगार दे रहा है, कोई दो लोगों को रोजगार दे रहा है; वो स्‍वयं में अपने-आपको को एक entrepreneur बनने की दिशा में अब नए-नए तरीके से सोच रहा है। मैं समझता हूं कि ये empowerment है।

नहीं तो पहले क्‍या था, तुम चिंता मत कर यार, सरकार में तुमको काम पर लगवा दूंगा। अब कुछ दिन मिल गया, कुछ दिन नहीं मिल गया, उसको लगता था यार यही मेरी जिंदगी, भली करेगा तो उसको चिपक कर रहता था। हमने उसको empower करने की तरफ।

अब एग्रीकल्‍चर। हमने ठान लिया है कि हम 2022, जब भारत की आजादी के 75 साल होंगे, तब तक हम देश के किसान की इन्‍कम डबल करना चाहते हैं। अब उसके लिए उसकी लागत कम होनी चाहिए, उसका जो input cost है, वो कम होना चाहिए।

हमारे देश में, यानी ये जो आप कहते हैं ना मोदी का way of governance क्‍या है?  हमारे देश में, मैं जब मुख्‍यमंत्री था, तो मैंने उस समय प्रधानमंत्री को जो सबसे ज्‍यादा चिट्ठियां लिखी हैं, वो एक ही बात पर लिखी हैं, साल में तीन-चार बार लिखना पड़ता था, हमारे देश में किसानों को हमारे राज्‍य में यूरिया की जरूरत है, हमें यूरिया का कोटा बढ़ा दीजिए, यूरिया दे दीजिए। और सरकार कहती थी, कि नहीं-नहीं इससे ज्‍यादा कोटा नहीं मिलेगा। यूरिया के लिए लोग दो-दो दिन तक कतार में खड़े रहते थे। कुछ राज्‍यों में यूरिया प्राप्‍त करने के लिए लाठीचार्ज की घटनाएं बन जाती थीं। ये क्‍यों होता था?

आप हैरान होंगे, यूरिया का कारखाना मुझे लगाना होता तो पांच-छह साल लग जाते। मैंने आने के बाद कोई नए कारखाने नहीं लगाए हैं। प्रक्रिया चल रही है, लगने वाले हैं। जो बन्‍द पड़े थे, चालू भी होने वाले हैं। लेकिन सिर्फ मैंने efficiency में परिवर्तन किया। कुछ गलत काम हो रहे थे उसको रोका है। र्इमानदारी को बल दिया, बिना कोई एकस्‍ट्रा नया कारखाना लगाए 20 लाख टन यूरिया का उत्‍पादन बढ़ गया।

दूसरा- यूरिया होता था, सब्सिडी जाती थी, करीब 80-90 हजार करोड़ सब्सिडी जाती थी यूरिया में। सब्सिडी के नाम पर यूरिया निकलता था, किसान के नाम पर निकलता था, लेकिन वो कैमिकल फैक्‍टरी में चोरी होकर चला जाता था। कैमिकल फैक्‍टरी वाला उसको रॉ मैटीरियल के लिए उपयोग करके, उसमें से कोई नई प्रॉडक्‍ट बना करके दुनिया को बेच देता था। उसको बहुत सस्‍ते में यूरिया मिल जाता था।

हमने यूरिया का neem coating किया। ये जो आपका नीम का पेड़ होता है, उसकी जो फली होती है, उसका तेल निकाला, उसमें यूरिया को मिक्‍स कर दिया। इससे परिणाम क्‍या आया?

एक- जो नीम के tree थे, उसकी फली जो बेकार में जाती थी, लोगों, इकट्ठा करने वालों को रोजगार मिल गया। नीम का तेल निकलने से उसको इसमें डालने से अब वो यूरिया जमीन के सिवाय किसी काम में नहीं आता है, चोरी बंद हो गई। तीसरा- यूरिया नीम कोटिंग होने के कारण उसकी अपनी ताकत बढ़ गई, जमीन में सुधार लाने की extra energy उसमें आई, जिसके कारण उत्‍पादन में 5 प्रतिशत से 15 प्रतिशत तक increase हो गया। मुझे बताइए कितने फायदे हो गए। अब ये बदलाव है कि नहीं है?

Skill development, हम कैमिकल फैक्‍टरी मान लीजिए है गुजरात में और मैं कैमिकल का Skill development कर रहा हूं पश्चिम बंगाल में, तो वो रोजगार कहां से मिलेगा उसको। अगर जहां पर जो फैक्‍टरी है, उसका मैपिंग करके उसकी requirement के अनुसार मैं अगर Skill development करता हूं तो उसको तुरंत रोजगार मिलेगा और stability भी रहती है। और इसलिए हमने देशभर में जो उद्योग जगत के लिए potential areas हैं, उसके अनुसार Skill development के मैकेनिज्‍म को हमने develop किया है, और वो भी जनभागीदारी से।

हमने कहा, चलो भई आपकी दस फैक्‍टरी हैं, ऑटोमोबाइल क्षेत्र में काम करती हैं, आप दस लोग एक institution यहां खड़ा करो, ऑटोमोबाइल के लिए जो manpower चाहिए, उसकी ट्रेनिंग आप वहां करिए। आप ही के इंजीनियर को पढ़ाने के लिए भेजिए, जो Skill develop हो जाएगा, वो नौजवान आपकी ऑटोमोबाइल इंडस्‍ट्री में उसको नौकरी मिल जाएगी। तो एक ऐसे तरीकों को हमने अपनाने का प्रयास किया है, इसका मतलब ये  नहीं कि सब हो चुका है।

हम एक सही दिशा में जा रहे हैं और इसलिए जो साह‍स करता है, उसको साथ देना, ये हमारा दायित्‍व है। साहस करने वाले को निराश नहीं होने देना। जहां जरूरत पड़े उंगली पकड़ कर आगे ले जाना तो उंगली पकड़ करके, हाथ पकड़ करके ले जाने की अगर जरूरत हो तो हाथ पकड़ करके और धक्‍का दे करके ले जाने की जरूरत पड़े तो वो भी करने के लिए सरकार ने लगातार प्रयास करना चाहिए, और वो हम कर रहे हैं।

प्रसून जोशी–मोदीजी आप पूरे, जब आप बात करते हैं, schemes की बात करते हैं, लोगों तक पहुंचने की बात करते हैं तो साफ दिखता है कि आप कितने उसमें involved हैं और कितने उसके nitty grittyसे, धागा-धागा से आप उससे जुड़े हुए हैं। लोगों को ये लगता है आपको ये पूरा एहसासहोता है कि कितना काम जा रहा है और कितना जो परिवर्तन आ रहा है। क्‍या वो लोगों को उसका पूरा एहसास हो रहा होता है? आपको लगता है पूरी तरह होता है?

प्रधानमंत्री –देखिए, देश जिस हालत में था, उसको अगर आप याद रखोगे, तब तो क्‍या हो रहा है उसका पता चलेगा। मुझे बराबर याद है जब मैं पहली बार गुजरात में मुख्‍यमंत्री बना, 2001 में। मैं कभी पुलिस थाने में  नहीं गया था, मैं कभी सरकारी दफ्तर नहीं देखा था, मैंने असेम्‍बली  नहीं देखी थी। मेरे लिए सारी दुनिया नई थी। मुझे सब सीखना था, समझना था, अभी मेरा शपथ लेना बाकी था। लेकिन लोगों को पता चल जाता है तो फिर लोग आ जाते हैं, मालाएं-वालाएं ले करके वो तो, दुनिया का रिवाज है। मैं भी सोच रहा था वाह रातों-रात।

लोग मुझे कहते कि मोदीजी कुछ करो या न करो, लेकिन कम से कम शाम को खाना खाते समय बिजली मिले, इतना तो करना। यानी जब मैं मुख्‍यमंत्री बना, तो मेरे गुजरात से मुझे ही मांग थी कि साहेब कम से कम खाना खाते समय बिजली मिले, इतना तो करना।

खैर बाद में मैंने इस मिशन को हाथ में लिया। दो-तीन साल काम किया और स्थिति ये बनी गुजरात was the first state in the country जहां 24X7 घर में बिजली मिलना संभव होगा।

लेकिन आज जो 18-20 साल का है उसको पूछो कि अंधेरा क्‍या होता है,  तो उसको मालूम ही नहीं है। खाना खाते समय बिजली नहीं होती थी, वो क्‍या होता था क्‍योंकि उसे पता ही नहीं है। तो ये सरकार हमारी अच्‍छा कर रही है, बुरा कर रही है, मैं मानूंगा कम से कम इस पांच वर्ष; मैं आगे के लिए नहीं कर रहा, इस पांच वर्ष पहले की सरकार की तुलना में हम कहां हैं, ये अगर comparative देखोगे; मैं दावे से कहता हूं हर parameter में, देश के लिए अच्‍छा करने में कोई कमी हमने नहीं रखी है।

और मेरा सौभाग्‍य है कि पहले अखबार में ये खबरों की हेडलाइन रहती थी- आज इतना गया, आज इतना गया, यही खबरें भरी रहती थीं 2014 के पहले? आज खबर होती है, मोदीजी बताइए कितना आया? मैं समझता हूं देश को ये विश्‍वास पैदा हुआ है।

पहले समय छोड़ो यार, कुछ नहीं होने वाला है। आज स्थिति बनी है, अरे ये क्‍यों नहीं होता है? मोदीजी आप बैठे हैं, क्‍यों नहीं होता है? अच्‍छीचीज है। मेरी आलोचना होती होगी लेकिन आलोचना ये नहीं होती कि मोदी नहीं करता है; आलोचना ये होती है, अरे मोदी आप कर सकते हो, ये क्‍यों नहीं करते हो, आप बताओ। मैं इसे बहुत अच्‍छा मानता हूं।

Even media भी मेरी आलोचना क्‍या करता है। मीडिया मेरी आलोचना बहुत करता है और वो बुरा है मैं नहीं मानता हूं। और वो आलोचना क्‍याकरता है अरे मोदीजी आपको बिठाया है तो ये तो आप करके दिखाओ। मैं समझता हूं ये देश की प्रगति का इसके अंदरएक सहज अहसास है कि ये होना चाहिए।

मोदी आप पहले की बात छोड़ो हुआ नहीं हुआ, आप तो कर सकते हो। ये मैं समझता हूं एक बहुत बड़ी सफलता है।

प्रसून जोशी–बहुत अपेक्षाएं आपसे हमेशा देश रखता है, इसमें कोई शक नहीं। लेकिन एक चीज साफ दिखती है मुझे कि आपको अपने लिए कुछ नहीं चाहिए। एक फकीरी है आपके स्‍वभाव में। ये कहां से आई है? क्‍या आप हमेशा से ही ऐसे थे? या धीरे-धीरे-धीरे-धीरे फकीरी आती चली गई?

प्रधानमंत्री – ये बहुत ही personal nature का सवाल है।

प्रसून जोशी- नहीं मोदी जी ये एक जरूरी सवाल है।

प्रधानमंत्री -  ऐसा है कि मुझे मेरी कविता के शब्‍द बहुत याद तो रहते  नहीं।

प्रसून जोशी- नहीं, कविता में कहा भी है कहीं फकीरी के कारण क्‍या हैं।

मोदीजी – बहुत पुरानी मेरी एक

प्रसून जोशी– अगर मैं आपसे ये आग्रह कर सकूं कि एक-दो लाइनें बता दें

प्रधानमंत्री – मुझे याद नहीं रहती हैं कविता, इसलिए मैं कह नहीं पाऊंगा, लेकिन मैं जरूर सोशल मीडिया में उस कविता को डाल दूंगा। क्‍योंकि मुझे याद नहीं है तो मैं। लेकिन वो गुजराती में है और रमता राम अकेला करके मैंने उस शब्‍दों को मेरे भावों को व्‍यक्‍त किया है।

देखिए, मैं समझता हूं कि ये फकीरी वगैरह जो हैं, ये मन की अवस्‍था से जुड़ा विषय है और वो inject करने से नहीं आती है। हालात उसको पैदा नहीं करते हैं। अगर वो inbuilt होता है, तब जा करके होता है। और शायद, मैं कोई अपनी तारीफ करने के लिए नहीं कह रहा हूं। मुझे क्षमा करना, लेकिन प्रसून जी ने सवाल पूछा है, मैं जवाब न दूं तो ठीक नहीं लगेगा।

जब मैं गुजरात में था मुख्‍यमंत्री के नाते तो सार्वजनि‍क समारोह में जाता था तो लोग भेंट-सौगात देते हैं, बढ़िया सा शॉल देते हैं, कभी कोई चांदी की तलवार दे देता है, कोई अच्‍छा सा ताजमहल दे देता है।  कुछ न कुछ देते रहते हैं। बहुत बढ़िया–बढ़िया पेंटिंग देते हैं, तो मैं भी इंसान हूं, मेरा भी मन करता है यार ये बहुत बढ़िया पेंटिंग है इसको घर में एक दीवार पर लगाऊंगा, मेहमान आएंगे तो अच्‍छा लगेगा। ये बढ़िया सी मूर्ति दी है, यहां रखूंगा तो बहुत अच्‍छा लगेगा। मेरा भी मन करेगा, आपका भी मन करेगा। करेगा या नहीं करेगा? मेरा मन नहीं करता था। और मैं ये सारी चीजें सरकार का जो ट्रेजरी होता है, तोशाखाना बोलते हैं, उसमें डाल देता था। वो भी बड़े तंग आ गए कि ऐसा क्‍या सब चीज आप हमारे यहां भेज देते हो। मैंने कहा मैं कहां रखूंगा भाई? मेरा कौन संभालेगा इन चीजों को? इसके लिए किसी को रखना पड़ेगा मुझे। मैं दे देता था।

फिर मैं उसका valuation करवाने लगा, फिर मैंने उसका ऑक्‍शन करवाना शुरू किया। हम लोग जानते हैं हिंदुस्‍तान में राजनेताओं के साथ ऐसी बातें, सब सच होती हैं ऐसा भी मैं नहीं कहता हूं, झूठ होती हैं ये भी मैं नहीं कह सकता। लेकिन ये तो होता कि यार वो फलाना था, कितना ले गया। लेकिन मैं गर्व से कहता हूं कि जब मैंने गुजरात छोड़ा था तो ये जो मुझे मिलती थीं चीजें, मैं उसका लगातार ऑक्‍शन करता था पब्लिक में। और ऑक्‍शन करके उससे जो पैसा आता था वो मैं girl child education के लिए सरकार में donate कर देता था। और करीब-करीब 100 करोड़ से ज्‍यादा रुपए ऑक्‍शन से और फिर लोग मुझे चैक भी देने लगे। किसी फंक्‍शन में जाता था तो चीज देने के बजाय girl child education के लिए चैक देने लगे। ये amount करीब-करीब 100 करोड़ से ज्‍यादा था, जो मैं बच्चियों की शिक्षा के लिए दे देता था।

जब मैं मुख्‍यमंत्री से निकल करके दिल्‍ली आना तय हो गया, आप लोगों ने मुझे धक्‍का मार दिया। तो मैंने मेरे अफसर जो थे उनको बुलाया। मैंने कहा भाई, ये जो मैं MLA के नाते कमाता था, क्‍योंकि MLA के  नाते पैसे मिलते थे, मैंने कहा पैसे पड़े हैं क्‍या करेंगे हम लोग? मैं कहां ले जाऊंगा? आप हैरान होंगे सुन करके। मुझे अभी याद नहीं है, शायद 5-6 लाख रुपया था। मैंने कहा भाई मैं तो कोई सरकार में दे देना चाहता हूं। और मैंने कहा मेरी इच्‍छा ये है कि गांधीनगर के सचिवालय में जो ड्राइवर और peon है, उनके लिए मैं amount छोड़ दूं आप इसकी व्‍यवस्‍था कर दीजिए। और उसके ब्‍याज में से ये ड्राइवर और उनके peon के बच्‍चों को कुछ न कुछ मदद मिलती रहे, वो पढ़ते रहें, ऐसी व्‍यवस्‍था कीजिए।

मेरे जो अफसर थे, सुन रहे थे मेरी, कुछ बोले नहीं वो। अफसर बड़े कुशल होते हैं। मुंडी ऐसे-ऐसे हिला रहे थे, मैं भी सोच रहा था कि मेरी बात मान ली, कुछ करेंगे। दो दिन के बाद उन्‍होंने कहा, साहब हम जरा घर में मिलने आना चाहते हैं। मैंने कहा, आ जाइए, क्‍योंकि मैं जाने की तैयारी कर रहा था। बोले, साहब आप ऐसा मत कीजिए। पता नहीं कब आपको पैसों की जरूरत पड़ जाए और आपके पास कोई है नहीं। मेरे अफसरों ने मुझे वो पैसे देने नहीं दिए। तो मैंने कहा यार कम से कम मैं तो क्‍या करूंगा इसे ले जाकर?

आखिरकार वो बहुत समझाने पर मान गए और सारे पैसे तो उन्‍होंने मेरे लेने से मना कर दिया लेकिन एक छोटा सा फाउंडेशन बनाया और मुझे याद नहीं आज शायद 21 हजार रुपया, इतना कुछ शायद मैं उसमें कुछ दे करके, गरीब लोगों के लिए दे करके निकल गया।

शायद मेरी जिंदगी ही, मैं ऐसे अभाव में पैदा हुआ हूं। इसलिए मुझ पर किसी चीज का प्रभाव नहीं होता है। और ये फकीरी वगैरह है वो तो शब्‍द बड़े हैं लेकिन मैं ओलिया हूं भाई, मेरा कोई लेना-देना नहीं है।

प्रसून जी – बस वो ही है सर फकीरी, उसी का हम भी जिक्र कर रहे थे।

नहीं, आपने वो हर चीज में परिलक्षित होती है। ऑर्डियन्‍स से भी कुछ और भी यहां सवाल आए, पहले में चाहूंगा कि जो पहले से यहां पर रिक्‍वेस्‍ट है उसमें एक मैं आपको बताता हूं कुछ यहां से भी सवाल हैं।

ये सवाल श्री तरणप्रीत सिंह जी पूछना चाहते हैं। श्री तरणप्रीत सिंह जी- पूछें कृपया।

तरणप्रीत सिंह –सत् श्री अकाल।

प्रधानमंत्री – सत् श्री अकाल जी।

तरणप्रीत सिंह – हमारे श्रद्धेय युवा प्रधानमंत्री जी, आप हम सभी भारतीय युवाओं के लिए एक रोल मॉडल बन चुके हैं। न केवल भारतीय युवाओं के लिए आप देश के विभिन्‍न युवाओं के लिए एक रोल मॉडल बन चुके हैं। दिन में 20-20 घंटा काम करना, यह कोई छोटी बात नहीं है। आप हमें कभी थके हुए नहीं दिखते। मेरा आपसे सवाल यही है कि आपके अंदर इतनी ऊर्जा आती कहां से है? हमें पता है कि आप योगा करते हैं, लेकिन आप हमें ये बताएं कि यह ऊर्जा हम भी अपनी लाइफ में यूज करके देश हित के लिए आगे काम कर सकें।

प्रधानमंत्री – इसके कई जवाब हो सकते हैं। एक तो जवाब अगर मुझे हंसी-खुशी की शाम के रूप में देना है तो मैं ये कह सकता हूं कि मैं पिछले दो दशक से, करीब-करीब 20 साल से daily one kg, two kg गालियां खाता हूं।

लेकिन सीधी-सीधी बात मैं बताता हूं, एक पुरानी शायद घटना आपने सुनी होगी कि कोई तीर्थस्‍थान था एक पर्वतमाला पर और तराई के अंदर कोई संत-महात्‍मा बैठे थे। और एक आठ साल की बच्‍ची अपने तीन साल के भाई को उठा करके उस पहाड़ी पर चढ़ रही थी। उस संत ने उसको पूछा अरे बेटे तुझे थकान नहीं लग रही क्‍या?  तो उस बच्‍ची  ने जवाब दिया ये तो मेरा भाई है। तो संत ने दोबारा पूछा, अरे तुझे मैं तुम्‍हारा कौन रिश्‍तेदार है, नहीं पूछ रहा हूं- मैं तुझे पूछ रहा हूं तुझे थकान नहीं लग रही है? इसको उठाकर चल रही हो। तो उस बच्‍ची ने दोबारा जवाब दिया वो तो मेरा भाई है।

तो संत ने तीसरी बार पूछा- अरे मैं तुझे नहीं पूछ रहा हूं तेरा रिश्‍तेदार कौन है, मैं पूछ रहा हूं अरे तुझे थकान नहीं लग रही है क्‍या? तीसरी बार उस बच्‍ची ने कहा कि बापजी ये मेरा भाई है। भाई का थकान नहीं लगता।

मेरे लिए सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी, ये मेरा परिवार है। जिस पल, आप अपने जीवन में देख लीजिए, जहां पर आप अपनापन अनुभव करते होंगे, कितने ही थक करके आए होंगे, सोने का मन करता होगा, शरीर साथ नहीं देता होगा, लेकिन टेलीफोन आ जाए कि आपके भतीजे को कुछ हुआ है, अस्‍पताल है, सारी थकान मिट जाती है, स्‍कूटर ले करके आप भागते हैं, रात भर उसकी सेवा में लगे रहते हैं, क्‍यों? आपका अपना है। थकान मिट जाती है। आप स्‍वयं जुट जाते हैं। मेरी जिंदगी भी हर पल शरीर तो, शरीर का धर्म करता ही है लेकिन उसी पल मुझे ध्‍यान में कोई अपना, कोई अपनों के लिए, कभी त्रिपुरा से कोई खबर, कभी केरल से कोई खबर, कभी दिल्‍ली से कोई खबर, तो फिर मन करता है, अरे उठो यार, चलो दौड़ो।

तो सबसे बड़ी बात है मन की अवस्‍था। दूसरी बात है कि हमें भी क्‍योंकि मैं चाहूंगा मेरी जिंदगी ऐसी है कि आज तो प्रधानमंत्री हूं तो कोई चाय भी ले आएगा, पानी भी ले आएगा। लेकिन मुझे मालूम है उसके बाद क्‍या होगा। और इसलिए मैं नहीं चाहता हूं, मैं कभी भी किसी पर बोझ बनूं। ये मेरे मन की इच्‍छा है और परमात्‍मा मेरी सहायता करे। ऐसे ही हंसते-खेलते, बातें करते चला जाऊं किसी दिन। जिंदगी में किसी पर बोझ न बनूं। और इसलिए शरीर को जितना फिट रख सकता हूं, शरीर से जितना काम ले सकता हूं, जितने नियमों का पालन कर सकता हूं, जितना भी मैं सीख पाया हूं, उसको मैं जीने का प्रयास करता हूं और मैं सभी नौजवानों से कहना चाहूंगा कि विरासत में बहुत कुछ मिल सकता है लेकिन अपने-आपको फिट रखना, ये अपने मां-बाप की विरासत के ऊपर भरोसा नहीं रख सकते। वो आपको अपने-आप करना पड़ता है।

वो विरासत में आपको ऊंचाई दे सकते हैं, विरासत में चमड़़ी का कलर दे सकते हैं, विरासत मे बढ़िया आंखें दे सकते हैं, नाक-नक्‍शे दे सकते हैं लेकिन भीतर की तबियत तो आपको संभालनी ही होती है। और मेरा अनुभव कहता है कि एक detachment जो होता है वो अपने-आप एक बहुत बड़ी ताकत होता है और दूसरा नियमों से जिंदगी जीने से आप जिस काम के लिए निकले हो, उस काम के लिए अपने-आपको योग्‍य बना सकते हो। हमने जहां हैं वहां किसी पर बोझ नहीं बनना चाहिए। हो सके उतना, हमने जीवन ऐसा जीना चाहिए कि कभी किसी पर बोझ न बनें।

प्रसून जोशी- ये फिटनेस मंत्र तो आपने दे ही दिया कि फिटनेस विरासत में नहीं मिलती। ये तो आपने यूज खुद ही करनी पड़ती है। मोदीजी बहुत सवाल हैं, मैं नाम पढ़ता हूं और देखते हैं कितने ले सकते हैं। एक अमित दूबे जी का है, एक आशुतोष दीक्षित जी का है, ये सब यहीं पर हैं, सतीश जी का है और प्रेम‍ सिंह जी का है।

अमित दूबे जी आपका सवाल पहले है लेकिन मैं पूरी handwriting पढ़ नहीं पा रहा हूं, लेकिन मुझे लगता है कि Digital India से संबंधित सवाल ये पूछना चाहते हैं।

प्रधानमंत्री - ये बात सही है देखिए, दुनिया technology driven है। हम उससे परहेज नहीं कर सकते। उसका maximum उपयोग कैसे कर सकते हैं और मैं ये मानता हूं कि information technology का जो revolution है, digital world का जो revolution है, हम artificial intelligence के युग में प्रवेश कर रहे हैं। इसमें transparency की बहुत भारी संभावना है, और इसलिए efficiency है, transparency है, easy governance है, इन सारों को देखते हुए हमने इसको बल देना चाहिए।

भारत में optical fiber network का बहुत बड़ा काम तेजी से चल रहा है। आपको हैरानी होगी पहले तीन साल में 59 villages में optical fiber network गया था, मेरे आने से पहले। योजना पथ का ज्ञान था? था,optical fiber network होना चाहिए, पता था?  था, पैसे थे? थे, काम करने वाले थे? थे, हुआ कितना? तीन साल में 59 villages. मैंने तीन साल में एक लाख से ज्‍यादा गांव में काम पूरा कर दिया है। ये फर्क है काम में, ये फर्क है।

अब जैसे हमने एक GEM योजना बनाई है, जी ई एम। कोई भी व्‍यक्ति  ये डिजिटल वर्ल्‍ड के तहत उस पर अपना रजिस्‍ट्रेशन करवा सकता है। अकेला अपने घर में छोटी प्रोडक्‍ट करता है, भारत सरकार को चाहिए तो वो बेच सकता है, कोई‍ बिचौलियों की जरूरत नहीं। बड़े-बड़े टेंडर की जरूरत नहीं, बड़ी-बड़़ी कम्‍पनियों की जरूरत नहीं।

मैं हैरान था, मुझे एक दिन तमिलनाडु से एक महिला की चिट्ठी आई। मैं regularly ऐसे at random  10-12 चिट्ठी पढ़ने का daily प्रयास करता हूं। चिट्ठियां तो हजारों आती हैं तो सब तो नहीं पढ़ पाता हूं, वो डिपार्टमेंट पढ़ता है, लेकिन मैं at random  10-12 चिट्ठी ले करके खुद पढ़ता हूं ताकि मुझे सामान्‍य मानवी की क्‍या भावनाएं हैं, उसका पता चले।

एक दिन चिट्ठी एक मेरे हाथ में आई। तमिलनाडु की एक महिला ने चिट्ठी लिखी थी। और उसने लिखा मैं हैरान हूं कि, उसकी दो बेटियां हैं, उसने वर्णन अपना लिखा है- मेरे पति नौकरी करते हैं लेकिन बेटियां बड़ी हुईं, शादी करवानी थी, घर में थोड़े पैसों की जरूरत थी तो मैंने सोचा मैं कुछ काम शुरू करूं। तो मेरी बेटियों ने कहा‍ कि तुम मुद्रा से पैसे ले लो, मुद्रा योजना से। तो बोली, मैंने apply किया, मुद्रा योजना से मुझे पैसे मिल गए। और मैं भी हैरान थी कि मुझे 15 दिन में पैसे मिल गए। फिर बोली- मैंने बाजार से सामान ले करके बेचना शुरू किया। इतने में मेरी बच्चियों ने कहा GEM में रजिस्‍ट्री कराओ। बोली- मैंने करा दी। उतने में मैंने GEM में पढ़ा कि प्रधानमंत्री कार्यालय को चाय के लिए दो थर्मस की जरूरत है। तो बोलीं- मैंने बाजार में पूछा सस्‍ते में थर्मस कहां मिलेगा?  मैंने प्रधानमंत्री कार्यालय में GEM में लिखवा दिया। और GEM के आधार पर प्रधानमंत्री कार्यालय से ऑर्डर मिल गया। तो मैंने दो थर्मस देश के प्रधानमंत्री के कार्यालय को पहुंचा दिए और मुझे payment भी मिल गया। तो बोली- मेरी खुशी का पार नहीं है कि कैसे हो सकता है ये? ये digital revolution का परिणाम है कि ये संभव हुआ। वरना कहां तमिलनाडु के किसी गांव में कोई एक महिला अभी तो व्‍यापार शुरू कर रही है और उसकी चीज प्रधानमंत्री के कार्यालय तक पहुंच जाती है।

तो हमने digital revolution के द्वारा, दूसरा education और health के क्षेत्र में digital revolution बहुत बड़ी सेवा कर सकता है। अब उसकी दिशा में जाने के लिए प्रयास कर रहे हैं और मैं चाहूंगा कि भारत, और IT revolution में तो भारत का बहुत बड़ा contribution है, उसका benefit भारत के common लोगों को मिलना चाहिए और उस दिशा में हम प्रयास कर रहे हैं।

प्रसून जोशी- दूबे जी आप satisfy होंगे इस सवाल से आशा है। हम आगे बढ़ रहे हैं।

मोदीजी, भारत के साहस और संकल्‍प के बाद बात करते हैं आने वाले कल की और भारत के लक्ष्‍य की। आज भारत की ओर सारा विश्‍व एक आशा की निगाह से देख रहा है और भारत अंदर से जानता है कि अभी उसे बहुत दूर जाना है। ये नए भारत की बात है। ये new जो world order होगा, उसमें भारत का क्‍या रोल देखते हैं?

प्रधानमंत्री – आप सब अनुभव करते होंगे कि आज आपके पासपोर्ट की ताकत बढ़ी है कि नहीं बढ़ी है? विदेश में आप रहते हैं, कोई भी व्‍यक्ति जब उसको पता चलता है कि आप हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के हैं तो आपकी तरफ उसका देखने का रुतबा पहले की तुलना में बदला है कि नहीं बदला है? सच बताइए, वैसे मुझे खुश करने के लिए मत बताइए। बदला है? आपके प्रति लोग अब गर्व के साथ देखते हैं?

हिन्‍दुस्‍तान तो वो ही है, प‍हले भी था, आप भी थे, दुनिया भी थी, अब बदलाव महसूस होता है कि नहीं होता है?

ये हिन्‍दुस्‍तान ने करके दिखाया है कि आज पूरे विश्‍व में भारत का लोहा मान जाता है। सिर्फ सवा सौ करोड़ का देश है, बहुत बड़ा मार्केट है इसलिए नहीं। भारत ने अपनी नीतियों के द्वारा, संतुलित व्‍यवहार के द्वारा तनावपूर्ण विश्‍व में तुम भी भले-हम भी भले, तुम भी अच्‍छे-हम भी अच्‍छे, चलो यार बैठ लें, एक तस्‍वीर निकाल दें; इस प्रकार की रणनीति छोड़ दी है। जो सच है वो डंके की चोट पर बोलना, जो सच है हिम्‍मत के साथ उसके साथ चलना, ये सामर्थ्‍य हिन्‍दुस्‍तान ने दिखाया है।

आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं आजादी के 70 साल तक हिन्‍दुस्‍तान का प्रधानमंत्री इजरायल न जाए, कौन सा दबाव था? हिन्‍दुस्‍तान में दम होना चाहिए कि हिन्‍दुस्‍तान डंके की चोट पर कहे, कि जब मुझे इजरायल जाना है, मैं सीधा इजरायल जाऊंगा, और जिस दिन मुझे Palestine जाना होगा, उस दिन हिम्‍मत के साथ मैं Palestine भी जाऊंगा। मैं Saudi Arabia भी जाऊंगा, उतने ही प्‍यार के साथ उनका सम्‍मान भी प्राप्‍त करूंगा और देश की energy security के लिए जरूरत है तो मैं इरान भी जाऊंगा।

आप कल्‍पना कर सकते हैं, UAE- भारत से निकल कर एक-डेढ़ घंटे में वहां पहुंच जाएं, दो घंटे में पहुंच जाएं। 23 साल तक कोई गया नहीं था भाई। मुझे बताइए क्‍या हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के प्रति उनकी अपेक्षा हीं होगी क्‍या? कौन रोकता था आपको?  आज विश्‍व के सभी देशों के साथ हम बराबरी के साथ, और जब मैं चुनाव लड़ रहा था, तब मेरी एक विषय पर भरपूर आलोचना होती थी, भरपूर आलोचना होती थी। वो ये थी कि मोदी, चाय बेचने वाला, एक राज्‍य का मुख्‍यमंत्री। इतना बड़ा देश, क्‍या समझ आएगा उसको? और विदेश नीति तो बिल्‍कुल नहीं समझ पाएगा।

ये मेरी बहुत बड़ी आलोचना होती थी। ये इस देश का भट्ठा बिठा देगा। लेकिन आज चार साल के बाद कोई ये बात-सवाल नहीं उठा सकता है। अब उसका कारण- उसका कारण मोदी नहीं है। मोदी को सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों की ताकत पर भरोसा है। मोदी को हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की महान परम्‍पराओं पर आस्‍था है।

मोदी को हिन्‍दुस्तान का इतिहास, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की संस्‍कृति, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान के जीवन के प्रति पूरी श्रद्धा है और मुझे विश्‍वास है कि मैं दुनिया को भारत का सत्‍य समझा सकता हूं और उसीका परिणाम है कि आज विश्‍व में हर क्षेत्र में- देखिए मेरे टाइम टेबल में UK में ये कॉनवेल्‍थ कंट्रीज का कार्यक्रम करने जाना था। ये भारत का गर्व है कि स्‍वयं प्रिंस चार्ल्‍स खुद भारत आए थे। क्‍योंकि पिछली बार जब कॉमनवेल्‍थ समिट हुआ माल्‍टा में, मैं नहीं जा पाया। इस बार स्‍वयं प्रिंस चार्ल्‍स आए थे। सिर्फ मुझे व्‍यक्तिगत निमंत्रण देने के लिए- ‘इस बार आप जरूर आइए।‘ 

इतना ही नहीं, इतना ही नहीं, क्‍वीन ने स्‍वंयम ने मुझे पर्सनल चिट्ठी लिखी कि इस बार तो आपको रहना ही है। ये मोदी का विषय नहीं है। ये भारत का प्रोफाइल है जिसके कारण ये संभव हुआ है।

एक समय था जब humanitarian groundपर चर्चा होती थी तो ज्‍यादतर पश्चिम के देशों की चर्चा होती थी। भारत की कोई चर्चा नहीं करता था। लेकिन जब यमन में 5 हजार- 6 हजार लोग फंसे थे, उनको बाहर निकाला, तो दुनिया के कई देशों ने भारत को request की थी कि आप अपने नागरिकों को निकालते हैं, हमारे लोगों को भी यमन से निकालिए, और दुनिया के 2000 नागरिकों को बाहर निकाल करके हमने उनके यहां पहुंचाने का काम किया था।

म्‍यांमार में रोहिंग्‍या की समस्‍या हुई, दुनिया ने उस प्रश्‍न को human right, जिग्‍ना, फलाना ले करके जिसको जो अपनी पोजीशन लेनी थी, ले ली। हम वहां पर नहीं अटके। रोहिंग्‍या लोग जो बंगलादेश वापिस गए थे, हमने कहा बंगलादेश हमारा मित्र देश है, हमने स्‍टीमर भर-भरके वहां चावल लेकर पहुंचे, जो रोहिंग्‍या वहां आए हैं वो भूखे नहीं मरने चाहिए। मानवता का काम करने में भारत पीछे नहीं रहा। और म्‍यांमार के अदंर  रखैन स्‍टेट है जहां पर ये लोगों को मुसीबत थी। डेवलपमेंट नहीं हुआ है, भारत ने म्‍यांमार सरकार के समझौता किया कि हम रखैन प्रदेश के लिए, उसके विकास के लिए भारत जो कुछ भी contribute कर सकता है, हम करेंगे।

नेपाल के अंदर भूकंप आया, भारत सबसे पहला देश था कि तुरंत नेपाल पहुंचना और नेपाल के सुख-दुख की चिंता करना। भारत ने अपने व्‍यवहार के द्वारा किसी भी प्रकार के भेदभाव के बिना दुनिया की हर शक्ति के साथ बराबरी का व्‍यवहार और तब मीडिया ने मुझे पूछा था विदेश नीति के लिए और मैंने जवाब दिया था मेरी विदेश नीति का क्‍या होगा, क्‍या नहीं, उसकी बड़ी व्‍याख्‍या तो नहीं करता हूं, लेकिन मैंने इतना कहा था कि न हम किसी से आंख झुका करके बात करेंगे, न ही हम आंख उठा करके बात करेंगे, हम आंख मिला करके बात करेंगे। और आज, आज इस बात को आप देख सकते हैं और इसी के कारण और आज, आज विश्‍व जिस अवस्‍था में पहुंच रहा है, भारत- अगर दुनिया, ग्‍लोबल वार्मिंग और क्‍लाइमेट की चिंता करता है तो भारत इंटरनेशनलसोलर एलाइंस का solution ले करके आया है।

दुनिया टेरेरिज्‍म से परेशान है तो भारत मानवतावादी शक्तियों को एक कर-करके democratic values में विश्‍वास करने वाले लोगों को एक हो करके, मानवता के खिलाफ ये लड़ाई है। ये किसी देश, जाति, धर्म, सम्‍प्रदाय से जोड़ करके नहीं, ये मानवता के खिलाफ लड़ाई है। सभी मानवतावादी शक्तियां एक होनी चाहिए और भारत ने इसको lead किया है।

Third world countries, उनको उनके हक मिलने चाहिए, इसका प्रवक्‍ता आज भारत बना हुआ है। तो भारत ने अपनी जिम्‍मेवारियों को भलीभांति निभाने का प्रयास किया है और इसलिए आप देख रहे हैं कि आज भारत ने अपनी जगह बना ली है। हर इंटरनेशनल फोरम में आज भारत एजेंडा सेट करता है।

जी-20 Summit के अंदर black money के खिलाफ लड़ाई लड़ने के लिए initiative  भारत ने लिया, आज जी-20 समूह के देश अपने बैंकों को real time information देने के लिए भारत के साथ समझौता कर रहे हैं और दुनिया के देशों के साथ भी समझौता कर रहे हैं।

तो भारत आज एकtrend setter बन रहा है, एक एजेंडा सेट कर रहा है, भारत अपनी अहमियत, भारत अपना प्रोफाइल दुनिया में एक नए विश्‍वास के साथ पैदा करवा रहा है।

प्रसून जोशी– आपने जो बिल्‍कुल आंख मिलाकर बात करने की बात की और एजेंडा सेट करने की बात की, I think very clear it tells us where India is going towards, where we are marching towards.

एक सवाल है, बहुत कम वक्‍त हमारे पास है, तो बहुत से सवाल लेना चाहते हैं, बहुत से सवाल आए हैं पर एक सवाल जो पहले से वेटिंग पर है, अनुश्री घिसाद जी का, कृपया अपना सवाल पूछें।

अनुश्री घिसाद – नमस्ते मोदीजी जी।

प्रधानमंत्री – नमस्‍ते।

अनुश्री घिसाद – मोदीजी आपने भारत के हित में कई अनोखे कदम उठाए हैं। और इसके नतीजे हमने सिर्फ देश में नहीं बल्कि अंतर्राष्‍ट्रीय स्‍तर पर भी देखे हैं। बावजूद इसके आज देश में ऐसी कई सारी शक्तियां हैं जो किसी भी कीमत पर सत्‍ता हासिल करने में जुटी हुई हैं। तो क्‍या ऐसी गतिविधियों के चलते हुए आप कभी डगमगाते नहीं?

प्रधानमंत्री – देखिए, मैं मानता हूं ये लोकतंत्र की ब्‍यूटी है। लोकतंत्र में अगर विरोध नहीं होता है, आलोचना नहीं होती है, तो, तो फिर वो लोकतंत्र कैसे हो सकता हैजी? और मैं मानता हूं और ये मेरा conviction है, ये सिर्फ शब्‍द नहीं हैं। मैं मानता हूं डेमोक्रेसी की अगर उत्‍तम से उत्‍तम कोई ब्‍यूटी है तो वो criticism है।

मैं मानता हूं मोदी सरकार की भरपूर आलोचना होनी चाहिए। हर प्रकार से आलोचना होनी चाहिए। criticism से ही तप करके डेमोक्रेसी पनपती है और सरकारों को भी और शासन में बैठे हुए लोगों को भी वो सतर्क रखती है। और इसलिए अगर कोई आलोचना करता है, इसको मैं मेरा सौभाग्‍य मानता हूं। मैं उसे बुरा नहीं मानता।

लेकिन मेरी चिंता आलोचना नहीं है। दुर्भाग्‍य ये है कि आलोचना करने के लिए बहुत रिसर्च करना पड़ता है। बहुत मेहनत करनी पड़ती है। उसकी बारीकी में जाना पड़ता है, facts and figuresइकट्ठे करने पड़ते हैं। हिस्‍ट्री पूरी निकालनी पड़ती है। अब आज ऐसी आपधापी का समय है कि किसी के पास इतना टाइम ही नहीं है। बहुत कम लोग हैं जो अब ये काम कर पाते हैं। अच्‍छा, हरेक को इतनी तेजी है कि भई 24X7. मैं आगे निकलूं, ब्रेकिंग न्‍यूज मैं दूं, या वो दें, आपाधापी का युग है और इसलिए criticism ने दुर्भाग्‍य से उस मर्यादाओं को तोड़ करके allegation का रूप ले लिया है।

लोकतंत्र की अगर सबसे बड़ी ताकत है तो criticism है और लोकतंत्र का सबसे विनाशक कोई रास्‍ता है तो वो allegation है। और इसलिए एक तंदुरुस्‍त लोकतंत्र के लिएcriticism को सबसे ज्‍यादा पुरस्‍कृत करना चाहिए और allegation से बचने का प्रयास करना चाहिए।

और मैं मानता हूं कि इन मूलभूत तत्‍वों को मैं जानता हूं और मानता हूं इसलिए मैं, मुझे बराबर याद है, मैं तो सरकार में मुझे कोई अगर अच्‍छी खबर की जानकारी देता है तो मेरा सवाल रहता है कि भई ये तो ठीक है, मैं देख लूंगा बाद में। ये बताओ, इसमें वो कौन सी कमियां हैं हमारी, जरा वो दिखाओ पहले। मैं पूछता हूं सामने से। क्‍योंकि कोई पूर्ण नहीं है भई, हम सब इंसान हैं। हम में भी कमियां हैं, हमसे भी गलतियां होती हैं।

कोई है जो बताता है। अगर मैं सुनना ही बंद कर दूंगा तो फिर तो मेरी गलतियां कभी ठीक नहीं होंगी, न मेरे देश का भला होगा। और इसलिए मैं हमेशा criticism का स्‍वागत करता हूं। लेकिन मेरे पर आरोप ये है कि मोदीजी इतना criticism होता है, आप बोलते क्‍यों नहीं हैं?  अरे भाई, आपके criticism को मैं इतना महत्‍व देता हूं कि मैं उसको समझने की कोशिश करता हूं। इससे मैं सुधरने की कोशिश करता हूं। आपका मुंह बंद करना मेरा काम नहीं है। ये तो गलत रास्‍ता है। आप जो बोल रहे हैं मेरे लिए वो मूल्‍यवान चीज है।

आप जो मेरी आलोचना करते हैं वो मेरे लिए बहुत बड़ा खजाना है। वो मेरे लिए gold mine है।

प्रसून जोशी- पर ये कैसे decide करते हैं कि कौन सा criticism आप उसको महत्‍व देंगे और किसको नहीं देना चाहिए?

प्रधानमंत्री – देखिए ये तो black and white  में नहीं हो सकता कि मैं इस criticism को अच्‍छा मानूंगा, इस criticism, जैसे अब ये कार्यक्रम कर रहा हूं। मुझे और आपको दोनों को लगता होगा यार बहुत बढ़िया है। लेकिन कोई कहेगा यार मोदीजी बंद करें तो अच्‍छा है। कोई ये भी कह सकता है कि देखो यार ये मोदीजी ने आज, पता नहीं जवाब नहीं दे पाते हैं कई बार तो जा करके उन्‍होंने stage managed show कर लिया, अपना काम कर रहे हैं। उसमें से भी मैं कोशिश करूंगा, आज के मेरे जवाब जो मैं बोल रहा हूं हो सकता है कोई इसमें से निकालेगा, तो मैं जरूर सोचूंगा। हां यार ये शब्‍द मेरे से मुंह से न निकला होता तो अच्‍छा होता। मैं सोचूंगा, और मैं आज जहां पहुंचा हूं ना, साहब मुझे बहुत लोगों ने बनाया है। बहुत लोगों ने मुझे थपथपा करके कहा मोदीजी ये करो, ये नहीं करो। ये करो, नहीं ये करो। ऐसे करते करते मुझे लाया है। तो ये सब उन्‍होंने जो मेहनत की है उसको मैं मिट्टी में नहीं मिलने दूंगा।

प्रसून जोशी– यस, मोदीजी हम कार्यक्रम के अंत की तरफ बढ़ रहे हैं, हमने कहा भी, घड़ी की तरफ देखा, आपने घड़ी की तरफ देखा और मुझे लगा कि कार्यक्रम को अंत की तरफ बढ़ना चाहिए।

तो एक सवाल जो आखिरी सवाल मैं आपसे पूछना चाहता हूं, आप क्‍या चाहेंगे, इतिहास आपको कैसे याद रखे?

प्रधानमंत्री – आपमें से कोई बता सकता है कि वेद किसने लिखे थे?  दुनिया के सबसे पुराने ग्रंथ और आज भी पांच हजार, दस हजार साल के बाद भी दुनिया को रास्‍ता दिखाने का सामर्थ्‍य रखते हैं। आपको मालूम है क्‍या किसने लिखे थे?  अगर इतने बड़े रचियता का नाम हमें मालूम नहीं है, इतिहास में दर्ज नहीं है तो मोदी तो क्‍या है? एक छोटी सी चीज है जी।

इतिहास में नाम अंकित करने के लिए न मोदी पैदा हुआ है, न मोदी का वो मकसद है और मैं नहीं चाहता हूं मोदी को लोग उन सवा सो करोड़ देशवासियों की तरह ही एक मानें, उससे ज्‍यादा मानने की जरूरत नहीं है। आपको टीचर का काम मिला होगा, आपको ड्राइवर का काम मिला होगा, आपको व्‍यापार का काम मिला होगा, आपको खेती का काम मिला होगा, मुझे ये काम मिला है, उससे ज्‍यादा कुछ नहीं है, मैं नहीं चाहता हूं, इतिहास में अमर होने के लिए।

अगर मकसद है तो मेरा देश अजर-अमर है। दुनिया याद करे तो मेरे देश को याद करे। मेरे देश के भविष्‍य को देखे। मेरे देश के लिए दुनिया गर्व से कहे, ये एक देश है जो मानव कल्‍याण का रास्‍ता दिखा सकता है, विश्‍व को संकटों से बाहर निकालने का सामर्थ्‍य इस धरती में है। ये दुनिया को पता चले मोदी की छवि चमकाने में मुझे interest नहीं है, हिन्‍दुस्‍तान की छवि चमकाने के लिए जिंदगी खपाने में मुझे interest है।

प्रसून जोशी – मोदीजी अंत में, अंत में वो चार पंक्तियां पढूंगा जिससे मैंने यहां शुरू किया था आज, जो मैंने आज ही लिखी थीं, और ये भारत के लिए- 

एक आसमां कम पड़ता है।

एक आसमां कम पड़ता है, और आसमां मंगवा दो।

एक आसमां कम पड़ता है, और आसमां मंगवा दो।

हैं बेसब्र उड़ानें मेरी, पंख ये नीले रंगवा दो।

एक आसमां कम पड़ता है, और आसमां मंगवा दो।

हैं बेसब्र उड़ानें मेरी, पंख ये नीले रंगवा दो।

स्‍वप्‍न करोड़ों सत्‍य हो रहे, स्‍वप्‍न करोड़ों सत्‍य हो रहे,

अब उनका सत्‍कार करो, निकल पड़ा है भारत मेरा, अब तुम जय-जयकार करो।

प्रधानमंत्री– वाह, हमारे यहां राजा रंतीदेव ने कहा है और बहुत ही अच्‍छा कहा है- राजा रंती देव ने और एक राजघराने से निकली हुई बात है। उन्‍होंने कहा है-

न कामये राज्‍यम्, न स्‍वर्गम न पुर्भवम् ।

कामये दु:खतप्रानाम् आर्त्‍ते नाशनम् ।।

न मुझे राज्‍य की कामना है, न मुझे मोक्ष की कामना है, न मुझे पुनर्जन्‍म की कामना है। अगर मेरे हृदय में कामना है तो मुझे उन दुखी-दरिद्रों की सेवा करना, यही मेरी कामना है। उसी कामना को ले करके हम चलें।

मैं फिर एक बार आप सबका बहुत आभारी हूं। प्रसून जी आपका बहुत आभारी हूं कि आपने समय निकाला। मेरी जो गलतियां हो वो आप बताते रहिए, बिना संकोच बताते रहिए। ताकि उन आपके आशीर्वाद के द्वारा, आपके सुझावों के द्वारा सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासियों के कल्‍याण के लिए मैं भी कुछ अपना योगदान दे सकूं। जिस व्‍यवस्‍था के तहत मैं बैठा हूं उस व्‍यवस्‍था के तहत कुछ दे सकूं। इसी एक कामना के साथ आपने इतना समय दिया, आशीर्वाद दिए, मैं आपका बहुत-बहत आभारव्‍यक्‍त करता हूं।

बहुत-बहुत धन्‍यवाद!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi interacted with participants across the globe in Bharat Ki Baat Sabke Saath programme held at London, U.K. 

He also took questions from the participants. Following are the highlights from his interaction with the participants:  

रेलवे स्टेशन मेरे जीवन का स्वर्णिम पृष्ठ जिसने मुझे जीना और जूझना सिखाया|

The person in the Railway Station was Narendra Modi. The person in the Royal Palace in London is the Sevak of 125 crore Indians

My life at the Railway Station taught me so much. It was about my personal struggles. When you said Royal Palace, it is not about me but about the 125 crore people of India

'Besabri' is not a bad thing. If a person has a cycle, a person aspires a scooter. If a person has a scooter, a person aspires a car. It is nature to aspire. India is getting increasingly aspirational

जिस पल संतोष का भाव पैदा हो जाता है, जीवन फिर आगे नहीं बढ़ता। हर आयु, हर युग में कुछ न कुछ नया पाने को गति देता है|

जज्बा होना सबसे ज़रूरी है... मुझे ख़ुशी है कि आज सवा सौ करोड़ लोगों के मन में एक उमंग, आशा और संकल्प का भाव है और लोग मुझसे अपेक्षा कर रहे हैं|

I was not born with an aim to be in history books. I request you all- remember our country and not Modi. I am just like you all, a common citizen of India

Yes, people have more expectations from us because they know that we can deliver. People know that when they say something, the Government will listen and do it.

लोगों की मुझसे अपेक्षा इसलिए है कि उन्हें विश्वास है कि हम करके जरूर दिखाएंगे|

बेसब्री मेरे लिए ऊर्जा है और जब आप ‘सर्वजन हिताय, सर्वजन सुखाय’ के संकल्प को लेकर चलते हैं तो निराशा की बात ही नहीं उठती|

‘तब और अब’ में जमीन आसमान का अंतर क्योंकि जब नीति स्पष्ट हो, नीयत साफ़ हो, और इरादे नेक हों तो उसी व्यवस्था के साथ आप इच्छित परिणाम ले सकते हैं|

During the freedom struggle Mahatma Gandhi did something very different. He turned the freedom struggle into a mass movement. He told every person that whatever you are doing will contribute to India's freedom

Today the need of the hour is to make development a mass movement

Participative democracy makes good governance possible

लोकतंत्र कोई कॉन्ट्रैक्ट एग्रीमेंट नहीं, ये भागीदारी का काम; जनता-जनार्दन की ताकत बहुत होती है और उन पर जितना भरोसा होगा, उसके परिणाम देखने को मिलेंगे|

Look back at India's history. India has never desired anyone else's territory. During World War 1 and 2 we had no stake but our soldiers took part in the Wars. These were big sacrifices. Look at our role in UN Peacekeeping Forces

We believe in peace. But we will not tolerate those who like to export terror. We will give back strong answers and in the language they understand. Terrorism will never be accepted

Those who like exporting terror, I want to tell them that India has changed and their antics will not be tolerated

I do not need to read books to understand poverty. I have lived in poverty, I know what it is to be poor and belong to the backward sections of society. I want to work for the poor, the marginalised and the downtrodden.

18,000 villages did not have electricity. So many women do not have access to toilets. These realities of our nation did not let me sleep. I was determined to bring about a positive change in the lives of India's poor

I am like any common citizen. And, I also have drawbacks like normal people do

मेरी पूँजी है – कठोर परिश्रम, प्रमाणिकता और सवा सौ करोड़ लोगों का प्यार|

मैंने देशवासियों को भरोसा दिलाया था कि मैं गलतियाँ कर सकता हूँ लेकिन गलत इरादे से कोई काम नहीं करूँगा|

We have a million problems but we have a billion people who can solve them

देश में वेलनेस सेंटर हो या प्रिवेंटिव हेल्थकेयर हो, हम हर भारतीय के स्वास्थ्य के लिए काम कर रहे हैं|

One of the things I wanted to do in London was to pay homage to Bhagwan Basaveshwara

भगवान बसवेश्वर ने लोकतंत्र के लिए अपना पूरा जीवन खपा दिया और समाज को जोड़ने का अभूतपूर्व काम किया|

लोकतंत्र, सामाजिक चेतना और नारी सशक्तिकरण के लिए किया गया भगवान बसवेश्वर का प्रयास हम सभी के लिए प्रेरणास्त्रोत|

हम एक ऐसा इको-सिस्टम बना रहे हैं जहाँ सभी के लिए अवसर हो|

आज हम किसान कल्याण के लिए काम कर रहे हैं चाहे वो 2022 तक कृषि से होने वाली आय को दोगुनी करनी हो, यूरिया की आसान उपलब्धता हो या यूरिया की नीम-कोटिंग हो, हम एक निश्चित लक्ष्य के साथ आगे बढ़ रहे हैं|

चाहे कोई पैरामीटर हो, देश के लिए अच्छा करने में हमने कोई कमी नहीं रखी है|

The 125 crore people of India are my family

आज हम आर्टिफिसियल इंटेलिजेंस के युग में जी रहे हैं और हम टेक्नोलॉजी से अलग नहीं रह सकते|

What prevented Indian Prime Ministers from going to Israel. Yes, I will go to Israel and I will even go to Palestine. I will further cooperation with Saudi Arabia and for the energy needs of India I will also engage with Iran

भारत आँख झुकाकर या आँख उठाकर नहीं बल्कि आँख मिला कर बात करने में विश्वास करता है|

Democracy cannot succeed without constructive criticism.

I want this Government to be criticised. Criticism makes democracy strong.

My problem is not against criticism. To criticise, one has to research and find proper facts. Sadly, it does not happen now. What happens instead is allegations

इतिहास में नाम अंकित करना मेरा लक्ष्य नहीं, मैं उसी तरह जैसे मेरे सवा सौ करोड़ देशवासी|

I was not born with an aim to be in history books. I request you all- remember our country and not Modi. I am just like you all, a common citizen of India.

	At the invitation of Prime Minister Theresa May, the Prime Minister of India, Mr Narendra Modi visited the United Kingdom (UK) as a Guest of Government on 18 April 2018. The two leaders held wide-ranging and constructive discussions and underlined our strategic partnership and growing convergence on regional and international issues.Prime Minister Modi will also participate in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London from 19-20 April 2018.


 


	The UK and India have a natural ambition to reinforce our Strategic Partnership, based on shared values, common law and institutions, as the world’s oldest and largest democracies. We are committed members of the Commonwealth. We share a global outlook and commitment to a rules-based international system that strongly opposes unilateral actions that seek to undermine that system through force or coercion. We share the Living Bridge of countless personal and professional ties between our nations.


 


	The UK and India will work closely together and with other Commonwealth member-states, the Commonwealth Secretariat and other partner organisations to address shared and global challenges. We are committed to reinvigorating the Commonwealth, especially ensuring its relevance tosmall and vulnerable states and to our youth, who make up 60% of the Commonwealth's population. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is an important opportunity to address these challenges as we come together and unite under the summit's official theme ""Towards a Common Future”. Specifically, the United Kingdom and India will make commitments to help create a more sustainable, prosperous, secure and fairer future for all Commonwealth citizens by taking action:

Technology Partnership


 


	A UK-India Technology Partnership is central to our joint vision and to our prosperity, today and for our next generations. Our nations are at the forefront of a technology revolution. We will share knowledge, collaborate on research, innovate and create partnerships between our world-class innovation clusters. We will deploy our complementary technological strengths to create high value jobs, enhance productivity, promote trade and investment and tackle shared challenges.


 


	Both sides will scale up collaboration on Future Tech to tackle our global challenges; realising the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI); the digital economy; health technologies; cyber security; and promoting clean growth, smart urbanisation and future mobility – while developing the future skills and capabilities of our youth.


 


	The Government of India welcomes the UK initiative of establishing a UK-India Tech Hub in India as part of our growing bilateral Technology Partnership. The Tech Hub will bring together hi-tech companies to create investment and export opportunities and provide a new platform to share the very best technologies and advance policy collaboration including on Future Mobility, Advanced Manufacturing and Healthcare AI under India’s Aspirational districts’ Programme. We will establish a series of new partnerships between UK regional and Indian State-level tech clusters, to drive joint innovation and R&D. With the support of both Governments we have also announced an India-UK Tech CEO Alliance; signed a Tech UK/NASSCOM MoU focused on skills and new technologies, including industry-led apprenticeship schemes; and launched the new UK FintechRocketship Awards to boost fintech and wider entrepreneurship in India.


 


	Both sides are deploying the best of British and Indian talent in science, research and technology to address priority global challenges. The UK is India’s second largest international research and innovation partner. The UK-India Newton-Bhabhaprogramme will have lifted joint research and innovation awards to over £400 million by 2021, since 2008. We will also deepen our joint working relationship on health to make the UK and India safer and healthier places to live, including through scaling up and rolling out AI and digital health technologies.
	
	Trade, Investment and Finance


 


	The leaders agreed to forge a dynamic new India-UKTrade Partnership, to develop new trading arrangements as the UK assumes responsibility for its independent trade policy, facilitate investment in both directions and intensify collaboration on shared or complementary strengths. Building on the recommendations of the recently-completed UK-India Joint Trade Review, we will work together on a sector-based roadmap, to reduce barriers to trade, make it easier to do business in both countries and enable a stronger bilateral trade relationship after the UK exits the EU. We will also ensure continued application to the UK of EU-India Agreements during the Implementation Period following the UK’s departure from the EU, and put in place arrangements to replicate relevant EU-India agreements beyond this period.


 


	The leaders reaffirmed the crucial role of the rules-based multilateral trading system, and the importance of enhancing free, fair, and open trade for achieving sustainable growth and development. They reaffirmed their commitment to work together with all members of the WTO and to take forward a dialogue under the Joint Working Group on Trade which will support a shared commitment to the global rules-based system and to the WTO’s role in underpinning it. 


 


	The UK has been the largest G20 investor in India over the last ten years and India has the fourth largest number of investment projects in the UK. We will begin a new dialogue on investment to improve our mutual understanding of priorities and reviewfuture opportunities for cooperation. 


 


	India welcomed the decision by the UK to provide additional support to Indian businesses by establishing a reciprocal Fast Track Mechanism for Indian investments into the UK. A programme of technical cooperation will help in improving the regulatory environment. The two sides will support initiatives of the business stakeholders, including those proposed by the UK-India CEO Forum which met today, to achieve shared prosperity for India and the UK.


 


	Both sides welcomed the prominent role played by the City of London in global finance and investment.About 75% of the global value in rupee-denominated ""masala bonds” issued on the London Stock Exchange with a third of these being green bonds.


 


	The Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF), a joint initiative by the Governments of India and the UK under India’s flagship National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, will provide financing to the fast-growing Indian renewable energy sector. With a commitment of £120 million from each side, the GGEF is expected to raise up to £500 million from institutional investors. GGEF will help accelerate achieving India’s target of 175GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and also invest in other related sectors such as clean transportation, water and waste management. We look forward to future cooperation on energy and infrastructure policy and have agreed to work together on smart urbanisation.


 


	We also welcomed the establishment of a FinTech dialogue between our two countries – including the proposed new regulatory cooperation agreement. Our financial services collaboration will be enhanced by a programme of technical cooperation to help develop markets in insolvency, pensions and insurance. Further collaboration in these areas will be set out by Finance Ministers when they meet for the tenth round of the Economic and Financial Dialogue later this year.


 


	India and the UK acknowledged the importance of connectivity in today’s globalised world. They underlined that connectivity initiatives must be based on the key principles of good governance, rule of law, openness and transparency; should follow social and environmental standards, principles of financial responsibility, accountable debt-financing practices; and must be pursued in a manner that respects international obligations, standards, best practice and delivers tangible benefits.
	
	Responsible Global Leadership


 


	The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to lead the fight against climate change. Both sides noted that addressing climate change and promoting secure, affordable and sustainable supplies of energy are key shared priorities, and agreed to cooperate on reducing the cost of development and deployment of clean energy projects through technology innovation, knowledge sharing, capacity building, trade and investment, and project establishment.


 


	The United Kingdom welcomed the pro-active steps taken by India in establishing the International Solar Alliance (ISA). The leaders noted the successful holding of the joint event between the ISA and London Stock Exchange (LSE) with support from the two governments as part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting week. The event marked the UK joining the Alliance, highlighted the proposed collaboration between the UK and ISA on solar financing, developing next generation solar technologies, and demonstrating UK solar business’s expertise to support the delivery of ISA’s objectives. The event also highlighted the role of the LSE as a financial organisation that can play a key role in furthering ISA’s objectives towards mobilisation of investment of over US$1,000 billion into solar energy by 2030 in target ISA countries.


 


	As thriving democracies, we share a desire to work closely together and with all who share our objective to support a rules-based international order that upholds agreed international norms, global peace and stability. Together the UK and India are a force for good in an uncertain world. We are sharing our experience and knowledge to tackle global challenges. India’s Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Cancer Research UK propose to launch a £10 million bilateral research initiative which will focus on low cost approaches to cancer treatment. UK’s Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and DBT will lead the ""Farmer Zone” initiative, an open-source data platform for smart agriculture which will use biological research and data to improve the lives of small and marginal farmers anywhere in the world. DBT will also partner with UK’s Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) on the Towards a Sustainable Earth initiative, which seeks to prioritise research and innovation for sustainable and resilient human development.


 


	We will strengthen our partnership on global development, to accelerate progress to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. We will ensure that the benefits of increased finance, new markets, trade, investment, connectivity and economic integration are shared by as many countries as possible – and by the poorest and most marginalised – to build a more prosperous and safer future.
	
	Defence and Cyber Security


 


	In 2015, we pledged a new Defence and International Security Partnership (DISP) to make security and defence a cornerstone of our relationship. The nature of threats that we face continues to change – so we must be innovative and agile in our response. We shall design, create and manufacture technologies that will address these threats; and our security and military forces will share technologies, capabilities and equipment.


 


	A secure, free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific is in the interests of India, the UK and the international community. The UK and India will also work together to tackle threats such as piracy, protect freedom of navigation and open access, and improve maritime domain awareness in the region.


 


	We have agreed to further enhance our cooperation to promote international security and stability in cyberspace through a framework that recognises the applicability of international law to State behaviour in a free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace. 


 

Counter-Terrorism
 


	The two leaders reiterated their strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms including terrorism and terror-related incidents in both India and the UK. Both leaders also affirmed that terrorism cannot be justified on any grounds whatsoever it may be and it should not be associated with any religion, creed, nationality and ethnicity.


 


	The leaders agreed that terrorist and extremist organisations need to be denied space to radicalise, recruit and conduct attacks on innocent people; for this all countries need to work together to disrupt terrorist networks, their financing and movement of terrorists, including foreign terrorist fighters.
	The leaders agreed to strengthen cooperation to take decisive and concerted actions against globally-proscribed terrorists and terror entities to protect our citizens, including Lashkar-e-Tayibba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, Haqqani Network, Al Qaeda, ISIS (Da’esh) and their affiliates, as well as tackling the online radicalisation and violent extremism which feeds this.


 


	In the wake of the appalling nerve agent attack in Salisbury, the UK and India have reiterated their shared interest in strengthening the disarmament and non-proliferation regimes against the spread and use of chemical weapons. They shared their deepest concern about the continued reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. They oppose the use of chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anybody, under any circumstances and are committed to strengthening the effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. They emphasise the need for urgent investigations and underline that the conduct of all investigations of any use of chemical weapons must be strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.
	
	Education and People-to-People


 


	We welcome the best and brightest to study and work in the UK, especially in subjects and sectors that develop the skills and capabilities that will boost the prosperity of both our countries.


 


	The two leaders lauded the successful completion of the India-UK Year of Culture in 2017. The year-long programme saw an unprecedented level of cultural exchange showcasing artistic, cultural and literary traditions in both countries and was a fitting celebration of the deep cultural ties that bind India and the UK. 


 


	The leaders welcomed the 70th anniversary of the British Council in India and its work to train teachers, deliver skills programmes for youth, and support cultural exchanges.


 


	The two leaders agreed that it is the Living Bridge between the people of the two countries that gives the greatest optimism that the next generation of India and UK will have an even more robust and stronger engagement and exchange. The leaders agreed to encourage and support this Living Bridge. 


 

Conclusion
 


	We are committed to making this a strategic partnership, that spans the globe and the century, seeing our special relationship evolve and improve in the coming years. We encourage our business, cultural and intellectual leaders to exploit the millions of interactions that already link India and the UK, from family to finance, business to Bollywood, sport to science – so that millions more British and Indians exchange and learn, travel, trade and thrive together.


 


	Prime Minister Modi thanked Prime Minister Theresa May and the Government of the United Kingdom for the warm hospitality extended to him and his delegation and looked forward to welcoming her in India.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Indian Community in Stockholm. He thanked the Government of Sweden, in particular His Majesty the King of Sweden; and the Prime Minister of Sweden, Mr. Stefan Lofven who was present at the event, for the warm welcome he received in Sweden.

He said that India is going through a great transformation today. He said that the current Union Government had been elected on the mandate of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas. He said the Government has worked towards a developed and inclusive India, in the last four years. He said all efforts are being made to create a New India by 2022.

The Prime Minister said that through initiatives  such as International Yoga Day, efforts are also being made to see that India emerges as a global thought leader once again. He said the world is looking at India with confidence. In this context, he mentioned humanitarian relief and rescue efforts, the International Solar Alliance, and membership of key regimes such as MTCR, Wassenaar Arrangement, and Australia Group. He said the world is acknowledging India's technological capability, including its space programme.

The Prime Minister said that because of digital infrastructure, the format of engagement between citizens and Government is changing. Technology is bringing about accountability and transparency, he said. He said access to Government is no longer a privilege, but a practice. In this context, he mentioned faster file disposal, Ease of Doing Business, GST, Direct Benefit Transfer, and access to cooking gas through the Ujjwala Yojana. 

The Prime Minister said that through the MUDRA scheme, there are new opportunities available to entrepreneurs. He said 74 percent of the beneficiaries under the MUDRA scheme till now, are women. He also mentioned the Atal Innovation Mission, Skill India and Start Up India.

The Prime Minister said that India is also building International Partnerships to boost innovation. In this context he mentioned the innovation partnership with Sweden, and a similar initiative with Israel. He said the Government is focusing on Ease of Living. In this context, he also mentioned the Ayushman Bharat scheme, which he described as the world's biggest healthcare assurance scheme.

The Prime Minister said that these steps are indicative of a transformation in India. He said that towards this end, the partnerships with Sweden and the other Nordic countries are very important.

The Prime Minister urged the gathering to not limit their connect with India, to just an emotional one. He said the emerging New India offers them many opportunities to innovate, trade and invest as well.

                My friend, the Honourable Prime Minister of Sweden, Mr Löfven,

All my enthusiastic friends of Indian Origin,

Good evening!

Hello to all my brothers and sisters,

I want to express my gratitude to the people and the government of Sweden, especially His Majesty the king of Sweden and Sweden's Prime Minister Mr Löfven for welcoming me and my delegation in Sweden.

Mr. Löfven's warm words in his address have touched my heart. Last night he had come to the Airport to receive and welcome me. He even dropped me at my hotel.

This gesture and honour is not only for me but also for you and the 125 crore Indians. With this feeling in mind, he had participated in the Make in India programme in 2016 and had also participated in a similar event organised in Sweden last year. 

I thank him profusely for the love he has for India and the Indians living in Sweden.

I request you all to give a standing ovation to the Honourable Prime Minister of Sweden as a token of respect.

Friends,

You have carved out a niche for yourselves here through innovative skills, professional attitude, cultural integration and Indian values. I would like to congratulate you for keeping alive the soul of India and Indian values even after living outside India.

You all speak different languages, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bangla or Marathi and so on. There are about 100 languages and 1700 dialects in India. If I start giving you the entire list, probably I won't be able to finish my speech until tomorrow morning.

Languages, conditions or circumstances could be different for everyone but one thing binds us all together and that is the pride of being an Indian.

This is the feeling that binds us together, inspires us to be with each other in difficult times and that gives us new energy and new resolutions.

This is the feeling that inspires all of us to stand up as a token of respect whenever we hear the words 'Vande Mataram' and 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai'!

This is the feeling that makes every Indian proud of the success achieved by Indians like Mary Kom and Saina Nehwal.

Friends,

Today the country is going through a big phase of change. Today the government in India is going to greater extent to take India to New Heights in the 21st century for her welfare and self-respect. Four years ago the people of India had provided us with unprecedented mandate of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. During the last 4 years we have made every effort to build a developed India by our efforts towards building a 'New India' by the year 2022 when India will complete 75 years of independence. We have taken a vow of ' Sankalp se Sidhhi'. 

At the same time we have enhanced the respect for Indianism and India's rich tradition globally. Our efforts and your cooperation in the areas of International Yoga Day, Ayurveda, the age-old vision of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam and the balance between man and nature and so on have established India as a 'thought leader' on the Global platform.

Friends,

Moreover, regions like Africa, Small island nations of the Pacific, ASEAN, Europe or Asia today consider India as a trusted partner and a trustworthy friend.

Humanity looks towards India during times of crisis, be it the earthquake of Nepal or the floods of Sri Lanka. During Yemen war, we had rescued not only 4000 Indians but also about 2000 foreigners.

In the last 4 years, we have taken several such steps that have increased the faith of the world in India.

A few days ago you may have seen that the International Solar Alliance Summit was organised in Delhi. In such a short span of time, more than 60 countries have joined this initiative spearheaded by India for a green earth.

India's membership in the three regimes, the Missile Technology Control Regime, Australia Group and Wassenaar Arrangement, is an indication of India's impact and her acceptance by the international community.

Friends,

The world is appreciating our technological capabilities. India's space programme is one of the world's top 5 exploration programmes. India's space programme is not only of the highest quality but also cost effective. This is the reason why we have become the hope of many other countries in the world that do not have their space programmes. Last year we had launched the South Asia satellite that is being used by our neighbouring countries.

Friends,

We are using Technology within the country to ensure accountability and transparency. With the help of digital infrastructure, the engagement between the government and the citizens has totally transformed. Access to the government is no longer a privilege but has now become a practice. The common man is now able to engage and converse with the government directly. The old working style of the government has also totally changed. The piling up of files is no longer there and the focus is now on finishing the suspended work at a faster pace.

Today, setting up and doing business in India has become easier. For the first time India has made an improvement of 42 ranks in Ease of Doing Business to make a place for her within the top 100.

The historical reform brought in the country's indirect tax regime through GST has now become an integral part of life. There was an unprecedented growth in the country’s tax base and the businessmen who used to face a lot of hurdles previously due to different types of checks and obstacles are now relieved.

You must have heard about the use of JAM Trinity – the Jan Dhan bank account for the public, Aadhaar and Mobile phones, for social welfare. A system of Direct Benefit Transfer has been created with the help of this Trinity.

This provides direct benefits of the welfare schemes to those who are in need of it. There was a time when fake IDs used to be made in the names of those daughters that were not even born. Those IDs were used to depict the unborn daughters as widows and pensions meant for widows were taken by showing those fake IDs. However, the situation is different now. The poor is getting the money that he rightfully deserves. You will be glad to know that with this single scheme about 83 thousand crore rupees, i.e. more than 12 billion dollars were saved from falling into wrong hands after the ghost beneficiaries were eliminated.

Friends,

We have left behind the old culture of merely doing lip service about eliminating poverty. We have made 'empowerment' as the tool for poverty alleviation.

The Mantra of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas' is now becoming a reality with the empowerment of weaker sections of the society and women.

Under Ujjwala Yojana, we are providing free gas connection to the poor women across the country. Our target is to achieve 80 million connections by the year 2020 and in less than 2 years we have already provided 36 million connections.

Earlier our mothers and sisters had to inhale smoke equivalent to that of 400 cigarettes but now they are getting clean cooking fuel.

The availability of cooking gas has also improved. Many of you might have migrated out of India several years ago. You might remember that at that time even gas cylinders were sold in black market. One had to face a lot of hurdle for getting a gas connection. Sometimes we had to ask our neighbours for gas cylinders. However, today the gas agency calls and asks whether you need a cylinder or not!

The entrepreneurs in every corner of the country are getting new opportunities due to micro-finance schemes like MUDRA. The scheme is for those who didn't get loans or financial support for their small businesses. As a result, under this Yojana, about 5.3 lakh crore rupees i.e. 12 crore (120 million) loans of about 90 billion dollars have been given. These are not 12 crore loans but 12 crore dreams and we have taken steps to fulfil them. This is also a medium of job creation. 74% of these entrepreneurs are women.

A system is being created for future economic progress through Atal Innovation Mission, Skill India Mission and Start-up India Mission.

Over 1 lakh students have taken part in this year's Smart India Hackathon. Thousands of them have given their suggestions regarding challenges that the country is facing. I had also spent time with these young talents across the country through video conference.

We are creating International partnerships to promote such efforts. Today we have signed an 'Innovation Partnership' with Sweden. In the month of January we had launched the iCreate centre with Israel for Innovation and entrepreneurship.

Innovation, skill development and entrepreneurship will benefit only when the quality of life of the country's citizens improves.

Today the government is focusing upon Ease of Living. Just a few days back the world's largest Healthcare Assurance scheme 'Ayushman Bharat' was announced. This is one of the largest schemes of the world. Friends, no other scheme can possibly compete with it. Now just one phase has been launched.

It has two components. First is laying a network of Health and Wellness centres across the country and the second is to provide Health Insurance cover of rupees 5 lakhs to 40% of the poorest population of the country.

Brothers and sisters,

This is not just reform but transformation. We have vowed to transform India.

Friends,

This year on 2nd October not only India but the entire world will celebrate 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. We have decided that as a tribute to this great personality we will frame transformation strategy for India. Our journey could be long but we are on the right track. More over our resolution to reach the destination is determined.

Friends,

We consider this partnership with Sweden to be very crucial in building a transformed India and a New India. We want to take our partnership to a new level not only with Sweden but also with other Nordic countries.

Apart from Sweden, I also had the opportunity to discuss with Prime Ministers of Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Finland. In addition to bilateral talks, the India-Nordic Summit between the leaders of India and the Nordic countries concluded sometime back. We have decided to further strengthen our partnership for innovation, skills and technological cooperation.

Friends,

You have played a major role in India's growth story and international standing. Even though there is one single Indian Embassy in Sweden, our Ambassador is not one. You all are Indian ambassadors.

Today I want to request you all. Don't limit yourselves to just emotional connect with India. There are great opportunities in the emerging New India for those who want to innovate, trade and invest in India.

The new India is waiting for you. Now direct flights between India and Sweden have started. So there is no point in delaying.

Brothers and sisters,

There is a paucity of time. I have to reach London for a programme. Thank you for giving me the opportunity of connecting with you all in such a short time. I am delighted.

You have come here and given me the opportunity to talk about New India. Thank you very much for your hospitality and blessings. I also thank the Prime Minister for expressing his love towards India and Indian community. I thank the Prime Minister from the bottom of my heart.

 

Thank you!

                At the invitation of Prime Minister of Sweden Stefan Lofven, Prime Minister of India visited Sweden on 16-17 April 2018. This was Prime Minister’s first visit to Sweden as well as a visit to Sweden by Indian Prime Minister after three decades. On arrival in Stockholm on 16 April, Prime Minister was received by PM Lofven. 

On 17 April, Prime Minister had an audience with His Majesty King Carl XVI Gustaf. King Carl XVI Gustaf visited India earlier in 1993 and 2005. Prime Minister had a meeting with PM Lofven. They met earlier when PM Lofven visited India in February 2016 and participated in the ‘Make in India’ Week in Mumbai with a strong business delegation.  In October 2017, PM Lofven participated in ‘Make in India: Sweden 2017’ event organized in Stockholm. Prime Minister’s discussions with PM Lofven focused on strengthening bilateral ties with special emphasis on building closer economic relations as well as important global and regional issues. PM Lofven also hosted a lunch for Prime Minister. On the occasion of the visit, India and Sweden signed a Joint Declaration on India-Sweden Innovation Partnership for a Sustainable Future and adopted a Joint Action Plan. Both Prime Ministers participated in a Round-table meeting with about 30 CEOs of leading Swedish enterprises and addressed the CEOs. Additionally, Leader of Moderate Party & Leader of Opposition in Swedish Parliament, Ulf Kristersson, called on Prime Minister. Ulf Kristersson, who has been in Swedish politics for many years, took over the position of Leader of Opposition in October 2017.  

The visit took place at a time when India- Sweden economic ties have strengthened considerably. Over 170 Swedish companies have invested USD 1.4 billion since 2000. Some of the Swedish companies have been present in India for over a century. Around 70 Indian companies have established their presence in Sweden. India-Sweden annual bilateral trade stands at around USD 1.8 billion.

In the evening, Prime Minister will meet the vibrant Indian community in Sweden, before his departure for London.  PM Lofven is also expected to attend the community event as well.  Sweden is home to more than 20000 members of Indian diaspora, including around 2000 Indian students studying in various institutions. 

 

India - Nordic Council Summit

During the visit, India and Sweden also hosted an India-Nordic Summit, entitled ‘India-Nordic Summit : Shared Values, Mutual Prosperity’. At the invitation of Prime Minister of India and PM Lofven, all other Nordic Prime Ministers, PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen of Denmark, PM Juha Sipila of Finland, PM Katrin Jakobsdottir of Iceland and PM Erna Solberg of Norway, attended the Summit hosted on 17 April. India has substantial economic ties with Nordic countries.  Annual India-Nordic trade is about $5.3 billion.  The cumulative Nordic FDI into India has been $2.5 billion.

During the Summit, the Prime Ministers pledged to deepen cooperation between India and the Nordic countries and focused their discussions on key issues related to global security, economic growth, innovation and climate change. They acknowledged that innovation and digital transformation drive growth in an interconnected world, which underpin a growing engagement between India and the Nordic countries. The Summit emphasized the India’s strong commitment to innovation and digital initiatives as key to prosperity and sustainable development, with national flagship programmes such as Make in India, Start-up India, Digital India and Clean India. Nordic solutions in clean technologies, maritime solutions, port modernization, food processing, health and life-sciences and agriculture were mentioned. At the end of the Summit, India and the Nordic countries issued a Joint Statement.

Additionally, Prime Minister had separate bilateral meetings with PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen of Denmark, PM Juha Sipila of Finland, PM Katrin Jakobsdottir of Iceland and PM Erna Solberg of Norway on 17 April. The discussions focused on bilateral ties as well as major global and regional issues of mutual interest. A number of MoUs were signed on the occasion with these countries. These were an MOU on Cooperation in the field of Sustainable and Smart Urban Development, an MOU on Cooperation in the fields of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, an MOU on Food Safety Cooperation and an MOU on Cooperation in Agricultural Research and Education with Denmark and an MOU on the Establishment of the ICCR Chair for Hindi Language with Iceland.

                Your Excellency, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven,

Friends from Media!
 

This is my first visit to Sweden.The Prime Minister of India is visiting Sweden after a gap of nearly three decades.I express my heartfelt gratitude to Prime Minister Lofven and the Swedish government for our warm reception and honor in Sweden.During this visit, Prime Minister Lofven has organized India's Summit along with other Nordic countries. I also express my heartfelt gratitude for this.

 

In India's Make in India mission, Sweden has been a strong partner since its inception. In 2016, in the Make in India program in Mumbai, Prime Minister Lofven himself participated with a very big Business Delegation.The most prominent program of Make in India outside India was also held in Sweden in October last year. It is a matter of great happiness and pride for us that Prime Minister Mr. Lofven himself participated in it.I believe that the most prominent theme in our conversation today was how Sweden can do a win-win partnership with India under the opportunities created by India's development.As a result, today we have agreed on an Innovation Partnership and Joint Action Plan.

 

Innovation, Investment, Start-ups, Manufacturing etc. are our main dimensions of partnership.With them, we are also focusing on many topics like renewable energy, urban transport, waste management, which are the topics related to the quality of life of the people of India.On topics related to trade and investment today, Prime Minister Lofven and I will also discuss with Sweden's leading CEOs.

 

Another key pillar of our bilateral relations is our defense and security cooperation.Sweden has been India's partner for a long time in the defense sector. And I believe that in the future, in this area, especially in defense production, many new opportunities will be created for our cooperation.

 

We have decided to strengthen our security cooperation, especially cyber security cooperation.We agree on one thing, it is that the importance of our relations are also at the regional and global stage.We have very close cooperation on the international stage, and will continue even further.

 

Today we have exchanged views in detail about the developments taking place in Europe and Asia.

 

In the end, I would once again like to thank Prime Minister Lofvenfrom my heart.

 

Thank you very much.

“India's contingent at the 2018 Commonwealth Games has made every Indian extremely proud. All our sportspersons gave their best and played very well. I congratulate all those athletes who are bringing back medals. 

Every athlete who represented India at 2018 Commonwealth Games inspires us. Their life stories illustrate the power of dedication and a never-say-die attitude that made them overcome countless hurdles to attain the heights of success they did at the CWG.

I hope India’s success at 2018 Commonwealth Games motivates more youngsters to pursue sports and creates larger awareness on the importance of fitness in everyone’s lives. 

On our part, we in the Government are doing everything possible to strengthen the FitIndia movement”, the Prime Minister said in a series of tweets.

Babasaheb Ambedkar will remain immortal!

 

Babasaheb Ambedkar will remain immortal!

 

......

 

My colleague of in the Council of Ministers Shri JP Nadda ji, the popular Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Dr. Raman Singh Ji, Chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes Mr. Nand Kumar Sai, other Ministers of Chhattisgarh government and my dear brothers and sisters of Bijapur Bastar who have come here in large numbers.

 

I bow down to the gods and goddesses who have taught not only the people of Bijapur but also the people of the entire Bastar region to live in harmony with nature. From the soil of Bijapur I would like to commemorate the martyr Veer Gaind Singh who had sacrificed his life while fighting against the British about 200 years ago. Similarly, another leader was also born here about hundred years ago i.e. Veer Gundadhur. 

 

The bravery of such heroes like Gaind Singh and Gundadhur has been mentioned in your folk songs for several generations. I salute the heroic sons and daughters of this great land. Event today new stories of heroism are being written on this land.

 

Friends,

 

Several soldiers of the security forces have never cared for their lives while dealing with the local challenges, the region's development and the people's safety. These soldiers are playing an important role in constructing the roads, installing mobile towers, hospitals and schools and for strengthening Chhattisgarh's infrastructure.

 

Many of these security personnel involved in the development of Chhattisgarh have lost their lives. A memorial has been built in the memory of those who were martyred in Naxalite attacks. I salute them and would like to pay my tributes to them.

 

Friends,

 

This day, 14th April, is extremely important for the 125 crore people of the country. Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar ji. It is a great privilege for me to have come here today and to have got an opportunity to seek his blessings. On the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar ji, I would like you all to raise your hands and say with me loudly-

 

Jai Bhim Jai Bhim!

 

Jai Bhim Jai Bhim!

 

Jai Bhim Jai Bhim!

 

The echo of Baba Saheb's name in the air of Bijapur and Bastar is making us grateful! I salute the hope and aspiration associated with the name of Baba Saheb.

 

Friends,

 

Our government had started the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Urban Mission from the soil of Chhattisgarh. Even Pradhan Mantri Grameen Awas Yojana had started from Chhattisgarh. These schemes are expediting the countries progress at the national level. Even during this visit to Chhattisgarh, I will be launching Gram Swaraj Yojana and the first phase of 'Ayushman Bharat Yojana'. This Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is meant for ensuring that all the schemes that have been launched in the last four years for the poor, Dalits, women, tribal, backward and disadvantaged sections of the society, actually reach them. The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan will continue across the country from today till May 5th. 

I believe that the schemes of the central government and the state government that were started here on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb will be successful in creating a new record for changing the path of development.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

Baba Saheb was highly educated. He could have spent a luxurious life in the prosperous countries of the world. After studying abroad, he returned to India and devoted his life to the cause of the backward and the depressed classes and the tribals. He was determined to provide opportunities to the deprived classes of the society to lead a normal life. The classes of the society that were left behind have now become aware and conscious and are hungry for development. They have the desire to claim their rights. Everything was possible because of Babasaheb Ambedkar's contribution.

 

My dear brothers and sisters,

 

Today this son of a poor mother, who belongs to a backward community, is the Prime Minister of the country only because of Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Baba Saheb has played a very significant role in awakening the hopes and aspirations of Lakhs of people like me.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

There are many people like farmers, service-sector employees, self-employed and probably some students present here before me. I want you to answer one question. Even if you don't speak aloud, you may think of the answer in your minds. Doesn't the person aspiring for something great in life work harder? On the other hand, when a person doesn't want to achieve anything in life, keeps sleeping all day long. Isn't it? A person with a dream keeps awake all the time and works hard. Isn't it? Ask yourselves.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

When a farmer is confident that there will be a good monsoon and the monsoon actually begins well, then don't you think the farmer will put more effort? As soon as the sky is overcast, the farmer starts working hard because his dreams are associated with those clouds.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

Today with the inspiration of Babasaheb I have come here to revive this new trust in the people of Bijapur and to ignite a new faith and a new desire in the administration of this place. I have come here to tell you that the central government is standing by your hopes, aspirations and desires.

 

There's is a reason behind choosing Bijapur district. I don't remember clearly but I want to tell you one incident. I was not a very good student in school. I was an average student but some of the students were weaker than me. Our teacher used to teach those students after school with a lot of patience. He used to focus on every student. As soon as the teacher used to instil confidence in the students that they are not weak and encouraged them, those students used to come up to the level of the other students in class in a few days. Some of those students even used to leave the bright students far behind.

 

I believe there will be several such people who might have witnessed such an incident. You might have seen in different fields that if those who are lagging behind are encouraged, they have the ability to leave everyone else behind in a very short span of time. Bijapur is not the only district that is labelled as backward. More than 100 districts are in the same position. Even after so many years of independence, these districts continue to lag behind. They are not at fault for this. What is the reason that more than 100 districts are still backward even after the Constitution of Ambedkar ji had made so many provisions?

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

Had the mothers of these districts no right to have healthy children or to have children who are devoid of Anaemia, who have a proper growth? Didn't the people of these districts have the expectation of being a part of development from this country? Didn't the daughters of these districts have the right of getting educated and skilled? Weren't they expecting these things? Even after having several things like hospitals, schools, roads and clean drinking water there are many things lacking as several districts are still lagging behind. It is ironical that the backward districts are the ones with rich natural resources. Doesn't your Bijapur district possess these things? Everything is there.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

I have come to Bijapur to tell you and assure you that although you were labelled as a backward district, now work will start on a large scale; it will be a new beginning with a new idea. I want to congratulate Bijapur for one more thing. I had called the officers of these 100-125 districts in January and had announced that I would visit the district on 14th April that would progress at the fastest rate in three months. I want to congratulate the entire team of Bijapur for grabbing the number 1 position in the rate of progress among more than 100 backward districts. In a way, I have come here to salute your achievement and to take inspiration from it so that the 115 districts realize that if Bijapur can achieve this in 100 days, rest of the 115 districts can also make it in the coming months.

 

I will call these 115 aspirational districts not only aspiring but also ambitious. Now these districts will no longer be dependent or backward. They will emerge as new models of valour, transformation and outcome. We are moving ahead with this belief.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

You might be wondering how I can claim these things with such confidence. Before coming to Bijapur, our government has studied more than 100 districts and analysed the results. Our experience of three months tells us that if all the people of the district, the administration of the district, the officials, and every village join the campaign and if you start a mass movement, then we can achieve something that could not be achieved in the last 70 years after independence.

 

Friends,

 

You can never reach new heights by walking on old paths. World cannot be changed with old methods. Rules need to be changed with time. One has to use new ways to achieve new goals. Our government is working with a new approach for the 115 backward districts including Bijapur. I want to give you one example of this approach. My farmer brothers are present in large numbers. So they will easily understand this. Our farmer brothers cultivate paddy, maize and pulses. I want to ask them about the amount of water that they used for each of these crops. Do you use the same amount of water for maize that you use for vegetables or paddy? Your answer will be -no. You don't use same amount of water. Paddy needs more water. You work on different crops in different ways. Isn't it? If the requirements are different, the weaknesses as well as challenges will also be different. Keeping this in mind, every district has to plan its strategy and frame a development plan. They have to do this on the basis of their local resources.

 

Your administration will have to frame a plan based on your needs and decide upon how to accomplish the same. These small steps will take you to the top of this race of development. The centre, state government, blocks and villages will join hands together in this endeavour.

 

Friends,

 

Today, on this platform, a great scheme to end social inequality and to ensure social justice is being launched. The first phase of 'Ayushman Bharat' is being launched from the soil of Chhattisgarh, Bijapur district, on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Ambedkar. In the first phase, efforts will be made to make major changes in the issues related to Primary Health in the country. Under this scheme, sub-centres and Primary Health centres will be developed into Health and Wellness centres in the country's major Panchayats i.e. in 1.5 Lakh villages. I tell the youngsters to suggest simple words for these Health and Wellness centres by logging into mygov.in. I will definitely study those suggestions. Today 'Health and Wellness Centre' is very popular but I want to use a simple word for it so that in the future even an illiterate person of the village should be able to identify with it. But I want to use your suggestions, the suggestions of the people of the villages.

The goal of the government is to complete this work by 2022. You can imagine the magnitude of the work. By the time the country will be celebrating 75 years of Independence, a network of Health and Wellness centres will already be in place across the country. Priority will be given to those 115 districts which are still behind in the race towards development.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

Why are these Wellness centres needed? I want to explain this thing to you in detail. When we talk about Health and Wellness centres our motive is not only to cure the disease but also to prevent the diseases. In our country we can find a large number of patients with blood pressure and diabetes. 60% of the health related deaths occur due to these 4 diseases viz. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory problems and cancer. But these diseases can be prevented if detected on time.

 

Through these Health and Wellness centres efforts are being made to provide free diagnosis of the diseases.

 

Friends,

 

I will also give you an example of how timely diagnosis is beneficial. Suppose a 35 year old person gets diagnosed with high blood pressure then he can avoid serious diseases in the future. If he gets diagnosed for any disease and with timely intervention takes medicines and does exercises, he can avoid greater expenditure and risks in the future. Today while I was inaugurating the Wellness Centre, I came across a sister of 30-35 years age. She was unaware about her diabetes. She told the doctors that she had the frequent urges of drinking water and felt dizzy and tired all the time. After the doctor examined her, it was diagnosed that she had high diabetes. A 30-32 year old sister did not know that she had diabetes. After coming to the wellness centre, she got to know about her disease. She will follow the diet and everything henceforth. She will be able to save herself from other diseases by controlling it. The Health and Wellness centres will spread the idea of this preventive treatment in every village.

 

These Health and Wellness centres will in a way work as family doctors for the poor. Earlier there used to be a family doctor in middle class and upper class families. These Wellness Centres will now become the extension of your families. These will be associated with your day to day lives.

 

Friends,

 

The idea of Ayushman Bharat is not limited to service but is also a call for public participation so that we can build a healthy, capable and satisfied new India. The next target is to provide a financial security of up to 5 lakh rupees to 50 crore poor people for serious illnesses per year. The work is going on at a very fast pace.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

Transformation can happen only when resources are used in a right way with inspiration. Today on this stage we have talked about an aspirational Bijapur along with an aspirational Chhattisgarh. Walking on the path shown by Atal ji for the past 14 years, the popular Chief Minister of the state, Mr Raman Singh, with the help of the people and a lot of hard work, is taking forward the developmental schemes for the welfare of the public. After the formation of the NDA government 4 years ago, the resolution of development got a further boost in Chhattisgarh. Here the governance has reached the people. The Chhattisgarh government has set new records by successfully developing tribal areas and implementing many popular schemes. A new revolution is visible in the form of University of Bastar and Surguja, medical colleges, engineering colleges and excellent Institutions of schools and skill development in the other districts.

 

I met one daughter named Lakshmi here. She has built a drone. Can anyone imagine that in a tribal region of Chhattisgarh-Rewa, a child of class 10th named Lakshmi has made a drone? She was telling me that she flies it at the height of 50 metre. I was delighted!

 

You must be aware that the work of Nagarnar Steel Plant is about to get over. Soon the Plant will be operational. I am confident that your state is moving ahead in the right direction as I see that the youngsters of Bastar are qualifying for medical colleges, engineering colleges, UPSC and PSC. There has been a revolutionary change in the health sector since the formation of BJP government in this state. There was a time when there used to be just 2 medical colleges in this state and I was told that today it has increased to 10. The seats of the medical colleges have also been increased manifold. I am glad to see that the health facilities are being upgraded continuously in Bijapur and its surrounding areas. Highly qualified specialists are now offering their services in District hospitals. I congratulate their devotion to service from the core of my heart. I just met some of the doctors from Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and other states who are devoting their entire time in these forests.

 

I am confident that in a country where we have such young dedicated doctors, the poor will not have to suffer from diseases. 

 

Sometime back I got the opportunity to inaugurate the dialysis unit of the district hospital. I want to inform you all that under Pradhan Mantri dialysis Yojana, more than 500 hospitals of the country will be offering free dialysis services. About 2.5 lakh patients have already used this facility, with almost 25 lakh sessions. A network of development has been laid down in the most backward districts of Chhattisgarh like Sukma, Dantewada and Bijapur.  I congratulate the government for this. The central government is working on a dual strategy to carry Chhattisgarh further on the path of development. First, the effort towards maximum development in this region and the second strategy is to bring back the deviated youngsters into the mainstream of development. In the last 4 years several important schemes have been started for the development of Chhattisgarh in general and Bastar in particular. A network of more than 400 km long roads has been laid in the Naxal affected areas of Bastar. The villages where Jeeps could not reach before are now connected with regular bus services.

 

Under the Saubhagya scheme, every household of Bastar is being provided with electricity connection. It will brighten the lives of the farmers, students, shopkeepers, small entrepreneurs and everyone. Thousands of solar pumps are being distributed in Bastar. These solar pumps are helping the farmers to a great extent. Several facilities like schools, hospitals, Health Care Centres, Public Distribution System, banks, ATMs and so on are being provided in these regions. New mobile towers are being erected. Bastar is now getting connected to Raipur through railways.

 

Today the work of one railway section has been started. It will reach up to Jagdalpur in 2 years. A new Steel Plant will also start operating in Jagdalpur this year. This will provide the youngsters of Bastar with new employment opportunities. A new airport will come up in Jagdalpur and the work will begin in a few months. Air connectivity will take this region's economy to new heights.

 

Friends,

 

Bastar is transforming. The decade-old identity associated with Bastar is also changing. Bastar will now be known as an economic hub in the future. It will be connected not only to Raipur but also to Hyderabad, Nagpur and Visakhapatnam.

 

Along with a New India, New Bastar will make life easier for lakhs of people here. They will come out of the darkness that was in their lives for the past several decades. The new Bastar will be a Bastar of new hope and new aspirations. It is said that sun rises in the east but that day is not far when Chhattisgarh's sun will rise from the South, from Bastar. If all these areas remain bright then the state will keep shining. If this region prospers, the entire state will prosper.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

It has always been a great challenge to extend the government schemes and services to the actual beneficiaries. This is one of the reasons for the regional imbalance and backwardness. I am glad that the government of Raman Singh ji is sensitive to this matter and is taking good initiatives.

A while ago, I got the opportunity to visit the Jangla Development Centre. A major objective of this centre is that all the government services will be found at one place and the people will not have to waste time by going to multiple places. Providing all the facilities like office of the Gram Panchayat, the government ration shop, the Patwari, hospitals and schools at one place will be a great service.

 

I have been told that 14 such centres will be set up in the state. The centres of development can also work as models for other states of the country.

 

Friends,

 

One way of ending regional imbalances in the country is to increase connectivity. Therefore emphasize is being placed on different levels of connectivity like Highways, Railways, Airways and I-ways or Information ways. At a time when internet and communication has become the greatest requirements of the people, it is indispensable to have a good communication system in place. This is the reason for the inauguration of Phase 1 of Bastar Net project to improve the connectivity of Bastar. Under this scheme, about 400 km of Optical Fibre network has been laid in 6 districts.

 

I have also been shown how the rural BPO of Jangla will help in increasing the income of its people and make their lives easier. The work of Bharat net project is underway in Chhattisgarh. I have been told that till date about 4000 Gram Panchayats out of 10000 Gram Panchayats have been connected to the Bharat net project and the work will get over by the next year.

 

Friends,

 

Railway is another medium of connectivity.

 

Today Dalli Rajhara Bhanupratap Express has been flagged off. You will be happy to know that the new train that has been flagged off today have all women employees - ranging from the driver to the guards. The people of the country will also be happy to know that our daughters are plying the trains in the forests of Chhattisgarh. The Dalli Rajhara- Raigarh line and Raigarh-Jagdalpur rail lines were proposed about 23 years ago but the work had not been started for a long time. Even after it was started the progress was at a snail's pace.

 

This new project was envisaged by our government which led to this new railway line in the Northern region of Bastar.

 

Today the foundation stone of roads worth nearly Rs. 1700 crore has been laid. It will create a network of modern roads in villages of Bijapur, Kanker, Kondagaon, Sukma, Dantewada, Bastar, Narayanpur and Rajnand gaon. Under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana, roads more than 2700 km long will be created. Airports are also being developed to connect large tribal areas of Bastar and Sarguja. These regions will also be linked to the Udaan scheme in the future. 

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

Foundation-stone has also been laid today to solve the problems of drinking water of Bijapur. Besides, efforts are being made to build bridges over Indravati River.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

This government is for the poor, the Dalits, the oppressed and the tribal people. It is evident from the decisions, laws and the schemes made for the welfare of the poor and the tribal people in the past 4 years. Today the Van Dhan Yojana has been launched in this context. Under this scheme, Van dhan development centres are being opened. The government has ensured that the forest produces should get the right prices as soon as they reach the market. The forest products will be promoted with value addition through these centres. A new market will be created.

 

Friends,

 

Today I have seen the importance of value addition here. The raw tamarind is sold at rupees 17-18 per kg. If the same tamarind is sold in a good packing after removing the seeds it will fetch 50-60 rupees per kilo. This means that the price increases 3 times.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

Today we have started the Van Dhan Yojana. You must have heard about the Gobardhan Yojana announced in this year's budget and along with this we have two more schemes - Jan Dhan yojana and Van Dhan Yojana. The trio will change the face of the villages. I assure you that.

 

The Forest Rights Act is being implemented strictly considering the interests of the tribals. 

 

Recently the government has taken another decision related to the old law of bamboo under which bamboo was placed in the category of trees. As a result, chopping of bamboo drew legal obstacles.

 

However, the central government has modified the Forest Act and has taken out bamboo from the list of trees. Now you can easily carry out your business in bamboo, grow bamboo and sell them in the market.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

The water, the land and the forests belong to you. You have the right over these things. Government has understood this and has made efforts to change the 60 year old system. We have also made changes in the previous laws related to mining. As per the rules, it will be mandatory to spend a part of the amount derived from the minerals for the local dwellers. Therefore the District Mineral Foundation has been established in every district of mining.

 

After this modification in the law, Chhattisgarh has benefited with an amount of more than rupees 3000 crores. The government has also decided that 60% of the amount under Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana will be spent on environmental protection, pollution control, Healthcare, education and women and child welfare.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

The government is also working towards developing the education sector of the tribals along with prioritising their means of income. We have announced several major schemes in this year's budget. As per the government's target, Ekalavya Model Residential schools will be developed in every block by the year 2022, where the population of the tribals is more than 50% or the number of tribal people is more than 20000.

 

Moreover, another major task of the government is associated with the tribal honour and pride. The tribals had played a crucial role in the country's freedom struggle. For the first time a government is honouring that contribution of the tribals. The government has decided that in order to honour the tribal freedom fighters in the different states, a world-class Museum will be established so that the future generation is informed about the sacrifices made by their tribal brothers and sisters. That fight was for their self-respect.

 

Friends,

 

One major way of economic empowerment and eliminating regional imbalances is Bank. Today banks have essentially become a part and parcel of our lives. Today I got an opportunity to inaugurate the new branch of State Bank of India here. I was told that people had to travel 20-25 km to get access to the bank. Moreover the problem aggravated due to lack of staff. With this new branch you will be highly benefited.

 

We have also entrusted the post offices with the work of banks. All the banking operations will also be available in post offices. We have appointed Bank Mitras for facilitating banking operations. We have framed new schemes after Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana for spreading banking systems in every village. Every citizen can make banking transactions with the help of Bhim app on their mobile phones.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

People with Jan Dhan accounts very well know the importance of opening bank accounts. Today more than 31 crore bank accounts have been opened up due to the efforts of this government. Even in Chhattisgarh more than 1lakh 30 thousand bank accounts have been opened. These accounts belong to those poor, dalit, tribals and backward people.

 

I got the opportunity of riding the E-rickshaw driven by Chhattisgarh’s daughter Savita sahuji. I was told that Savita ji had to face a lot of difficulties in her family. Yet she managed to earn her livelihood by driving e-rickshaw. She had chosen the path of member committee. With the help of the government she is now living a respectful life.

 

This government is empowering the daughters and the sisters through several schemes like Swachh Bharat, Swasth Bharat Mission, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Mission, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana and so on.

 

The women of Chhattisgarh have also benefited out of the Ujjwala scheme. Till date about 18 lakh women have been given free gas connection in this state. The government is trying to bring the deviated youngsters to the mainstream with the help of self-employment schemes. Therefore, bank loans without guarantee are being provided under Mudra Yojana. I would like to urge the youngsters of this region to take advantage of the government schemes as much as possible. I would also like to appeal to the administration, the officers and the staff associated with the state to take the resolution of carrying forward the work of development and accomplishing them in their districts at a faster pace.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

The government is not only framing new schemes but also making efforts to take the schemes to the people in need so that they can take advantage of those schemes. I request you all to take active initiative along with the government in empowering the marginal people of this country. Your participation is the strength of the Government and the strength will help in fulfilling the resolution of building a new India by 2022 at 75 years of India's Independence. It will fulfil the dreams of the great personalities like Babasaheb Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi. I once again offer my gratitude for your presence here. On the occasion of birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar I would like to tell the youngsters who are deviated to the path of violence that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us the Constitution. He has taken care of your rights in the Constitution. It is the responsibility of the government to think about your rights. You don't have to take up arms and resort to violence. I would also like to tell the mothers and the fathers that some of your sons and daughters have meandered to this path. However, just think about who their leader is? Not a single leader belongs to your area. The leader was not born among you. They are outsiders. The leaders do not die. They go and hide in the forests and are safe while your children are the ones who are dying in this violence. Do you want to spoil your children's life like this? These people are not even from your state but are complete outsiders. You will realise this if you read their surnames and names. You will understand from where they come. Why are you giving them the rights to kill your children?

 

Therefore I would urge you that the government is committed to protecting your interests. We have to traverse the path of development. We are making efforts so that your children can get better education, your produce gets the right price and you all get a respectable life. The security forces are working day and night to ensure that your needs are fulfilled in terms of medicines, education, income etc. They are sacrificing their lives to ensure that the teachers are able to teach, roads are properly built, and telephone towers are erected. They are trying to ensure development in this region by sacrificing their lives.

 

Come brothers and sisters, let's move on to the path of development and take the country to new heights. Let us take the pledge to bring transformation in these 115 aspirational districts and let us promise to fulfil the dream of Ayushman Bharat.

 

 

With this hope I once again congratulate you all for organising this great programme in the forests.

 

Jai Bhim, Jai Bhim, Jai Hind!!

                On the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a Health and Wellness Centre, to mark the launch of the Union Government’s ambitious Health Assurance Programme – Ayushman Bharat. The Centre was inaugurated at Jangla Development Hub, in the aspirational district of Bijapur in Chhattisgarh.

In the course of over one hour, the Prime Minister interacted with a number of people, and was briefed on several development initiatives at the development hub.

At the inauguration of the Health and Wellness Centre, he interacted with ASHA workers. He visited a model Anganwadi Centre, and interacted with Anganwadi workers and beneficiary children of Poshan Abhiyan. He visited a Haat Bazaar Health Kiosk and interacted with health workers. He inaugurated a bank branch at Jangla and distributed loan sanction letters under the Mudra Scheme to select beneficiaries. He also interacted with Rural BPO employees.

The Prime Minister then arrived at the venue of the public meeting. He launched the Van Dhan Yojana, which aims at empowering tribal communities. It envisages a mechanism for marketing of Minor Forest Produce through Minimum Support Price and development of value chain for MFP.

Via video conference, the Prime Minister dedicated to the nation, the Bhanupratappur-Gudum Railway Line. He flagged off a train between Dalli Rajhara and Bhanupratappur. He also inaugurated a dialysis centre at Bijapur Hospital.

The Prime Minister laid the foundation stone for construction of 1988 km of PMGSY roads in LWE areas; other road connectivity projects in LWE areas; water supply scheme of Bijapur; and two bridges. 

Addressing an enthusiastic gathering, the Prime Minister paid homage to the martyrs from the region who had fought against British Imperialism. He also paid homage to the security personnel who laid down their lives in Naxal-Maoist attacks, in the region. 

The Prime Minister noted that the Union Government had earlier launched two significant development initiatives, the Syama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban Mission, and the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awaas Yojana, from Chhattisgarh. Today he added, Ayushman Bharat and Gram Swaraj Abhiyan, are being launched from the State. He said that the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan would ensure that all development initiatives launched by the Union Government in the last four years, reach the poor and disadvantaged sections of society. He said that the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan would extend from today till the 5th of May.   

The Prime Minister said Babasaheb Ambedkar had a key role to play in the establishment of ""aspiration"" in the hearts and minds of crores of people.

Explaining the significance of holding this event in Bijapur today, the Prime Minister said that Bijapur is one of the over 100 aspirational districts in the country, which have got left behind in the development journey. He said he wants to convert these districts, hitherto labelled as ""backward"" into aspirational and ambitious districts. These districts will no longer remain dependent and backward, he asserted. He said that if the district administration, the public representatives and the people all join hands in a mass movement, then, unprecedented results can be achieved. He said the Government is working with a different approach on these 115 districts. He said each district faces its own challenges, and therefore, a different strategy is required in each case.   

The Prime Minister said that the Ayushman Bharat scheme will go a long way in ending social imbalance, and ensuring social justice in the country. He said that in the first phase of this scheme, an effort would be made to bring about a sea change in primary healthcare. He said sub centres and primary health centres at 1.5 lakh places in the country would now be developed as Health and Wellness Centres. He said the aim is to complete this task by 2022. He said these Health and Wellness Centres would function like a family doctor for the poor.  

He said the next target of Ayushman Bharat would be to provide financial assistance of upto Rs. 5 lakh to the poor, for medical treatment.  

The Prime Minister appreciated the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Dr. Raman Singh, for the development work done in the State over the last fourteen years. In particular, he appreciated the development initiatives carried out in the southern districts of Sukma, Dantewada and Bijapur. He said Bastar would soon be recognised as an economic hub. He emphasized the importance of connectivity for ending regional imbalances. In this context, he mentioned the connectivity projects launched today.  

The Prime Minister asserted that the initiatives and decisions taken by the Union Government indicate its commitment to the welfare of the poor and weaker sections of society. In this context, he mentioned the Van Dhan Yojana, and other decisions taken for the benefit of the tribal communities. He mentioned schemes such as Swachh Bharat Mission, Beti Bachao – Beti Padhao, and Ujjwala Yojana, which have benefited women.

The Prime Minister asserted that people's participation is the strength of the Government, which will help in the creation of New India by 2022.

                My colleague in the council of ministers Shriman Thavarchand Gehlot, Shriman Ram Vilas Paswan Ji, Member of Parliament from this constituency and my colleague in the council of ministers Dr. Harsh Vardhan Ji, Shri Ramdas Athawale Ji, Shriman Vijay Sampla Ji, and all the distinguished people, ladies and gentlemen present here,

First of all I sincerely congratulate 1.25 billion countrymen because today they have got an invaluable gift in form of Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial. I myself feel very fortunate while dedicating this national memorial constructed in the memory of Baba Saheb to the nation. 

The country is also celebrating the festival of Baisakhi. Baisakhi is the day to honor the labour of those who feed us – our farmers. I greet the country on the occasion of Baisakhi. Today is also the anniversary of Jalianwala Bag massacre. The way atrocities of the British Raj were committed on the freedom fighters 99 years ago, that is one of the most heart rending events of the human history. I bow down to every freedom fighter who was martyred the Jalianwala Bag massacre.

Friends, several governments were there after the independence, a lot of time has lapsed but the work that should have been done a long time ago, that work is taking place today after several decades. And that is why, it is an extremely emotional moment to come to this place and attend this function and to stand on the ground where Baba Saheb had spent his last days. So this national memorial build in the memory of Baba Saheb, in the name of Baba Saheb, this is an emotional tribute to Baba Saheb on behalf of the country. Tomorrow, it is Baba Saheb’s anniversary and a day before that organization of this kind of event at this place shows our unshakable devotion towards him, it shows the government’s commitment.

I thoroughly appreciate the ministry of social justice and empowerment and other concerned departments of Government of India for completing this holy work. 

I bow down to every single worker who has shed a lot of sweat in the construction of the memorial. Most of them will not be here today, they would be engaged in their work far away from this function, and however, I bow down to them too. 

Brothers and sisters,

This memorial constructed at 26, Alipur Road has etched permanently not only on the map of Delhi but on the map of the country as well. People will be able to better understand the things related to the life of Baba Saheb and his approach in a better manner after visiting this place. 

This memorial is a symbol of an extraordinary life of an extraordinary person. This memorial is the remembrance of the last days of a talented son of Mother India.

Brothers and sisters, 

This memorial has been built in the shape of a book. This book is the constitution of India the sculptor of this book was Doctor Baba Saheb Ambedkar. 

By enacting the constitution, Baba Saheb ensured that the world’s largest democracy will remain a democracy. 

When today’s new generation will visit this memorial then it will be able to properly understand the infinite expansion of the life of Baba Saheb by visiting the exhibition here, by experiencing the important milestone of his life in the museum with the help of modern technology. 

Friends, our government has been fortunate that it got the opportunity to develop the five important places related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar; the places that I always respectfully remember as five pilgrims. Shriman Gehlot has explained it in detail just a while ago.

The birth place of Baba Saheb located in Mhow in Madhya Pradesh; Doctor Ambedkar Memorial, his place of education located in London; the place of baptism in Nagpur; Chaitya Bhumi located in Mumbai; and his place of final salvation located here in Delhi in form of this national memorial. These places, these pilgrim centers, these are not just the buildings made of bricks and cement, but these are living institutions, these are the top institutions of ideas. 

Friends, this building is grand and this building is divine too. Friends, this grand and divine building is an example of the work culture of this government too. When the discussion on building a national memorial at this place was started, it was during the time of the government of Atal Bihari Bajpai, please just think that how many years have passed since then, the matter was taken forward. However, after the tenure of Atal Ji’s government; during the time of Congress Government all the files of this project were stopped; the work was stopped. 

In 2014, the countrymen once again gave us the opportunity to serve. We had to search the files of 26, Alipur Road after formation of our government in 2014. We found out all of them and once we had got the files we started the work at a fast pace. 

I had said this thing on 26 March 2016 while laying the foundation stone for this memorial that I would like to inaugurate it before the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb in 2018. And I would like to say with all the humility that we have tried to develop such a work culture that we shall dedicate the projects foundation stones for which have been laid by us. 

How the timeliness, the trust on resources and the will power of the government bring about changes, today, we can understand all these things very well by seeing the grand building before us. 

Friends, in democracy you are required to set your own accountability before the people seek accountability. You yourself should set your accountability. However, this kind of accountability was rarely seen about the earlier governments. This government has completely transformed this system. 

Perhaps, some of you would have visited Ambedkar International Centre built at 15 Janpath in Delhi. In 1992, just imagine, the idea of this centre was mooted in 1992. However, these files were buried somewhere for 22 years, they were lost somewhere. Within a year of taking charge in Delhi, I got the opportunity to lay the foundation stone for that centre in April, 2015 and a few months ago I dedicated it to public in December. Now, this symbol of the ideas of Dr. Ambedkar, this state of the art International Centre is one more gem in the grand view of Delhi. 

Brothers and sisters, the systems can be transformed in this manner only when the shortcomings are understood and removed by going to the bottom of the issues. I was there in Champaran just three days ago. I had also inaugurated the first phase of an electric locomotive factory located in Madhepura. This project had a similar story. It was approved in year 2007 but started in year 2015 after formation of our government. The previous government had wasted 7 years in movement of files. 

Because of the efforts made by our government in the last two and two and a half years, now the production of one of the most powerful engines in the world has already started in this factory. If I start listing out this kind of projects before you people then, perhaps, it might take several days. Baba Saheb had never thought about this thing that after the independence our country would get a work culture of creating hurdles, creating confusion and the work culture of keeping things pending. He had never thought that the projects will not be completed for up to 30-40 years during the tenure of governments in future. Keeping these projects incomplete like this is a big crime against the country. 

Friends, 

In the last four years, our government has been doing the job of completing the incomplete projects by actively looking for them. Today, the work to complete the projects worth Rs. 9 lakh crore which were stuck in the past has been going on at a fast speed through the PRAGATI meetings taking place under the direct supervision of Prime Minister’s Office. In the last four years, the development of the country has picked up the pace due to PRAGATI meetings. 

Friends, 

This mantra of not crying over the lack of resources and remaining unaffected because of the influences becomes the strength for anyone. And Baba Saheb has provided this strength to us through his life. That is why you will not find this government crying over lack of resources. We continue to make efforts by having confidence in our resources and in our capabilities. And this thinking and Baba Saheb have taught us to clearly set our target and then completely dedicate ourselves to achieve that target. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Exactly one month ago, a program was organized here in Delhi. And people from all over the world have gathered in that. In that program, other countries of the world put forward their views on how to end TB by 2030. In the same meeting, India announced that it will work to completely eradicate TB by 2025. It means that we have preponed the date to achieve our target by five years in comparison with other countries. 

Please see, the earlier governments used to apply their minds for extending the deadlines for completing the work. This government believes in further preponing the date for completing the work. And what are these works? See, this war against TB is not for rich people. This TB has entrenched itself in the house of poor people. And who are these poor people? These are Dalits, these are persecuted, exploited and excluded people. And this was the dream of Baba Saheb Ambedkar to set them free of these difficulties. And we have dedicated ourselves in realizing that dream. 

The government has preponed the last date by two-three years for completing the work - be it the immunization program for pregnant women and for kids in the remote areas of the country or be it the scheme to link rural roads. The scheme which was to be completed in 2022, we have asked about that scheme that why it can’t be completed in 2020? The work which was to be completed in 2024; we have asked why it can’t be done by 2022? 

Friends,

Equality is integral to Baba Saheb’s ideology in several ways. Equal respect, equality before law, equal rights, equality of human dignity and equality of opportunity, Baba Saheb continued to explain and raise numerous such issues throughout his life. He had expressed hope that Governments in India would be following the principles laid down in the constitution without any discrimination. He had always expressed hope that Governments in India would be following the principles laid down in the constitution without any discrimination.

Today, you would feel that the values of social justice and equal rights for all are the core values for every scheme of the Government. The Government schemes have been trying to put an end to the imbalance lasting over decades. For example: Jan Dhan Scheme. It was a massive social injustice that millions and millions of people did not have bank accounts so many years after the independence. Our government ended that thing. 

More than 31 crore bank accounts have been opened so far under the Jan Dhan Scheme. 

Similarly, it was also a form of social injustice that millions and millions of households did not have toilets. This government has constructed 7 crore toilets in the country under the Clean India Mission. Nearly 2.25 crore toilets of the total toilets have been constructed in the houses of my poor SC/STs, persecuted, exploited, deprived and tribals living in the rural areas. In the last four years the country has seen how respect and equality are also being brought through the toilets. 

Brothers and sisters, in this modern era not having electricity supply in somebody’s house is also a huge social injustice. In 2014, we had more than 18,000 villages where there was no electricity. These 18,000 villages were compelled live in 18th century even so many years after independence. Our government has resolved to provide electricity by making a public announcement from the Red Fort. By now most of the villages have got the electricity. I have recently received the information that perhaps 200-250 villages have not been covered. And by this time we have also started the tough task of connecting every single household with electricity connection. 

Under the Prime Minister Saubhagya scheme, free electricity connections have been given to more than four crore households. When there will be light in the house then it will also brighten the entire society. The Mudra Scheme aimed at promoting the self employment has also been ending the injustice being perpetrated over decades. This is not a fair situation that an youth who dreams of doing something on his own continues to face problem due to lack of bank guarantee and only the people with big schemes get loans from bank. That is why our government provided the option of borrowing bank loans without bank guarantee. 

More than 12 crore loans have been sanctioned under the Mudra scheme. And because of this, the opening of numerous doors for self-employment has become possible. Under the Mudra scheme, more than 2.16 crore, more than 2 crore 16 lakh Dalit beneficiaries have received money from banks without guarantee and today they have become self dependent. 

Friends, the government has announced one bigger scheme in this budget. The scheme has been discussed the world over. This scheme is a great effort made by us in the direction of abolishing social imbalance. This scheme has been called Ayushman Bharat. Under this scheme, the government is going to provide health insurance coverage to nearly 10-11 crore poor families, it means nearly 45-50 crore people of the country. If someone falls sick in a poor family then a treatment of up to Rs. 5 lakh will be assured for him. 

Friends, 

Today, if you visit any part of the country then if there is any scheme which has received the maximum discussion among the rural women then this is Ujjwala scheme. For decades, this was the situation of the country that very few households in a village had gas connections. Those families have a special recognition because they had gas connections. It was also an example of social justice that those households did not have a gas connection. 

The government has provided more than 3.5 crore gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme. Now this target has been increased to 8 crore gas connections. I believe that if we compare schemes of the last several decades then it has become the most popular scheme for ensuring social justice. 

Friends, 

This government has also made a continuous effort to restore the social balance through the laws. It is my Government which brought in stringent provisions to prevent atrocities on Dalits in 2015. We have increased the number of crimes against Dalits enlisted in the law from 22 to 47. It means now stringent legal action can be taken for 47 different crimes committed against Dalits. 

Friends,

When our Government brought in amendments in this act, the provision of not granting anticipatory bail to the accused persons was maintained as it is. The compensation amount for the victims was also enhanced.  Our Government spent more than double the amount compared to the previous Government for implementation of this law. 

When the Honorable Supreme Court announced its verdict related to this act then the government immediately field a review petition too. However, a lot of people do not know that there was public holiday of 6 days between the judgment and the filing of the petition. Even well educated people when they meet me they ask: Modi Ji why there was a delay? And when I told them that: brother, there were public holiday for six days then they say: sorry sir, but no one speaks about it. 

I want to reassure the nation today that we won’t let the provisions in the law to be stifled, which were made stringent by us. I would like to appeal to the people of the country that they should not be mislead by the Congress and those parties who have surrendered before the Congress culture. 

Friends, 

Our government is fully committed for the protection of the rights and respect of our Dalit brothers and sisters, and backwards and tribal. Special Courts are being set up to fast track the hearing of the cases related to prevention of atrocities on SCs and STs. The government wants that those who are extremely backward within the OBC they should be able to get more benefit of the reservation in government and educational institutions while keeping it within the stipulated ceiling. Government has also decided to set up a commission for sub-categories of backward castes.

Friends, 

Earlier, public servants with an annual income of Rs. 6 lakh were covered under the creamy layer. The government enhanced it to Rs. 8 lakh per annum. It means now many more people of OBCs are getting the benefit of OBC reservation. 

Earlier there was no parity in the creamy layer between the employees of government and public sector undertakings. The demand to end this anomaly had been raised for the last 24 years. Please keep in mind that the demand had been raised for the last 24 years. This government has ended this imbalance a few months ago. After assuming the charge at the centre, this government has shown urgency in those vacancies which are reserved for OBCs and SC/STs. 

Friends, 

For this government social rights are not just a matter of talks, but it’s our commitment. When I talk of a New India, then it is also the India of the dreams of Baba Saheb. The 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar was celebrated in India and abroad in a grand manner. It was celebrated in UNO. It was celebrated in more than 150 countries of the world. And this has happened for the first time. Special postage stamps were released on this occasion.

A tableau on Baba Saheb was put on display on the Republic Day. Many students were sent to the institutions in US and UK where Baba Saheb had pursued his studies.  In a historic decision, 26th November was declared as the Constitution day when the constitution was accepted. For the first time, constitution was on the agenda of parliament for two consecutive days. I had narrated one story about myself to Mr. Narendra Yadav when he had met one day. It was of the time when I was chief minister of Gujarat. Our constitution had completed 60 years during that period. It was sixtieth year in India and no one had any idea. In Gujarat, I had organised a big festival on the completion of 60 years of the constitution. And I organised a procession by placing it on the top of an elephant. And I myself was marching ahead of the procession on foot and the constitution and a portrait of Baba Saheb were placed on the top of the elephant. Because we had our commitments. Because we have our dedication. 

Brothers and sisters, today, I would like to clearly tell the people of the country that this was Baba Saheb’s commitment to truth, devotion towards duty and his contribution in the holy work of nation building because of which today he lives in the hearts of Indians. 

And this thing cannot be forgotten that the Congress has done everything under its power to erase his legacy from the history of the country. This is an extremely bitter truth of history that when Baba Saheb was alive even then Congress had not left any stone unturned in insulting him.  

Brothers and sisters, this is why it is very important for today’s generation to know that how Congress party had insulted Baba Saheb when he was alive and even after his death. It is also important for today’s generation to know that how Baba Saheb had exposed the true character of Congress before the country. It is also important for today’s generation to know that how the Congress carries out every kind of conspiracy, how it uses every trick on its sleeves to completely destroy its opponent when the party begins to be surrounded by allegations. 

There are a lot of things to talk about the last days of the period when Congress party and Baba Saheb were breaking apart, but if I start talking about those things then perhaps it will take days. But it’s important to remember about these things as they expose the true face of Congress. 

Friends, Baba Saheb had resigned from the council of ministers of Pandit Nehru because of lot of controversies. Baba Saheb had discussed about the pain caused to him one by one. He also explained those reasons in detail because of which he had resigned. 

I would like to tell you about a few lines of that statement. Talking about these things is also important so that the Dalit community, the tribal community, the backward community of the country, so that every Indian could know how the Congress party, which had imposed emergency on the country, had treated the creator of the constitution. 

Friends, Baba Saheb had written: ‘I had not been included in any committee of the cabinet’. He was a minister. ‘I have not been included in any committee of the cabinet, neither in the committee of foreign affairs nor in the committee of defense affairs. When the committee about the economic affairs was constituted then I was very hopeful that I will be certainly included in that committee as I had been a student of economics and financial issues. However, I was not included even in that committee.’ These are the words of Baba Saheb. 

What was the thinking of Congress party about Baba Saheb? Seventy years ago this was the reality. The person who had studied in the top universities of the world, the same person was insulted in Congress party every single moment. Baba Saheb himself had said this thing that he was given charge of just one ministry which did not have much work. He was thinking that he would join in the task of policy making, he would give the benefit of his experience to the country in those areas where he had mastery. However, he was kept away from all these things. He was not even given the additional responsibility of any ministry at the time of expansion of council of ministers. 

Friends, there was one more major reason because of which Baba Saheb had resigned. This reason also explains what has been the attitude of Congress party towards the SC/STs and backward communities of the country. 

In his statement, Baba Saheb had written: ‘Now I would like to share you the reason because of which I got disillusioned with the government. This is related to the treatment given to backwards and SC/STs. I regret that there is no proper provision in the constitution for the welfare of the backward castes. This work was to be done on the basis of recommendations made by a commission. The government has not even thought about appointing a commission even though more than one year has lapsed after the adoption of the constitution.’

Friends, since then the thinking of Congress party has not changed so far. The Congress party did not allow any progress on the issue of constituting a commission for backward castes seventy years ago. Even Dr. Ambedkar had to resign. Even today, seventy years after that, Congress party has been stalling the work in the Parliament to give constitutional status to the OBC commission. You would be aware that we, our government, brought the bill to give constitutional status to OBC commission; but (they) are not allowing its passage; they don’t allow the parliament to function. After getting the constitutional status, OBC commission will also have the powers like SC/ST commission. However, Congress has been creating hurdles in its way. 

Friends, I had explained the issue of Baba Sahib's resignation to you people in so much detail because Congress spreads the lies that it had made Baba Saheb law minister of the country. However, every Indian should know how Congress party behaved with Baba Saheb after making him law minister.  Because, after the independence the Congress created this kind of ecosystem in the country that the entire history of the country was confined to just one family. You see if someone wants to visit a memorial in Delhi to remember the great souls following the independence then there is no memorial except to those belonging to one family. 

A memorial was constructed in the honor of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel after formation of our government and today this memorial in the honor of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar has been built; otherwise there is no space for anyone except one family. Whether these people had not sacrificed their lives for the country? Have they not done anything for the country? Baba Saheb Ambedkar was not a member of Bhartiya Janta Party. Baba Saheb Ambedkar was the creator of a modern India and it is his debt on all of us. He was someone who did not bend down before the Congress ecosystem; and this is a fact that those who did not bend down before the ecosystem of Congress, those people have not been given any space even in books. 

Friends, after resigning from cabinet in 1951, Baba Saheb contested general election for the Lok Sabha. Congress not only fielded its candidate against him at that time but Nehru Ji himself went there to campaign against him. Baba Saheb had to suffer the humiliation of defeat as Congress deployed its entire might against him. After that, he again contested by-election for Lok Sabha from Bhandara seat in 1953. Congress again fielded its candidate against him and blocked him from getting into the Lok Sabha. If there was anyone who supported during this entire period of humiliation then he was Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. Baba Saheb became Rajya Sabha member because of his efforts. And the same Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee founded Jan Sangh which is today working as Bhartiya Janta Party. 

Friends, today I challenge Congress. Let them say one thing that they had done for Baba Saheb. And this is my challenge to Congress, please tell one thing that you have done in the honor of Baba Saheb. 

Brothers and sisters, you and I know that Congress doesn’t have any answers for this thing. They can only lie in the name of giving answers. The truth is that Congress also tried to erase the contribution of Baba Saheb in nation building after his death. From Nehru Ji to Rajiv Gandhi, several people in Congress were honored with Bharat Ratna. However, Baba Saheb was never considered worthy of Bharat Ratna. 

Baba Saheb was honored with Bharat Ratna when VP Singh was in power with the support of Bhartiya Janta Party and it was on the insistence of Atal Ji and Advani Ji that he was finally honored with Bharat Ratna so late. It was due to effort of BJP that Baba Saheb’s portrait was installed in the central hall of Parliament. Otherwise, you just imagine that these kind of logics were offered against installation of Baba Saheb’s portrait in the central hall of Indian Parliament that there was no space for his portrait. 

Just imagine the great soul who crafted the constitution by sitting in the central hall; where he had discussed its finer points for hours; and during the Congress regime there was no space in the central hall for installation of the same person’s portrait, one or two feet, or four feet tall. And then they talk like this. And when Bhartiya Janta Party came into power then the portrait of Baba Saheb was installed in the central hall. 

Brothers and sisters, I can say this thing with the full sense of authority that if a nationwide discussion on the rights of backwards and Dalits had not started in the country in the 90s then even today Congress would be openly reflecting its hatred towards Baba Saheb as it used to do earlier. But now there are compulsions as Congress sees vote bank, Congress sees power in the name of Baba Saheb so it has started the pretention of remembering Baba Saheb’s name. I believe that for Congress it is one of the biggest compulsions of the party in its history to remember Baba Saheb’s name. 

This is the result of great deeds done by Baba Saheb and the service to the country done by Baba Saheb that those who worship just one family, those who consider only one family as the savior of the country have now been compelled to remember the name of Baba Saheb with a heavy heart.  But I know that Congress will not do even this much. It could only spread confusion, it could lie to Dalits, backwards and tribals, it could spread rumor among them. And we have seen one glimpse of this effort on the second of this month. Sometimes rumors are spread that the reservation will be abolished and it’s their job to spread this rumors before every election. Atal Ji’s government was there; we have been in power for the last four years; I had been the chief minister of Gujarat for a long period; Bhartiya Janta Party has been running governments in several states and there never was any discussion about abolishing the reservation. Spreading rumors, spreading the lies, causing confusion, misguiding people and at times by spreading the rumours about abolition of laws related to prevention of atrocities on SCs/STs; the Congress is not leaving any stone unturned in turning the man against his brother. 

Friends, Congress never wanted this thing and nor it want it today that Dalits and backwards join the mainstream of the development whereas our government has been trying to ensure that the benefits of development reach to every section of the society by following the path shown by Baba Saheb, by following the formula of Sabka Sath – Sabka Vikas. Any person or political party who has an honest faith in Baba Saheb, who remembers his name, it will never go with Congress. 

Friends, I could have not so easily understood Baba Saheb had I not been born in a backward and poor family. I have seen poverty; I’ve heard the foul language linked to the caste; and sometimes I hear them even after becoming Prime Minister; and I have also suffered taunts. That is why it has been easier for a person like me to understand that what Baba Saheb had gone through in that period. Even today, my Dalit brothers have to endure what kind of things. 

Because of the inspiration from Baba Saheb, Village Self Rule Campaign is going to start in the country from tomorrow, which is his birth anniversary. I myself will be Bijapur in Chhattisgarh. Also a new chapter is going to start from tomorrow to end the imbalance in the regional development; it’s also a kind of injustice; a new chapter to end the imbalance in health is going to start. 

Friends, 

For this government, social justice is not something to just talk about, but it’s a commitment. For us it is like a devotion. However, the kind of incidents we have seen in the last 20-22 days, those incidents challenge the concept of social justice. The incidents which have been under discussion during the last two days, those incidents certainly do not behove any civilised society. These are utterly shameful. This is an affront to the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for the future of this country. As a society, as a country, all of us are feeling ashamed because of this. This kind of incidents occurring in any state of the country or in any part of the country they shake our human sensitivities. 

I would like to assure the nation that no criminal will be spared and justice will be done and the complete justice will be done. The horror that has been committed on those daughters; the justice will be done to those daughters. All of us will have to work together to end this internal vice of our society. And you people would remember this thing that it was my first speech from the ramparts of Red Fort in Delhi and I showed the courage of saying this thing from the Red Fort. And in my first speech I had said this thing; and I had said although we worship girls but if she comes back home late then we ask her that where she had gone? Where were you? Why did you come late? 

I had said that those parents who question their daughters that you should ask your sons where was he, why did he come back late in the night? These atrocities that have been committed on mothers and sisters, it is always done by the son of some mother and that is why a kind of social sensitivity is needed and it is the responsibility of all of us. All of us need to collectively fight with these vices of our society and it’s the responsibility of all of us that the harshest punishment is meted out to the perpetrators and I would like to assure this thing to the citizens of this country that Government of India will not allow any lapses to take place in the fulfillment of this responsibility. We will have to strengthen the institution of our families, our social values and our judicial system, all these things, only then we will be able to make the India as was envisioned by Baba Saheb, only then we will be able to make a New India. 

I conclude my speech with this one wish that may Baba Saheb continue to bless the country, may he continue to bless the 1.25 billion Indians and we should continue to take inspirations from his ideas. 

Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you, to all the countrymen for Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial. 

Thank you very much. Jai Bheem.

Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu

My Ministerial colleagues 

Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu

Other distinguished dignitaries on the dais

 

Ladies and Gentlemen 

 

On the upcoming occasion of the Vilambhi Tamil New Year on April 14th, I extend my warm greetings to all Tamil people across the world. I am happy to be at Cancer Institute,Adyar.This is one of the oldest and most significant comprehensive cancer care centers in India.  

 

Changing lifestyles are adding to the burden of non-communicable diseases.According to some estimates, non-communicable diseases now account for about sixty percent of total deaths in our country.

 

The Union Government has planned the setting up of 20 State Cancer Institutes and 50 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres in different parts of the country.Proposals can be approved, for eligible institutions, upto Rs. 45 crore for setting up of Tertiary Care Cancer Centre and upto Rs. 120 crore for setting up of State Cancer Institute. I am happy to note that proposals for setting up of 15 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved so far.14 new All India Institutes of Medical Sciences are being set up, with focus on oncology in its various aspects. 

 

Under Pradhan MantriSwasthya Suraksha Yojana,8existing institutions are being upgraded with provision of oncology services.The National Health Policy of 2017 under-lines the importance of preventive healthcare.

 

Under the Comprehensive Primary Health Care aspect of Ayushman Bharat, we will provide preventive and curative services at primary care level to people near their homes.

 

We have initiated Population-based Prevention, Control, Screening and Management of common non-communicable diseases such as Diabetes, Hyper-tension and Common Cancers.

 

Ayushman Bharat also includes the Pradhan Mantri National Health Protection Mission. 

 

This will cover over ten crore families.Approximately 50 crore people will be benefited through this mission. Insurance coverage upto 5 lakh rupees per family, per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization will be provided under this mission. 

 

This will be the world’s largest government funded health care programme. The benefits of the scheme will be portable across the country.People will be able to get benefits in both public and empanelled private facilities.The scheme intends to reduce out of pocket expenditure on health.

 

To prevent, control and manage diseases like cancer we need action from all sections of society including NGOs and private sector. 

 

The Cancer Institute W.I.A. Chennai is a voluntary charitable institution, founded by a group voluntary women social workers under the inspiring leadership of the late Dr.Muthulaxmi Reddy. 

 

This institute started as a small cottage hospital. It was the first cancer specialty hospital in South India and the second in the country.Today, the Institute has a Cancer Hospital with 500 beds. I am informed that 30 percent of these beds are free beds, which means patients are not charged.

 

The molecular oncology department of the institute was designated a “Centre of Excellence” in 2007 by the Union Government. It was the first super specialty college in India established in 1984.These are pioneering, and praise-worthy  achievements.

 

Dr. Shantha, in her opening speech spoke about some of the difficulties being faced by the Institute.  I would like to assure her that we would look into them and I would also request the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to see what can be done. Lastly, let me turn for a while, to an issue that has been raised by certain vested interests over the last few days. 

 

A baseless allegation is being made, about the Terms of Reference of the 15th Finance Commission, being biased against certain states, or a particular region. Let me tell you something, that our critics seem to have missed.The Union Government has suggested to the Finance Commission to consider incentivizing States who have worked on population control.By this yard-stick, a state like Tamil Nadu, which has devoted a lot of effort, energy and resources towards population control would certainly benefit.This was not the case earlier.

 

Friends,

 

The Union Government is committed to cooperative federalism. Our mantra is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas. Let us all work together to build a New India, which would make  our great freedom fighters proud.

 

Thank You.  

 

Thank you very much.

                Governor of Tamil Nadu,

Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha,

Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,

Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,

My Ministerial colleagues,

Distinguished visitors,

Friends.

A very good morning to you all!

This is the 10th edition of Def-Expo.

Some of you may have attended this event several times.A few may even have been attending it since inception.

But for me, this is the first time at Def-Expo.I am both delighted and over-whelmed to see such akeengathering here in this historic region of Kanchi-puram in the great State of Tamil Nadu.

I am very happy to be here in the land of the great Cholas who established India's historic civilization links through trade and education. This is the land of our glorious maritime legacy. 

This is the land from where India Looked East and Acted East thousands of years ago.

Friends.

It is wonderful to see over five hundred Indian companies, along with over one hundred and fifty foreign companies present here. 

More than forty countries have sent their official delegations as well.It is an opportunity like none other, not only to discuss India’s defence requirements, but also to show-case, for the first time ever, in such a manner, India’s own defence manufacturing capabilities to the world.

Armed Forces, the world over know the importance of supply chains. But it is not just on the battle-fields, but also on the factory floors of defence manufacturing enterprises, that strategic decisions are made.

Today, we live in an inter-connected world.The efficiency of supply chains is a key factor in any manufacturing enterprise.Therefore,the strategic imperative to Make in India, to Make for India, and to Supply to the World from India is stronger than ever before.

Friends.

Thousands of years of history of India shows that we have never desired any one's territory. 

Rather than winning countries through wars, India has believed in winning hearts.This is the land from where the message of peace and universal brotherhood has gone out sinceVedic times.

This is the land from where the light of Buddhism spread to the world.In fact, from the time of Ashoka and even earlier, India has believed in using strength to protect the highest ideals of humanity.

In modern times more than one hundred and thirty thousand Indian soldiers sacrificed their lives in World Wars in the last century. India had no claim on territory.But Indian soldiers fought for restoring peace and up-holding human values.

Independent India has also sent one of the largest numbers of UN Peace-Keepers to places all over the world.

At the same time, an important responsibility of the State is to protect its own citizens.The Great Indian thinker and strategist Kautilya wrote theArth-shastra more than two thousand years ago. He said that the King, or the ruler, must protect his people. And, he also said that peace is preferable to war. India's defence preparedness is guided by these thoughts.Our commitment to peace is just as strong as our commitment to protect our people and our territory.And for this, we are ready to take all steps required to equip our Armed Forces, including through the establishment of a strategically independent defence industrial complex.

Friends.

We are conscious that creating a defence industrial complex is far from simple. We know that a lot needs to be done, and many piecesof this puzzle need to fit together.We are also aware/ that the defence manufacturing sector is unique in terms of government involvement.You need the government to grant a license to manufacture. Since the government is almost the only buyer in India, you also need the government to grant an order. 

And, you need the government even to grant permission to export.

Therefore, over the last few years, we have made a humble beginning.

On defence manufacturing licenses, on defence offsets, on defence exports clearances, on Foreign Direct Investment in defence manufacturing, and on reforming our defence procurement, we have taken many steps.

In all these areas, our regulations, processes and procedures have been made more industry-friendly, more transparent, more predictable and more outcome oriented.The Defence Products List for the purpose of issuing licenseshas been revised, and most of the components, parts, sub-systems, testing equipment and production equipment have been removed from the list to reduce entry barriers for the industry, especially for the small and medium enterprises.

Initial validity of Industrial License has been increased from 3 years to 15 years, with provision to further extend it by 3 years.

Offset guidelineshave been made flexible by allowing changes of Indian Offset Partners and offset components, even in contracts already signed. 

Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers are now not required to indicate the details of Indian Offset Partners and products at the time of signingof contracts. We have also re-instated Services as an avenue of discharging offsets.

The Standard Operating Procedure for issue of export authorizationshas been simplified and put in public domain. 

The requirement of Government-signed End User Certificate for export of parts and components and other non-sensitive military stores, sub-assemblies, and sub-systems has been done away with.

The defence industry sector was closed to the private sector till May 2001, when it was first opened up to private sector participation by the Government of Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee ji. 

We have taken a step forward and revised the Foreign Direct Investment cap of 26 percent to 49 percent through the automatic route, and even up to 100 percent on a case-to-case basis.

The Defence Procurement Procedure has also been revised, with many specific provisionsfor stimulating the growth of domestic defence industry.

We have also de-notified some items earlier made exclusively by Ordnance Factories, so that the private sector, especially the micro, small and medium enterprises can enter this space.

For encouraging the development of Micro and Small enterprises in the defence sector, the Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises– which was notified in 2012 – has been made mandatory from April 2015.

And we have seen some encouraging initial results.In May 2014, the total number of defence licenses issued stood at 215. In less than four years, we have issued 144 more licenses through a much more transparent and predictable process. 

In May 2014, the total number of defence export permissions granted stood at 118, for a total value of 577 million dollars. In less than four years, we have issued 794 more export permissions, for a total value of over 1.3 billion dollars.From 2007 to 2013, the targeted offsets obligations were 1.24 billion dollars, of which only 0.79 billion dollarsworth of offsets were actually discharged. That is, an achievement rate of only about 63 percent. 

From 2014 to 2017, the targeted offsets obligationswere 1.79 billion dollars, of which 1.42 billion dollars worth of offsets were realized. This is an achievement rate of close to 80 percent. Procurement from Micro and Small Enterprises by the Defence Public Sector Undertakings and Ordnance Factories has gone up from about Rs. 3300 crores in 2014-15 to over Rs. 4250 crores in 2016-17. This is an increase of close to 30 percent.

It is heartening to note that the contribution of small and medium scale sector to defence production has grown by 200 percent in the last 4 years.

And, they are increasingly also becoming part/ of the global supply chains.

I am also pleased that the share of Indian vendors in the procurement orders placed through defence capital expenditure has gone up from about 50 percent during 2011-14 to over 60 percent during the last three years.

I am sure that this will improve further in the years ahead.

Friends,

Having said that, I am aware that we need to do a lot more.And, we are committed to do so.

We are committed to building a defence industrial complex that has room for everyone – public sector, private sector, as well as foreign firms.

We are committed to establishing two Defence Industrial Corridors – one right here in Tamil Nadu, and one in Uttar Pradesh.These defence industrial corridors will utilize the existing defence manufacturing ecosystems in these regions,and further build upon it.

These corridors will become the engines of economic development and growth of defence industrial base in the country.We have also established a Defence Investors Cell to assist and handhold the investors involved in Defence Production.

Friends’.

Government's support for technology, innovation, research and development is essentialfor defence sector.

A Technology Perspective and Capability Road-map has been released to help the industry in planning and initiating technology development, partnerships and production arrangements.

In recent years, we have also taken various initiatives like Make In India, Startup India, and Atal Innovation Mission, to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in the Indian commercial eco-system.

Today, we have launched the ‘Innovation for Defence Excellence’ scheme. It will set up Defence Innovation Hubs throughout the country to provide necessary incubation and infrastructure support to the start-ups in defence area. 

Private venture capital into the defence sector, especially for start-ups will also be encouraged.

New and emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Robotics are perhaps the most important determinants/ of defensive and offensive capabilities for any defence force in the future. India, with its leadership in Information Technology domain, would strive to use this technology tilt to its advantage.

 

Friends.

The former President and a great son of Tamil Nadu and India,Bharat RatnaDr. A. P. J Abdul Kalam had called upon all of us to “Dream! Dream! Dream! Dreams transform into thoughts, and thoughts result in action”.

Our dream is to Develop the Ecosystem to Foster an Environment of New and Creative Entrepreneurship in the defence manufacturing sector.

And for this, in the weeks ahead, we will undertake extensive consultations with all stakeholders, including both Indian and Foreign companies, about our Defence Production and Defence Procurement policy space.I call upon all of you to actively participate in this exercise.Our aim is not just to discuss, but to draw the right lessons.Our intention is not to lecture, but to listen.Our goal is not merely to tinker, but to transform.

Friends.

We want to move fast. But, we do not want to take short cuts.

There was a time when, like many other aspects of governance, the critical issue of defence preparedness was also hampered by policy paralysis.

We have seen the damage such laziness, incompetenceor perhaps some hidden motives, can cause to the nation.

Not now. Not anymore. Never again.Issues that should have been long addressed by previous governments, are being resolved now.

You would have seen how the issue of providing bullet proof jackets to Indian Army soldiers was kept hanging for years. 

And, you would have also seen that we have brought the process to a successful conclusion with a contract that will provide a boost to defence manufacturing in India.You would also recall the long-drawn process of procurement of fighter aircraft that never reached any conclusion.

We have not only taken bold action to meet our immediate critical requirements, but have also initiated a new process to procure 110 fighter aircraft.We do not want to spend ten years in discussions without any tangibleoutcomes. We will work with you with a sense of mission to keep our defence forces equipped with state-of-the-art systems, and to create the necessary domestic manufacturing ecosystem to achieve this.And, in all our efforts to pursue efficiency and effectiveness in partnership with you, we will be guided by the highest ideals of integrity and probity.

Friends.

This sacredland brings to mind the legend Thiruvalluvar, a celebrated Tamil poet and philosopher.

He had said:

“In sandy soil, when deep you delve, you reach the springs below; The more you learn, the freer streams of wisdom flow.” 

I am confident that Def-Expo will provide the opportunity to professionals and industry to find new meeting ground for developing military industrial enterprises.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

K. Choubey, MoS (Health & Family Welfare) and Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW) called on the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today, to invite him about the upcoming Partners Forum 2018 which will be hosted during 12-13 December, 2018 at New Delhi. Heads of State and Health Ministers from various countries and 1200 delegates would be participating in this forum. PMNCH is a global partnership of 92 countries and over 1000 organisations. The Prime Minister graciously agreed to be Patron of the PMNCH Forum and accepted the Logo of the forum.

Dr. Michelle Bachelet, as the incoming Chair, explained the mandate of the Partnership and sought ideas from the Prime Minister on how to take forward the challenge of women empowerment, children and young people. Prime Minister shared his personal experiences on the initiatives taken in Gujarat for increasing institutional deliveries through partnership with the private sector and organising community feeding for the poor and pregnant women in villages so that their nutrition needs could be met. He stressed on effective communication strategy. He also emphasised that ‘participation is partnership’. The Prime Minister also suggested that we should involve people across the globe, specially young people in important issues like nutrition, age of marriage, pre-natal and post-natal care and seek ideas for effective implementation and communication for programmes for women, children and adolescents. He suggested that we could have an online quiz competition on these themes and provide awards to prize winners in the upcoming Partners’ Forum Meeting in December 2018.

                Over 100 beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, from across the country, today interacted with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at his residence.

During the informal interaction with Shri Narendra Modi, many of the beneficiaries explained how their lives had improved through the use of the Mudra loans sanctioned to them.

Ms. Kiran Kumari, a beneficiary from Bokaro, Jharkhand, who received a loan of Rs. 2 lakh, explained how she started her own toy and gift shop. Earlier, she and her husband earned their livelihood selling toys as hawkers. After receiving the loan, she has been able to establish herself as a successful entrepreneur.

Ms. Munirabanu Shabbir Hussain Malek from Surat, received a Mudra Loan of Rs. 1.77 lakh. She explained how she took LMV driving training and is now earning Rs. 25,000 per month, by driving an auto rickshaw.

Mr. Sijesh P. from Kannur, Kerala, worked abroad for 8 years. On return to India, he worked as a sales manager in a medical unit. He enthusiastically explained to the Prime Minister how he was able to set up a unit to produce herbal tooth powder, thanks to a Mudra Loan of Rs. 8.55 lakh. He even presented some samples to the Prime Minister.

Mr. Salehundum Giridhar Rao from Telangana, shared his entrepreneurship story with the Prime Minister. He received a loan of Rs. 9.10 lakh, which he used to further his dye casting and moulds enterprise.

Ms. Veena Devi, from Kathua District of Jammu and Kashmir works as a weaver. She received a Mudra loan of Rs. 1 lakh. She is now one of the leading manufacturers of Pashmina shawls in her area. Today, she presented one Pashmina shawl to the Prime Minister, during the interaction.

Mr. Rajendra Singh from Dehradun is an ex-Armyman. He told the Prime Minister about his business of manufacturing and supplying brooms to retailers, which he was able to establish through the Mudra Loan of Rs. 5 lakh. He has not only been able to successfully set up his business, but has also generated employment for a few other persons.

Mr. T.R. Sajeevan from Chennai received a Mudra loan of Rs. 10 lakh. He explained how he now does job work for foundries.

Mr. Satish Kumar from Jammu, received a loan of Rs. 5 lakh. He was earlier unemployed. Now, he has a business of manufacturing and trading of steel products. He shared his experiences with the Prime Minister today.

Mr. Viplav Singh, from Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarkhand, worked with a pharma firm, but wished to set up his own business. With the help of a Mudra Loan worth Rs. 5 lakh, he was able to start his own business of trading pesticides and fertilizers, and has now been able to generate employment for several other persons. He shared his experiences with the Prime Minister today.

Several other beneficiaries also shared their experiences.

The Prime Minister appreciated the efforts of the entrepreneurs who have made good use of the Mudra Loans. He said that 11 crore people have so far benefited from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. He said that one of the aims of this scheme is also to increase self-confidence among the people. He said that so far, the conventional thinking has been that employment is generated either in the public sector or in the private sector. This scheme, he said, has helped in the development of the “personal sector,” as a means of livelihood and self-employment. 

The informal interaction between the Prime Minister and the beneficiaries, lasted for over an hour. Ministers of State for Finance, Shri Pon. Radhakrishnan and Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla were present on the occasion.

                Minister for Energy, Saudi Arabia

Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, India

Secretary General, International Energy Forum

Distinguished Delegates

Ladies and Gentlemen.

 

Welcome to India.

Welcome to the 16th International Energy Forum Ministerial Meeting.

I am happy to see such a large participation of Energy Ministers from producing and consuming nations, Heads of International Organisations and CEOs in this forum. 

As you come together today  to discuss the future of global energy, the world is seeing a great transition  in energy supply and consumption. 


	Consumption growth has shifted to non OECD  countries: Middle East, Africa  and developing Asia;
	Solar Photo-Voltaic energy has become economical compared to all other energy sources. This is changing the supply paradigm;
	Abundant availability of natural gas globally with increased percentage of LNG and natural gas  is contributing to the primary energy basket;  
	The US may soon become the largest producer of oil.  It is predicted to meet a major portion  of the additional oil demand  in the next few decades;  
	Coal may gradually go out of favour  as a major contributor to primary energy  in the OECD World  and later in developing countries;  
	The Transport sector will see massive changes  in the next few decades  with adoption of electric vehicles;   
	The World is committed to the climate change agenda based on the COP-21 agreement.  The energy intensity of economies will change  with focus on green energy and energy efficiency;  


Last month I came across an energy forecast prepared by an agency, according to which  India will be the key driver of global energy demand  in the next twenty-five years.  India’s energy consumption will grow by four point two percent a year for the next twenty-five years. This is fastest among major world economies. The report also mentions that Gas demand will triple by 2040. The number of electric vehicles will rise to three hundred and twenty million by 2030,  up from three million today.    

We are entering an era of energy abundance. However,  one point two billion people  still do not have access to electricity.   Many more do not have access to clean cooking fuel. We must ensure that this situation is not exploited to the detriment of the under-privileged. People must have universal access to clean, affordable, sustainable and equitable supply of energy.  

Let me share with you some of my thoughts on the hydrocarbon sector and our endeavour to achieve energy security.  

 Oil and Gas are a commodity of trade but also of necessity. Whether it is for the kitchen of a common man or for an aircraft, energy is essential.   

The world has for too long seen prices on a roller-coaster.   

We need to move to responsible pricing, which balances the interests of both the producer and consumer. We also need to move to transparent and flexible markets for both oil and gas. Only then can we serve the energy needs of humanity in an optimal manner.   

If the world has to grow as a whole, there has to be a mutually supportive relationship between producers and consumers.   It is in the interests of producers that other economies keep growing steadily and rapidly. This will ensure growing energy markets for them.   

Efforts at artificially distorting prices are self-defeating, as history has shown us.They also cause undue hardships, particularly to those at the bottom of the pyramid in developing and least developed countries.   

Let us use this platform to build a global consensus on ‘responsible pricing.’ This will serve the mutual interests of both producers and consumers.  

Given global un-certainties, India also needs energy security. My vision for India’s energy future has 4 pillars – energy access, energy efficiency, energy sustainability and energy security.  

Energy in general and hydrocarbons in particular are an important part of my vision for India’s future.   India needs energy which is accessible and affordable to the poor.   It needs efficiency in energy use.   

As a responsible global member of the comity of nations, India is committed to combating climate change, curbing emissions  and ensuring a sustainable future.  The launch of the International Solar Alliance is a step towards fulfilling this commitment.   

Friends.  

Currently, India is the fastest growing large economy in the world. All leading agencies such as IMF, World Bank, and ADB are estimating India to grow at 7 to 8 percent in the near future.   Our Government has been able to achieve high GDP growth with low inflation, well controlled fiscal deficit and stable exchange rate. This macro-economic stability is boosting both consumption and investment in the economy.  

India is also blessed with demographic dividend. The working age population as a share in total population, is one of the highest in the World.   Our Government is boosting local manufacturing through Make in India and skilling of youth in industries such as textile, petro-chemical, defence, engineering etc. This, in turn, is also increasing our energy consumption further.  

We have also revamped our up-stream policies and regulations and brought transparency and competitiveness in the sector through the launch of Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy.   The bidding criteria has been changed to revenue sharing which will help reduce government intervention.  Currently, a bidding round is open till the 2nd of May.   I request you to participate in our endeavor towards increasing production. The Open Acreage and National Data Repository will help companies participate in fields they are interested in and help increase the exploration interest in Indian fields.   

The Enhanced Oil Recovery Policy aims to promote the use of latest technology in improving productivity of up-stream fields.  

Our Down-stream sector has been completely liberalized with market driven petrol and diesel prices reflecting the changes in price of crude oil.  We have moved towards digital platforms in fuel retail and payments.  

Our government has encouraged private participation across the entire oil and gas value chain from up-stream production to down-stream retail.   

Our Government believes in an integrated approach to energy planning. And, our energy agenda in India is inclusive, market based, and climate-sensitive.   This, we believe, would go a long way towards achieving three energy related components of the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda.   Namely:

Universal access to modern energy by 2030;  

Urgent action to tackle climate change  - in line with the Paris agreement;  

Measures to improve air quality;  

Friends,  

We believe access to clean cooking fuel is very important to improve standards of living.  Women benefit the most from it.   It reduces indoor pollution, and hardships faced in collecting bio-mass and fire-wood.  It gives them increased time for further self-development, and taking up additional economic activities.   

In India, through the Ujjwala Yojana we provide free LPG connections to women from poor households. The aim is to provide clean LPG cooking connections to 80 million poor households.   35 million connections have already been provided in less than two years.   

We propose to shift to BS Six fuels by April 2020, which is equivalent to the EURO Six standards. Our refineries are under-going massive up gradation.  They are on target to meet the ambitious deadlines to provide clean fuel.  In fact, here in New Delhi, we have already started offering BS Six standard fuel this month.   

We have also launched a vehicle scrapping policy which will help replace old vehicles with cleaner and energy efficient vehicles.  

Our oil companies are assessing all their investments keeping in view the energy diversification strategies.  

Today, oil companies are also investing in wind and solar capacities, gas infrastructure,  and also thinking in the direction  of investing in Electric Vehicle and Storage areas.  

Friends.  

As we are all aware,  we are now looking towards Industry 4.0,  proposing to change the way industry operates in the future  with new technologies and processes like Internet of Things,  Artificial intelligence,  robotics process automation,  machine learning,  predictive analytics,  3-D printing, etc.  

Our companies are also adopting latest technologies. This will improve efficiency, and increase safety and reduce costs not only in down-stream retail but also in up-stream oil production, asset maintenance and remote monitoring.  

In this backdrop, India provides the perfect setting  for hosting this event,  to ponder over the future of the energy sector.   To reflect on how global shifts, transition policies and new technologies will influence market stability  and future investment in the sector.   

 

 

Friends,  

The theme of IEF-16  is “The Future of Global Energy Security.”   I am told that the Agenda aims to address issues like global shifts in producer–consumer relations,  universal energy access and affordability,  and promoting investments in oil and gas to meet future demand.   Maintaining energy security and co-existence of new and existing technologies are also to come up for discussion.  These are all pertinent subjects for the future of our collective energy security.  

I believe that the discussions at this forum will go a long way  in benefitting the world citizens  in accessing clean, affordable and sustainable energy.   

I wish you all a successful and fruitful Ministerial Conference.   

Thank you

                I would say: Mahatma Gandhi,

And you people will say: Long Live, Long Live. 

Mahatma Gandhi…Long live, Long live.

Mahatma Gandhi…Long live, Long live.

Mahatma Gandhi…Long live, Long live.

Swachchagrahi brothers and sisters from all corners of the country who are present here on this sacred land of Champaran; I bow down to all the respected people, to all the loved ones. Everyone knows that Bapu started his movement of passive resistance from this sacred land of Champaran. And we got this powerful weapon in the form of passive resistance to get freedom from the British. A century after the Satyagrah movement has passed, but it is still effective even after that. And for how many more years it will remain effective? Modern time demands that we move from Satyagrah to Swachchagrah. 

Mahatma Gandhi had started his campaign for cleanliness from BadahwaLakhansen of Champaran at the time Champaran movement. Today, we are taking forward the cleanliness campaign of Bapu by moving from Satyagrah to Swachchagrah. RauaSamankeSojhaBani. 

ShrimanSatpal Malik Ji, the governor of Bihar present on the dais; popular chief minister of the state ShrimanNitish Kumar Ji, my colleague in the council of minister Ravi Shankar Prasad Ji, Ram Vilas Paswan Ji, Sushri Uma Bharti Ji, Radha Mohan Singh Ji, Giriraj Singh Ji, Shri Ram Kripal Yadav Ji, Shri S. S. Ahaluwalia Ji, Shri Ashwini Kumar Chaube Ji, the deputy chief minister of Bihar Shriman Sushil Kumar Modi Ji, member of the council of minister of the state Shri Shravan Kumar Ji, Shri Vinod Narayan Jha Ji, Shri Pramod Kumar Ji and thousands of Satyagrahis present here and all the people connected with this programme through video conference, ladies and gentlemen,

Those who say that history does not repeat itself they can come here and see for themselves that how the 100 years old history is still present here before us. In a way the Swachchagrahiswho are sitting here before me they are the ones who have a part of the ideals of Gandhi, ideas and deeds of Gandhi alive inside them. 

I bow down to that part of Mahatma Gandhi present in all those Swachchagrahis. The world had witnessed the similar image of the people’s movement hundred years ago on this sacred land of Champaran and today once again the world has been remembering the holyBapuafter having seen this visual. 

Hundred years ago, people from all over the country had come to Champaran. They had worked under the leadership of Gandhi Ji by visiting lane by lane. Today, 100 years after that, the people from different corners of the country have worked hard, worked day and night by working shoulder to shoulder with the enthusiastic and young Swachchagrahis. Today, in this massive crowd, someone is Kasturba, someone is Raj Kumar Shukla, someone is Gorakh Prasad, someone is Sheikh Gulab, someone is Lomraj Singh, someone is Harivansh Rai, someone is Sheetal Rai, someone is Bin Muhammad Munees, someone is Doctor RajendraBabu, someone is DhartidharBabu and someone is Ram Navami Babu and someone is JP Kriplani Ji. 

Today’s Swachchagrah is providing a new direction to the millions and millions of people of the country as hundred years ago the Satyagrah had provided a new direction to such great people. On to Champaran;today, thousands of Swachchagrahis have gathered here from different corners of the country by following this slogan. I bow down to your enthusiasm, your vigor, your energy and your eagerness to work for the country and the desires of the people of Bihar. 

Before coming on dais, I have also visited an exhibition on cleanliness. New technologies, new industries have been explained in detail in this exhibition. This is also the time for completion of those programmes which have been organised on the occasion of completion of 100 years of Champaran Satyagrah. However, for us it is more of an occasion to begin urging people even more for cleanliness rather than the culmination of the programmes. 

Brothers and sisters, this is the same Bihar which has shown the path to the country on three very difficult occasions during the last 100 years. When the country was under the shackles of slavery then Bihar had developed Mohan Das Karam Chand Gandhi a great soul; it had made him the father. 

After the independence, when millions and millions of farmers faced the threat of being deprived of the land then Vinoba Ji started the movement to donate land. And third time when the democracy in the country was threatened then the hero from this land Babu Jay Prakash answered the call and saved the democracy.

I’m extremely proud that the people of Bihar have once again demonstrated and established their leadership capabilities. I’m aware that some people might question that Modi Ji is talking like this despite the situation of cleanliness in Bihar. There is a reason behind that. The work done by Bihar in the last sometimeunder the leadership of Nitish Ji and Sushil Modi Ji has boosted everybody’s morale. 

Friends, Bihar was the only state in the country where coverage of cleanliness was less than 50 per cent. But today our secretary Mr. Parmeshwar Ji has told me that Bihar was able to breach this barrier after a week longSwachchagrahAbhiyan (cleanliness mission). In the last one week alone, Bihar has completed the work of construction of 8 lakh 50 thousand toilets. And this speed and progress is not ordinary. These data proves that very soon Bihar will be able to expand the coverage of cleanliness and become at par with the national average. 

I sincerely congratulate the people of Bihar, to every Cleanliness Warrior and to the government of Bihar for this extremely challenging effort, for this initiative and for its leadership. 

Just a while ago, I also got the opportunity to honor a few Swachchagrahi colleagues (cleanliness warriors). I appreciate the efforts made by them, I convey my best wishes. And I have noticed that the number of women is higher among those who have wholeheartedly participated in this thing. Our mothers and sisters very well know the importance of cleanliness. And today I’ve not got the opportunity as an individual but I strongly feel that and I would like to go beyond the administrative limitations to discuss this thing. 

The officers working for the government remains anonymous, their names, their work don’t get any recognition. They never come in the picture. However, there are certain things that I feel like to share. 

Today, our secretary in the Government of India Mr. Parmeshwar Ji Aiyyar; whether he is present here? He must be sitting below the dais; he has been looking after this project. He had gone to the US by leaving the job of IAS. He was leading a comfortable life in the USA. After formation of our government, we made an appeal, we appealed to a lot of people. And I’m glad that he has come back to India by giving up that glamorous life. He had been an IAS officer for years and then he had left the job. You have just seen him on television, he was just shown on TV channels. TV channels have focused their cameras on him just a while ago, please once again turn your cameras towards him. Yes. It’s him. He again came back and I inducted him in the government and assigned this responsibility to him. 

He himself cleans toilets by going from place to place. And today if I have colleagues like Parmeshwar Ji, if there are thousands of cleanliness warriors who have come from all the corners of the country then my belief is strengthened that we will be able to realise the dreams of Bapu Ji when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of him. 

During the earlier period, we used to hear that the God has thousands of hands. That the God has thousands of hands, we still hear and read this kind of things. But we have never heard of a Prime Minister with thousands of hands. But given the thousands of cleanliness warriors sitting before me, I would like to say with all the humility that the Prime Minister of the country too has become a person with thousands of hands. 

Your commitment, your hard work, your support; these cleanliness warriors who left their villages to do the work of cleaning in the lanes of Bihar while still being dedicated to cleanliness in their own areas, these Swachchagrahis have been providing a new momentum, new energy and a new life to the Bapu’s movement of moving from passive resistance to cleanliness campaign; and therefore I once again congratulate to all of you.

Friends, be it the cleanliness mission or be it the fight against black money and corruption or be it development of facilities related to common man, the central government has been walking shoulder to shoulder with Nitish Ji and his team. For development of Bihar, for social and economic empowerment of the people of the state, the policies and strategies of both central government and Bihar government are complimentary to each other. 

From this platform, I have got the opportunity to either publicly dedicate or lay the foundation stones for the schemes worth more than Rs. 6,600 crore related to Bihar’s development. Be it water or railways or be it roads or petroleum; several such schemes are going to prove important for Bihar and especially for Champaran. And if we see that in a way these schemes are also related to cleanliness and protection of environment. 

Brothers and sisters, the restoration of Motihari lake is also among those projects the foundation stones for which are being laid today. Our Motihari district is being named after that lake, the lake that has been part of the history of Bihar, the restoration work of that lake is being started today. When Gandhi was here in Champaran for the Satyagrah then he had said about this lake that the lake’s view in the evening gives happiness. This city is beautiful because of this lake. But the beauty of the Moti Lake, which was experienced by Gandhi Ji, has been slowly fading away with the passage of time. 

I’m aware that thewise citizens of this place have made every possible contribution to protect the lake. The awareness campaign had been run from social media to roads. By joining into the efforts made by you people, not only the lake will be restored but the facilities like Lake Fun will also be developed for tourists. 

Brothers and sisters, cleanliness is also linked to water. The foundation stone for a water supply scheme with a cost of nearly Rs. 100 crore has been laid under the Amrit Scheme so that Betia doesn’t have to struggle for clean water. This is directly going to benefit more than 1.5 lakh people.

One more effort made by us is related to cleaning of the life giving mother Ganges. The government has been working with the resolve to clean the Ganga from Gangotri to up to Ganga Sagar. Bihar is an important part of this mission. Eleven projects worth more than Rs. 3,000 crore have now been approved in Bihar to stop the drainage of polluted waters of homes and factories. There is a plan to lay 1,100 kilometer long civil pipeline with that money. And the foundation stones for four projects out of these have been laid today. 

The work has been taking place on those four projects the foundation stones for which were laid when I had visitedMokama last year. The work on the remaining projects will be started very soon. The villages located on the banks of the river Ganges have been declared free from open defecation on priority basis. 

In five states, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, from where Ganga Ji flows through, several villages located on the banks of Ganga have succeeded in this mission. Waste management schemes have been implemented in those villages that are located on the banks of river Ganga so that the waste generated in the village is not thrown in the river. I’m hopeful that the banks of Ganga will be soon free from open defecation. 

Sometime back a ‘Waste Festival’ was celebrated in Banaras. I would urge the people of the cities located on the banks of Ganga that you should celebrate Waste Festivals and teach people how the waste can be used for creating wealth. And you will be surprised to know what an important work can be done through the waste. 

Brothers and sisters, 

Clean fuel is also a part of cleanliness drive. The government has been fully dedicated to set every poor mother and sister free from poisonous smoke through the Ujjawala scheme. More than 3.5 crore families in the country have been provided a free gas connection so far. Nearly 50 lakh women, 50 lakh families of Bihar have also benefitted under the scheme. 

Friends, but due to the priority given to clean fuel and due to the success of Ujjawala scheme the demand for the gas cylinders has been rising. Today the foundations for establishing LPG plants in Motihari and Sagoli have been laid so that the people of Champaran and nearby areas do not face problem in getting gas cylinders. Nearly 90,000 cylinders will be refilled in a day after these plants start working. 

In addition to this, in Motihari, foundation stone has been laid for a petroleum-oil lube terminal. Once it is ready then not only it will meet the requirement of the petrol and diesel of Champaran and nearby districts but it will also help in streamlining the supply to the Nepal as well. 

Brothers and sisters,

These projects are the expansion of that vision of the central government under which the eastern India has been considered the growth engine for the country. The kind of work to develop the infrastructure from eastern Uttar Pradesh to Bihar, to West Bengal and then up to Odisha and also in the states of North East has been done by our government, it is such that has never been done earlier. 

Nitish Ji too is a witness to this thing that how the schemes have been formulated by taking into account the needs of eastern India including Bihar. New projects have been started. Especially, our government has been laying a lot of emphasis on improving connectivity in these areas. 

Given the requirements of the 21st century, the work on the development of all these things like highways, waterways, i-ways in these areas has been taking place at a fast speed. Today, the foundation stones for national highway projects worth nearly Rs. 900 crore have been laid. Aurangabad to Chaurdah, which is a four lane section, today, the work on making it six lane has started. This project will benefit the people from both Bihar and Jharkhand. 

Similarly, the foundation stones for two railway projects for Champaran have been laid. The railway track between Muzaffarnagar to Sagoli and Sagoli to Balmiki Nagar will be converted into double line. This will not only benefit the people of Champaran but it will also make the travel and tradeof the people from Uttar Pradesh to Nepal easier. 

Friends, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a new train on the occasion of centenary of Champaran movement. This train will run between Katihar to Old Delhi. The government has specially named it Champaran Humsafar Express. This train which is equipped with modern amenities will be extremely helpful for you people for travelling to and from Delhi. 

Brothers and sisters,

Today, the first phase of an electric locomotive factory in Madhepura has been dedicated to the public. This factory is important for two reasons. First, it’s an excellent example of Make in India. Second, it is becoming a big source of employment in this region. Indian railways have been working on this project in collaboration with a French company. This factory will manufacture powerful engines. I just got the opportunity to show the green flag to a 12,000 horse power engine produced in this modern factory. 

Friends, there are very few countries in the world that use such a powerful engine for carrying goods. The average speed of goods trains in India will be more than doubled because of these engines. 

There is one more reason because of that I would like explain to you people about this project in detail. 

Brothers and sisters, this project was approved in 2007, but the files of this project did not receive any power even 8 years after it was sanctioned and the files were rotting. Three year ago, NDA government started work on this project and now the first phase has already been completed.

Ayushman Bharat: In our country, for the poor people, another important thing after cleanliness is health. If someone falls sick in the poorest of the poor family then that family will get up to Rs. five lakh in a year for the treatment of the disease with the help government and this insurance scheme. Now the family will not face hurdles in the treatment of the diseases due to lack of money. Ayushman Bharat, the government of India is going to implement this new scheme.

My government has certain way of doing things. Now the tendency of putting brakes, putting things on the back burner and of misdirection has beenput to an end. The work culture of keeping the files on holdhas ended. The government has been completing its every mission, its every resolve with the support from the public. 

But those people who are not able to accept these changes are facing problems because of this. They are not able to tolerate the empowerment of poor people. They feel that if the poor person becomes strong then they will not be able to tell the lies, then they will not be able to misguide him. That is why hurdles have been created in the functioning of the government from road to parliament. 

Friends, you otherwise have a government which has been trying to create amity among people. On the other hand some opponents have been trying to create discord among the people. 

Friends, I would like to specially praise the able administration and patience of Nitish Ji. The way he has been fighting against the corrupt and anti-social forces of Bihar that is not easy. The central government fully supports his cleanliness campaign against corruption, fully supports his efforts to bring about social changes. 

NDA government has been doing the work in a time bound manner with a solemn resolve by following the formula of Sabka Sath – Sabka Vikas.Previous governments might not have understood the importance of completing the work in a time bound manner but Gandhi Ji always used to stress upon timely completion of work in addition to Satyagrah and Swachchagrah. Gandhi Ji always kept a pocket watch with him. And he also used to say this thing: ‘when you can’t waste a grain of rice or a piece of paper then you must not waste a single minute’. This is not our time, this time belongs to the nation and it must be utilised for the country.

1.25 billion Indians have been working in the mission mode by leading their lives as per this spirit of Gandhi Ji. It is their insistence on cleanliness because of that the coverage of cleanliness which was 40% in 2014 has now expanded to over 80%. It means that more cleanliness has been achieved during the tenure of this government than what was achieved in 67 years after the independence. 

Friends, in the last three and a half years more than 350 districts and more than 3.5 lakh villages of the country have declared themselves free from open defecation. Nearly 7 crore toilets have been constructed in the country in the last three and a half years. This is due to the will power of the people because of that in the last one week alone, from 4th April onwards, when the Satyagrah to Swachchagrah Week was celebrated; nearly 26 lakh toilets were constructed in Bihar, UP, Odisha and Jammu & Kashmir. These are the four states which have resolved that they will expand the coverage of cleanliness at a much faster speed.   

Friends, you people are very well aware that how the Clean India Mission has changed the lives of millions and millions of women of the country. The women are getting all three things – dignity, safety and health – because of the construction of a toilet. I’ve been told that now people in Bihar have also started calling toilets as Izzatghars (the place of honor). Construction of toilets has also ended a huge social imbalance. It’s also becoming the reason for economic and social empowerment. 

Last year, it was reported in a study of United Nations that on an average Rs. 50,000 of those families have been saved in a year that have a toilet in the house. Otherwise the same amount is being spent on the treatment of diseases, on visiting hospitals and due to absence from work.

As per a study conducted by another international agency, it has been revealed that for the kids of those villages which have been declared free from open defecation,the incidence of suffering from diarrhea has come down and their mental and physical development is also taking place in a proper manner. Because now the kids are falling sick less frequently, they have been taking leaves from schools less frequently. Therefore those villages that have declared themselves free from open defecation have also registered improvement in the school results.

Friends, it is a case study for the top universities of the world the way Clean India Mission has reached every nook and corner of the country by becoming the people’s movement. I feel that this kind of people’s movement to change the human behaviour has not taken place in any other country in the 21st century until now. India has certainly been changing. The change is taking place in habits and behaviour.

However, now every Swachchagrahi present here in Gandhi Maidan, everyone one from the youngest kid of the country to the oldest person, will have to face the real challenge. This challenge is about maintaining the insistence on cleanliness from roads to railway stations and bus stations, in front of the house and shop, in front of schools and colleges, in markets and in lanes and, in corners and in the locality. Clean India Mission will not be complete unless every single person of the country will make effort for cleanliness at his own level. Clean India Mission will not be completed unless cleanliness becomes part of life of every single person of the country. That is why we will be able to complete the Clean India Mission in 2019 to the extent we will insist on the cleanliness. And we will be able to pay our similarly emotional tribute to the Holy Bapu on the second of October the next year.  

Friends, Gandhi Ji had placed farmers, laborers, teachers, lawyers, doctors, engineers and everyone in the same line here in Champaran. Only then Satyagrah had succeeded. As a Swachchagrahi (cleanliness warriors) our roles should be similar to that. It should be our constant endeavor that this message of cleanliness should reach to every person and every section of the society. 

And that is why I will urge upon every Swchchagrahi present here that you should give the maximum publicity to the things mentioned in the booklet that has been given to you. The more you make the people aware, the more this Clean India Mission will succeed. The government has also been making this effort that there should be at least one Cleanliness Champion in every village of the country. More than 6.5 lakh Cleanliness Champions have been working on cleanliness to make it a part of the daily lives of people in every corner of the country, they will work on the mission to make it a part of people’s lives. 

The work to provide housing to poor in the country has been progressing at a rapid pace under the Prime Minister’s AvasYojana. I’m hopeful that Bihar will also carry out the work to provide housing to the poor at the same speed at which it has taken upon the work of construction of toilets. 

All of us can do one more thing: all the anniversaries that will fall between today and the 2nd of October the next year, birth or death anniversary or any festival then we should specially motivate people on that occasion for the Clean India Mission. For example, tomorrow on the 11th April, it is the birth anniversary of great social reformer JyotibaPhule Ji; Baba SahebAmbedkar’s birth anniversary is falling on the 14th of April. In addition to talking about that great soul on these special days, a request to people can also be made regarding the cleanliness.

Even otherwise, let me tell you about your knowledge that the central government is going to start Gram Swaraj Abhiyan from 14th of April. Under this movement, all our MPs, MLAs, elected representatives, be they are in a local village body or in a municipal council or city council, they all should associate themselves with some or some other work related to the Clean India Mission in their areas. Please persuade others, make request to people by visiting door to door that they should make effort to keep the nearby areas clean and hygienic. 

Brothers and sisters,

The future generations will remember your contribution in nation building. Every Satyagrahi has been working towards building a healthy, hygienic and prosperous nation. When Champaran Satyagrah was taking place then we were not there to participate in it, we were not even born. No one of us was there in that movement. However, we can work day and night to make the Champaran Swachchagrah a success.

I know that this task requires extreme patience. And I also know this thing that you Swachchagrahis (cleanliness warriors) have this kind of burning desire to bring about a change in the country that you people constantly keep working in your efforts. Champaran Swachchagrah has become the national song for today’s youth which gives them the power to understand the challenges, to overcome them and to fight and not to stop till the victory has been achieved. This movement by the people also provides the guidance for the future of India. 

I’m totally confident that our insistence on cleanliness will write a new chapter of a clean, beautiful and prosperous new India. I convey my best wishes to all the Swachchagrahis participating in this grand function here. I would also like to say that India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022. And we have been celebrating the 150th anniversary of Gandhi Ji from the second of October 2018 to the second of October 2019. In order to realise the dream of a New India, we have to eradicate those social evils, those vices from our society that have been damaging the country, that have been weakening it. We have to make an India that is free from filth, free from corruption. We have to liberate our country from these feelings of casteism, free from the feelings of superiority and inferiority and of untouchability, we have to set the country free of communal tensions and this communalism. 

When we will move ahead with these resolves only then we will be able to pay real tribute to the freedom fighters in 2022; we can pay real tribute to Gandhi Ji when his 150th anniversary will be in 2018-19.  With these feelings, by respectfully bowing down and while congratulating the youth for doing this great service to the country, I once again appeal to all of you, to the people of the country: Mahatma Gandhi had done a lot for us, please come forward and we should also make efforts to realise one dream of Gandhi Ji - the dream of a clean India. 

This work is not a government event. This programme doesn’t belong to the Prime Minister or Chief Ministers, neither it belongs to the central government or state governments. This programme belongs to 1.25 billion people of the country, it belongs to the poor people of the country, this programme is for ensuring social justice in the country and for ensuring honor for mothers and sisters. And that is why we should join this programme wholeheartedly. 

With this feeling I once again honor, I once again congratulate all those Swachchagrahis and I respectfully thank all of you. 

Please once again join me in saying.

I would say Mahatma Gandhi and you would say it twice: long live; long live.

Mahatma Gandhi; long live, long live. 

Please say with all your strength.

Mahatma Gandhi; long live, long live. 

Mahatma Gandhi; long live, long live. 

 

Thank you very much.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the National Convention of Swachhagrahis at Motihari. The event has been organized, as part of the centenary celebrations of the Satyagraha led by Mahatma Gandhi, in Champaran.

 

On this occasion, the Prime Minister launched several important development projects as well. In the Water Supply and Sanitation sector, he unveiled a plaque to mark the foundation stone of Motijheel Project, the Bettiah Nagar Parishad Water Supply Scheme, and four Ganga Projects, namely: the Saidpur Sewage Network, Patna; the Pahari Sewage Network, Zone 4, Patna; the Pahari Sewagw Network, Zone 5, Patna; and the Pahari STP project.

 

In the Railways sector, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of the doubling of railway lines between Muzaffarpur and Sagauli; and Sagauli and Valmikinagar. He dedicated the first phase of the Madhepura Electric Locomotive Factory to the nation. Via video link, he flagged off the first 12000 HP Freight Electric Locomotive, and the Champaran Humsafar Express.

He also distributed awards to Champion Swachhagrahis.

 

Addressing an enthusiastic gathering on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that the atmosphere at Motihari today, evokes the same spirit of mass movement, that marked the Champaran Satyagraha, a century ago.

 

He said that in this journey of Satayagraha to Swachhagraha, the people of Bihar have shown their ability to lead. He noted the remarkable progress made in toilet construction in Bihar in the last one week. He appreciated the efforts of the people of the State, and the State Government for the same.

 

The Prime Minister said that whether it is the Swachh Bharat Mission, or the fight against corruption, or the development of civic amenities, the Union Government is working shoulder to shoulder with the State Government. He said the projects worth over Rs. 6600 crore launched today would go a long way in the development of the region and the State.He mentioned the project for the rejuvenation of Motijheel, which he described as a part of the history of Motihari. He mentioned that 11 projects worth more than Rs 3000 crore have been approved so far, to prevent waste water from entering the River Ganga. He said that about 50 lakh women had benefited from LPG connections through the Ujjwala Yojana, in the State of Bihar. In this context, he also mentioned the LPG and petroleum projects launched today. He said the projects launched today are part of the larger vision of developing Eastern India as growth engine for India. He also mentioned the road and rail projects launched today. He described the Madhepura Electric Locomotive Factory as a prime example of Make in India, and a source of employment in the region. He said the 12000 HP engines, the first of which rolled out today, will help in significantly improving the speeds of goods trains. He said that the work for this project, which was first approved in 2007, began three years ago, and the first phase has already been completed. He said the Union Government is committed to fulfilling all its missions and resolves, with the help of the people.

Speaking of the achievements in sanitation, the Prime Minister mentioned that sanitation coverage has expanded from about 40 percent in 2014, to about 80 percent today. He said toilet construction is ending social imbalances, and becoming a means of socio-economic empowerment and women empowerment. He described the mass movement of Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan as a phenomenon unparalleled anywhere in the world, in the 21st century. 

The Prime Minister expressed confidence that the resolve for Swachhta would write a new chapter of a clean and prosperous India.

Anant Geete ji doesn't sing but Babul ji sings. This is a new beginning of the small world of the public sector. I welcome you all at the CPSE conclave. I congratulate you all. I could clearly see your diligence, enthusiasm and by and large your clarity of thoughts in the presentation given in the past 1-1.5 hours. I got the opportunity to get a glimpse of your vision and thoughts on various aspects ranging from corporate governance to innovation, technology and New India. I don't know whether any former Prime Minister has ever got a similar opportunity! 

 

I would also like to congratulate all those who were involved in the discussions and were associated with the presentation team. They must have had a deeper discussion and collected many references. They must have got the opportunity to think out of the box.

 

I am told that you have been engaged in a detailed discussion for the past few months. You have done a lot of research in order to get a transformative change in your related sectors. Even I try to incorporate my thoughts in your discussions and some of your subjects so that there could be a balance of thought between you and me. In a way everyone has contributed in some or the other way in the process of discussion and debate.

 

Several day-to-day challenges faced by you have been discussed upon. The government is ceaselessly working to overcome these problems. In the last 4 years, the government has also given operational freedom to the Institutions of public sector so that they perform better.

 

Friends,

 

The public sector undertakings have made significant contribution to the country's economy for nation building after independence. At that time India was in need of funds, technology and investment in different sectors. It was not easy to get these things. Therefore, at that time the public sector enterprises helped the country to meet these requirements. A number of good brands came up. These Enterprises had their domination over several sectors like power production, designing of the equipment related to power, steel production, oil, mineral, coal and so on. At the time when private sector had not proliferated, you had expedited the process of economic growth. Even today, you are not only strengthening India's economy but also acting as a catalyst to the industrial activities.

 

Friends,

 

Usually assessment of a CEO of a private company is done on the basis of profit earned by him for his shareholders. Profit is also important for public sector enterprises, but at the same time they have to take into consideration the welfare of the society.

 

We cannot keep ourselves limited. We have to take into consideration of the entire society. In a way, PSE actually refers to Profit and Social benefit generating Enterprises. This means they should not only generate profit for the shareholders but also generate benefits for the society. We cannot forget about the contribution and the sacrifices made by the PSE staff and all the officials when we talk of social benefits. You have to face a lot of difficulties while working in difficult areas under difficult circumstances where there is lack of facilities. Yes you are determined.

 

The government is able to take big decisions as a result of your courage. It would not have been possible without your hard work, be it providing electricity to every village of the country or providing LPG connection to the mothers and the sisters. We have also seen the scope and the time frame of the work in the presentation. 

 

Friends,

 

We cannot be satisfied with a good and a rich history in this era. There is a need to make changes for facing the present challenges. I believe that idealism and ideology are not enough in economic decision making. Pragmatism and practicability should also be taken into account. In the 21st century economy Innovation and Enterprise should be the mantras that will guide and be the driving forces for any sector.

 

There are no separate mantras for the success of private sector or public sector. When I think of success mantra, the concept of three ‘I’s comes to my mind. These three ‘I’s are: Incentive, Imagination and Institutional building. Economists say that incentives are one of the greatest tools for bringing change in human behaviour not only in business but also in our lives. We usually see that if we want a person to work up to his potential, we try to motivate him. Similarly, even you have to come up with unique incentive models so as to get rid of procrastination and stagnation. Incentives need not always be financial. The photo of the best performing employee can be put up on the bulletin board or just a pat on the back by the Chairman can also do wonders in motivating employees.

 

I clearly remember that once I went to a pharmaceutical company in Baroda. Whenever a product was made, its description was publicized and the employees were asked to name the product. A competition used to be organised. Even though the employees were not scientists, they used to search for an apt name enthusiastically for which they were rewarded later. Their contribution was equally important as that of the scientists. Therefore, there is a need to think in terms of providing incentives and the manner in which those should be provided. You know how these things are used in families. It has to be taken forward with a feeling of togetherness.

 

The second thing I have mentioned is ‘Imagination’. It has taken a different form altogether since the time the PSEs were formed. Several successful private companies would not have sustained for two decades. It is a fact. There may be a number of reasons. But the major reason is not being able to adapt to the upcoming changes in the future, especially in the field of technology. Here, the imagination of leadership comes handy. I have stayed in Ahmedabad for several years. There was a time when the big chimneys of the Mills used to be of great magnificence. Due to lack of new technology it spread everywhere. But today not a single chimney gives out smoke. Why? This was due to lack of imagination. There was a habit of living on outdated things. Those who cannot adapt themselves to the changes by making transformation, or do not have a long-term vision or cannot take decisions are the ones who remain stagnant. Gradually they are headed towards destruction. Today, diversification has become extremely important.

 

Thirdly, Institution building is one of the greatest tests of leadership. I am not talking about political leadership. All the people present here are leaders in their fields. They have to provide leadership in the entire field of work. A Team should be formed centred around a proper system. Individual-centred systems do not last long.

 

Friends,

 

Till date we have been classifying PSEs as Navratnas. It's high time that we classified them as 'New India' Ratnas that will help in building a New India. Are you ready to make changes in technology and processes to become and make 'New India' Ratnas?

 

I believe your participation in the creation of a New India will be more effective by following the 5P formula. The 5P means - Performance, Process, Persona, Procurement and Prepare.

 

Friends,

 

All of you have to elevate your benchmarks for operational and financial performance in your institutions. You have to prepare yourselves for competing with the world's best companies in your respective sectors. Today it is being said that India will be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few years. India's Public Sector Enterprises have a major role in achieving this goal by improving the GDP growth rate.

 

Friends,

 

I was told that Net Value Addition by the PSUs in the period 2017-18 was about 5%. It is the need of the hour to double this figure. Your collective efforts should be in this direction so that the PSUs become the third arm for revenue generation after direct and indirect taxes.

 

There is a saying - 'Udyogsampannam saamupaiti Lakshmi' which means that Lakshmi goes to industrialists. It is important for the PSUs to be prosperous for the welfare of the country.

 

Today, the Return on Equity of all the PSEs of the government is about 11%. It is lower than that of the private sector and is low for a good business venture. It is extremely low in my opinion. Therefore, I would like the CPSE management to make the necessary decisions and try to increase it by adopting a definite strategy. 

 

Similarly, the second 'P' is 'Process'. The process should bring about transparency, accountability and should deliver more effectively in a global scale.

 

We should ask ourselves that how the Indian PSUs will achieve Global greatness in the next 5 to 10 years in New India. How the PSUs should bring more innovation, redefine them to increase the GDP and change their policies to increase tax revenue so as to open new avenues for employment? I believe there is a need to think on these lines.

 

It is indispensable for the Public Sector Undertakings to be competitive in this Global scenario. You must have seen that the public sector enterprises of several European countries are doing well in the areas of power, atomic energy and solar energy. We can also learn a lot from their working model.

 

Friends,

 

The way the business environment has transformed globally there is a need to incorporate flexibility along with speed in decision making. In the past there have been many such instances when the government Enterprises have suffered due to the lack of risk taking. In such a scenario, decision making should be streamlined at every level. Therefore, the next ‘P’, i.e. Persona becomes important.

 

Better decision making can only work if we have a talent pool. We have to ensure that the right talent is being carried forward and whether we are able to create bench strength.

 

One is bound to progress if one incorporates 3 things i.e. flexible decision making, good talent and technology. I am told that you, in your presentation, have mentioned about the priority given to Tech-up India mission in order to increase innovation in the field of Technology. It is highly commendable and I wish success for this endeavour.

 

Procurement is also important. Friends, changes in procurement policy can strengthen the country's Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises - MSME. I wish to present a fact before you. The PSUs had procured more than Rs.1, 30,000 crores in the year 2016. Out of this, the purchase of only Rs. 25,000 crores was made by the MSME sector. Can't you all frame a mechanism by which more and more goods can be purchased from the micro and small industries of the country? You can help especially by hand-holding of the Industries in the backward regions of the country.

 

You must be aware of a scheme of the government of India i.e. Government e-Market (GeM) portal. You have also mentioned this in one of your presentations. It is a good system. It has instilled new energy in the MSME sector. In a short time, business worth Rs 6500 crore has been done on this online platform. If you use this platform more and more, it will not only bring transparency but also benefit the MSME sector. When you buy more and more item from the small entrepreneurs of our country, new opportunities for employment will open up in remote areas.

 

Besides, the more these MSMEs get funding and technical assistance from your organizations, the more will they get stronger. Capacity building of the MSME sector should be one of your goals. Probably you have mentioned this in your resolution today. The more you share your experiences with the small industries, the more will these progress towards making the country self-sufficient and self-reliant!

 

I want to request you all to ensure that the payment to the MSMEs is not delayed. You are well aware of the problems faced by the small industries on delay of payment.

 

The manufacturing sector of the country can get a boost from Central Public Sector Enterprises. You can play a major role in rejuvenating the sectors like rural housing, renewable energy, solar energy, textile, pharma, tourism etc.

 

I will also request you to hold the annual general body meeting at a new tourist destination, not the conventional ones like Agra. The people will get to know about the tourist spot and come to visit it. That tourist destination will develop in a natural course. Suppose there are 300 companies and each of the company holds 25 meetings in a year in 25 different tourist spots, then tell me whether the economy of that place will develop or not? Whether the infrastructure of that region will develop or not? You are usually holding the meetings in cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and staying in 5 star hotels. Can you hold the meetings in such new locations as well? Now you see, this is your routine but this will help in boosting the country's tourism sector. You don't have to do anything extra. This will happen only when your vision merges with the country's vision. Therefore, I would like to request you to take these small steps for nation building and the country's tourism sector would get a boost. This is the sector that has the capacity to provide highest employment out of the total capital invested. This soil has the ability to provide what the world is not able to provide. But we have never tried to reach up to our potential. How should we do that?

 

Friends,

 

Our preparation for the future takes us to the fifth 'P' i.e. 'Prepare'. The Indian PSUs must prepare themselves keeping in line with technological innovations such as artificial intelligence Quantum computing, electric vehicles and robotics. It is estimated that by the year 2020, India's share in the Global Internet of Things market would be about 20%. It is a market of around 20 lakh crore rupees. It is also estimated that the share of Internet of Things in industrial manufacturing will be approximately 60%. Are the Indian PSUs framing the future strategy keeping this in mind? Are you analysing the data?

 

Friends,

 

New technologies such as digitisation, analytics, e-mobility and block chain are going to help you in your efforts. These technologies can create new opportunities for you in your business. You can also take advantage of the new innovations in financial market and the availability of a large capital pool for investment today.

 

Friends,

 

When you move ahead in harmony with the needs and priorities of the country, better results are sure to follow. I am sure that the PSUs of our country have the full potential of becoming a New India change agent.

 

Today on this occasion, I wish to put forth 5 questions as 5 challenges before you. I am not going to say anything different from your presentation. I would like to present whatever you have said in my own way. I believe you will be able to do these things successfully. These 5 challenges will redefine your role in New India. I will not get into the details but will present a broad structure before you.

 

My first question: India will complete 75 years of independence in the year 2022. Will the Indian PSUs be able to increase their geo-strategic reach to the maximum by 2022? If yes then how? My second question: how will the PSUs help the country to reduce its import bill? You might be thinking that whose job is it? I want to give you one example. I went to the farm of a farmer in Haryana. This incident is 25-30 years old. His agricultural field was very small. He had requested me to visit him as he had done something new. He was 30-35 years old but was very enthusiastic. The five star hotels of Delhi used to import special vegetables like baby corns, small tomatoes etc. He decided to stop the imports and instead grow the same vegetables in a controlled environment for supplying them to the hotels. In just 3 years, he managed to stop the imports. If a son of a farmer is determined, he can do wonders. These self-reliant PSUs have played a major role in making the country self-reliant. Now, it's time to make your presence felt in the global economy. Although you have mentioned this in your presentation, I would still like to emphasize upon this. What alternative technology and equipment should we use so as to reduce the country's import bill? My third question: how should the Indian PSUs share the innovation and Research among themselves? Today we are working in isolation. As a result, the human resource is getting wasted. Someone has completed a work while the other is starting the same work from the scratch. If we work in coordination, you can imagine the leap in this area. Therefore, I am talking about integration.

 

My fourth question: can the CSR fund be utilised according to the dream of New India and to get rid of the problems that the country is facing? What should be its roadmap? How can we accomplish it collectively? You have mentioned about your experiments. You have made huge contributions in making toilets. And as a result we have seen such a drastic change in the country. Thus, it is necessary to focus on challenges one by one and find solutions for them.

 

Finally my fifth question: which development model will the Indian PSUs provide the nation by 2022? Will we keep on dragging the same old system or bring a new system in place?

 

I am putting forth these challenges in the form of questions because you have to take decisions, frame policies and strategies and also implement the same. When you discuss these questions in the board meetings keeping in mind the greater goal of nation building, new pathways will open up. You will get a new direction.

 

Friends,

 

Your contribution is essential to increase India's Geo-strategic reach in the new world order. Today you have the opportunity as you meet people across the globe. Earlier such opportunities were few. We should not let go of this opportunity. You must be well aware of the fact that some countries have used their PSUs to increase their influence in other countries.

 

It's a fact that one-fourth of the 500 big companies of the world are PSUs of some or the other country. These companies are the medium of good amount of investment in their respective countries. Therefore, you must think on these lines to expand your base as much as possible. Today, government to government contact is increasing. Thus, you have a good opportunity to increase PSU to PSU contact.

 

Today the Indian PSUs are waving their flags from Brazil to Mozambique and from Russia to Australia. The need of the hour is that these PSUs should now frame a comprehensive strategy for overseas investment. You also have to keep in mind while framing the strategy that your return on investment should be as much as the geo-strategic reach. This government has signed a number of MoUs with the leading cities of other countries. Work is going on in developing several sister cities. Can our PSUs promote Make in India in a planned and a systematic manner together with the industrial bodies and Institutions of those cities?

 

Actually one state becomes the sister state of the other. Similarly, one city becomes the sister City of the other. However, the other units are left behind. Just signing one MoU is not enough. We have to maximise this. There may be 50-100 areas in which the cities can connect this way. Therefore, I appeal for new strategic views. There is a similar challenge of import bill in front of all of us. There are several products that are imported but these imports can be reduced. Government has reduced import bill in some sectors but there is a long way to go. In such a scenario, there is a good opportunity for you all in this area. This is not a big challenge. You just have to try and the transformation will be visible.

 

You can set a deadline for 2-3 years to reduce the import of any product by 10-15-20% whatever you may decide.

 

If we are price competitive and quality sensitive and focus on products that are imported but can be replaced by innovation, then there will be a significant reduction in the import bill.

 

Friends,

 

I want to give you an example of the Defence sector. India has been one of the world's largest arms importer countries in the last 60-70 years. I do not want to get into previous policies. At that time no one could even think that Foreign Direct Investment will be opened up in the defence sector too by the government.

 

I believe that the PSUs of the defence sector should consider this as a good opportunity. The more our PSU emphasize on technology transfer and joint ventures, the more will the 'Make in India' get strengthened and the defence sector will become more self-reliant. Today India is building a fighter aircraft like Tejas and making world class submarines and warships. We are also technologically capable. In such a scenario, we have to keep an eye on the domestic market as well as the overseas markets.

 

Another important aspect is the integration of innovation with research. Our scientific Institutions like Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Indian Council of Medical Research and Indian Council of Agricultural Research have the best R&D infrastructure. CPSEs also have modern research infrastructure in respective fields.  You have also developed many techniques and innovative products. But it has also been observed that the innovation in the laboratory of different Agencies is limited to that. I believe it is the need of the hour to prepare an integrated infrastructure of innovation and research by 2022. When Information sharing between the CPSEs and the government departments will increase, the cost of research will also reduce and the system will be more efficient. This sharing can take place at different levels ranging from infrastructure to skill pooling, and the use of modern equipment and technologies.

 

Friends,

 

In the last few years the public sector has done much better according to its balance sheet. Last year, the net profit of the CPSEs was more than Rs. 1, 25,000 crores. Two per cent of this amount i.e. around Rs. 2500 crore can be used as Corporate Social Responsibility.

 

We have to think about its apt use keeping in mind the country's priorities. You have shown on your presentation that in the year 2014-15, donations were made from the CSR fund for the construction of toilets in Schools. The results are in front of everyone. I suggest that a similar theme should be selected every year and a large part of the CSR should be put to a single task.

 

You must be aware of the 115 districts selected by NITI Aayog that have not been able to reach up to the levels of the other districts of the country. I have named those districts as aspirational districts. Can the development of these aspirational districts be the theme of this year?

 

Your organisation can also take up the task of skill development as a part of Corporate Social Responsibility. You can associate your organization with several universities, colleges and ITIs for a huge campaign on skill development.

 

Besides, the more you support the National Apprenticeship Programme, the more will the youth get benefitted out of it! I would like you to go and study the plans and schemes of government of India as soon as possible, form a team and take steps towards implementing them. The youth will come forward to learn with more passion upon receiving resources from your institutions. Moreover, they will also act as a talent pool for you.

 

Thus, you have to make more number of incubators and tinkering labs so that we can impart innovative ideas to the students at an early age. There is a need to tap the strength of the youth. Often, youngsters can provide an innovative solution which the present system is incapable of providing.

 

Friends,

 

Your experienced and resource-rich institutions can also provide new models for development to the country. Your institutions can become the centres of energy in the remote areas for the entire region. If you all are determined, then the country can get hundreds of new model smart cities in 1-1.5 years.

 

Your institutions can prove to be a role model for several areas like paperless work-culture, cashless transactions, waste management etc. You have reach and resources. With R&D you can show good results. This will be a great service to the society and the country.

 

I insist you all to focus on maximum efficiency, corporate governance and proper use of resources. No person or institution or a country can prosper without having faith in their resources and strength. There is no shortage of resources in India or lack of strength. We have the will-power and the trust in ourselves.

 

In the last 4 years, you would not have for once heard a negative tone from the government - such as complaining about difficulties or problems. I believe we can take our country to new heights. This is the promise of this government. There is no shortage of resources in our country. Come, let us move ahead together.

 

I believe that this initiative which you have taken will continue this way. The ideas that have emerged and are emerging out of this discussion will not only be implemented but also be monitored.

 

I believe that the combination of energy and experience, enterprise and enthusiasm will yield unprecedented results. To me PSU stands for: Pragati, Seva and Urja (Progress, Service and energy). And ‘S’ i.e. Service is at the centre!

 

Carrying forward the dream of New India along with a new energy and feeling of service will definitely lead the country to the path of Progress. This is my belief.

 

I hope your policies regarding the country's future become successful and your participation in the accomplishment of the resolution for new India is the maximum. Before ending my speech I want to request you all. Can I meet all the leaders after hundred days? I would be grateful if you can educate me regarding the framework that will be set for accomplishing the things discussed today. Even I want to learn a lot from you. If I am able to spend more time with you and learn from you, I can bring those changes in the government. So, I would like you all to frame a roadmap of the things discussed today and the responsibilities allotted and meet me after 100 days. It's not that everything is hunky dory, the future is bright or the people are enthusiastic or the results are bound to be achieved. But we have to move in that direction even if it means moving 100 steps. We can set deadlines, the team and the resources for achieving the smaller goals. You belong to the corporate world. You need not be told all these things. You must have studied management after paying hefty fees. I don't want to get into the details of what they have learnt and implemented. However, I hope you all will think over today's discussion. I hope you will take advantage of these things. Now I want the proper roadmap with measurable targets. They should not be superficial. You will see the transformation soon. Best wishes to you all. Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, attended the CPSE Conclave at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi today. 

Thematic presentations were made to the Prime Minister on subjects such as corporate governance, human resource management, financial re-engineering, innovations and technology, and Vision 2022 for New India. 

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister described this conclave as a new beginning in the public sector sphere. 

Appreciating the presentations, the Prime Minister said that the Union Government has given operational freedom to the public sector undertakings, so that they can improve their performance. He said PSUs have contributed significantly in nation-building, and in the nation’s economy, since independence. 

He said that for Public Sector Enterprises, both profit and generating social benefit are important. Complimenting the PSE employees for their contribution, the Prime Minister said that major objectives of the Government, such as electrifying all unelectrified villages, and providing LPG connections to the poor, could not have been fulfilled without the hard work of the PSE workers. 

The Prime Minister said that it is not enough to rest on past laurels, but is also important to adapt to emerging challenges. He said enterprise and innovation should be the guiding principles in the 21st century. He said Incentives, Imagination and Institution Building would be the three keys to success. 

The Prime Minister exhorted PSEs to help in making the New India, through changes in technology and processes. For this he said, PSEs would need a 5-P formula – Performance, Process, Persona, Procurement and Prepare. 

Elaborating the same, he mentionedimproving operational and financial performance; transparency and accountability in processes; procurement through the GeM platform and from MSMEs; and preparation for technological disruptions such as Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing and Robotics. 

He set five challenges before the PSEs, for New India:

 


	By 2022, how will Indian PSUs maximize their geo-strategic reach?
	By 2022, how will Indian PSUs minimize the country’s import bill?
	By 2022, how will Indian PSUs integrate innovation and research?
	By 2022, what will be the roadmap for Indian PSUs to optimally utilize their CSR Fund?
	By 2022, what new development model will Indian PSUs give the country?


 

The Prime Minister said that out of the 500 biggest companies in the world, one-fourth belong to the public sector in some country. He suggested that Indian PSUs can link with PSUs with other countries, and develop a comprehensive strategy for overseas investment. He said PSUs can also play a key role in reducing India’s import bill. Noting that CPSEs have modern R&D infrastructure, in addition to the facilities that exist in CSIR and ICAR etc, the Prime Minister said that innovation and research now need to be integrated. In this context, he called for greater information sharing among CPSEs and Government Departments. 

The Prime Minister suggested that the CSR spend of CPSEs should be focused largely on one specific theme each year. In this context, he noted the success that was achieved when this CSR spend was utilized for toilet construction in schools. He said one good theme could be the development of aspirational districts. He said CPSEs can also take up skill development programmes, as part of CSR. 

The Prime Minister said CPSEs can work as role models in many areas such as paperless work culture, cashless transactions, and waste management. 

The Prime Minister expressed hope that CPSEs would participate in a big way in realizing the resolve of New India.

                The Honourable speaker,Madam SumitraJi, my colleagues in the council of ministers, Shri Anant Kumar Ji, ShrimanHardeep Singh PuriJi, the chairperson of the House Committee Shriman, Suresh AngadiJi, all the honourable members of Parliament present here,

Tai Ji hasjust said about taking the Prime Minister’s time for such a small event; But, I don’t think that it’s a small event. It’s not a small event because you have worked with dedication to complete this task. When people watch the visuals of Parliament on television, they would see that Madam Speaker is pulling up the MPs, asking themto go back to their seats. Sometimes people would feel that the MPs are irritatingMadam Speaker. They would have been watching SumitraJi sitting like a mother on the chair and these five hundred people in the House troubling her. 

Today the country will also see the kind natureof a mother, her concern for the MPs when they face problems.And because of her motherly concern for them that this building has been constructed. These appropriate arrangements have been made for the guests of the MPs and also for the newly elected MPs. 

People will feel that Madam Speaker comes forward not just tomaintain  discipline in the House but also to take care of all the MPs. Her concern for the MPs is like that of a mother for her children..

Therefore, attendingsuch program is a matter of great luck.Members of both the Houses of Parliament including me are grateful to you because you have created this facility for our family of MPs. 

Generally,the work done by government departments is considered worse than that of a contractor. However, one would realise once a government agency decides to do a good job it is capable of doing it and that it can execute in time and with the budgeted amount. 

All these things have been done by HardeepJi’s department in a proper manner. Therefore I convey my sincere congratulations to all those officers of the department who have worked hard. 

Today, a grand thing is annexed with our Parliamentary system. This is an historic place.Those who have read the records of 1926knowLalaLajpatRaiJi used to stay here,MotilalJi Nehru used to stay here. You would get the opportunity to connect with such a heritageplace. I am sure that a good work has been done in this system. 

And as Tai Ji has said that we are the kind of people who inaugurate the facilities the foundations for which were laid by us.  And today you would have seen this thing that we have done it before the deadline. I think the project has been completed and delivered 4 to 6 months ahead of the schedule. 

When new MPs come here  theyhave to stay in five star hotelsspending a lot of money. This is because MPs who have not contested the election or have not been re-elected by the people do not vacate their house. As a result, newly elected MPs are required to stay in hotels. 

You have done a great service to the MPs. The newly elected MPs will now come and stay here instead of staying in hotels and it will also remove the burden on the government exchequer. So in a way this facility will not just  provide convenience, but will also bring respect to the newly elected MPs. 

Mycolleagues ShrimanMeghwalJi and Shriman Suresh Ji, and as the speaker madam informed that both of them have worked on this project with full dedication. My colleague Mr. Rudi also took great interest in this.  I felt that because it was constructed for MPs Ialso used to apply my mind to it. I don’t have much knowledge about architecture but Mr.Rudi was very enthusiastic about it so he used to come up with new ideas. However, it’s very natural for everyone to be happy after seeing that it has been materialized. 

You would be aware that there are two such places in Delhi which were planned to be constructed in the memory of Doctor Baba SahebAmbedkar during the government of AtalJi. However, when the governments were being run then they had been run in this manner that everybody rushed to do the politics in the name of Baba SahebAmbedkar. 

Those decisions which were taken during the tenure  ofAtalJi were not implemented. However, we completed them within the stipulated time after forming the government. 

And second thing, when I laid itsfoundation I said that I would dedicate this to publicin April 2018. And today I’m happy to inform that on the eve of Baba SahebAmbedkar’s birth anniversary  on14th of Aprilwe will dedicate the  house onAlipur Road where he lived to public on 13th of April. 

There is some respect, there are some ideals and there is a commitment which run in our veins. And we have demonstrated this through our deeds. Perhaps no other government would have given this kind of respect and honourand paid tributes to Baba SahebAmbedkar which have been given by this government. And instead of dragging Baba Saheb into politics if all of us would try to follow the path shown by Baba SahebAmbedkarwhich places importance on brotherhood and we can never progress by abandoning that.

We have moved forward by following the motto of SabkaSath-SabkaVikas for the welfare of everyone and we are the people who live and die for the rights of the last man in the society. 

And throughout our lives we follow these things as Mahatma Gandhi had shown this path to us that we should be first concerned about the last man in the society. And it is the responsibility of the government. And the government has been discharging its duty. 

I once again heartily congratulate this entire team and convey my best wishes to all of you. 

Thank you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the newly constructed Western Court Annexe in New Delhi. This building will serve as transit accommodation for Members of Parliament.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister appreciated the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Smt. Sumitra Mahajan, for her efforts in the completion of this project. He added that Smt. Sumitra Mahajan always has the well-being of the MPs in mind. He said that her compassion is reflected in the attention to detail that has been given in this project.

The Prime Minister said that the project has been completed well within the stipulated time and cost. He congratulated all those involved in the construction of the project.

The Prime Minister said that when MPs are newly elected, they have to stay in hotels and this makes headlines. However, he said that what is often missed is that previous occupants overstay beyond the designated time.

The Prime Minister asserted that the Union Government is walking on the path shown by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. At the core of Dr. Ambedkar's ideals is harmony and togetherness, he said. He added that working for the poorest of the poor is the Government’s mission.

The Prime Minister announced that the memorial to commemorate Babasaheb Ambedkar, at 26 Alipur Road in New Delhi, which was the place of Mahaparinirvana of Dr. Ambedkar, will be inaugurated on the 13th of April - the eve of his birth anniversary. He condemned the politics being played by certain people, in the name of Dr. Ambedkar.

                 The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval for the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Sao Tome and Principe on cooperation in the field of Medicinal Plants.  The MoU was signed on 14.03.2018.

 

Background: 

 

India is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of biodiversity, having 15 agro-climatic zones. Out of the 17000-18000 species of flowering plants, more than 7000 are estimated to have medicinal usage in folk and documented systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha & Homoeopathy (AYUSH System of Medicine). About 1178 species of medicinal plants are estimated to be in trade of which 242 species have annual consumption levels in excess of 100 metric tonnes/year. Medicinal plants are not only a major resource base for the traditional medicine & herbal industry but also provide livelihood and health security to a large segment of Indian population. There is global resurgence in traditional and alternative health care systems resulting in world herbal trade which stands at US$ 120 billion and is expected to reach US$ 7 trillion by 2050. Moreover, there are a large number of medicinal plants, particularly those found in tropical region, which are common to the two countries given similar geo-climatic factors.

 

Keeping in view the need for promotion and propagation of AYUSH systems, of medicine and Medicinal Plants Sector in Sao Tome and Principe, our standard draft MoU for country to country cooperation in field of Medicinal Plants was shared with the concerned authorities of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.

                The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given approval to the declaration of Scheduled Areas in respect of Rajasthan under Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India by rescinding the Constitution Order (C.O.)114 dated 12th February 1981 and promulgation of a new Constitution Order.

 

The promulgation of new C.O. will ensure that the Scheduled Tribes of Rajasthan will get benefits of protective measures available under the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India.

 

The Rajasthan Government has requested for extension of Scheduled Areas in the State of Rajasthan under Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India. 

 

Beneficiaries:

 

The Scheduled Tribes residing in Banswara, Dungarpur, Pratapgarh, and partial areas of Udaipur, Rajsamand, Chittorgarh, Pali and Sirohi districts of Rajasthan will get benefits of protective measures available under the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India.

 

The  areas  comprising  of 3  complete districts  namely,Banswara, Dungarpur, Pratapgarh; 9 complete tehsils, 1 complete block and 46 complete gram panchayats covering 227 villages in district Udaipur, Rajsamand, Chittorgarh, Pali and Sirohi of Rajasthan, would be included in the Scheduled Areas in the State of Rajasthan. 

 

No additional funds are required as to be expended on account of declaration of Scheduled Areas.   This will be part of Tribal  Sub-Plan  (now renamed as   Tribal Sub-Scheme) within existing schemes of Central and the State Government for more focused attention in Scheduled Areas for effecting speedy development.

Background:

 

As per paragraph 6(1) of the Fifth Schedule {Article 244(1)} to the Constitution of India, the expression 'Scheduled Areas' means ‘such areas as the President may by order declare to be Scheduled Areas'.  In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6(2) of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution, the President may at any time by order increase the area of any Scheduled Area in a State after consultation with the Governor of that State; rescind, in relation to any State or States, any order or orders made under this paragraph, and in consultation with the Governor of the State concerned, make fresh orders redefining the areas which are to be Scheduled Areas.

 

The Scheduled Areas were first notified in the year 1950. Subsequently, Constitution Orders specifying the Scheduled Areas were issued for State of Rajasthan in1981. Due to re­organization/creation of new districts and changes in population of Scheduled Tribes as per 2011 Census, the Government of Rajasthan has requested for extension of Scheduled Areas in the State of Rajasthan.

                            In line with the Government initiative of ease of doing business, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for delegating the powers to Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Finance Minister to award the Blocks/Contract Areas to successful bidders under Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) after International Competitive Bidding (ICB) based on the recommendations of Empowered Committee of Secretaries (ECS). Under HELP, Blocks are to be awarded twice in a year. Therefore, this delegation of powers will expedite the decision making process on awarding blocks and give a boost to the initiative of ease of doing business.

 

Impact:

 

Under the NELP Policy, ECS considers the Bid Evaluation Criteria (BEC), conducts negotiations with the bidders wherever necessary and make recommendations to CCEA on award of blocks. The CCEA approves the award of blocks. The entire process, including Inter Ministerial Consultations (IMC) is quite lengthy and time consuming. In consonance with the Government initiative of 'Ease of Doing Business', it is desirable to shorten the duration of time taken for award of the Blocks / Contract Areas.      Under     the      New Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy' the competitive bidding will be continuous and blocks will be awarded twice a year. 

 

Background:

 

Government of India launched a new policy regime for Exploration & Production (E&P) sector namely Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) in 2016 which is paradigm shift from earlier policy regime. The main features of new Policy regime are Revenue Sharing Contract, single Licence for exploration and production of conventional as well as unconventional Hydrocarbon resources, marketing & pricing freedom, etc. Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) under HELP, is main innovative feature wherein investor can carve out Blocks of their own interest and submit an Expression of Interest (Eol) throughout the year. Based on the areas for which expression of interest has been expressed bidding will be conducted every 6 months.

 

Government received an overwhelming response in first Eol cycle of OALP which started on 1st July, 2017 and closed on 15th November, 2017. In the first Bid round, 55 blocks, having an area of 59282 sq.km spreading across 11 States have been offered for bidding. The bidding process is being handled through a secured and dedicated e-bidding portal.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for rightsizing the Competition Commission of India (CCI) from One Chairperson and Six Members (totalling seven) to One Chairperson and Three Members (totalling four) by not filling the existing vacancies of two Members and one more additional vacancy, which is expected in September, 2018 when one of the present incumbents will complete his term.

Benefits:

The proposal is expected to result in reduction of three Posts of Members of the Commission in pursuance of the Governments objective of ""Minimum Government - Maximum Governance"".

As part of the Governments objective of easing the mergers and amalgamation process in the country, the Ministry had revised de minimis levels in 2017, which have been made applicable for all forms of combinations and the methodology for computing assets and turnover of the target involved in such combinations, has been spelt out. This has led to reduction in the notices that enterprises are mandated to submit to the Commission, while entering into combinations, thereby reducing the load on the Commission.

The faster turnaround in hearings is expected to result in speedier approvals, thereby stimulating the business processes of corporates and resulting in greater employment opportunities in the country.

The proposal is expected to result in reduction of three Posts of Members of the Commission in pursuance of the Governments objective of ""Minimum Government - Maximum Governance"".

Background:

Section 8(1) of the Competition Act, 2002 (the Act) provides that the Commission shall consist of a Chairperson and not less than two and not more than six Members. Presently, the Chairperson and four Members are in position.    

An initial limit of one Chairperson and not more than ten Members was provided in the Act, keeping in view the requirement of creating a Principal Bench, other Additional Bench or Mergers Bench, comprising at least two Members each, in places as notified by the Central Government. In the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007 (39 of 2007), Section 22 of the Act was amended removing the provision for creation of Benches. In the same Amendment Act, while the Competition Appellate Tribunal comprising one Chairperson and two Members was created, the size of the Commission itself was not commensurately reduced and was kept at one Chairperson and not less than two but not more than six Members.

The Commission has been functioning as a collegium right from its inception. In several major jurisdictions such as in Japan, USA and U.K. Competition Authorities are of a similar size.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today has approvedCentrally Sponsored Scheme of National Bamboo Mission (NBM) under National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) during remaining period of Fourteenth Finance Commission (2018-19 & 2019-20).  The Mission would ensure holistic development of the bamboo sector by addressing complete value chain and establishing effective linkage of producers (farmers) with industry.

 

CCEA has also approved Empowerment of Executive Committee for formulation of guidelines of the NBM and to make the changes therein, including cost norms for various interventions from time-to-time as per the felt needs and specific recommendations of States, with the approval of Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.

 

Expenditure:

An outlay of Rs.1290 crore (with Rs. 950 crore as Central share) is provisioned for implementation of the Mission during the remaining period of 14th Finance Commission (2018-19 and 2019-20).

 

Beneficiaries:

The scheme will benefit directly and indirectly the farmers as well as local artisans and associated personnels engaged in bamboo sector including associated industries. Since it is proposed to bring about one lakh ha area under plantation, it is expected that about one lakh farmers would be directly benefitted  in terms of plantation.

 

States/ districts covered:

The Mission will focus on development of bamboo in limited States where it has social, commercial and economical advantage, particularly in the North Eastern region and States including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

The Mission is expected to establish about 4000 treatment/ product development units and bring more than 100000 ha area under plantation.

 

Impact:

Bamboo plantation will contribute to optimizing farm productivity and income thereby enhancing livelihood opportunities of small & marginal farmers including landless and women as well as provide quality material to industry. Thus, the Mission will not only serve as a potential instrument for enhancing income of farmers but also contributing towards climate resilience and environmental benefits. The Mission will also help in creating employment generation directly or indirectly in both skilled and unskilled segments.

 

Details:

 

          The restructured NBM strives to - 

(i)      To increase the area under bamboo plantation in non forest Government and private lands to supplement farm income and contribute towards resilience to climate change.

(ii)    To improve post-harvest management through establishment of innovative primary processing units, treatment and seasoning plants, primary treatment and seasoning plants, preservation technologies and market infrastructure.

(iii)   To promote product development at micro, small and medium levels and feed bigger industry.

(iv)   To rejuvenate the under developed bamboo industry in India.

(v)    To promote skill development, capacity building, awareness generation for development of bamboo sector.

 

Implementation strategy and targets:

The following steps would be adopted for the development of bamboo sector:

I.     The Mission will focus on development of bamboo in limited States where it has social, commercial and economical advantage with focus on genetically superior planting material of bamboo species of commercial and industrial demand.

II.     Adoption of end to end solution in bamboo sector i.e. complete value chain approach starting from bamboo growers to consumers would be emphasized.

III.    Mission has been developed as a platform for integration of Ministries/ Departments/Agencies with implementation responsibilities given based on their mandate.

IV.   Capacity building of the officials, field functionaries, entrepreneurs and farmers through skill development and trainings will be emphasised.

V.   Focus will be given on Research & Development (R&D) to increase the production and productivity of bamboo.

 

Background:

National Bamboo Mission (NBM) started as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme in 2006-07, was mainly emphasizing on propagation and cultivation of bamboo, with limited efforts on processing, product development and value addition. There, was weak linkage between the producers (farmers) and the industry. The restructured proposal gives simultaneous emphasis to propagation of quality plantations of bamboo, product development and value addition including primary processing and treatment; micro, small & medium enterprises as well as high value products; markets and skill development, thus addressing the complete value chain for growth of the bamboo sector.

 

Details and progress of scheme if already running:

National Bamboo Mission (NBM) was initially started as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme in 2006-07 and was subsumed under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) during 2014-15 and continued till 2015-16. Funds were released thereafter only for maintenance of bamboo plantations raised earlier under NBM, and no new work or annual action plan was initiated. Since 2006-07, an area of 3.62 lakh ha covered under bamboo plantations and 39 bamboo wholesale markets, 40 bamboo bazaars and 29 retail outlets were set up.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for the increase in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Raw Jute for 2018-19 season.

 

The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Fair Average Quality (FAQ) of Raw Jute has been increased to Rs.3700/- per quintal for 2018-19 season from Rs. 3500/- per quintal in 2017-18 season. 

 

The MSP would yield returns of 63.2 percent over the weighted average A2+FL cost of production. The MSP of Raw Jute is expected to ensure appropriate minimum prices to the farmers and step up investment in Jute cultivation and thereby production and productivity in the country.

 

The increased MSP is based on recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) which while recommending MSP takes into account the cost of production, overall demand-supply, domestic and international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors and the likely impact of MSP on the rest of the economy.

 

The Jute Corporation of India would continue to act as Central Nodal Agency to undertake price support operations at the Minimum Support Prices in the Jute growing states.

Details:

(i)     This scheme will extend to all States and UTs of the Country and will also include institutions of rural local government in non-Part IX areas, where Panchayats do not exist, 

(ii)     The scheme will have both    Central Component - National Level activities including ""National Plan of Technical Assistance"", ""Mission Mode project on e-Panchayat"", ""Incentivization of Panchayats"" and State component - Capacity Building of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), 

(iii)    The Central Component will be fully funded by the Government of India. However, Centre:State funding pattern for State Component will be 60:40 for all States, except North East and Hill States where Centre:State funding pattern will be 90:10.  For all Union Territories (UTs) (with and without legislatures), the Central share will be 100%.

(iv)    The implementation and monitoring of the activities of the scheme will broadly be aligned for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with main thrust on Panchayats identified under Mission Antyodaya and 115 Aspirational districts as identified by NITI Aayog. 

(v)     The Scheme will converge capacity building initiatives of other Ministries with particular focus on those Ministries which will be impacted substantially by this Scheme, 

                    (vi)    Sunset date for RGSA will be 31.03.2030.

States/districts covered:

This scheme will extend to all States and UTs of the country and will also include institutions of rural local government in non-Part IX areas, where Panchayats do not exist.

Impact:

The approved scheme of RGSA will help more than 2.55 lakh Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) to develop governance capabilities to deliver on SDGs through inclusive local governance with focus on optimum utilisation of available resources. The key principles of SDGs, i.e. leaving no one behind, reaching the farthest first and universal coverage, along with gender equality will be embedded in the design of all capacity building interventions including trainings, training modules and materials. Priority will be given to subjects of national importance that affects the excluded groups the most, e.g. poverty, primary health services, nutrition, immunization, sanitation, education, water conservation, digital transactions etc. 

The scheme is designed keeping in view programmatic convergence with Mission Antyodaya GPs and 115 Aspirational districts as identified by NITI Aayog. As Panchayats have representation of Schedule Castes, Schedule Tribes and women, and are institutions closest to the grass­roots, strengthening Panchayats will promote equity and inclusiveness, along with Social Justice and economic development of the community.

Increased use of e-governance by PRIs will help achieve improved service delivery and transparency. The scheme will strengthen Gram Sabhas to function as effective institutions with social inclusion of citizens particularly the vulnerable groups. It will establish the institutional structure for capacity building of PRIs at the national, state and district level with adequate human resources and infrastructure. Panchayats will progressively be strengthened through incentivisation on the basis of nationally important criteria which will encourage competitive spirit among them.

Implementation strategy and targets:

The Central Government and the State Governments will take action for performing and completing the activities approved for their respective roles. The State Government will formulate their Annual Action Plans for seeking assistance from the Central Government as per their priorities and requirement. The scheme will be implemented in a demand driven mode.

Background:

The Finance Minister, in his budget speech for 2016-17, announced the launch of new restructured scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA), for developing governance capabilities of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A Committee under the Chairmanship of the Vice Chairman-NITI Aayog was constituted to restructure the existing scheme of this Ministry as Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan.

The Committee held several meetings, consultations etc. with various stakeholders and submitted its report with set of recommendations which were accepted by Government and formed the basis for the formulation of this scheme.

In his Budget Speech for 2017-18, the Finance Minister announced to undertake a Mission Antyodaya to bring one crore households out of poverty to make 50,000 Gram Panchayats poverty free. Accordingly, convergent action with Mission Antyodaya has been integrated into this scheme.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today gave its approval for issuing a notification amending clause 3(xiii) of the notification dated 03.11.2015 issued by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural gas under Section 12 of the Oil Fields (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 (ORD Act, 1948). 

 

Due to this amendment relaxation is granted under the Petroleum & Natural Gas Rules 1959 (PNG Rules, 1959), to Coal India Limited (CIL) and its subsidiaries for not applying for grant of license/lease under the PNG Rules, 1959 for extraction of Coal Bed Methane (CBM) under their Coal Bearing Areas.

 

Impact:

The decision is in line with the Government’s initiatives of ‘Ease of Doing Business’.  It will expedite the exploration and exploitation of CBM, enhance the availability of natural gas and reduce the gap in demand and supply of natural gas. The increased development activities for exploration and exploitation of CBM gas reserves in-and-around the block will generate economic activities which in turn has potential to create employment opportunities in CBM operations and in the industries.

 

Background:

Government of India has earlier issued a notification on 03.11:2015 granting rights to CIL and its subsidiaries for exploration and exploitation of CBM from all coal bearing areas for which they possess mining lease for coal. Clause 3(vi) of the Notification provides that the ""Lessee shall submit application under the P&NG Rules 1959 for grant of Mining Lease (ML) for CBM to MoP&NG along with detailed recommendations of Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL).""

Background:

The NRC Assam, the Register containing names of Indian Citizens in Assam, was prepared in 1951 as a non-statutory process by recording particulars of all the persons enumerated during 1951 Census. The Assam agitation (1979-85) against the illegal foreigners led to the signing of Assam Accord on 15th August 1985 between the Central Government, State Government, All India Students' Union (AASU) and All Assam GanSangramParishad (AAGSP), which stipulated 24th March, 1971 as the cut-off date for identification and deportation of illegal migrants from East Pakistan (Bangladesh). Accordingly, the Citizenship Act, 1955 was amended by inserting section 6A as special provisions for Assam.

In a tripartite meeting of the Central Government, State Government and AASU chaired by the Hon'ble Prime Minister in May, 2005, it was agreed to update NRC, 1951. The modalities were approved by the Government of India in consultation with the Government of Assam.

In pursuance of the Supreme Court's direction, the exercise of NRC update in Assam commenced in December 2013 to be completed over a period of three years. The Supreme Court is continuously monitoring the progress of NRC update and has given various directions from time to time.

Background: 

 

India is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of biodiversity, having 15 agro-climatic zones. Out of the 17000-18000 species of flowering plants, more than 7000 are estimated to have medicinal usage in folk and documented systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha & Homoeopathy (AYUSH System of Medicine). About 1178 species of medicinal plants are estimated to be in trade of which 242 species have annual consumption levels in excess of 100 metric tonnes/year. Medicinal plants are not only a major resource base for the traditional medicine & herbal industry but also provide livelihood and health security to a large segment of Indian population. There is global resurgence in traditional and alternative health care systems resulting in world herbal trade which stands at US$ 120 billion and is expected to reach US$ 7 trillion by 2050. Moreover, there are a large number of medicinal plants, particularly those found in tropical region, which are common to the two countries given similar geo-climatic factors.

 

Keeping in view the need for promotion and propagation of AYUSH systems, of medicine and Medicinal Plants Sector in Sao Tome and Principe, our standard draft MoU for country to country cooperation in field of Medicinal Plants was shared with the concerned authorities of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.

Venkaiah Naidu will be the chief guest at the function while Minister of State (I/C) for AYIJSH Shri Shripad Yesso Naik will preside. This day is observed to commemorate the birth anniversary of the founder of Homoeopathy Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann. Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha Dr. Manoj Rajoria and Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH Shri Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha will be the Guest of Honours.

The theme of this convention is ""Innovate: Evolve; Progress: Exploring Science since 40 years"". The delegates at the convention would include homoeopathic researchers, practitioners, students, industrialists as we all as representatives of various homoeopathic associations. Many reputed scientists and veterans of Homoeopathy will be the speakers at the event. Scientists from other allied sciences will also present their findings related to studies on Homoeopathy.

The Central Council for Research in Homeopathy (CCRH),is organising a scientific convention on the World Homoeopathy Day to pay tributes to Dr. Hahnemann, on his 263nd birth anniversary. AYUSH awards relating to Homoeopathy for Life Time Achievement, Best Teacher, Young Scientist and Best Research paper will be conferred on this occasion.

The Council's research activities during last 40 years have yielded reassuring results and carved out a future roadmap for the scientists working in the field of Homoeopathy. These will be showcased in an exclusive Exhibition to the delegates during the convention. 168 clinical researches, 40 basic researches, standardization studies of 348 drugs, proving of 112 drugs and clinical verification of 106 drugs have so far been accomplished by Council in the last 40 years. 55 Research proposals sanctioned under Extra-Mural Research Scheme were technically monitored. Studies on 5 epidemic diseases, namely dengue, malaria, chikungunya, influenza-like illness and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) have been undertaken, and new studies in these diseases, as well as in other epidemic diseases are planned. Council has also initiated the Short Term Studentship in Homoeopathy (STSH) Program with the vision to inculcate research aptitude among homeopathic undergraduates, under which 52 students have been awarded scholarships.

As a step forward, this year, Council is signing MoUs with PG Homoeopathic Colleges on this World Homoeopathy Day to support development of research infrastructure in an effort to link education with research. The vision behind the agreement would be to provide impetus to research infrastructure, which, in turn further orient the students towards research.

                The Chairman Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) & Secretary Department of Space, Dr K Sivan called on Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space Dr Jitendra Singh here today. During the meeting Dr. K Sivan briefed him about the upcoming Moon mission “Chandrayaan-2”, expected to be launched from Sriharikota around October-November this year. 

 

Giving details about the upcoming Chandrayaan-2 mission, Dr Sivan informed that the total cost of the mission is about Rs. 800 crore, which includes Rs. 200 crore as the cost of launching and Rs. 600 crore for the satellite. This cost, he said, is almost half of the launch cost if the same mission had to be launched from a foreign launching site. 

 

Chandrayaan-2 will be equipped with a lander and rover probe, which will descend on the surface of the moon, from where it will observe the lunar surface and send back data, which will be useful for analysis of the lunar soil.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh not only appreciated Chandrayaan-2 for being a cost-effective mission but also lauded it for being totally indigenous in its expertise, manufacturing and material, which makes it an appropriate example of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” Mantra. 

 

Another ISRO Mission, GSLV Mk III-D2, scheduled for June-July this year, also came up for discussion.

                In its forty third flight, ISRO’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle PSLV-C41 successfully launched the 1,425 kg IRNSS-1I Navigation Satellite today from Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota.

PSLV-C41 lifted off at 0404 hrs (4:04 am) IST, as planned, from the First Launch Pad.  After a flight lasting about 19 minutes, the vehicle achieved a Sub-Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit with a perigee (nearest point to earth) of 281.5 km and an apogee (farthest point to earth) of 20,730 km inclined at an angle of 19.2 degree to the equator following which IRNSS-1I separated from PSLV.

After separation, the solar panels of IRNSS-1I were deployed automatically. ISRO's Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan, Karnataka took over the control of the satellite. In the coming days, orbit manoeuvres will be performed from MCF to position the satellite at 55 deg East longitude in the planned Geosynchronous Orbit with an inclination of 29 deg to the equator.

IRNSS-1I is the latest member of the ‘Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC)’ system.  NavIC, also known as Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), is an independent regional navigation satellite system designed to provide position information in the Indian region and 1,500 km around the Indian mainland.

A number of ground facilities responsible for IRNSS satellite ranging and monitoring, generation and transmission of navigation parameters, satellite control, network timing, etc., have been established in many locations across the country as part of NavIC.

Till now, PSLV has successfully launched 52 Indian satellites and 237 customer satellites from abroad.

                As announced by the Prime Minister of India in the India-ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) Summit in October 2010, ISRO is pursuing a proposal to support Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries to receive and process data from Indian remote sensing satellites (RESOURCESAT-2 and OCEANSAT-2) and also to provide training in space science, technology and applications.

 

All the 10 members of ASEAN, viz., Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, will get benefitted from this project.

 

India pursues international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space with space agencies of 43 nations and 5 multilateral bodies. As part of this, ISRO keeps developing new products and services, jointly with partnering agencies, through joint missions, scientific instruments accommodation, data sharing and exchange of expertise. ISRO has built and launched ‘South AsiaSatellite’ on May 5, 2017 to provide satellite communication services to individual South Asian nations and also across the region. India participates in international disaster management mechanisms including International Charter ""Space and Major Disasters“, Sentinel Asia programme of Asia Pacific Regional Space Agency Forum (APRSAF), UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (UNESCAP) and UN Platform for Space based Information for Disaster management and Emergency Response (UNSPIDER). India, as a member of the International COSPAS-SARSAT system for search and rescue operations, provides distress alert and position location services to India and seven neighbouring countries. India has also been providing training programmes on space technology applications to officials from other countries.

 

This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, in written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.

                Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and Electricite de France (EDF) of France have on March 10, 2018 signed an Industrial Way Forward Agreement for implementation of six nuclear power reactor units at Jaitapur, Maharashtra with a total capacity of about 10,000 MW. The Evolutionary Pressurized Reactors (EPRs) are evolutionary reactors, whose design has evolved from “KONVOI’ and “N4’ reactors which have been in operation in Germany and France respectively for about two decades. Further, the work at Jaitapur will be commenced only on demonstration of full power operation of Flamanville-3 under construction in France, as reference plant, to have an operationally proven technology.       

There are currently four EPRs under construction viz. Olkiluoto-3 in Finland, Flamanville-3 in France and Taishan 1&2 in China. There have been reports that these reactors are delayed. There is delay in execution of the project and this is not attributable to the technology itself.

This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, in written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.

                Applications of nuclear energy and radiation have played a significant role in the field of electricity production, agriculture, medicine and health. Contributions of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) have made a positive impact on improvement in the treatment of disease and the quality of life of citizens in the country.

Electricity Generation:-

The total electricity generation from the Nuclear Power Plants during the last three years was 115292 Million Units. 

Agriculture:-

Using radiation induced mutagenesis technology, DAE has developed 42 varieties in oilseeds (groundnut, mustard, soybean and sunflower), pulses (urdbean, mungbean, Pigeonpea, cowpea), rice and jute, which have been released and notified for commercial cultivation across the country.

Government of India (Department of Atomic Energy) has set up two radiation technology demonstration units, one commissioned in the year 2000 for high dose irradiation at Vashi, Navi Mumbai, and another in 2002, for low dose irradiation, i.e. Krushi Utpadan Sanrakshan Kendra (KRUSHAK) facility at Lasalgaon near Nashik. The facilities are being operated by the Board of Radiation & Isotope Technology (BRIT). Two plants are also set up one each by Maharashtra government and Gujarat government. Currently, 15 irradiation plants including those in Private Sector are functional in the country carrying out radiation processing of agricultural/food products. Presently fruits like Mango and Pomegranate and vegetable like onions and garlic are being irradiated for shelf life extension.   

Medicine and Health:-

BRIT under DAE India is responsible for production and supply of Medical products linked to human health. The radioisotopes produced in nuclear reactors/ cyclotron is employed for medical applications. The nature of radiation emitted from the radioisotope determines its utility for diagnostic or therapeutic application. Under this category diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals are manufactured. 

Some of the Radiopharmaceuticals manufactured and supplied are:-


	99mTc-Technetium based radiopharmaceuticals: For diagnosing diseases related to all the important organs of the body comprising cerebral, myocardial, renal, liver, lung, etc. and for cancer detection. 



	18F-Fluorine based diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals: PET based products for diagnosis of cancer, cardiac and neuro diseases. 



	131I-Iodine based products for diagnosis and therapy of thyroid and related cancers.
	32P-Phosphorus, 153Sm-Samarium and 177Lu-Lutetium based Therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for relieving the cancer borne pain and cancer therapy.


Other than the above radiopharmaceuticals BRIT supplies 60Co (Cobalt) source for Bhabhatron Teletherapy unit used as radiation source for treatment of cancer. Also 125I based in vitro Radioimmunoassay kits for diagnosing the low concentrations of hormones, proteins, etc. present in blood are supplied.


	The nuclear share of electricity generation in the year 2016 in the country was about 3.4% and is comparable to China (3.6%) and Japan (2.2%).


In so far as medicine and health Sectors are concerned, around 220 Nuclear medicine centres are currently operational in India which employ above radioactive products for medical applications. However no such data is available for countries like China and Japan for direct comparison.   

(c)    In so far as electricity generation through nuclear technology is concerned, the government has taken several enabling steps to increase the nuclear power capacity and to provide adequate quantity of fuel. These include:

 


	Resolution of issues related to Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act & Creation of Indian Nuclear Insurance Pool (INIP).
	Accord of administrative approval and financial sanction of - ten (10) indigenous 700 MW Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) to be set up in fleet mode & two (02) units of Light Water Reactors (LWRs) to be set up in cooperation with Russian Federation.
	Amendment of the Atomic Energy Act to enable Joint Ventures of Public Sector Companies to set up nuclear power projects.
	Entering into enabling agreements with foreign countries for nuclear power cooperation including supply of fuel. 


In so far as Agriculture sector is concerned, Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MOFPI) grants subsidy to gamma radiation processing plants under SAMPADA (Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro-Processing Clusters) which are installed for gamma radiation processing of food products.

In so far as Health & Medicine sectors are concerned, the Government provides all impetus to the use of nuclear energy in health care by promoting Nuclear Medicine practices in the country. This is with respect to indigenous development of import substitutes and also providing cost-effective treatment. The medical cyclotron of Radiation Medicine Centre provides the PET imaging facility to patients at no cost.   Use of a Lutetium-177-labeled product (DOTA-TATE) for treatment of cancer patients having neuroendocrine cancer is 10-15 times less than the imported radiopharmaceutical (₹ 10,000 vs. ₹1,50,000).

                In Karnataka, State Election Machinery and Income Tax Department have stepped up their action against misuse of money in election and for the first time, teams with statutory powers and sufficient resources in terms of manpower, vehicles etc. have been posted in each district of the state.

Total cash seizure as on today ( 30.04.2018) is Rs.19.69 crores and the unexplained jewellery of value Rs.4.81 crores has been made by the Investigation Wing of Income Tax department in Karnataka after the start of the Assembly election related surveillance. 

In 2013, Karnataka State Assembly Elections, the total seizure made in the entire campaign period was only Rs 4.97 crore cash and Rs 3.41 crore worth of jewellery. It has been found that the bulk of cash seized during operations in the present Assembly Elections is has been meant for distribution.  

The Investigation Wing of the Income Tax Department has been doing intensive surveillance and monitoring activities in the State.  

The details of some of the major activities carried out by Income Tax department are as follows.

 

(A)       Searches conducted in Mysore on 24th April, 2018

 

1. Based on the intelligence, search & seizure operations were conducted on several government contractors between the 24th and 26th of April 18. This resulted in a seizure of unaccounted cash of Rs 6.76 crore from four such contractors in the Mysore area. The entire amount seized was in higher denomination notes i.e. Rs.2,000/- and Rs.500/- and the bulk of the seizure was made from lockers in benami names. The cash found and seized was not reflected in the books of account maintained by the contractors and they could not explain the source of the cash.

2.         Hoarding of huge stocks cash by these persons at a time when the election process is in progress and when cash shortages are reported in some areas in the state raises troubling questions. 

 

(B)       Bangalore, Davangere & Mysore cases on 26th April, 2018 to 28th April, 2018

 

1.         Based on the specific intelligence that cash is hoarded by Government contractors for being used for election purposes, search action has been initiated in the cases of 3 contractors in Bangalore, Davangere and Mysore on 26/04/2018 and were concluded on 28.04.2018. 

2.         Unaccounted cash of Rs. 4.08 crores and unexplained gold jewellery of 2.79 Crores worth were seized. In one of the contractor's case, cash of Rs. 1.2 crores was found in a moving car.

3.         During the search evidences have been recovered showing inflation of purchases, bogus sub-contractor and labour payments and unaccounted cash payments. The searched party admitted additional income of Rs.74.39 crores.

 

(C)       Searches conducted in Bangalore on 28.04.2018 & 29.04.2018

 


	Based on the intelligence inputs that one person was funding certain candidates of a particular party, a search was conducted at 2 business premises and 1 residence, which continued for 32 hours and resulted in seizure of Rs. 3.18 Crs of cash, concluded on early hours of 29th April. 
	Cash of Rs.2.00 crores was found in a car parked closed to the main persons residence, which was found by the department after causing the thorough rummaging of the persons premises and belongings. 


 

(D)       Searches conducted at Khanapur, Hubballi and Bangalore on 28th & 29th April, 2018

 

1.         Searches were conducted on a candidate who is contesting on a party ticket based on verification of the affidavit filed by him, specific intelligence about the cash transactions and other particulars.

2.         It was found that the contesting candidate is a non – filer since AY 2012-13 onwards. However, in his election affidavit he has declared some income and put a remark that online filing of return has been blocked by Income Tax Department so he could not file his return and has paid Self Assessment Tax. 

There is no such thing like blocking the filing of return. Also, there are substantial discrepancies between income declared by his wife in her return of income filed, declared in affidavit and actually detected during the search.

4.         He accepted that five Properties (out of which 3 are General Power of Attorneys and 2 are purchased Properties) of his family members have not been declared in the election affidavit.

5.         During the search it was found that he and his family members have not declared their income out of real estate business and Joint Development Agreements. The income detected and now being declared by him and his family members is Approx. Rs.18.00 crores for various Assessment Years, including he himself, his wife and two sons. He has most of the business activities in family member’s name only.

6.         Issues like valuation of properties which he claimed to be valued at Rs.191.00 crores are under investigation.

                            The Election Commission of India organized a 3-day Training and Certification Programme for State Level Master Trainers (SLMTs) from April 19-21, 2018 at New Delhi. About 280 SLMTs from across the country attended the training, who in turn would deliver cascaded training to various functionaries in the States/UTs and would also conduct certification course for Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) and Assistant Electoral Registration Officers (AEROs). 



Launch of ‘Handbook for ERO and AERO Certification’ at the programme

The Chief Election Commissioner of India Shri O. P. Rawat recalled the time when India got its first electoral roll after independence. He said that the preparation of India’s first electoral roll was a humungous and complex task. However, the election machinery, with their efforts, made it possible to hold the first election during 1951-52. Shri Rawat urged the participants to continue the tradition of working diligently in conduct of elections. He added that elections could further be improved with better electoral roll management. Shri Rawat urged the participants to create an atmosphere of motivation and increased participation in training of EROs and AEROs and other officers in the field. 

Election Commissioner Shri Sunil Arora said that in election management, electoral roll is akin to foundation of an institution. Shri Arora made special mention on motivating field-level officers to achieve greater participation and deeper understanding of the subjects and procedures. Talking about use of technology in elections, Shri Arora said that ethical issues are of concern in Information Technology, and asked the participants to keep a check on the malpractice. Shri Arora hoped that the 3-day training programme would be an immense learning experience for all participants.

Election Commissioner Shri Ashok Lavasa said that importance should be given to procedures and systems, which are two of the most important factors in making elections a success. Shri Lavasa said that preparing for elections is as difficult a task as conducting elections, thus equal importance should be given to non-election period as well in election management. Referring to concerns over ethics in use of technology, he said that morals of human beings cannot be substituted. 

Senior Deputy Election Commissioner Mr. Umesh Sinha called electoral roll management as the foundation to poll management. Thus, it is necessary that electoral roll is clean and healthy. Given the dynamic population of India, Mr. Sinha said that electoral roll management should be a continuous process. Citing IT as a big enabler, Mr. Sinha urged the participants to use the ERO-NET platform gainfully. 

Deputy Election Commissioner Mr. Sandeep Saxena explained the different methodologies to the participants to make electoral roll more transparent and credible. He presented a number of facts and figures that could help in improving electoral rolls. Mr. Saxena expressed his gratitude to the Commission for their constant guidance and to senior ECI officers for bringing in technology in electoral roll management. 

Deputy Election Commissioner Mr. Sudeep Jain said that there was a felt need to train election officers since they perform election duties in addition to their primary work. Realizing the need for a structured training, ECI started with a certification programme for returning officers in 2016 which received a positive feedback. He expressed his pleasure to see the programme being extended for EROs and AEROs.

The programme also saw the launch of ‘Handbook for ERO and AERO Certification’ by the Commission. The participants were handed out Certificates for successful completion of the threeday training workshop. The interactive sessions at the workshop were much appreciated by the EROs and AEROs. Suggestions have been invited from the participants to make ERO Net more effective. Two best entries would be awarded at the next National Voters Day function held every year on the 25th of January.

                           The India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM) organized a 2-day Consultative Workshop for the Delegation from the Central Election Commission (CEC) of Kazakhstan from April 16-17, 2018 at Nirvachan Sadan, Election Commission of India, New Delhi. The six-member delegation comprised of the Vice-Chairman of CEC, Kazakhstan and other Senior Officials. The workshop aimed to hold interactive discussions on the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) & Role of IT and Conduct of Training Programme. 



Delegates from CEC, Kazakhstan at the Consultative Workshop

The Chief Election Commissioner of India Shri O. P. Rawat talked about the Indian EVM which is being used for the past 20 years in the Indian elections. Shri Rawat said that EVM is a unique voting machine and has multiple features which bring transparency in elections. Yet, there are times when people raise questions on its credibility. To clear all possible doubts, the Election Commission makes constant efforts and goes out of the way to address the concerns. In wake of the upcoming state legislative elections in Karnataka, the Commission is inviting the public to have a hands-on demonstration of EVM & VVPAT. Shri Rawat explained to the participants the features and advantages VVPAT, or Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail, in making the election process transparent for the voter. Shri Rawat also invited the delegation to have a Memorandum of Understanding with ECI and IIIDEM for collaborating in the field of election management.

The Election Commissioner Shri Ashok Lavasa said that exchange of ideas between different countries is extremely beneficial for all of us in working towards the objective of strengthening our democracies. Shri Lavasa said that in the last two centuries, democracy has found roots in countries around the world. During the same time, technology has also grown manifold.  It is, thus, important to understand how technology can be used to strengthen democracy. Shri Lavasa added that in a country like India, about 11 million persons are deployed for conduct of elections and all of them undergo training to be equipped to handle the dynamics of elections.  

Deputy Election Commissioner Mr. Sudeep Jain said that during the rollout of EVMs, the Election Commission faced a number of challenges but always overcame them. Today, the EVM has been fully accepted by the 80-plus million electors of India. Mr. Jain told the participants that the current workshop would talk about the various forms of electoral technology being used to continuously improve the election processes in India. He hoped that the ECI would be able to learn from the challenges faced by CEC, Kazakhstan, and be able to address the same. Mr. Jain added that IIIDEM, so far, has conducted international training programmes for 83-plus countries across the world.

Mr. Konstantin Petrov, Vice-Chairman of the CEC, Kazakhstan, said that the delegation was visiting the ECI for the first time to understand challenges that India faces in its elections, on the use of Indian EVM, and to share their country experiences. Mr. Petrov told the Commission that Kazakhstan is in the process of introducing IT in elections and is also considering the use of electronic machine technology. Ms. Sabila Mustafina, Secretary, Kazakhstan, said that the delegation hoped to learn the various aspects of conducting training programmes on elections and voting.

Senior Advisor at IIIDEM Dr. Bhagbanprakash extended a warm welcome to the participants and urged them to actively participate in the discussions and knowledge sharing exercises. He said that the workshop has been divided into two days wherein the first day would cater to the use of EVM & technology in elections while the second day would focus on capacity building for training programmes.

Electoral Expert at IIIDEM Dr. Noor Mohammad briefed the participants on the schedule of the 2-day workshop. The key topics of the programme included challenges in electoral technologies, online voter registration, transmission of results, apps and electoral services, electoral capacity building, training of trainers and facilitators, among others. Dr. Mohammad said that the training would readily accept recommendations from participants on similar topics which may have been left out in the programme.

Mr. Vivek Khare, Director (Training), ECI, gave a vote of thanks to the delegation from Kazakhstan, the Commission, and senior officials of ECI and the IIIDEM staff. He looked forward to a fruitful interaction for a greater learning experience.

ORDER

 

At the time of General Elections to the Lok Sabha in 1998, a new initiative for State funding of recognized political parties through free use of the State owned Television and Radio was introduced under directions of the Commission vide its Order, dated 16th January, 1998. The said scheme was subsequently extended in all the General Elections to the State Assemblies held after 1998 and General Elections to the Lok Sabha in 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014.

           

With the amendments to the Representation of People Act, 1951 vide ""Election and Other Related Laws (Amendment) Act, 2003"" and the rules notified thereunder, equitable time sharing for campaigning by recognized political parties on electronic media now has statutory basis. In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (a) of the Explanation below section 39A of the Representation of People Act, 1951, the Central Government has notified all such broadcasting media which are owned or controlled or financed wholly or substantially by funds provided to them by the Central Government as the electronic media for the purposes of that section. Therefore, the Commission has decided to extend the said scheme of equitable time sharing on electronic media through Prasar Bharati Corporation to the ensuing General Election to the State Legislative Assembly of Karnataka -2018.

           

The facilities of use of broadcast time and telecast time will be available only to ‘National Parties’ and ‘Recognized State Parties’ in respect of Karnataka.

2.  A base time of 45 minutes will be given to each National Party and Recognized State Party (recognized in respect of Karnataka) uniformly on the Regional Kendras of Doordarshan network and All India Radio network in the Karnataka States.

 

3.  The additional time to be allotted to the party has been decided on the basis of the poll performance of the party in the last assembly election in the Karnataka State.

 

4.   In a single session of broadcast, no party will be allocated more than 15 minutes.

 

Date of Telecast/Broadcast:

 

5.  The period of broadcast and telecast will be between the last date of filing the nominations and two days before the date of poll in the Karnataka States.

 

6.  The Prasar Bharati Corporation in consultation with the Commission will decide the actual date and time for broadcast and telecast. This will be subject to the broad technical constraints governing the actual time of transmission available with the Doordarshan and All India Radio.

7.  The guidelines prescribed by the Commission for telecast and broadcast will be strictly followed. The parties will be required to submit transcripts and recording in advance. The parties can get this recorded at their own cost in studios, which meet the technical standards prescribed by the Prasar Bharati Corporation or at the Doordarshan/All India Radio Kendra. They can, in the alternative, have these recorded in the studios of Doordarshan and All India Radio by advance requests. In such cases, the recordings may be done at the State Capital and at timings indicated by Doordarshan/All India Radio in advance.

                In January, 2018, the Commission, in the wake of expansion and diversity of media platforms and to address the challenges in regulation and control on the display of ‘election matter’ during the period of last 48 hours, as provided in Sec. 126 of RPA 1951, constituted a high level Committee. Apart from senior officers from ECI one representative each from M/o Information & Broadcasting, M/o Law & Justice, M/o Electronics and IT, Press Council of India and News Broadcasters Association are also the members of this Committee.

The Committee will study and examine the present provisions of Section 126 and other related Sections of the R. P. Act, 1951 and identify difficulties/critical gaps to regulate the violation of the said provisions of the act, particularly during the prohibitory period of 48 hours and suggest necessary amendment/modification.

As soon as the Committee submits its report, the Commission will consider it and forward to the Ministry of Law & Justice, Govt. of India for making necessary amendments/modifications in the present provisions of Section 126 and other related Sections of the R. P. Act, 1951 

During this time, all present provisions provided in the R. P. Act, 1951 shall prevail and binding for all. Therefore, guidelines issued vide Commission’s Press Note No. ECI/PN/27/2018 dt. 3rd April, 2018 (details below) should be observed in letter & sprit in all the media coverage during the ongoing Karnataka Assembly Election. 

 

Details:

The schedule for calling general election to the Legislative Assembly of Karnataka has been announced on 27.03.2018. Poll is scheduled to be held in single phase on 12.05.2018. Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, prohibits displaying any election matter by means, inter alia, of television or similar apparatus, during the period of 48 hours before the hour fixed for conclusion of poll in a constituency. The relevant portions of the said Section 126 are re- produced below: -

(126. Prohibition of public meeting during period of forty-eight hours ending with hour fixed for conclusion of poll-

(1)  No person shall –

(a) ………………….                                           

(b)  Display to the public any election matter by means of cinematograph, television or other similar apparatus;

(c) ……………………. 

In any polling area during the period of forty-eight hours ending with the hour fixed for the conclusion of the poll for any election in the polling area.

(2)   Any person who contravenes the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.

(3)   In this Section, the expression “election mater” means any matter intended or calculated to influence or affect the result of an election.)

During elections, there are sometimes allegations of violation of the provisions of the above Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by TV channels in the telecast of their panel discussions/debates and other news and current affairs programmes. As above mentioned the said Section 126 prohibits displaying any election matter by means, inter alia, of television or similar apparatus, during the period of 48 hours ending with the hour fixed for conclusion of poll in a constituency. “Election matter” has been defined in that Section as any matter intended or calculated to influence or affect the result of an election. Violation of the aforesaid provisions of Section 126 is punishable with imprisonment upto a period of two years, or with fine or both.

The Commission once again reiterates that the TV/Radio channels and cable networks should ensure that the contents of the programme telecast/broadcast/displayed by them during the period of 48 hours referred to in Section 126 do not contain any material, including views/appeals by panelists/participants that may be construed as promoting/prejudicing the prospect of any particular party or candidate(s) or influencing/affecting the result of the election. This shall, among other things include display of result of any opinion poll and of standard debates, analysis, visuals and sound-bytes.

In this connection, attention is also invited to Section 126A of the R.P. Act 1951, which prohibits conduct of Exit poll and dissemination of their results during the period reckoned from the commencement of polls and half an hour after the close of poll in the state.

During the period not covered by Section 126 or Section 126A, concerned TV/Radio/Cable/FM channels are free to approach the state/district/local authorities for necessary permission for conducting any broadcast related events which must also conform to the provisions of the model code of conduct and the programme code laid down by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting under the Cable Network (Regulation) Act with regard to decency, maintenance of communal harmony, etc. They are also required to stay within the provisions of Commission’s guidelines dated 27th August, 2012 regarding paid news and related matters. Concerned Chief Electoral Officer/District Election Officer will take into account all relevant aspects including the law and order situation while extending such permission. As regards political advertisements, the same needs pre-telecast/broadcast certification by the Committees set up at the State/District level as per the Commission’s order No. 509/75/2004/JS-I dt 15.04.2004.

Attention of all print media is also drawn to the following guidelines issued by Press Council of India on 30.07.2010 to be followed for observance during the election: 

(i)        It will be the duty of the Press to give objective reports about elections and the candidates. The newspapers are not expected to indulge in unhealthy election campaigns, exaggerated reports about any candidate/party or incident during the elections. In practice, two or three closely contesting candidates attract all the media attention. While reporting on the actual campaign, a newspaper may not leave out any important point raised by a candidate and make an attack on his or her opponent.

(ii)       Election campaign along communal or caste lines is banned under the election rules. Hence, the Press should eschew reports, which tend to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between people on the ground of religion, race, caste, community or language.

(iii)      The Press should refrain from publishing false or critical statements in regard to the personal character and conduct of any candidate or in relation to the candidature or withdrawal of any candidate or his candidature, to prejudice the prospects of that candidate in the elections. The Press shall not publish unverified allegations against any candidate/party.

(iv)      The Press shall not accept any kind of inducement, financial or otherwise, to project a candidate/party. It shall not accept hospitality or other facilities offered to them by or on behalf of any candidate/party.

(v)       The Press is not expected to indulge in canvassing of a particular candidate/party. If it does, it shall allow the right of reply to the other candidate/party.

(vi)      The Press shall not accept/publish any advertisement at the cost of public exchequer regarding achievements of a party/government in power.

(vii)     The Press shall observe all the directions/orders/instructions of the Election Commission/Returning Officers or Chief Electoral Officer issued from time to time.

                National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED) reeling under financial distress and massive debt of its lender banks till recently, has made an impressive turn around with  record profit for the financial year 2017-18. This has enabled the Federation to contribute Rs. 220 Crore as cash payment to its lender banks towards part fulfillment of its One Time Settlement amount of Rs. 478 Crore.

 

Nafed had signed the Debt Settlement Deed on 27th March, 2018 at its Headquarter at New Delhi. Central Bank of India was the lead bank, representing all eight lender banks. This journey of Nafed from a period of acute financial crisis, staring at imminent closure to the present when it has reported record profit and wiped out its liabilities to its lender banks as well other high value creditors, has been quite arduous. Several efforts and schemes were drawn for the financial revival of the federation, whose role is very vital for implementation of Price Support Scheme of Oilseeds, Pulses and Copra as well regulating the prices of perishables. Finally, the One Time Settlement worked out on 27th January, 2016, saw the light of the day. 

 

The federation had organized a Thank Giving Function at Dr. Ambedkar International Centre, 15, Janpath, New Delhi, yesterday evening to express its sincere thanks and gratitude to Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Union Agriculture Minister, several Departments of the Govt. of India, the lender banks and State Governments for their support. 

 

Union Agriculture Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh, was the Chief Guest. Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Union Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas alongwith Shri Parshottam Rupala, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Ministers of State for Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare were present. A host of senior Govt. of India Officials, State Governments, National Cooperative Bodies, State Cooperative Bodies, Banks, Niti Aayog and the Members of the Board of Directors of Nafed, ex-Managing Directors, retired employees of the federation, etc. were present.

Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Guest Shri Radha Mohan Singh complemented Nafed and lender banks for implementing the One Time Settlement. Shri Singh lauded the efforts of the federation in making record procurement of Pulses and Oilseeds under Price Support Scheme of Govt. of India, thereby earning substantial business income for the federation as well service to the farmers and further called upon the Management of Nafed to continue its efforts for the service of the farmers as well to introduce transparent mechanism of the procurement and disposal of the commodities being procured on behalf of Govt. of India. 

 

Recalling the genesis of the crisis which had engulfed the federation, Union Agriculture Minister mentioned that Nafed without proper security had been distributing financial assistance to the private parties during the year 2003-07. The money was never returned by the private parties to Nafed, leading to defaults to banks. Shri Singh mentioned that a common borrower is put through lot of check and appraisal before he/she is granted personal loan but here was the case in which no financial rules and regulations were followed. Shri Singh cautioned the present Management to be careful in discharge of their functions so that there is no repetition of such instances. There shall be no second opportunity for the Federation if its affairs and working is not transparent and above board. He called upon the Management to induct professionals in its system as they will properly guide and steer the federation to greater heights.

 

Criticizing the UPA regime, Shri Singh said that the previous government was bent upon closing this organization by taking policy decisions which were anti-farmer. The capping of losses to 15% in case of PSS was suicidal, as there will be no procurement within defined percentage. He said that the present government is reimbursing losses as per the actual. Further, he criticized the UPA Government for reducing the government guarantee of Nafed to tune of Rs. 261 Crore, when the Present government is giving guarantee of Rs. 42000 Crore to Nafed to serve the farmers. This shows the deep commitment of the government for the service of the farmers.

                The agriculture and food security of the nation will continue to be sustainable in the coming years and we will be successful in doubling farmers’ income in the stipulated time frame. This was stated by the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh at the National Kharif Conference 2018 at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi today. 

Shri Singh asserted that the credit for ensuring the nation’s food security goes to the farmers. Today, India is not only self-dependent but also an exporter of many agricultural products. It is also true that farmers do not get fair value of their produce; therefore an all-round development of the agriculture sector is needed to ensure the stock of food and agriculture product; and enhance farmers’ income. The aim of the government is to make agriculture policy and programs 'income-oriented' rather than 'production-oriented'. To achieve this ambitious objective, the government is encouraging the adoption of 'multi-dimensional seven-point' strategy suggested by Hon'ble Prime Minister, which includes-


	Emphasis on irrigation along with end to end solution on creation of resources for ‘More crop per drop'. 
	Provision of quality seeds and nutrients according to the soil quality of each farm.
	Large investments in warehouses and cold chains to prevent Post-harvest losses.
	Promotion of value addition through food processing.
	Implementation of National Agricultural Markets and e-platforms (e-NAM) to eliminate shortcomings of all the 585 centers.
	To mitigate the risk, introduction of crop insurance scheme at a lower cost.
	Promotion of allied activities such as Dairy-Animal husbandry, Poultry, Bee-keeping, Har Medh Per Ped, Horticulture, and Fisheries.


Shri Singh said the need of the hour is full cooperation of State Governments so that all efforts of the Central Government reach and benefit farmers. The Minister appealed to officials from States to properly implement the schemes/missions in their state. Farmers must be encouraged to participate in large numbers in the ongoing Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan, in which every block will organize Kisan Kalyan Karyashala on May 2, 2018 in which farmers from that block will participate. Agriculture officers and scientists will discuss ways to increase income through new technology and progressive farmers will also narrate their success stories.

The Minister informed that National Bamboo Mission has been announced in budget 2018-19 for the overall development of bamboo as a supplement of agricultural income. This would help increase the income of farmers. For the development of dairy and fisheries, programs like National Dairy Plan-1 (NDP-1), National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD) and Dairy Entrepreneurship Development Scheme (DEDS) and Blue Revolution are being implemented and farmers are taking advantage of it.

The Minister further said that the main goal of the government is not only to identify potential areas of agriculture where more investment needs to be made but also to enhance income by diversification into horticulture and animal husbandry and fisheries and suggest ways to reduce risks. In order to achieve the goal of doubling farmers’ income, the Agriculture Ministry has been continuously working to reduce the cost of farming; increase production through better productivity; ensuring profitable returns and risk management given the uncertainty of weather. 

To ensure better productivity, schemes such as National Food Security Mission, Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm, Rashtriya Gokul Mission, National Livestock Mission, Blue Revolution etc. are being run. Similarly, to reduce the cost of farming, Soil Health Card, use of neem-coated urea and more crop per drop etc are being implemented successfully. For a profitable income source, e-NAM, cold storage, storage facility at concessional rate of interest, post-harvest credit facility, increase in base MSP etc are being emphasized. For adoption of risk management and sustainable practices, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and organic farming mission for north east are being implemented.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for the increase in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Raw Jute for 2018-19 season.

 

The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Fair Average Quality (FAQ) of Raw Jute has been increased to Rs.3700/- per quintal for 2018-19 season from Rs. 3500/- per quintal in 2017-18 season.

 

The MSP would yield returns of 63.2 percent over the weighted average A2+FL cost of production. The MSP of Raw Jute is expected to ensure appropriate minimum prices to the farmers and step up investment in Jute cultivation and thereby production and productivity in the country.

 

The increased MSP is based on recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) which while recommending MSP takes into account the cost of production, overall demand-supply, domestic and international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors and the likely impact of MSP on the rest of the economy.

 

The Jute Corporation of India would continue to act as Central Nodal Agency to undertake price support operations at the Minimum Support Prices in the Jute growing states.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today has approvedCentrally Sponsored Scheme of National Bamboo Mission (NBM) under National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) during remaining period of Fourteenth Finance Commission (2018-19 & 2019-20).  The Mission would ensure holistic development of the bamboo sector by addressing complete value chain and establishing effective linkage of producers (farmers) with industry.

 

CCEA has also approved Empowerment of Executive Committee for formulation of guidelines of the NBM and to make the changes therein, including cost norms for various interventions from time-to-time as per the felt needs and specific recommendations of States, with the approval of Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.

 

Expenditure:

An outlay of Rs.1290 crore (with Rs. 950 crore as Central share) is provisioned for implementation of the Mission during the remaining period of 14th Finance Commission (2018-19 and 2019-20).

 

Beneficiaries:

The scheme will benefit directly and indirectly the farmers as well as local artisans and associated personnels engaged in bamboo sector including associated industries. Since it is proposed to bring about one lakh ha area under plantation, it is expected that about one lakh farmers would be directly benefitted  in terms of plantation.

 

States/ districts covered:

The Mission will focus on development of bamboo in limited States where it has social, commercial and economical advantage, particularly in the North Eastern region and States including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

The Mission is expected to establish about 4000 treatment/ product development units and bring more than 100000 ha area under plantation.

 

Impact:

Bamboo plantation will contribute to optimizing farm productivity and income thereby enhancing livelihood opportunities of small & marginal farmers including landless and women as well as provide quality material to industry. Thus, the Mission will not only serve as a potential instrument for enhancing income of farmers but also contributing towards climate resilience and environmental benefits. The Mission will also help in creating employment generation directly or indirectly in both skilled and unskilled segments.

 

Details:

 

          The restructured NBM strives to - 

(i)      To increase the area under bamboo plantation in non forest Government and private lands to supplement farm income and contribute towards resilience to climate change.

(ii)    To improve post-harvest management through establishment of innovative primary processing units, treatment and seasoning plants, primary treatment and seasoning plants, preservation technologies and market infrastructure.

(iii)   To promote product development at micro, small and medium levels and feed bigger industry.

(iv)   To rejuvenate the under developed bamboo industry in India.

(v)    To promote skill development, capacity building, awareness generation for development of bamboo sector.

 

Implementation strategy and targets:

The following steps would be adopted for the development of bamboo sector:

I.     The Mission will focus on development of bamboo in limited States where it has social, commercial and economical advantage with focus on genetically superior planting material of bamboo species of commercial and industrial demand.

II.     Adoption of end to end solution in bamboo sector i.e. complete value chain approach starting from bamboo growers to consumers would be emphasized.

III.    Mission has been developed as a platform for integration of Ministries/ Departments/Agencies with implementation responsibilities given based on their mandate.

IV.   Capacity building of the officials, field functionaries, entrepreneurs and farmers through skill development and trainings will be emphasised.

V.   Focus will be given on Research & Development (R&D) to increase the production and productivity of bamboo.

 

Background:

National Bamboo Mission (NBM) started as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme in 2006-07, was mainly emphasizing on propagation and cultivation of bamboo, with limited efforts on processing, product development and value addition. There, was weak linkage between the producers (farmers) and the industry. The restructured proposal gives simultaneous emphasis to propagation of quality plantations of bamboo, product development and value addition including primary processing and treatment; micro, small & medium enterprises as well as high value products; markets and skill development, thus addressing the complete value chain for growth of the bamboo sector.

 

Details and progress of scheme if already running:

National Bamboo Mission (NBM) was initially started as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme in 2006-07 and was subsumed under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) during 2014-15 and continued till 2015-16. Funds were released thereafter only for maintenance of bamboo plantations raised earlier under NBM, and no new work or annual action plan was initiated. Since 2006-07, an area of 3.62 lakh ha covered under bamboo plantations and 39 bamboo wholesale markets, 40 bamboo bazaars and 29 retail outlets were set up.

                Minister of State for Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Shipping and Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya, while giving a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today on steps taken/being taken by the Government to bring transparency in fixing prices of essential/lifesaving medicines across the country, informed that the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) fixes the prices of Scheduled medicines and new drugs as per the provisions of Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013).

The Minister said that the NPPA monitors the prices of medicines fixed by the manufacturers and issues notices for the violation of the prices. It verifies the prices of medicines randomly from the respective websites of the drug manufacturing companies and wherever any violation is found, action is taken as per the provisions of DPCO, 2013. This is an ongoing process. The details of demand notices issued in the last three years are as follows:

The Minister further informed that in order to have transparency, a draft version of the Price Calculation Sheets for the proposed revised price notifications, including wherever applicable, the Price to Retailer (PTR) and Moving Annual Turnover (MAT) values adopted for calculations, is uploaded on the website of NPPA for 10 clear working days to invite comments from the affected pharmaceutical firms. Only after taking into account the comments or any additional data thus received within the given time period, the NPPA finalizes the ceiling and the retail Prices. Thus the entire procedure of price fixation is available in the public domain which ensures transparency and accountability of the whole process.

Shri Mandaviya, while giving a written reply to a separate question in Lok Sabha today on action taken by the Government to check overcharging by pharmaceutical companies, informed that since inception of NPPA till February 2018, 1763 demand notices (including suo-moto deposits) have been issued to pharmaceutical companies for their having overcharged patients on the sale of formulations at prices above the ceiling price notified by NPPA. Amount to the tune of Rs. 827.25 crore has been recovered from the companies to the Government in overcharging cases. The detailed list of overcharging cases where demand notices have been issued is available on NPPA website www.nppaindia.nic.in, Shri Mandaviya added.

When Goa will have two airports passenger handling capacity will increase to 3 crores, he further added. 

Under the Skill Development and Startup India initiative, Civil Aviation Ministry is in talks with the representatives of World Bank and other major institutions to promote Goa as a market destination, informed Shri Prabhu. Major Airlines like Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa Airlines are interested to be part of market destinations in India. There is a huge job requirement in civil aviation ministry and other sectors also. These initiatives are imperative in the overall development of the State.

                The maiden flight from Delhi to Pathankot was inaugurated at a function at Terminal 3, IGI Airport, New Delhi by Sh. Suresh Prabhu, Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation in the presence of Sh. Vijay Sampla, Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, here today. With this, Pathankot now gets operationalized as the 21st Airport under UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) – RCS (Regional Connectivity Scheme). Airports Authority of India (AAI) is the implementing agency of UDAN.

Alliance Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India, commenced operations on the Delhi-Pathankot route today with ATR aircraft. The flight from Delhi to Pathankot will operate on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, departing Delhi at 0955 Hrs. and arriving at Pathankot at 1130 Hrs. On its return from Pathankot, the flight will depart at 1150 Hrs. and arrive at Delhi at 1335 Hrs. With the introduction of this flight the travel time between the two cities will reduce significantly.    

This will be the 19th route operated by Alliance Air under UDAN. The Scheme was launched on 27th April 2017 by the Hon’ble Prime Minister when the first UDAN flight, operated by Alliance Air, was flagged off on the Shimla – Delhi route.    

Alliance Air has been a front-runner in regional connectivity and presently operates a network of 49 stations. Alliance Air continues to focus on new routes to connect regional destinations. The airline has been awarded 18 new routes under UDAN-II, which are being launched progressively this year bringing new destinations on India’s air map.

Through its codeshare with Air India, Alliance Air not only provides regional connectivity within the country but also offers seamless connectivity to regional passengers on Air India’s network in India and abroad.

                Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) is committed to the building of airport capacity as part of its NABH (NextGen Airports for BHarat) Nirman initiative. Three key aspects of NABH Nirman are (1) fair and equitable land acquisition, (2) long-term master plan for airport and regional development and (3) balanced economics for all stakeholders. As part of NABH Nirman, MoCAcalled a meeting of all stakeholders to review the progress of setting up of Noida International Greenfield Airport at Jewar.

Fair and equitable land acquisition

Noida International Greenfield Airport is strategically located in respect of road distance about 72 km from IGI Airport, about 40 km from Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad, about 28 km from Greater Noida, 65 km from Gurugram and 130 km from Agra. It is well connected via Yamuna Expressway that will serve domestic and international tourists to reach Agra, Mathura and Vrindavan.  

MoCAhadgranted site clearance on July 06, 2017. The U. P. Government appointed Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) as the implementing agency on its behalf in October 2017. YEIDA obtained a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Defence on January 11, 2018.  To expedite the implementation of Airport project, a Project Monitoring and Implementation Committee (PMIC) has been constituted on March 27, 2018.

Landmeasuring 5,000 hectares (ha) has been identified by YEIDA for the project, out of which 240 ha. belongs to the State Govt and rest is with private owners. The first phase of acquisition of land measuring 1,327 ha.for construction of Terminal buildings and Runways is expected tobe initiated in the month of June, 2018by the YEIDA for necessary arrangements have been made. 

Long-term master plan for airport and regional development 

Airports are gateways of global connectivity and form the corner stone of creating strategic economic hubs. Development of an airport leads to construction of commercial and residential real estate closer to the airport and can transform the economic geography of the region. A well-designed aero-city around an airport can become an economic engine in and of itself. 

It was decided that the planning for the airport will take into account holistic planning of the urban area around the airport. Intra and inter-city connectivity with various modes of transport (linkages with the existing Delhi airport, Railways, metro, buses, autos, private vehicle connectivity, etc.) were identified to bring down cost and time involved for passenger and freight movement.

Balanced economics for all stakeholders 

The airport is to be developed on Public Private Partnership model (PPP). A detailed discussion was held on the financial viability of the airport and various models of awarding the PPP concession were deliberated upon. The State government and YEIDA assured that funds for land acquisition are availableand the process is expected to proceed smoothly.  

Stakeholders and conclusion

The meeting was attended by Shri Suresh Prabhu, Hon’ble Minister for Civil Aviation, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Hon’ble Minister of State for Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Shri Jayant Sinha, Hon’ble Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Shri R N Choubey, Secretary Ministry of Civil Aviation, Shri Prabhat Kumar, Chairman, YEIDA and other senior officials of the Central and the State government.

In the meeting, timelines have been fixed for various activities and responsibilities assigned. The UP government is planning to lay the foundation stone of Phase 1 of the project by October 2018.

                The Central Trade Unions of Coal India Limited (CIL) the Maharatna coal mining behemoth served notice to go on a one-day strike on 16th April protesting against the commercial coal mining.

In a bid to ward off the strike Hon’ble Union Minister of Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal invited the four trade unions BMS, HMS, AITUC and CITU for a meeting in Mumbai where their apprehensions were dispelled in a proper perspective.

Subsequently a next round of meeting was held with Secretary (Coal) as a result of which the four trade unions agreed to call off the strike in principle. In fact, BMS and HMS inked their pact to steer clear off the strike. Though AITUC did not formalize their consent through signature, nevertheless they agreed to back off the strike.

CITU was the lone union to head off and called for a protest day against the commercial mining.

To ensure no loss to production and off-take Coal India management made elaborate arrangements and a multi-pronged plan was put into action at all mines of CIL viz...

 

(a) To maintain peace and thwart any disruption of mining activities all the subsidiary companies geared up by setting up videography and photography arrangement at mine level to identify the persons taking part in the strike. This move paid result as it dissuaded the agitators to force any stoppage of work and sit on dharna 

(b) Officers of CIL and subsidiaries maintained a round the clock vigile at production units to monitor the situation.

(c)   Law and Order machinery worked in tandem with CIL authorities to ensure peace and running of usual operations. 

(d) It was informed to all concerned that any unlawful activity would be dealt with disciplinary actions as per the legally enforceable measures.

(e) Control rooms were set up at every area, subsidiary and Coal India to constantly monitor the situation.

(f)    All the subsidiaries were intimated to send reports to CIL every two hours informing the developments.

The state of preparedness by CIL led to a point where there was hardly any untoward incident.

The arrangements were so elaborate that the operations in all the subsidiaries of CIL were normal today except for few stray incidents where protesters tried to sit on dharna but it didn't succeed and no adverse effect on production related activities was reported anywhere.

The cohesiveness with which the trade unions and CIL management worked together reflected a high level of maturity and harmonious coordination.

                The Union Minister for Railways and Coal Shri Piyush Goyal today launched UTTAM App for Coal Quality Monitoring.  UTTAM stands for – Unlocking Transparency by Third Party Assessment of Mined Coal (uttam.coalindia.in). The Ministry of Coal and Coal India Limited (CIL) developed UTTAM,aims to provide an App for all citizens and coal consumers to monitor the process of Third Party Sampling of coal across CIL subsidiaries.

UTTAM App ensures accountability, transparency, effectiveness and efficiency in coal ecosystem.  It provides a platform for monitoring of sampling and coal dispatches.  The App is designed with an aim to make the citizens a stakeholder in the coal ecosystem. UTTAM is an example of leveraging technology to facilitate a bidirectional channel between Coal India Limited and a common citizen.  It ensures transparency and efficiency in the coal quality monitoring process and brings coal governance closer to people.

Specific benefits of the UTTAM App would be

(i)         For Subsidiary structure :   The information about subsidiary wise declared GCV will help citizens and coal consumers  to compare and assess the coal quality coming from a particular mine.  It will provide a proper mapping of declared grade of coal dispatch to the consumers.

(ii) For Coal consumer portal – The portal would give detailed information for coal consumers regarding the Third Party Sampling parameters.  The App will give access for monitoring coal quality to individual coal consumers.

The salient features of UTTAM APP are:


	Sampling Coverage – The App provides coverage of Third Party Sampling which includes information on production, dispatch and quantity sampled of coal.
	Subsidiary wise quality parameters – An interactive map based view provides holistic coverage of coal quality across subsidiaries, along with subsidiary details on quality parameters (Declared Gross Calorific Value [GCV], Analysed GCV) and coverage parameters (Locations, Quantity sampled).
	Declared Vs Analysed GCV – With CIL’s aim of having minimum variation between declared and analysed GCV of coal, an accurate representation of the same is incorporated in the App.
	Complaints pertaining to quality of Coal – Complaints are reflection of coal quality and transparency in the coal ecosystem.  The App reflects the trend of complaints, which validates CIL’s efforts for quality improvement through Third Party Sampling.


With the reduction in imports and gap minimising between analysed and declared grade, the reduction of complaints have been observed.


	Sampled volume – The App presents the latest quantity sampled in the power and non-power sector, bringing transparency in the coal quality assessment system.
	Imports of coal – The amount of coal imported is a clear reflection of the quality of coal that is produced within the country.  The trend of coal imports over the last years is presented in the App. 


At the Workshop organised today by Ministry of Coal a study commissioned to assess the future demand scenarios for coal sector and to formulate a ‘Coal Vision 2030’ on detailing future evolution and identifying key actions were also discussed.

                Coal is the prime source of energy in India and as per draft “National Energy Policy” prepared by NITI Aayog, coal will remain as an important source of energy and electricity even in near future due to abundance of coal in India and that too at a cheaper rate.

The total number coal mines in Coal India Ltd. (CIL),Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), Public and Private Sectors as on 31.03.2017 and total annual production from these mines during 2016-17 is given below:

In the year 2017-18, against the pro-rata AAP target (Apr-Feb’18) of 408.6 MT in CIL, supply of about 411.3 MT coal is been made to power sector thereby achieving materialization of 101% during the period. 

CIL has taken the following measures to improve the work efficiency of coal mines:

 

i.   Planning for higher capacity mines with heavy mechanization to take advantage of economy of scale.

ii.  Introduction of state of the art technology to improve its work efficiency with high capacity HEMMS like 42 cum shovel with 240T Rear Dumper.

iii. Introduction of Surface Miners in opencast mines to improve operational efficiency & cater to environmental needs.

iv.  Introduction of In-pit crushing & conveying/in pit conveying.

v. Introduction of mechanized mass production technology like powered support long wall technology and continuous miner in UG mines.

vi. Thrust on mechanization of coal winning/loading system by gradually phasing out manual loading by SDL/LHD loading, manual drilling into UDM drilling, haulage system of transport to conveyor system wherever feasible.

vii.  Construction of silos with rapid loading system for faster loading.

viii. For survey/check measurements, use of technology like Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS).

 

With a view to optimize transportation cost, an inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) was constituted by Ministry of Coal for a comprehensive review of existing coal sources as also feasibility for rationalization of these sources. The IMTF recommended rationalization of existing sources on case to case basis for 19 Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) of Public Sector Undertakings(PSUs). This has resulted in rationalization of sources of 24.238 MT of coal. In addition, an agreement was signed between Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd. (GSECL) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) for swapping of 1.0 MT of domestic coal with imported coal. Further, CIL has rationalized sources of coal supply to TPPs of PSUs to the tune of 30.46 MT on the basis of the requests received from them. These have resulted in annual potential savings of Rs.3354 cr. Further, Government has permitted flexibility in utilization of domestic coal by allowing central/state utilities to use coal in such power plants to achieve overall reduction in cost of generation.

In addition to the above, it has been decided that all Power Plants located within 20 km from Pithead shall construct elevated closed belt conveyor within next 2 years (up to 1st April 2020). Further, it is also decided that the power plants located within 40km from Pit-head shall construct MGR within 3 years (up to 1stApril 2021). Power plants located beyond 40 km and up to 100 km, may also consider the option of MGR depending on the financial viability.

 

This information was laid in the House today in response to a question in Lok Sabha.

                A number of important steps have been taken in the Government, in the Coal India Limited (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) to monitor and augment coal dispatches to the power houses. Some of the steps taken are:


	Coal stocks at the power plants are monitored constantly on the basis of daily CEA reports, which form the basis for CIL to advice its subsidiary companies to plan the movement of rakes, with specific reference to critical/supercritical plants, in coordination with the Zonal railways.
	In addition to the monitoring mechanism available at coal companies and CIL, coal supplies to Power Utility Sector is monitored regularly by an inter-ministerial sub-group comprising representatives of Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Railways, Central Electricity Authority, Ministry of Shipping, NITI Aayog, CIL etc. This sub-group has been meeting periodically, at times twice every week, in order to take various operational decisions for meeting any contingent situations relating to Power Sector including critical coal stock position for power plants.
	A committee of Secretary (Coal), Secretary (Power) and Member (Traffic), Railway Board has been jointly reviewing the coal transportation and supply on a regular basis.
	Comprehensive monitoring has been done for coal movement through rakes from CIL sidings, Washery sidings and Goods sheds.
	There has been close monitoring of turnaround time of rakes at the loading and unloading ends.
	An Innovative Monitoring Control Cell has been established in order to monitor supply related issues of the Power Houses and provide regular feedback to the MoC/CIL authorities.
	In order to meet the coal requirement of thermal Power Plants, CIL has offered coal through road mode from the available pithead stock to those Plants which are located within 50 Kms to 60 Kms from the nearest mines. As a result, power plants located within 50 Kms to 60 Kms have taken coal to fulfill their immediate coal requirement.
	Coal supplies to Power Sector from CIL have grown by 20%, 19%, 17%, 9% and 3% during the months of August-2017, September-2017, October-2017, November-2017 and December-2017 respectively over coal supplies during corresponding months of the last year.


To improve coal supplies to power plants, Indian Railways have augmented rakes availability for loading of coal to power plants. Turnaround time of rakes at loading end has improved. These efforts and close monitoring have resulted in increase in coal supplies to power plants from the level of 219 rakes per day from CIL sidings in September, 2017 to 270.6 rakes per day in March, 2018. Besides the rail projects which have been undertaken by the Railways, CIL has collaborated with the Indian Railways to undertake construction of railway lines on deposit basis and in the States of Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh by formation of Joint Ventures. There are 14 rail projects which will augment coal evacuation and these are regularly monitored in the Ministry.

An India-Nepal Inter Government Committee (IGC) on Trade, Transit and Cooperation to Control Unauthorised Trade, led by Commerce Secretaries of the two Governments, is functioning under the India-Nepal Treaty of Trade and India-Nepal Treaty of Transit. It provides a platform for discussing and reviewing bilateral trade and transit related issues.

A meeting of the IGC was held on 26-27 April 2018 in Kathmandu, Nepal with the Indian delegation led by Ms. Rita Teaotia, Commerce Secretary and the Nepali delegation headed by Shri Chandra Kumar Ghimire, Commerce Secretary of Nepal. The two sides held extensive and productive discussions on a variety of issues concerning bilateral trade, transit and economic relations. The meeting concluded with several landmark decisions aimed at boosting the bilateral trade and investment ties significantly.

Both countries agreed to initiate, by July 2018,a comprehensive review of the bilateral Treaty of Trade which governs the bilateral trade and was last revised in 2009, considering all factors.

The meeting discussed amendments to the bilateral Treaty of Transit, signed in 1999, to further facilitate transit movement of Nepal’s trade with third countries by expanding transit points, simplification of procedures, electronic cargo tracking and also enabling movement of Indian cargo through Nepali territory. Additonally, both sides aim to consolidate all earlier amendments to the Treaty of Transit, within a month.

Since most bilateral trade takes place through land customs stations across the border between India and Nepal, the two countries also agreed on synchronised development of border trade infrastructure so as to ensure timely utilisation of the investment in border infrastructure.

In order to enhance the volume of trade, the two countries emphasised the need for bilateral harmonisation of standards and expediting progress on MoUs between concerned agencies including BIS and FSSAI from the Indian side. The two sides further agreed to work towards mutual recognition of each  other’s testing and certifications.

 

In order to ensure regular inputs from business and investors, both sides had earlier agreed to constitute India-Nepal Joint Business Forum consisting of industry representatives from the two countries that will function as an institutional B2B mechanism for providing policy level inputs on trade and investment. Both countries are aiming at holding the first meeting of the Forum shortly.

The meeting was preceded by a meeting of Inter-Governmental Sub-Committee on Trade, Transit and Cooperation to Control Unauthorised Trade at the Joint Secretary level which was held on 24-25 April 2018 in Kathmandu.

                Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, will chair the first meeting of the think tank on the Framework for National Policy on E-commerce to be held on April 24th, 2018. Senior officers of the ministries/ departments of the Government of India involved in different aspects of e-commerce; high level representatives from the industry bodies, e-commerce companies, telecommunication companies and IT companies; Reserve Bank of India; and independent experts have been invited to participate in the meeting.

The think tank on the Framework for National Policy on E-commerce has been established recently by the Department of Commerce. It will provide a credible forum for an inclusive and fact-based dialogue leading to recommendations for informed policy making, so that the country is adequately prepared to take advantage of the opportunities, and meet the challenges, that would arise from the next wave of advancements in digital economy.

The think tank on the Framework for National Policy on E-commerce will seek to collectively deliberate on the challenges confronting India in the arena of digital economy with a view to developing recommendations for a comprehensive and overarching national policy on e-commerce. Some of the issues that will be discussed by the think tank include the following aspects of e-commerce and digital economy: physical and digital infrastructure, regulatory regime, taxation policy, data flows, server localisation, intellectual property rights protection, FDI, technology flows, responding to disruptions in industrial organisation, need for skill development and trade-related aspects. Developments on e-commerce at the WTO and evolving appropriate national position on the underlying issues, would be another important dimension of the discussions of the think tank on the Framework for National Policy on E-commerce.

The think tank will explore options for providing a fillip to entrepreneurship in digital economy. It will identify specific policy interventions for nurturing domestic firms and create jobs in e-commerce.

Representatives of almost fifty organisations are expected to participate in the first meeting of the think tank on the Framework for National Policy on E-commerce to be held on 24 April 2018.

Shri Suresh Prabhu delivering keynote address at the First International SME Convention – 2018, Delhi

The First International SME Convention – 2018 is being convened inNew Delhi. Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhuwas the Chief Guest at theinaugural function held today. Speaking on this occasion, the Minister congratulated Minister Shri Giriraj Singh for taking leadership in holding this International SME Convention for the first time, in which more than 30 countries are participating. He said that the world is debating strategies to revive global growth, but there are challenges like the rising gap between rich and poor within a country and also between rich and poor countries along with issues likeclimate change and jobless growth. He emphasised that Micro,Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) will play key rolesin solving these problems.

MSMEs will reduce gap between rich and poor as they are agents of inclusive growth. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises will help in reducing Green House Gas emissions as they are generally closer to markets leading to reduced carbon footprints. MSMEs will play a key role in employment generation thus countering jobless growth.

He further said that there is a complementary relationship between big enterprises and MSMEs. Only if thesmall survive the big will prosper.  Big enterprises and MNCs require global value and supply chain, which is not possible without MSMEs. Need of the hour is strengthening these linkages between big and small, and together both will propel the global economy.

Stressing on role of MSMEs, the Minister said that new Industrial Policy, which will be announced soon, lays great stress on the role of Self Help Groups (SHGs). He also emphasised that MSMEs can take advantage of the Start-up India Program. The Minister suggested that network of MSMEs across countries in Africa, Central Asia and Latin America, may be created to promote their ideas at the global level as MSMEs are the crucible of creation of new ideas in the world of business.

The SME International Convention – 2018 is being organised by the Ministry of MSME and National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) along with KVIC and Coir Board. During the inaugural function MoS (IC), MSME, Giriraj Singh, MoS of External Affairs, M.J. Akbar, Secretary MSME, Dr.Arun Kumar Panda, Additional Secretary and Development Commissioner, MSME, Ram Mohan Mishra, Chairman of KVIC and Chairman of Coir Board were also present.

                To involve the districts more actively in the growth of the Indian economy and to formulate a common development vision starting from the district level, through a participatory mechanism, it has been decided by Union Commerce & Industry Minister Shri Suresh Prabhu that District Plan will be created for achieving this goal. Shri Suresh Prabhu emphasised the need to accelerate growth in the districts to ensure growth at the national level.  There is need to create resource based plans, for the districts based on a bottom-up approach and implement the plan by going beyond a silo-ed mind-set.  An addition of 3% growth at the district level will ensure that USD 5 trillion target for the Indian economy becomes achievable. 

The Plan will provide specific interventions taking into account resources, strengths of the districts, sectoral interventions for agriculture including mapping of cropping pattern, industry including MSME and services relevant for the districts, skilling initiatives, Ease of Doing Business, access to credit and convergence of existing efforts in public and private sectors. Active participation of the State governments and district administration will be sought for effective implementation of the plan.   

The initiative will begin with 6 districts, including Sindhudurg & Ratnagiri in Maharashtra, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Muzaffarpur in Bihar, Vishakapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Solan in Himachal Pradesh have been selected. A Steering Committee will be formed to oversee creation and implementation of the plan. It will be headed by Minister for Commerce and Industry with members from different Ministry of Union Government and representatives from State Governments of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.  The Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) in the selected States will prepare the plan. An implementation committee is proposed at the District level to ensure implementation of the plan. The Committee will be headed by the District Collector/ District Magistrate.

Union Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu chairs a meeting on Role of Districts in Economic Growth

 

Union Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviation Minister, Suresh Prabhu today chaired a meeting for brainstorming and creating an action plan on role of districts in economic growth of the country. The aim of the meeting was to prepare an action plan to increase the growth rate at the district level by 3-4% per annum by accelerating economic activities. Larger aim of this initiative is to help India become a USD 5 trillion economy. 

Speaking on the occasion, Minister said that to push growth further, a bottom-up approach is required. Therefore, districts need to be considered as planning and execution units, facilitating change at micro level.  In order to achieve this aim, few districts including Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Varanasi and Vishakhapatnam, across different states will be selected in phase 1 of the pilot project. Profile of the districts will be created, identifying strengths and local resources, so as to incorporate it with different sectors and verticals. Efforts will be made to converge government and private initiatives and introduce mechanism for handholding and mentoring. The Minister directed the officials to create an Action Plan in this regard at the earliest.

Representative from different Ministries including Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, MSME, Skill Development & Entrepreneurship and Statistics & Program Implementation along with NITI Aayog, Department of Economic Affairs and representatives of States of Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were present.

The Union Minister for Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Shri Suresh Prabhu, delivering the inaugural address at the Global Logistics Summit, in New Delhi

 

Efficient logistics is critical for countries like India to harness trade and facilitate greater & faster integration with both the domestic as well as world economy. Keeping this in mind 56 new airports will become functional in the next few years, Union Minister for Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Shri Suresh Prabhu said at the two days Global Logistics Summit being held in New Delhi.

The Minister further said that by bringing all the stakeholders together it will create the right platform to improve logistics and connectivity which are vital for increasing intra-state and international trade flows.

Indian logistics industry is estimated at around US $ 215 billion in 2019-20, growing at over 10 % annually. In the last decade or so, significant improvements in Railways, Roads, Highways, Inland Waterways, Aviation, Ports and Coastal Shipping have taken place. India has improved its ranking in the Logistics Performance Index (prepared by the World Bank) from 54 in 2014 to 35 in 2016. To keep up with the growth in demand for logistics services, it is important to develop a consistent approach to logistics across infrastructure, services and different modes of transportation.

To support awareness building and develop better understanding on these issues, the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, in partnership with FICCI and the World Bank Group, is organising this Summit on 5 & 6 April 2018.

The Summit provides an opportunity to discuss the above issues among global experts, academics, government officials and private sector and industry representatives.

Union Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviation Minister, Suresh Prabhu today launched digital initiatives by Export Inspection Council (EIC) for ease of export at New Delhi today.

Speaking on this occasion the Minister said that India’s potential for agricultural and food export will get a great boost due to these digital initiatives.

 

EIC is the official export certification body of Government of India and has launched this flagship project of Digital India Initiative to keep pace with changing dynamics of the world.  

In order to continue the vision for credible inspection and certification and to strengthen the confidence on Indian produce, three portals have been developed to reduce transaction time and cost in a transparent manner. The portals not only provide an opportunity for ease of export but also plays an important role in the Go Green initiative by reducing paper usage and saving millions trees. 

 

To provide fast, efficient and transparent services for ease of doing business in all sectors the complete export food chainhas been integrated in this digital platform. Primary production, chain catch, aquaculture pond, dairy farms and apiaries are all linked. Processing units, testing laboratories, official controls and exports have complete traceability. 

 

One lab one assessment portalprovides unified approach to all stakeholders like accreditation bodies, regulators and laboratories by bringing them together on a common platform. Simplified proceduresfor granting joint certification and joint decisionshelps in reducing cost, time and multiplicity of assessment.

 

TheExport Alert Monitoring portal monitors non compliances raised byimporting countries. The portal will enable monitoring of alerts and action taken by multiple organizations involved in initial certification in the food safety & biosecurity and analysing the trend, understanding the trade barriers to reduce the alerts and enhance the export trade. 

 

EIC has worked towards building the analytical capability for the country by providing accredited Proficiency Testing (PT) providers at Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai byreducing dependency on foreign PT providers and ease of access.

 

Minister of State, Shri C.R. Chaudhary along with Commerce Secretary, Rita Teaotia, were also present on the occasion.

                Inaugurating the newly created Parcel Directorate in the Department of Posts here, Minister of State for Communications (Independent Charge) and Minister of State for Railways ShriManoj Sinha said, “This is another significant step in the journey of transformation that DoP has embarked upon.  I expect this Directorate to act as a catalyst for growing our business, and providing efficient and cost-effective service to our customers.”

The global decline in letter mail, and India being no exception to this trend, has been offset by an increase in packets and parcels. This is primarily on account of the e-commerce boom in India, with e-tailers requiring integrated collection, aggregation, sorting, transmission and delivery systems. The parcel market (logistics and distribution but excluding fulfilment and merchandise value) in the country is growing at a rate of 15% per annum and is expected to reach Rs. 60,000 Crore by 2026 from the existing Rs. 18,000 Crore.

India Post has undertaken the Parcel Network Optimization Project during November, 2016 to revamp the parcel operations.  Steps are being taken to address parcel- specific requirements, including network rationalization, strengthening processing hubs and delivery centres, ensuring security, etc. Additionally, in order to ensure the timely and secure transmission of parcels, the Department has operationalized road transport routes.

It has now been decided that a separate Directorate for parcels and E-commerce will be setup within the Department, which shall be headquartered in New Delhi. The Directorate will be along the lines of the PLI Directorate and the Business Development Directorate, which were set up earlier to bring focused attention into the PLI business and other business development activities of the Department.The traditional mail business and marketing of the Department will continue to be handled by the existing divisions.

                With a view to achieve total digitisation of postal operations in the country, under the IT Modernisation Plan, Department of Posts has launched DIGITAL ADVANCEMENT OF RURAL POST OFFICE FOR A NEW INDIA (DARPAN) Project, which aims to connect all 1.29 lakh Rural Branch Post Offices in the country, to enable them to do online Postal and Financial Transactions.

Hand held devices with SIM connectivity and solar power backup are being installed in all Branch Post Offices in the Country. The total Project cost is more than Rs.1300 crores. 61,941 Branch Post Offices have been rolled out under DARPAN Project.

The DARPAN-PLI App, launched by Hon’ble Minister of State (I/C) for Communications and Minister of State for Railways today, will help in collection of premium for PLI and RPLI policies at Branch Post Offices anywhere in India, with online updation of the policies. Further, with launch of this App, indexing of maturity claims in respect of PLI and RPLI policies can be done at Branch Post Office itself, upon which the customer will immediately be provided with the request number for further references. These two initiatives will help Department of Posts in providing better after-sales service to customers of PLI and RPLI, particularly those living in rural areas of the country.

This is another milestone in the Department of Post's journey on the path of Digital India. As Minister of State (Independent Charge) for  Communications and Minister of State for Railways, Shri Manoj Sinha said, ""As a result of the change we are making in our post offices, I believe our citizens will see a new face of our postal system-which will be focussed on making citizen services available to our people, with quality"".

                Shri PP Chaudhary, Union Minister of State, Ministry of Law and Justice & Corporate Affairs, Government of India is currently on an official visit to St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Barbados. On the first day of his visit, Shri PP Chaudhary met Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Dr. The Honourable Ralph Everard Gonsalves.

Dr. Gonsalves welcomed Shri Chaudhary to St. Vincent and the Grenadines and wished him a great stay during his visit to the country. Shri Chaudhary thanked Dr. Gonsalves for having him in the beautiful island country and recalled the meeting of the Hon’ble Prime Minister with the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly 2015 in New York.

During this meeting, the two leaders extensively discussed various matters related to the bilateral relations between the two countries. During the meeting, both leaders agreed to not only deepen the engagement between the Governments of two countries but also expand the people-to-people interactions for the mutual interest of both nations. Shri Chaudhary also assured the Hon’ble Prime Minister of all possible cooperation from the Indian side for the progress and development of St. Vincent and Grenadines.

Earlier in the day, Shri PP Chaudhary met Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade & Commerce, Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Ms. Sandy Peter-Phillips who briefed the Hon’ble Minister about the bilateral relations between the two countries. Shri Chaudhary also visited Indian settlements in Calder and Richmond Park, areas where Indian origin people had migrated as early as the 19thcentury. Such visits play an instrumental role in engaging Indian diaspora for our nation’s socio-economic development.

Later in the day, Shri PP Chaudhary also attended the cultural programme followed by the dinner hosted in his honour. The Hon’ble Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Dr. Gonsalves was also present for this program.

Shri PP Chaudhary has undertaken this visit under the Bruhad Sampark Yojana, an initiative by the Ministry of External Affairs to expand the bilateral relations of India with countries across the world. Championed by Prime Minister’s vision of making our nation a ‘Vishwaguru’, this initiative entails the visit of a high-level ministerial delegation from India to countries where no senior ministerial delegation has undertaken a visit during the recent years.

The Exhibition is in collaboration with the Petach Tikva Museum of Art, Israel  and is titled ‘To the End of Land’ contemporary art from Israel on the occasion of 25 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Speaking on the occassion the ambassador said that the exhibition is a festival of art and friendship between the two countries and represents the vision of the leaders of both the countries and widening dialouge  between India and Israel.

The Israeli Ambassador also said, “This exhibition speaks to the heart of the Indo-Israeli relations as it tells the story of Israel’s agriculture and technology in an innovative and out of the box context of contemporary art. It presents the Israeli spirit not only in its content, but also in its method of delivery. We are proud to have partnered with the Indian Ministry of Culture and the NGMA and to have upgraded our cultural cooperation via this special project. Through art, we find a common language through which to deepen our understanding of one another and strengthen our people to people bonds.”

 The exhibition presents a wide range of references and approaches to recent changes in the economic and social landscape in Israel, as manifested by the appearance of

natural scenery in Israeli contemporary art. Engagement with the land, its borders, scars, and produce runs through the work of many artists active in Israel today. The chosen title, “To the End of Land:, strives to draw attention to some of the cultural, social, and political aspects embodied in their artistic explorations of land.

The exhibition is available for the public viewing for the entire month of May, 11am to 6.30pm, tuesday to Sunday. (Closed on Sundays and national holidays.)

                The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with International Buddhist Confederation (IBC) will celebrate the auspicious Buddha Jayanti-2018 by showcasing various facets of Buddhist traditions. A conglomerate of Buddhist Institutions will come together on 30th April, 2018 in the presence of Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, New Delhi. The Minister of State for Culture (I/C), Dr. Mahesh Sharma, with the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju and Ven Dr. Dhammapiya, Secretary General, International Buddhist Confederation (IBC) will also be present.

The Prime Minister and other dignitaries will be paying their respects to the sacred relics specially brought for the occasion from the National Museum, New Delhi, to the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium. The Prime Minister will also be performing the offering of Sangha Dana (Cheevar Vastram and Sacred Leaf of Bodhi Tree) to the venerated Sangha. The event would also house an exhibition gallery- ‘Buddham Sarnam Gacchami’ with murals, photographs and artefacts.

Buddhist thought has been integral to the Indian concept of Dharma, as Buddha is remembered most for his notion of Karuna (Compassion). Buddhism has thrived in the Indian Himalayas, from Arunachal Pradesh in the east to Ladakh in the west. Also, there are communities in India that trace their origin to the Shakya clan of Buddha and the Maurya clan of Samrat Ashok. UN has also officially recognized the importance of this auspicious day in 1999, considering the contemporary  relevance of Buddha’s teachings of compassion and humanism in these modem times. ‘Buddha dharma’ is also the common thread running through many south Asian countries and connecting these countries and most others in Asia to India. 

In 2015, Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi had announced that the Buddha Jayanti day will be commemorated and celebrated as an annual event by the nation. Accordingly, an organizing Committee to oversee the organization of these celebrations, was set up under the Chairpersonship of the Minister of State for Culture (I/C), Dr. Mahesh Sharma, with the Minister of State for Home, Shri Kiren Rijiju as Co-chairperson. Ven Dr. Dhammapiya, Secretary General, International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), a global umbrella Buddhist body headquartered in New Delhi, is the Convener of the Organizing Committee in India. Besides, Dr. Ramdas Athawale, Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Dr. Udit Raj, Member of Parliament ( Lok Sabha ), Dr Sunil Gaikwad, Member of Parliament ( Lok Sabha ), Most Venerable Dr Rahul Bodhi, Most Venerable Shantimitra Mahathera and Dhammacharya Shantum Seth are also members of the committee.

                The National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi in collaboration with the Embassy of Israel in India and the Petach Tikva Museum of Art, Israel is organizing an exhibition titled ‘To the End of Land’-contemporary art from Israel on the occasion of 25 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. 

The exhibition will be inaugurated tomorrow (Saturday, 28th of April, 2018) at 6:00pm at the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi in the presence of the Minister for Culture (I/c) and Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Chief Guest for the Occasion and His Excellency, Daniel Carmon, Ambassador, Embassy of Israel in New Delhi, Guest of Honour for the Occasion. The exhibition is a collection of art creations of 19 Israeli artists, including the internationally acclaimed Shahar Marcus who will perform at the exhibition opening.

The exhibition -open to the public throughout May 2018- will revolve around connection of human beings with land, territory, locality and identity projected through innovative modern art pieces and installations. 

The exhibition presents a wide range of references and approaches to recent changes in the economic and social landscape in Israel, as manifested by the appearance of natural scenery in Israeli contemporary art. Engagement with the land, its borders, scars, and produce runs through the work of many artists active in Israel today. The chosen title, “To the End of Land:, strives to draw attention to some of the cultural, social, and political aspects embodied in their artistic explorations of land. On one hand, it points at the broad environmental-ecological dimension. It refers to the depletion of natural resources in the Anthropocene era, typified by acceleration of geological and environmental processes due to human activity, and to the resulting fear of “the end of land” as a meta-cultural concern which goes beyond national boundaries. On the other hand, it offers a porthole through which to look at some of the major cultural issues in present-day Israel, alluding, among others, to its land being a source of an ongoing strife. 

Whether consciously or not, the local engagement with land and the accessibility of natural resources is thus charged not only with a romantic view of the local landscape or with internal questions of development and social status, but also with ideological and political questions pertaining to the reality of conflict and borders. The immediate, ironic link between land and territory, in the context of a nation-sate constantly shifting between change and entrenchment, is clear at face level. This affinity is reinforced by the profound bond between man and land in Judasim. The book of Genesis recounts the creation of Adam, the first man, from the earth, a link which is further emphasized through the etymological connection between the Hebrew words for man (adam) and land/earth/soil (adama) 

Striving to shed light on additional dimensions in our intricate relationship with the place and land, the exhibition highlights individual life stories which reflect a rich cultural heritage as well as collective hopes for prosperity and rootedness. It touches on ritual of burial and regeneration, the transformations in the Zionist ethos of “land tilling” vis-à-vis market forces and globalization, and the challenges posed by a rapidly forging future.

                An exhibition titled ""Dhvani se ŚabdaurChinh” was inaugurated at National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai today evening. Curated by AdwaitaGadanayak and his team, the exhibition speaks to us about southern sensibilities and singular identities that were forged through scholarly adaptations, multiple skills and experiments that were seeking to juxtapose the notions of the modern with the traditional. It identifies artists who practiced in Southern states as well as artists who were born there or had family trees and moved up North to become the greatest practitioners and pedagogues. We are looking at a period that just followed the Partition wherein an idea of tradition was in its genesis - as it oscillated between symbolic fantasy (Madras group) and the knowledge of truths that were generated by pure practice. The czar of the Madras Movement, K.C.S. Paniker – believed that an artist had to foreground tradition and cultural art forms and interpret these within contemporary sensibilities, leading to defining the regional modern particularly in Madras.




Hence, Paniker's regional modern was firmly fixed in the wedge between the visibility and identity of the southern artists nationally, and developing a visual language born of an Indian ethos - the vitality of the Indian spirit.

Historians have noted that the modernity which was established in Madras in the '60s integrated and blended pioneering visions of certain artist-teachers at the Madras School of Arts and Crafts.

The culling also includes Malayali veterans like K. G. Subramanyan, the cultural theorist, the philosopher, the art mandarin who taught seven decades of students as well as A. Ramachandran the scholar, the author, the art historian and the guru who taught a love for the immediate environment to his students.

“I want [my art] to flourish (so to say) in a ‘cloud of unknowing’,” K.G. Subramanyan explained in an interview, when asked about the process of his work. “For a centipede like me to start counting my legs is suicidal,” he elaborated in that distinctly witty yet acerbic manner of his, “It will freeze me into inaction.” The phrase, “cloud of unknowing”, is the ideal frame through which to look at Southern sensibilities and imagery.

It instantly conjures up that drifting restlessness which typically characterizes the traffic between the earthy and the ethereal in many of these works. Then again, it is the artist’s self-description as an unselfconscious centipede that, more than anything helps one to make sense of the profusion of paintings spread across these galleries at the NGMA. There is indeed an arduous degree of introspection and reflection about Southern sensibility and creativity — as if some artists indulged in a Dionysian ritual that revealed, quite naturally and effortlessly in an endless proliferation of images that cut across time and space to create corollaries in multiple contexts and complexities.

A look at the monumental work by VeluViswanadhan signifies the truth that abstraction must be born out of the symbolism of a deeper experience - the incandescent flavour of the red hues and the geometry that creates succinct planes tells us that this is a nether journey built on rumination and realization and not superficial reflections of strokes and colour.

While the visual arts in the South charted trajectories that engaged with diverse media, techniques, materials, and concepts allowing articulation of creative expression also from within the social and cultural milieu, the Indian accent born of everyday idioms was also creating pathways. Between sculptures, paintings and prints we see an offering of possibilities mirroring the symbolic, the sacred and the secular.

Sculptures and paintings picked out from the NGMA Archives is an exercise that moves beyond the realms of exploration and intellectual thirst. In a large number of works that were created within and around the Deccan plateau regions and beyond the Western and Eastern Ghats this group of works is one that defines the many art practices that were born out of European influences and moved beyond to embrace and find deep rooted meaning in Indianesque histories and narratives that explored native elements over time.

                After a glorious run of 51 days across 17 cities of India, the historic event 8th Theatre Olympics drew to a colourful close in Mumbai today. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri DevendraFadnavis was the Chief Guest at the closing ceremony. Union Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Culture, Dr. Mahesh Sharma and eminent theatre and film personality Shri Nana Patekar were Guests of Honour.

Addressing the gathering, the Union Culture Minister said that the 8th Theatre Olympics aimed to showcase the rich heritage and culture across the length and breadth of the country. He expressed satisfaction at the success of the event, which he recalled witnessed 450 shows from more than 30 countries performed across 17 Indian cities. He said that given the immense diversity of the country, how India remains united is a matter of wonder for many other countries. The Minister said that the power which keeps India united, despite its immense heterogeneity, is its rich heritage and culture.



Speaking of the power of theatre and culture, Dr. Sharma said that life is like theatre. He said that theatre has the power to unite the past, the present and the future, and to connect cultures ranging from tribal, folk and urban cultures. The Minister said that the Government aims to use the power of our culture in uniting the entire nation and in realizing the Prime Minister’s dream of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’. He said that the goal is to take the glory of Indian culture to all corners of the world.

Dr. Sharma said that around 400 artists from various parts of the country have come to put up a very colourful show at the closing ceremony. Speaking of the venue of the closing ceremony, the Minister said that the Mumbai city is nothing less than a microcosm of India. He appreciated Mumbaikars for the enthusiasm they showed in attending the cultural shows held as part of the theatre festival, all of which were houseful.

The Minister said that the medium of theatre is very powerful, capable of gifting us very powerful messages, whether it be that of Swachh Bharat or of preventing foeticide. He said we need to realize this power through which we can give the invaluable messages drawn from the psyche of a great nation.

The Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri DevendraFadnavis said that theatre is a place which brings together all sectors of the society. He said that while the film industry is moving ahead with the help of technology, bringing in various new visual effects, theatre is a medium which gives us all such effects even without employing technology. He said that theatre will continue to keep generations and the society together. He also expressed happiness that Mumbai was chosen as the host city for the closing ceremony of the Olympics.

                National Culture Fund (NCF) set up as a Trust under the Charitable Endowment Act, 1890 on 28thNovember, 1996 by the Government, with a view to mobilize extra resources through Public Private Partnerships has successfully completed 34 projects since inception, thus, promoting, protecting and preserving India’s cultural heritage. 

The National Culture Fund is managed and administered by a council headed by Hon’ble Culture Minister to decide the policies and an Executive Committee headed by Secretary, Culture to actualize those policies. The Fund aims at inviting the participation of the corporate sector, non-government organizations, private/public sector as well as individuals in the task of promoting, protecting and preserving India’s cultural heritage.

  The Government has granted Rs. 19.50 crore as one time corpus fund to National Culture Fund out of the planned budget. Apart from this there is no fund allocated by the Government to National Culture Fund. Besides this, NCF receives contributions and voluntary donations as endowments from many other sources. 

All the projects undertaken by the NCF are completed within a specified period, in accordance with an MoU signed by NCF with the concerned donor organization. Accordingly any ongoing project is supposed to be completed in several stages for which adequate funding is made available by the donor at such different stages. Consequently there is always some unspent balance lying with NCF in respect of such ongoing projects which are still awaiting completion. This reasons for the funds remaining unspent. 

A list of projects completed and statement indicating the status of funds received from various sources and also the expenditure incurred during the last four years is given below.

                Exercise Harimau Shakti 2018, between the Indian Army and the Malaysian Army commenced on 30 April at Wardieburn Camp, Kuala Lumpur with a brief and impressive handing over of troops ceremony.        Lt Col Irwan Ibrahim, Commanding officer of the 1st Royal Ranger Regiment of Malaysian Army welcomed the Indian contingent and wished the Indian and Malaysian troops for a successful and mutually beneficial joint exercise.           

First phase of the two week long joint military exercise begin with the formal handing over of the Regimental Flag to the Malaysian Army signifying merging of the two contingents under one Commander.  First day also saw briefings to the joint contingent on Malaysian country brief, exercise settings and security aspects. The day ended with a keenly contested friendly Volley Ball match, which the visitors could finally snatch after a tiff competition. Both armies stand to hone their tactical and technical skills in counter insurgency and counter terrorist operations under the UN mandate. Due emphasis will be laid on increasing interoperability between forces which is crucial for success of any joint operation.           

Exercise Harimau Shakti is a positive step in the bilateral relations between the two nations. The conduct of such exercises in future will enable mutual capacity enhancement and assist in building strong bonds of friendship and cooperation between India and Malaysia.

                Tejas, the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) successfully fired Derby Air-to-Air Beyond Visual Range Missile to expand the firing envelope as well as to demonstrate safe operation of the aircraft during missile plume ingestion into the aircraft engine under worst case scenarios. The missile was launched from LCATejas piloted by Wg Cdr Siddharth Singh on 27 April 2018 from the firing range off the Goa coast after exhaustive study of the missile separation characteristics and plume envelope. LCATejas has been designed & developed by DRDO’s autonomous society – Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA).

Integration of Derby, a BVR class missile is one of the major objectives of Final Operational Clearance (FOC) of LCATejas.

The aircraft was tracked by two other Tejas aircraft in close formation to capture the firing event in the specially instrumented high speed cameras for detailed analysis and comparison with the simulation model for validation. The entire planning, practice sorties and final firing was carried out by ADA and it’s National Flight Test Centre (NFTC) officials Cmde JA Maolankar and GpCapt A Kabadwal, IAF, DG(AQA), HAL &  INS HANSA. 

Based on the successful integration and demonstration, Regional Centre for Military Airworthiness (RCMA), a unit of DRDO has cleared the series production aircraft of Squadron 45, to be equipped with Derby operational capability.  LCATejas has successfully completed a series of captive flight trials to clear Derby for the full operational capability in the entire FOC envelope. In the past, Tejas has qualified for the armaments and missile release related trials.

Raksha Mantri Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman has complimented DRDO and other agencies involved for making LCATejas fighter jet, a world class aircraft platform.     

Chairman DRDO& Secretary Department of Defence R&D Dr. S Christopher, congratulated and said that with this firing, LCATejas achieved another major milestone towards FOC certification.

                The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by the Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, met today and accorded approval to Capital Acquisition Proposals of the Services valued at over Rs 3,687 crore. 

In a boost to indigenisation and in realisation of India's growing technological prowess, the DAC approved procurement of Defence Research and Development Organisation’s (DRDO’s) designed and developed NAG Missile System (NAMIS) at the cost of Rs 524 crore. The system includes a third generation Anti-Tank Guided Missile, the NAG, along with the Missile Carrier Vehicle (NAMICA). The NAG missile is a third generation anti-tank guided missile, which has top attack capabilities that can effectively engage and destroy all known enemy tanks during day and night. This will give a quantum boost to the Army's capability against enemy armour.

The DAC also approved procurement of thirteen 127 mm calibre guns for the Navy. These guns will be fitted on-board new construction ships for undertaking surface engagements including Naval Gunfire Support Operations. The guns will enable Naval ships to provide fire support and engagement of targets on the land. These guns have engagement range of 24 kilometres, which could be extended further by using Extended Range Gun Munitions (ERGM). These guns, a long outstanding requirement of the Navy would be procured from BAE Systems of the United States of America under the categorisation of Buy (Global) at an approximate cost of over Rs 3,000 crore.

The DAC also reviewed the progress of the DRDO programme to develop indigenous Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS).

                The third ship of the Landing Craft Utility (LCU) Mk-IV project was inducted into the Indian Navy today at Port Blair. The ship was commissioned as INLCU L53 by Vice Admiral Bimal Verma, AVSM, ADC, Commander-in-Chief A&N Command. Designed and built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE), Kolkata, the ship showcases the immense potential of the country’s indigenous ship building capability and is in consonance with the national goal of ‘Make in India’. 

LCU MK-IV ship is an amphibious ship with a displacement of 830 Tons and is capable of transporting combat equipment such as Main Battle Tanks Arjun, T72 and other Armoured Vehicles. The ship is fitted with state-of-the-art equipment and advanced systems such as the Integrated Bridge System (IBS) and the Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS). The indigenous CRN 91 Gun with Stabilised Optronic Pedestal provides the ship the requisite offensive capability for undertaking patrolling in addition.

The ship, commanded by Lt Cdr Vikas Anand, has a complement of five officers and 45 sailors. Capable of carrying 160 troops in addition, the ships would be based in the Andaman and Nicobar Command bolstering the Command’s capability in undertaking multi role activities such as beaching operations, HADR, search/ rescue, and supply and replenishment of distant islands.

The remaining five ships of the project are in an advanced stage of construction and are scheduled to be inducted into Indian Navy over the next year and half. Induction of these ships will contribute to the nation’s maritime security needs and would accomplish India’s quest for self-reliance in shipbuilding.

                The Indian Air Force conducted pan India Exercise Gagan Shakti-2018 from 08-22 Apr 2018. The aim of the exercise was real time coordination, deployment and employment of air power in a short and intense battle scenario.  For an exercise of such scale, the planning process started almost nine months back.  During Gagan Shakti-2018, lAF exercised its entire war fighting machinery to validate its concept of operations and war waging capability. The focus of the exercise was to check the viability of our operational plans and learn meaningful lessons.

The exercise was conducted in two phases so that all Commands get adequate opportunity to test the efficacy of their preparedness.  Phase-I of the exercise involved activation of Western, South Western and Southern Air Commands, with affiliated Army and Naval components. Phase-II of the exercise involved activation of Western, Central, Eastern and Southern Air Commands.  Re-deployment for Phase-II involved relocating the forces so as to be effective at the new  Iocations within a short span of 48 hours. This was made possible by round the clock  operations of heavy lift transport aircraft like C-17 and IL-76 as well as by employing a large number of tactical airlift aircraft like C-130 and An-32 aircraft.  IAF also used civil chartered flight and trains for mobilisation of resources.

During the exercise, all types of combat missions, encompassing all air campaigns, were conducted.  Fighter aircraft undertook surge operations i.e. generating maximum number of sorties in a 24 hours cycle. These included long range missions with concentrated live and simulated weapon releases across all air to ground ranges in India, creation of Air Defence umbrella to facilitate operation of ground forces and Counter Surface Force Operations in support of Army in various sectors, during both phases Maritime Operations involving long range maritime strikes with Maritime Reconnaissance support by Indian Navy aircraft were also practiced. The efficacy and integration of indigenous LCA aircraft and Akash Missile system in the operational matrix of the IAF was also checked out.  In addition, capabilities of upgraded Mirage-2000 and MiG-29 aircraft were tested for the first time in an operational environment.  All types of aerial weapons, including standoff and precision weapons were employed to validate their use in the Air Operations Matrix.

Combat  Support  Operations involved missions by force enablers like AWACS and Air to Air refuellers, Special Ops comprising a Battalion Group paradrop, Special Ops with Garud Commandos, Combat Search and Rescue for effective extraction of downed aircrew behind enemy lines, sea rescue and operations from Advanced Landing Grounds. The transport aircraft also undertook mass casualty evacuation missions in all Commands employing C-17, C-130 and An-32 aircraft. Helicopter missions included Special Heliborne Operations, casualty evacuation, strike missions against enemy formations and Inter-Valley Troop Transfer.

For joint operations, lAF’s  joint command and control structures with Indian Army and Navy, such as Advance HQ of IAF co-located with Army Commands, Tactical Air Centres, Maritime Air Ops Centre and Maritime Elements of Air Force etc, were activated. Army troops and combat vehicles were deployed to simulate Tactical Battle Areas in all Commands and some of the Army exercises were dovetailed with air operations for simulation of realistic battlefield environment. Ships were deployed, both in the Arabian Sea as well as in Bay of Bengal, for anti-shipping strikes by IAF maritime aircraft operating from bases on the east and west coast, as well as from island territories.

During the exercise, more than 11000 sorties were flown, which include approx 9000 sorties by fighter aircraft.

To sustain the tempo of operations on such a large scale, on a 24 x 7 basis, the training status of entire IAF was enhanced, especially the aircrew.  All qualified and medically fit crew upto 48 years of age were made proficient and current by giving them re-validation training on combat assets, employed during the exercise.  Even the technical manpower focused on their primary tasks and rehearsed their SOPs/ practices in the run up to the exercise.  Over 1,400 officers and 14,000 men were pulled out of training establishments and deployed for the exercise, to augment existing resources.

Intense operations of this magnitude, in a short span of time, involved very close coordination with Airport Authority of India for airspace coordination. It was an endeavour of the IAF to conduct this exercise with negligible disruptions of civil traffic anywhere in the country.  IAF had also activated a number of civil airfields to support combat operations during the exercise.

All operations were conducted in a Network Enabled scenario with a very high reliability of communications, networked air defence systems employing op enabling software.

A major highlight of the exercise was a very high availability and reliability of all combat assets including aircraft, missile systems and radars. High tempo operations also enabled the IAF to ascertain sustainability of the logistics chain.

IAF was able to achieve 80% serviceability of aircraft while radars and surface to air guided weapons maintained a serviceability of 97%, which included some of the legacy systems that were over 40 years old.  Focused effort enabled a dispatch rate of more than 95% for the Combat Assets, 100% availability of Combat Support Systems and almost 100% dispatch rates of Combat Enablers.  This had been possible due to good planning and dedicated efforts of our airwarriors as well as continuous support by DPSUs that is HAL, BEL and DRDO. Flight line unserviceabilities were promptly rectified by dedicated maintenance crew.  The logistics stamina of the IAF and the ability to sustain continuous operations through day and night was put through a rigorous assessment.  Contingencies such as repair of battle damaged aircraft and relocation, of essential services due to enemy air action were also practiced.

The exercise also focused heavily on base security aspects.  Simulated drills involving infiltration into operational area by various means were practiced.  Dedicated contingencies were conducted towards sustaining operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear attack scenario. Different techniques for repairing runway after bomb damage were practiced in addition to restoration of essential services and mass casualty evacuation at forward bases. Extensive coordination with Territorial Army Units and Local Civil Administration was undertaken to refine response during various security and administrative contingencies.

Exercise Gagan Shakti-2018 provided IAF with an excellent opportunity to practice its war time drills and undertake operations in realistic scenario.  Activities were undertaken in a cohesive manner to achieve the stated objectives of the Indian Air Force, in case of any contingency.  The exercise also enabled the IAF to validate operational efficacy of new platforms and refine existing Standard Operating Procedures. Joint operations with Army and Navy, conducted during the exercise, would help in achieving better operational synergy between the three services, in application of combat power.

                India is participating in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Defence Ministers Meeting for the first time. The 15th SCO Defence Ministers Meeting was held at Beijing in China, today. Speaking at the meeting, Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted India’s keen interest in developing an expanded partnership with the broader Eurasian region. In doing so, India has sought to build on her long-standing ties of deep mutual trust and confidence with Russia, vibrant historical and cultural linkages with countries of Central Asia and closer development partnership with China and to further enhance and deepen ties with all the member countries for mutual benefit.

Smt Nirmala Sitharaman stated that in the days ahead, India will work with the SCO partners to energize and revitalize the age-old ties of affinity with the countries of the region. She sought a forward looking partnership based on robust dialogue and concrete initiatives to enhance the economic, trade and cultural cooperation as well as mutually beneficial interactions on defence and security matters. 

She called for SCO members to work towards enhancing greater communication among member countries within the region as well as in the broader international context. This is essential for progressive trends towards stability and peace to reassert itself and to arrest the current drift in ties between major powers and to address any possible implications for the region. 

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman said that many problems that confront the region, such as climate change, cyber security, narcotics trafficking or violent trans-national crime require solutions based on cooperative frameworks that involve all countries and stakeholders. This is particularly necessary to address the persistent threat of cross-border terrorism and extremism. 

Smt Sitharaman stated that international terrorism is today the most serious threat to our peaceful societies. Terrorism threatens to derail our developmental aspirations and create sustained instability both within our countries and across national borders. She called upon the member countries to closely coordinate and adopt a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism. She contended that arguments of political convenience to provide an alibi for terrorist groups or organisations that support terrorism through material support or otherwise are no longer tolerable. Indeed, as the world has now realized, there are no good terrorists. India, she stressed, will continue to engage strongly with the SCO-Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure based in Tashkent in this regard. 

In this context, she said that we must also work towards the goal of a stable, secure and peaceful Afghanistan. She strongly condemned yet another tragic terrorist attack in Kabul, recently. The SCO must adopt an uncompromising approach towards the persisting threat of terrorism in Afghanistan, as it is essential to advance peace and prosperity in the region. India is committed to doing all it can to assist Afghanistan in its quest to regain stability and reconstruct its economy and polity. This includes cooperation in building capacities and capabilities of the Afghan national security forces. In doing so, India will continue to be guided by the requirements of the government of Afghanistan and the shared objectives of the international community, Smt Sitharaman said.

Since defence cooperation, especially enhanced linkages between armed forces is an important dimension of SCO, Smt Sitharaman stated that India is keen to explore the full potentialities of this engagement. India will engage with a positive approach and an open mind on all issues related to defence cooperation within the SCO framework.

She stated in this context “we note the decision to set up an Experts Working Group (EWG) mechanism under the SCO Defence Ministers Meeting to support greater cooperation in the defence field. There is a need for further discussions on how the EWG mechanism can be best developed to meet our shared requirements and objectives for defence cooperation in the SCO framework. India has already commenced practical steps to take forward defence engagement under the framework, as reflected in our first ever presence at this Ministerial Meeting and participation of the Indian Army Band at the Fanfare for Peace Military Tattoo being held in conjunction with our meeting today”. Further, she stated that “we will also engage as feasible on the items under the Agreed Programme of activities for defence cooperation under the SCO for 2017-19. As we move ahead, India will also explore the possibility of coordinating some SCO defence activities in the coming years”. 

The Raksha Mantri stated that India will participate in the SCO’s Peace Mission joint military exercises being held in Russia later this year. As India enjoys excellent bilateral defence cooperation with a large number of SCO countries especially with Russia as well as with all of India’s Central Asian partners represented in the SCO, she expressed belief that cooperation in the SCO framework will help reinforce India’s efforts to strengthen bilateral cooperation with the partners in the region in the field of defence.

Recognizing the value of improving regional transportation and communication networks through mutual consultation, sustainability and sharing of benefits, the Raksha Mantri opined that it can create a network of physical and digital connectivity that extends from Russia’s northern regions to the shores of Indian Ocean. The International North South Transportation Corridor is an important step in that direction. However, she noted that it would also be essential that such initiatives respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries.

                            A Dakota DC-3 aircraft of 1940’s vintage would be inducted shortly in to the Vintage Aircraft Flight of the Indian Air Force.  A large fleet of Dakota DC-3 served in the IAF till 1988.  It was one of the most versatile transport aircraft of its time. To honour the first Dakota which transported troops of the 1st Sikh Regiment to Srinagar on 27 Oct 47, during the Kashmir conflict, the IAF has allocated the aircraft with a registration number. Built in 1944, the aircraft served in military with the RAF and was also operated by various civil airlines.

            The aircraft was obtained from scrap in 2011 and was restored to flying condition in UK by Hon’ble Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) Mr. Rajeev Chandrasekhar for gifting it to the IAF. Subsequently, the IAF signed a contract with M/s Reflight Airworks Ltd London for upgrading its navigational systems. The CAS ceremonially accepted the aircraft into the IAF from Mr. Rajeev Chandrasekhar on 13 Feb 18.

            After successfully completing all test flights, after its restoration, the aircraft commenced its journey from the UK on 17 Apr 18. It is being flown to India by a joint team crew of the IAF and M/s Reflight Airworks Ltd. The ferry to India by making   en-route halts at France, Italy, Greece, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman, will be completed on 25 Apr 18 at Jamnagar. 

             To honour the old war horse in its new residence, the induction ceremony of Dakota VP-905 is scheduled on 04 May 18 at Air Force Station Hindan. The ceremony will include the representatives from the OEM, dignitaries from the High Commission of the UK and the proud veterans of the IAF who have operated this magnificent flying machine.

            An aircraft of this generation being flown to India from across the World after its restoration, is an unprecedented event in the history of the IAF and joins our vintage flight which was raised in Palam in 1988. The Present day heritage aircraft in Vintage Flight are Howard and Tiger moth with plans afoot to add a wider variety of military aircraft which forms a part of our rich ancestry.

                The 6th edition of Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) and Conclave of Chiefs is being hosted by Iran at Tehran from 23 to 25 April 2018. The Chief of the Naval Staff is leading a four member Indian delegation for the event.

The IONS was conceived by the Indian Navy in 2008. The forum seeks to enhance maritime cooperation among navies of the littoral states of the Indian Ocean Region by providing an open and inclusive forum for discussion on regionally relevant maritime issues that would lead to common understanding on the way ahead. The inaugural edition of IONS was held in February 2008 at New Delhi, with Indian Navy as the Chair for two years. This was followed by UAE from 2010 - 2012, South Africa from 2012 - 2014, Australia from   2014 - 2016 and Bangladesh from 2016 - 2018. 

The IONS Charter of Business was agreed upon by the Conclave of Chiefs and brought into effect in February 2014. A relatively young forum, barely in its 10th year of existence, it has grown into a formidable organisation with 23 members and 09 observers. As the founder nation, India will also be conducting commemorative activities in November 2018 at Kochi, for celebrating its 10th Anniversary this year.

The visit of the Chief of the Naval Staff is also aimed at consolidating bilateral naval relations between India and Iran and to explore new avenues for naval cooperation. Admiral Sunil Lanba will also hold bilateral discussions with the Commander IRI Navy, and other participating ‘Chiefs of Navy/ Head of Maritime Agencies’.

                            As part of ongoing exercise ‘GaganShakti-2018’, the Operational Commands of the IAF planned and executed Inter Valley Troop Transfer (IVTT) in coordination with affiliated Indian Army Commands. IVTT, a major Joint Operation, was conducted in the high hills of Northern and North-Eastern Sector. The aim of the exercise was to validate the capability of the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army to quickly transfer and redeploy acclimatized troops, in the simulated objective area. These operations are conducted to reposition troops from one valley to another, to counter any evolving threat and to surprise or offensively exploit the weakness of the adversary.

In the mountainous terrain the movement of the troops from one valley to another is a challenging task. The redeployment of forces from one area of interest to another may at times take couple of days. IVTT operations help to reposition the desired forces within a couple of hours. 

All the three commands of IAF conducted a company level exercise in their area of operations, in a time sensitive environment. This tactical transfer of troops not only validated Joint Operations between the IAF & the Indian Army, but also showcased the capability of the IAF to operationalise forward ALG’s by setting up communications and refueling facilities, and preparing aircraft operating surface.   C-130 and AN-32 tactical transport aircraft and Mi-17 V5 / ALH helicopters are used for these missions. Owing to their versatile maneuvering capabilities, these platforms are most adaptable in an extremely demanding high altitude terrain. 

The operations were meticulously planned by the planning staff and the aircrew executed the demanding and rigorous operations by flying in a coordinated manner, giving due importance to the flight safety. In addition to the aircrew, the maintenance and administrative personnel, worked relentlessly through day and night, to ensure smooth conduct of these high intensity operations.

                            Hon’ble Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman visited Air Force Station Chabua today, to witness and assess the ongoing IAF operations. She was accompanied by Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa. They visited Pasighat Advanced Landing Ground, where the operations by Su-30 MKI fighters, C-17 Globemaster aircraft and rocket loading on Mi-17 V5 helicopters were demonstrated. At Pasighat ALG, they also witnessed a mesmerizing assault drill by the IAF’s Garuds, who had landed earlier by the C-17 Globemaster.

           

            Hon’ble RM thereafter visited the Air to Ground weapons range at Dullong Mukh, where a well planned and coordinated strike package of Su-30 aircraft orchestrated precise and concentrated delivery of Laser Guided 1000 Lbs, conventional 1000 Lbs and 100 Kg bombs. Mi-17 V5 Helicopters also demonstrated their strike capability in the armed role wherein they delivered 80mm rockets on a simulated target.

 

            After witnessing the mesmerizing ALG and strike operations, she witnessed accelerated fighter operations at Chabua, interacted with the air warriors and was also briefed on employment of Air Power in the defence of Eastern Sector.

 

            To gauge the operational capability and preparedness of the IAF, the Hon’ble RM has been visiting various Air Force establishments. Recently, she had flown a Su-30 MKI aircraft at Jodhpur, to gain first hand experience of the operational capability of this versatile fighter platform. These visits by the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri would  go a long way in enhancing the motivation of the air warriors and bolstering their commitment towards security of the Nation.

 

            Exercise Gaganshakti-2018, is a large scale IAF exercise which is currently in its second phase. The assets have now been deployed along the northern region and operations are taking place in full swing. These operations, under the umbrella of net centricity, supported by combat enablers like AWACS, FRA and ISR assets, will give the operators a near real time experience of conducting sustained and challenging operations in a simulated short and intense war scenario.

                As part of the ongoing massive IAF exercise ‘Gaganshakti-2018', fighters, helicopters and transport assets have been deployed at the Advanced Landing Grounds (ALG). The ALGs are short prepared / unprepared airstrips close to the borders in the valleys, which have limited rail/road connectivity due to challenging terrain. ALGs located strategically offer an opportunity for swift mobility of troops and equipment close to our Northern and North Eastern borders.

A large number ALGs have been operationalised and are being utilised for conducting Inter Valley Troop Transfers (IVTT), Special Heliborne Operations, Air Landed operations and Special Operations by SFs, close to the simulated objective areas. SU-30s have also been operating from most ALGs in the NE sector. The full gamut of support services has been mobilised & operationalised at these ALGs for seamless conduct of these operations.

The challenges faced by our pilots in landing at these ALGs are unpredictable weather, undulating terrain, narrow corridor of approach / manoeuvring and short runway lengths. Braving these odds, the IAF pilots are undertaking these daring operations with extreme precision and professionalism, thus giving strategic fillip to these tactical operations. IVTT operations were carried out in Uttar Bharat Hills and at the Tezu-Walong in the North East sector. The support to these operations was possible due to the presence of ALGs at these strategic locations.

This exercise has proven to be an excellent opportunity for honing the skills of our aircrew and the support services to carry out these exacting operations.

                During both phases of Ex Gagan Shakti, the IAF is effectively exercising its Maritime war fighting concepts on both the Western and Eastern seaboards.  Air Dominance, over the entire extended area of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) in support of the Indian Navy (IN) is being demonstrated by employment of combat enablers like the FRA (Flight Refueling Aircraft) in conjunction with our maritime fighter forces of the Su-30 and Jaguar class carrying potent long distance anti shipping weaponry.

Missions have been flown in the initial phase to address both near and in depth targets over the Western Sea Board utilising Su-30 and Jaguar fighter aircraft equipped with the potent Brahmos and Harpoon Anti ship missiles respectively.  The Su-30 ac has also showcased its strategic reach by operating from the eastern most air bases on the peninsula and engaging maritime targets well out into the western seaboard with support of AAR.  After quick repositioning of Maritime Assets the focus has now shifted in Phase–II to addressing targets over the Eastern Sea Board right upto the Mallaca Straits.  The full compliment of Maritime Assets would now operate from bases in the  Southern peninsula and Andaman & Nicobar islands. Extensive missions would be flown by the Su-30 and Jaguar  in conjunction with the IN P-8i MR ac  using long range weapons  to refine and practice offensive and defensive tactics against maritime targets.

 Such demonstrations of extended reach utilizing potent standoff weapons in Joint coordinated Operations with the IN  has adequately show cased the IAF ability  to support the IN in order to dominate the  IOR and effectively address any misadventure by an adversary in our area of interest.

                As part of the ongoing IAF exercise ‘Gaganshakti-2018’, in a joint operation, the IAF and Indian Army Parachute Brigade undertook a Battalion level airborne assault on the evening and night of 14 Apr 18, in the desert sector. This assault included paradrop of 560 paratroopers, combat vehicles and GPS guided cargo platforms. The landing force was dropped behind the simulated enemy lines to soften up the likely resistance to our own armoured offensive. The airborne force comprised six C-130J and seven An-32 aircraft launched from multiple IAF bases. The force was provided aerial surveillance by AWACS and protected by a Flight of SU-30 Air Superiority Fighters. 

Airborne operations are a means of aerial insertion of troops, equipment or supplies directly into the battle zone. Airborne operations are high risk operations which are based on accurate intelligence, dynamic air dominance by own forces and criticality of requirement by ground forces. Airborne assault is a subset of Airborne Operations wherein combat troops and equipment are para dropped into the tactical battle area. These troops have specific tasks like disrupting enemy lines of communication, capture/ destruction of critical enemy infrastructure.

The accuracy and outcome of the mission highlights IAF’s multi spectral capabilities and its efficiency in providing timely support to ground forces.

                As part of the ongoing massive IAF exercise ‘Gaganshakti-2018’, the Indian Air Force conducted a Mass Casualty Air Evacuation Drill in the Northern sector. 88 Casualties were airlifted from Leh and taken to Chandigarh by C-17.  The C-17 Globe Master Aircraft was converted for this role by fixing support structures for the stretchers, in the main cabin.  An indigenously developed Patient Transfer Unit (PTU) capable of providing In-Flight Critical Care to patients was demonstrated during the exercise. 

After landing at Chandigarh, these patients were evacuated to Command Hospital, Chandimandir.  For swift transfer of the patients in ambulances to the Hospital, a green corridor was made in liaison with Chandigarh civil authorities. 

With this demonstration the IAF has proven its flexibility and quick response in carrying out mass casualty evacuations. This capability will also be utilised by the IAF in case of Human Assistance & Disaster Relief operations near the incident locations by even landing on the designated highways.

                As part of the ongoing massive IAF exercise ‘Gaganshakti-2018’, on 14 Apr 18 the IAF conducted maritime air operations on the Western sea board, with the clear aim of air dominance and deep strike validation over the extended area of interest in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). In the long range strike concept validation, the Su-30s, airborne from a base on the eastern coast engaged multiple targets, in the western seaboard, at distances beyond 2500 Km, and landed at a southern base, thus covering a total distance of 4000 Km, in a single mission. These staggering ranges were made possible by support of IL-78 Flight Refueling Aircraft, thus ensuring long range strike capabilities for our fighter aircraft. These joint operations have Indian Navy P-8i aircraft and AWACS of IAF in support.

Exercise Gaganshakti has provided an ideal environment to evaluate Joint Operations with the Indian Navy, to test enablers such as AWACS and FRAs in the Op matrix and in conjunction with Su-30 and Jaguar ac.  The exploitation of the combat support assets helps to extend the reach in the entire IOR, our strategic area of influence.

                A Memorandum of Undersanding (MoU) was signed between the Indian Army and Axis Bank on the Defence Salary Package on 13 Apr 2018. The first MoU between Axis Bank and the Indian Army was signed in 2011 and was renewed on 24 Mar 2015. The current MoU is tailor-made to suit the requirements of serving soldiers, pensioners and families.

 

The signing-in ceremony was chaired by the Director General (MP&PS), Lt Gen SK Saini and was attended by the top dignitaries of Axis Bank headed by Mr Sanjay Sailas, President and Head, Retail Banking, Axis Bank.

 

Recently, Indian Army has also signed a MoU with HDFC bank. MoUs are considered for inception and renewal with banks on analyzing their utility and suitability to the requirements of serving soldiers, pensioners and families. Army is hoping that this MoU will benefit a large number of serving and retired Army personnel who are having their accounts with Axis bank; and also provide them an opportunity to access modern banking facilities.

 

Under the current MoU, apart from other benefits, the Army personnel will get free personal accident death cover and free permanent total disability cover of Rs 30 lakh and free educational cover of up to Rs 2 Lakh for children between the age of 12 and 20 years.

                Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and Bharat Earth Movers Ltd. (BEML) have unveiled its latest product viz 155mm 52 Cal Mounted Gun system at a function held at the ongoing DefExpo 2018 in Chennai. It was launched jointly by CMD, BEML Shri Deepak Kumar Hota and DGOF & Chairman OFB Shri S K Chourasia. 

The uniqueness of this project is that it has been completely and independently designed and manufactured by OFB in association with BEML & BEL and is therefore a shining example of ‘Make in India’. The gun is equipped with the state-of-the-art laying and sighting system such as GPS aided INS, muzzle velocity feeder data management, day and night firing, ballasting computer system capability.

The base vehicle used for the gun system is the BEML-TATRA 8X8 truck with all differential lockable and a powerful 300 KW (402 HP) engine, which provides it a power to weight ratio of more than 10KW/ton. This is a high mobility vehicle with independent wheel suspension and swinging half axles to provide enhanced cross-country mobility. The vehicle has a cruising speed of 80 km/hr on road and more than 30 km/hr in cross-country and has a cruising range of 1000 km without refuelling.

The armament used in the 155 mm 52 Cal has a target destruction capability of approximately 42 kms. The Gun System combines with the advantage of high mobility performance of a truck with accurate long range fire power of a 155 mm 52 Cal gun and with its onboard ammunition storage capability of 18 rounds of HE shells as well as 18 BMCS and 2-6 chargers. It can be automatically deployed in any terrain and can perform a mission independently.

With its high strategic manoeuvrability in all types of terrain it will serve as an all weather reinforcement for the infantry and will be a present force multiplier for the Indian artillery.

                            Major IAF level exercise Gagan Shakti has started from 11 Apr 18. This year over 1100 aircraft have been deployed at their operational locations. This exercise is also unique as LCA our indigenous fighters are being deployed at forward bases. During the first phase of the exercise, today all the deployed LCA aircraft had participated. The operational efficiency and mission worthiness of these platforms would be put to test in a real time intense exercise environment. A milestone towards ‘Make in India’, LCA will employ Close Combat and Beyond Visual Range Air to Air missiles in a simulated scenario apart from Air to Ground weapons.

 

            The IAF has consistently encouraged the development of indigenous defence production capability and capacities. A look at the past demonstrates the IAF’s participation and promotion of indigenisation programs. It is proud moment for our test pilots as they have been involved in its development since 1990’s.

 

            This versatile multirole fighter would be put through its operational paces towards validating concepts. Ex-Gaganshakti will test the LCA across a varied spectrum encompassing Air Defence and Strike capabilities amongst others. The employment of LCA in the exercise will go a long way in incorporating its capabilities in the operational matrix of the IAF.

                During the Exercise GaganShakti-18, the IAF has formalised the concept of a Forward Surgical Centre (FSC).A Forward Surgical Centre is set up at a remote forward location in the IAF with the aim of enhancing the medical capabilities at a forward base which is located away from a service hospital. The establishment of FSC at a forward base enables immediate life and limb saving surgery and stabilization of the patient. Evacuation rear-ward to a higher surgical centre could then be undertaken at an opportune time during operations.

 

Air Force Station Naliya is the first AF Station where an FSC has been operationalised, using existing men and material of the IAF. Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa PVSM AVSM YSM VM ADC Chief of the Air Staff visited the FSC at Naliya and he was impressed with the set up. It has a dedicated surgical team, equipped to undertake 6-8 surgeries a day. FSCs are also being established at Phalodi and Sirsa.

 

The availability of FSCs at remote forward AF bases would be a major boost to the morale of not only the air warriors in the IAF, but also for soldiers in the Army who face the brunt of enemy forces.

                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) transferred eight technologies to seven industries from private and public sector in the presence of Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman during DefExpo India – 2018 at Thiruvidanthai, Kancheepuram district on the East Coast Road near Chennai, today. The spectrum of products include missiles, torpedoes, grenades, sonars, sonar dome, gas turbine technologies and Identification of Friend and Foe (IFF) systems.

This occasion saw the symbolic handing over of the total accrued Transfer of Technology (ToT) fee of Rs 192 crore by Chairman DRDO & Secretary, Department of Defence R&D Dr. S Christopher to Raksha Mantri arising from 290 ToTs by DRDO to industries from 2015 to till date.  A record number of 112 ToTs were executed in 2017 and a record ToT fee of Rs 158 crore has accrued in this year alone till date, breaking all previous records. 

This will provide a major boost to the ""Make-In-India"" programme envisioned by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Following three products were handed over to the Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba by Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman:-


	Processor based Moored Mines
	Advanced VLF Modulator & De-Modulator
	Modern ESM System - Varuna


 

The Light Combat Aircraft - Tejas, which is designed and developed by  ADA – a autonomous society of DRDO was amongst the major product that found mention during the function. So was BrahMos missile, the major sub systems of which were indigenized and developed in line with Make in India by DRDL, a laboratory of DRDO, and productionized as well as marketed by BrahMos Aerospace Limited, a joint venture of DRDO and NPOM, Russia.

To celebrate sixty years of its existence, DRDO has had a number of events to commemorate the celebrations such as outreach programmes for industry and S&T in schools & colleges, S&T exhibitions, Cyber Challenge, Public Lectures by Young Scientists, National Level Essay Competition and Skill India initiatives.

A commemorative postal stamp designed by the Department of Post & Telegraph was released on the occasion to honour DRDO scientists, both past and present, who have contributed in the 60 year journey of making India self-sufficient and self-reliant in Defence technologies and systems.

                Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman addressed a meeting of India’s Defence Attaches (DAs) here today. It was the first such conference held with our DAs, with a view to enhance their role towards implementation of India’s defence cooperation and engagement with foreign countries. India has Resident Defence Attaches in 44 countries, who are accredited to a total of 95 countries.

Addressing the DAs, Raksha Mantri complimented their efforts to expand and strengthen India’s defence engagement in bilateral, regional and multilateral frameworks. Raksha Mantri outlined India’s interest in building stronger military to military cooperation, training and capacity building as well as cooperation on defence industry and technology with our partners. She encouraged the DAs to play a more pro-active role in this process, highlighting India’s views and positions on the evolving regional and global security scenario as well as its rapid economic, technical and military advancements.

Enumerating ongoing efforts to expand defence manufacturing in India under Prime Minister’s Make in India initiative, Raksha Mantri also stressed the need for DAs to engage effectively with all stakeholders in the defence sector, including DPSUs as well as private industry, to expand broader defence cooperation linkages.

The programme for the Conference today included interactive sessions between DAs and Services HQs, Secretary (Defence Production) and Chairman DRDO as well as discussions with defence industry representatives. Deputy National Security Adviser and senior officials of Ministry of External Affairs will address the conference tomorrow. Thereafter, the DAs would be attending the DEFEXPO 2018 in Chennai.

                A major contract through capital procurement route, for procurement of 1,86,138 Bullet Proof Jackets (BPJs) has been signed. The impending requirement of the Indian Army for effective BPJs, has been met after successful conduct of stringent field evaluation trials.

The contracted BPJs have contemporary and state-of-the-art specifications with added protectional level and coverage area. These ergonomically designed BPJs have modular parts, thereby providing immense protection and flexibility to soldiers operating in different operational situations ranging from long distance patrolling to high risk room intervention scenarios. The new BPJs will provide 360 degree protection to the soldier in combat, including from latest hard steel core bullets. 

The concerns for BPJs for the Indian Army, have been raised at the highest levels, even in the civil domain and media reports amidst heightened security situation, along the borders and in the hinterland in the disturbed areas. The provisioning of this operationally urgent and very critical equipment concerning personal ballistic protection, will boost the confidence of the soldier and provide moral ascendency to security forces.

The case was processed as a ‘Buy Indian’. The provision of these new BPJs was done by Indian manufacturers who were successful in the trials. This has given an impetus to the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government, and provides confidence that the Indian Industry is capable of fulfilling the requirements of Indian Army for its personal protective equipment.

                     An all encompassing coordinated and composite exercise named Gaganshakti is being conducted by the IAF from 08-22 Apr 18. The aim of this exercise is real time coordination, deployment and employment of Air Power in a short & intense battle scenario.

     During Gaganshakti IAF will exercise the entire machinery to validate its concept of operations and war waging capability. With each successive exercise, the lessons learnt in the previous exercises and doctrinal precepts are put to test, for developing new concepts. This year the IAF has planned tactics that will be tested in a real time scenario.

     Concepts of accelerated operations, Network Centric Operations, long range missions with concentrated weapon releases across all air to ground ranges in India, inter valley troop transfer, flexible use of airspace, Joint Maritime Air Operations with the Indian Navy, Joint Operations with the Indian Army, simulated Combat Search and Rescue for effective extraction of downed aircrew behind enemy lines, Special Operations with Garuds, Mass Casualty Evacuation from highway and ALG Operations, to name a few, would be tested. It is for the first time that efficacy and integration of LCA in the operational matrix of the IAF is planned. The logistics stamina of the IAF and the ability to sustain continuous operations through day & night would be put to test.

     Efficient exploitation of combat support assets, including use of enablers like AWACS, AEW&C, FRA, Transport aircraft and ISR assets forms an integral part of the exercise. Special operations employing transport aircraft and helicopter as well as Special Forces have been planned during the exercise. The IAF will utilize this opportunity to validate new strategies and tactics, especially to validate recently inducted or upgraded assets and equipments.

     While it is an IAF centric exercise, it is planned to be executed keeping in mind the ""Joint Operational Doctrine"". The requirements of the other services are being met and the same has been factored while planning the exercise settings. Joint operations, including CSFO, Airborne Ops, Air Landed Ops and Maritime Ops, have also been planned.

     Apart from wartime drills, IAF will also practice and validate various Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief drills that the IAF is expected to undertake from time to time. Some such measure would involve mobilization of Air Ambulance version of transport aircraft and helicopters to airlift simulated sitting and bedridden casualties to metros/big cities having good medical facilities and would include evacuation of casualties from highways that facilitate such operations.    

     Full spectrums of operations are planned by IAF with special focus on `Network Centric Operations', and ‘Effect Based Operations'.

     This exercise is aimed at coordinating operations, maintenance and administrative responses to achieve the stated objectives of the Indian Air Force, in case of any contingency. This exercise will hone the war fighting skills of the air warriors in a real time scenario thus affirming the IAF's role as the cutting edge of our nation's military capability.

                Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, who is on three-day visit to Russia to attend ‘VII Moscow Conference on International Security’ from 03 to 05 April 2018, addressed the II Plenary Session of the Conference on the theme titled ‘Global Security in a Polycentric World’ covering aspects related to current global defence, security and strategic scenario on April 4 in the Russian capital.  

Raksha Mantri stated that for India, cooperation with Russia is vital in ensuring stability and security in our shared Eurasian neighbourhood, especially in addressing the menace of terrorism. She also spoke about terrorism in the region, persistence of instability in Afghanistan, rising threats to security in the wider Asia Pacific region, non-traditional security challenges such as climate change, food and energy insecurity, financial instability and the need for cooperation amongst the countries to address these issues.

Following is the full text of the address delivered by Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman at the Seventh Moscow Conference on International Security (MCIS) on “Global Security in a Polycentric World”

“Mr. Moderator, 

Your Excellencies Defence Ministers and other dignitaries, 

Distinguished delegates. 

It is a pleasure to address the Seventh Moscow Conference on International Security. I thank Defence Minister General Sergei Shoigu for the invitation.

At the outset, I compliment the organisers of the conference for the excellent arrangements made. The programme of the Conference covers several areas of contemporary relevance.

The theme of this session addresses a key aspect of the current global defence, security and strategic scenario. It is appropriate that we are discussing this subject in Moscow. Russia has re-established its role and influence in global strategic and defence matters. 

Russia has also established new partnerships, even as it continues to build ties with older friends and allies. At the same time, relations between Russia and some countries are now beset with serious differences. This has created a complex dynamic. Either way, the solution to the key challenges we face today require Russia’s active involvement.

I welcome the statements by Defence Minister Shoigu and other Russian leaders in the opening session stressing Russia’s intent to explore all possible avenues for dialogue and a constructive approach to resolving differences.

For us in India, Russia has been and remains a long-standing friend and partner with whom we share a Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership. India and Russia have just concluded a year of commemorative events to mark the 70th Anniversary of diplomatic relations. Over these seven decades, India and Russia have built a relationship of mutual trust and confidence in a range of areas, especially defence. 

We therefore welcome Russia’s growing global engagement and remain keen to continue consultations and coordination with Russia on international and regional issues. For India, cooperation with Russia is vital in ensuring stability and security in our shared Eurasian neighbourhood, especially in addressing the menace of terrorism. We also seek a cooperative relationship with Russia for broad based and mutually beneficial economic growth and development in the region.

The problems confronting the international community today cannot be solved by any one country or group of countries. 

The issues facing us today require an inclusive approach within broader and consultative frameworks. It is in this context that I offer my comments today on the theme of this session, namely, ‘global security in a polycentric world’.

Distinguished delegates, 

A key facet of the prevailing international situation is the continued and rising unpredictability in relations between major powers. This is both unprecedented and a matter of concern. 

The current deterioration of ties between Russia and the West is a reflection of this trend. We also see the manifestation of this instability at the manner in which major powers as well as other influential actors have sought to address a range of regional issues and conflicts. 

At a fundamental level, such divergent approaches indicate wider diffusion of power in the international system, in particular the rise of Asia. This is a positive development in which India also seeks to play its due role. 

However, it is essential that we manage such profound changes keeping in mind the need to balance change and stability.

Specific and concrete efforts must be made to work towards enhancing mutual confidence. We need to avoid perspectives that seek to enhance narrow gains while undermining the larger good.

In the economic sphere, we need to guard against protectionism. Barriers to movement of skilled labour and the closing of borders are unlikely to address the issues involved.

We also need to ensure that benefits of growth continue to flow to less affluent regions. We cannot achieve stability by devising new ways to perpetuate affluence and keeping parts of the world in relative deprivation.

The role of Asia will be central in this process. For the near future, Asian economies will remain the drivers of global growth. 

However, violent conflict in parts of West Asia, persistence of instability in Afghanistan and rising threats to security in the wider Asia Pacific region are threatening the gains made over the past few decades of growth and development in Asia.

In particular, the rise of extremist, fundamentalist and terrorist groups needs to be addressed urgently. Violent activities of these groups are also opening up newer sectarian fissures which pose longer term challenges to stability within and across borders.

The situation in Afghanistan remains of concern. There is no choice between a political process and dealing effectively with the forces of terrorism and violence in that country. A policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism is essential if we are to sustain the gains made. We must also, in the face of newer provocations and terrorism, persist with efforts to consolidate capacities of the Afghan government and security forces.

India is committed to supporting the emergence of a secure, stable and peaceful Afghanistan. We believe this is achievable with the continued commitment of the international community. India will continue its assistance and support to the people of Afghanistan. Even as we do as much as we can, we are keen to work with all partners that share similar objectives.

The scourge of terrorism remains a primary international security challenge. Terrorists are reinventing themselves in newer and more dangerous manifestations. The radicalisation of young minds using new technologies and social media networks, the trend of lone-wolf attacks and the continuing patronage of some irresponsible states to terrorist groups, need to be addressed in a comprehensive manner.

Efforts to establish a territorial base in West Asia by terrorists have been dealt a body blow. This was possible because broad objectives of all players, in particular the major international actors, were in alignment. This has been a silver lining in an otherwise challenging global scenario. It highlights the possibilities for greater cooperation in addressing the shared challenges we all face. 

Further efforts are necessary to ensure that there is no re-emergence of terrorism in the region and prevent its spill-over onto the wider region by returning terrorists. Better information sharing and intelligence exchanges are essential to address the threat. Cooperation in this effort can provide the basis for collaborative steps on other issues of mutual interest.

We should also resolutely resist attempts by some states to retain influence through terrorist proxies. We in India are well aware of such nefarious designs. Efforts by states to continue training, funding or ideological support to terrorist groups for their narrow objectives should be repulsed effectively, using forceful methods where necessary. 

The resurgence of territorial disputes in the maritime domain is another concern. Maritime territorial disputes are extremely complex. We need to ensure that such issues are managed effectively and solely through peaceful means.

The past few decades of growth have transformed the Indo-Pacific region into the most dynamic engine of the global economy.  We need to ensure that the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region is not put at risk through unilateral actions that can undermine regional peace and stability.

The rights of freedom of navigation and over-flight as well as unimpeded commerce should be ensured. For India, this is vital to sustain its own economic engagement with the Indo-Pacific region for mutual benefit.

The efforts to reduce tensions in the Korean peninsula need to be taken forward. India has long pointed to linkages between proliferation in that region to the detriment of our own security environment.   

There is also scope for cooperative approaches to address the growing salience of non-traditional security challenges such as climate change, food and energy insecurity, financial instability and the disruptive effects of technology. Effective management of such threats, including cyber-security, as well as meeting humanitarian assistance and disaster relief requirements are areas where established and rising powers can work together for the broader benefit of all.

Overall, the current international scenario has laid bare the challenges posed by great power competition. At the same time, it has illustrated the potential benefits of cooperative approaches. 

In a multi-polar world we will therefore need to work to broaden areas of convergence and minimise differences. There is no scope for expansionism, unilateral approaches or for beggar thy neighbour policies. 

We must also continue to seek inclusive frameworks for dialogue and cooperation that involve all responsible stakeholders, whether bilaterally, regionally or multilaterally. 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

India is playing its due role in maintenance of regional and international peace and stability. India’s continued economic rise over the past few decades has helped lift millions of its citizens out of poverty. The government is keen to enhance transparency, inclusion and growth, and to leverage innovation and the potentialities of the digital economy in this effort.

In our region, we have worked to share the benefits of our own growth by seeking to elevate the economic trajectory of our neighbours. 

            With our renewed emphasis on regional connectivity, continued focus on our Act East policy and strong efforts to expand engagement with countries in our extended neighbourhood ranging from West Asia, the Gulf and Africa as well as the wider Indian Ocean Region, India is today creating a dynamic network of international partnerships. 

Economic and diplomatic engagement with the Eurasian region is a key priority for India. Building on our strong ties with Russia, we are strengthening our linkages with Central Asian countries. We continue to manage the complexities in the India-China relationship even as we seek to make progress within the framework of a broader developmental partnership. India is also working with ASEAN countries and other partners to build a regional architecture that is open, balanced and ensures sovereignty and security of all countries.

Defence and security cooperation is an increasingly important aspect of India’s regional and global engagement. We are developing a range of military to military ties, sharing best practices, building capacities through training as well as cooperating on defence industry and R&D for mutual benefit. 

Our efforts are making considerable progress. I am confident that India’s partnerships will contribute to a more stable and peaceful environment, spur greater economic development and establish India’s role as a factor for growth and stability in our region and beyond.

India will continue to work closely with Russia and other international partners on all issues of mutual interest, both bilaterally as well as in broader frameworks such as BRICS, SCO and other forums. Effective cooperation between India and Russia will be a key factor in enhancing regional and global security in future.

Thank you!”

                The Defence Accounts Department is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the pay accounts of million plus Jawans and JCOs of Indian Army. The Pay Accounts Offices (PAOs) of this department are at the forefront of the concerted efforts that are being put in to ensure that these men get their correct dues within reasonable time frame.

An important requirement to meet the expectations of the end user and ensuring their contentment is that the JCOs/ORs understands their dues and their entitlement. If they further appreciate the processes involved in acceptance or denial of any dues, it would equip them with enough knowledge to have better awareness to contest entitlement inconsistencies, if any.

This handbook was conceptualized with the aim to provide more grasp on the rules of entitlement as well as to have complete transparency of procedures in the PAOs. This first edition contains all the procedures right from the inception stage of publishing and processing of the daily Part II orders, till the final processing and disbursement of entitlements.

The book also details the functional boundaries and constraints of PAOs. The chapters are so ordered that they lay down entitlement parameters in a user-friendly manner. Each of the chapter seeks to enlighten the JCOs/OR on the documentary and procedural requirements for processing an entitlement.

The audit and procedural requirements behind processing of Contingent Bill items, AFPP Fund claims, MACPs, transfer/deputation, leave/TD etc., are all detailed in distinct chapters of the handbook. The deductions from pay and allowances, bank account details, etc. are also elaborated in the book.

In a unique separate chapter interpretation of the Monthly Pay Slip has been elaborated. It details item-wise description of notifications provided in the Pay Slip, which, it is expected, would not only ameliorate grievances of Jawans at the inception stage but also give him confidence regarding legitimacy of the entitlements so granted. A chapter on general FAQs is also included for assistance and ready reference.

The book has sought to cover all the parameters of pay and allowances of JCOs/ORs, incorporating the 7th CPC entitlements as well, wherever available on the date of publication. This book in pdf format is also available on the website of PAO(OR) AMC & 11 GRRC as well as of PCDA(CC), Lucknow.

                A Memorandum of Undertaking (MoU) was signed between the Indian Army and HDFC Bank on the Defence Salary Package on 03 Apr 2018. The first MoU between HDFC Bank and the Indian Army was signed in 2011 and was renewed on 13 Mar 2015.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy & Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that India's ""Act East"" policy is crucial to the entire South East Asia.

 

Speaking at a conference on ""India-Myanmar Trade and Connectivity"" organized by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations here today, Dr Jitendra Singh said, Myanmar is one of the key pillars of India's ""Act East"" policy, since through the land borders it connects India via the North Eastern States with the South East Asian countries. A significant fact to note is that many North Eastern States share a common border with Myanmar, he said.

 

Emphasizing that to ""Act East"" effectively beyond the eastern borders, it is essential to first act east effectively proximal to the borders by promoting the potential of the region on this side of the border, Dr Jitendra Singh said, for example, Myanmar is not only geographically a proximate country with strong historical and economic linkages, but, in addition, the people on two sides of the border share common lifestyle, common food habits and common cultural traits. Therefore, he said, any meaningful trade or business engagement with Myanmar can be done primarily through the products and goods inherent to the North Eastern States bordering this country. 

 

In the last four years under the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Dr Jitendra Singh referred to a paradigm shift in the Government's approach towards the Northeast, particularly with regard to its development. The ""Act East"" policy also includes the endeavour to open new avenues of job generation and entrepreneurship which would also make the Northeast the focus of India's economic and diplomatic engagement across the eastern borders, he said.

 

Referring to the constraints of connectivity and transport as important impediments to the growth of trade and investment in the region, Dr Jitendra Singh said, in the last four years, a fast-track progress has been made to address these issues. He said, new airports have come up, rail tracks have been set-up in the States which had never seen a train before and new Inland Waterways are also being developed.

 

As an evidence of the Central Government's high priority to the region, Dr Jitendra Singh referred to the recently framed exclusive Northeast Industrial Development Policy, the amendment to the Indian Forest Act of 1927 and setting up of an exclusive NITI Aayog Forum for North-East. With respect to Myanmar, he also referred to an MoU finalized recently between the Mandalay Region Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the business groups from North Eastern India.

                The President of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Shri Rashesh Shah called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy & Space, Dr Jitendra Singh, here today and discussed business and investment plans for Northeast.

Shri Rashesh Shah referred to renewed focus on Northeast in the last three or four years ever since the Government took over and said that the entire business community and business trade organizations across the country are now looking forward to the Northeast for unexplored avenues. He said, the business community is particularly interested in tourism and agriculture sector, which has immense potential in the region.

Dr Jitendra Singh suggested that FICCI should organize series of awareness programmes in the peripheral States of Jammu & Kashmir and Northeast to spread awareness both among the business community as well as consumers about the kind of investments and business ventures, most optimally suitable for each of the given regions. He particularly emphasized the need to promote young Start-ups and young entrepreneurs from across the country to come forward and invest in these areas.

Shri Shah told Dr Jitendra Singh that very soon, FICCI will come out with a comprehensive proposal and plan in the form of a written document which would be the road- map for the best possible investments and industry initiatives in the times to come. He said that the FICCI will always look forward to Dr Jitendra Singh for continued support, as in the past.

                The first meeting of the newly constituted ‘NITI Forum for North East’ was held in Agartala, Tripura today. The meeting, organized by the NITI Aayog, Ministry of DoNER and the North Eastern Council (NEC), was co-chaired by the Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog, Shri Rajeev Kumar and the Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Dr. Jitendra Singh. Chief Minister of Tripura, Shri Biplab Kumar Deb, Chief Minister of Nagaland, Shri Neiphiu Rio and the Chief Minister of Meghalaya, Shri Conrad Sangma, besides Deputy Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Shri Chowna Mein also participated in the day-long deliberations. Senior Ministers, Chief Secretaries and senior officers of the Central Ministries and State Governments were also present.

 

In his inaugural address, Shri Rajiv Kumar said the focus of development projects in the NER will be based on the concept of “HIRA” (Highways, Inland Waterways, Railways and Airways) as spelled out by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He said emphasis will also be made on Education, Health and Skill Development in the region. He further said that Horticulture, Tourism, Food Processing, use of Bamboo and Made in North-East will be developed through five Mission Mode projects in a time-bound manner.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Jitendra Singh, said the Government has focused on development in a region which more or less remained out of the mainstream for the last seven decades since Independence. He said there has been a significant 21% rise in fund utilization in the North-East during the last three years. Dr. Jitendra Singh said the Central Government has now committed full 100% funding for development projects in the NER, as against 90-10 ratio earlier with the State Governments funding 10% of the total cost. 

 

Nagaland Chief Minister Shri Neiphiu Rio pointed out that Kohima is the only state capital in the North-East which does not have an airport. He said the State Government has acquired land for this purpose and at least one small airstrip at Kohima should be constructed for providing air connectivity to Nagaland under the UDAN scheme.

 

Meghalaya Chief Minister Shri Conrad Sangma said that development is the solution for all socio-economic problems in the region and through Infrastructure and Connectivity,  many development problems can be solved. He said that the National Games-2022 will be held in Meghalaya, which will coincide with the 75th Anniversary of Indian Independence. He further said that economic challenges of the NER can be met by removing the physical and economic barriers. Chief Minister of Tripura, Shri Biplab Kumar Deb thanked the Prime Minister for giving Tripura an opportunity to host this prestigious event. He said that the State bordering with Bangladesh from three sides imports more than Rs.300 crores annually from Bangladesh but exports a meager Rs.4.6 crores. He said certain provisions prohibit export of rubber from Tripura, but the same is routed through West Bengal. Shri Deb said Tripura has immense potential in fisheries as the state has the world’s best climate suitable for aquaculture but this has not been exploited.

 

Representatives of all eight member States of the NER gave their valuable suggestions on Moving towards a prosperous North East Region, the theme for today’s meeting. Secretary, DoNER Shri Naveen Verma and Secretary, NEC, Shri Ram Muivah explained the status of different development projects in the region.

 

The ‘NITI Forum for North East’ was constituted in February 2018 with an aim to ensure sustainable economic growth of the North Eastern Region (NER) of the country and periodically review the development status in NER.

                The New Chief Minister of Meghalaya, Shri Conrad Sangma called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy & Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and discussed with him a wide range of development projects and schemes in the State.

In the meeting, Dr Jitendra Singh told Shri Sangma that the immediate priority should be the upgradation of the Airport at Shillong. He said that it is an irony that Shillong, though being the original capital of erstwhile Assam, still does not have a full-fledged upgraded airport. He disclosed that the work of extending the length of the air-strip has already been funded by the Ministry of DoNER, but the overall upgradation of airport would require an active involvement of the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation. This, he said, is also essential for promoting other avenues including tourism.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the tourism potential of Meghalaya, in spite of its rich scenic beauty, has remained under-explored, but given the high priority accorded by the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, to the upliftment of the region, this sector is also being keenly attended. He stressed on the importance of encouraging ‘home tourism’, which has already picked up in Shillong and other destinations in the last two years. He also suggested to the Chief Minister whether a corporate five-star hotel chain could be persuaded to set up hotels in the State.

Shri Conrad Sangma told Dr Jitendra Singh that very soon he will revert back to him and hold a detailed meeting along with the Chief Secretary and other senior officers of the State Government, to put forward some of the other proposals for development projects. He said, as Chief Minister, his priority will be to concentrate and promote the three sectors of tourism, education and healthcare in a big way.

Shri Conrad Sangma was also informed by Dr Jitendra Singh that the Ministry of DoNER had set up ""APJ Abdul Kalam Study Centre"" at IIM Shillong, where the late President Kalam had breathed his last during a lecture visit.

                Following the Prime Minister’s clarion call on 2nd October 2014 for each individual to devote at least 100 hours to Swachhata through the year, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MDWS) in association with Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MYAS) has launched the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship – a novel and first of it’s kind initiative. The internship period commences from tomorrow, May 1, 2018 and ends on July 31, 2018. The programme aims to engage millions of youngsters across the country, to encourage them to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Mission in the spirit of a true janandolan. The Prime Minister in his address, Mann Ki Baat, yesterday called upon the youth to avail the benefits of the Internship and take forward the cleanliness movement.

Students can sign up for the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship by logging on to the portal www.sbsi.mygov.in which has already gone live. Besides students from college and Universities, youth from NYKS can also register for the internship.  Nodal officers at college level will coordinate the implementation of the internship.

Under the internship, all interns who complete at least 100 hours of sanitation related work in villages would be given a Swachh Bharat certificate. Those who complete the internship with additional, specified outputs would also gain 2 curriculum credits specially allowed by UGC. Additionally, top performers would receive awards at the College and University / District (NYKS), State and National Level. 

MHRD has already issued relevant instructions to college and University levels. States have been asked to facilitate the students as they fan out to villages to take up various Swachhata activities including Shramdan and awareness campaigns during the internship. The period for taking up the internship has been kept as a minimum of 100 hours any time from 1st May 2018 to 31st July 2018. The last date for registration is 15th May.

                Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation, Sushri Uma Bharti, today launched the GOBAR (Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources - DHAN scheme at the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI) Auditorium, Karnal in the presence of the Chief Minister of Haryana, Shri Manohar Lal Khattar. The scheme aims to positively impact village cleanliness and generate wealth and energy from cattle and organic waste. The scheme also aims at creating new rural livelihood opportunities and enhancing income for farmers and other rural people.

The Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) comprises two main components for creating clean villages – creating open defecation free (ODF) villages and managing solid and liquid waste in villages. With over 3.5 lakh villages, 374 districts and 16 States/UTsof the country being declared ODF, the stage is set for ODF-plus activities, including measures to enhance solid and liquid waste management. The GOBAR-DHAN scheme, with its focus on keeping villages clean, increasing the income of rural households, and generation of energy from cattle waste, is an important element of this ODF-plus strategy. The scheme envisages the implementation of 700 bio-gas units in different states of the country in 2018-19.

The scheme was launched today in Karnal by the Minister of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Sushri Uma Bharti, Haryana Chief Minister, Shri Manohar Lal Khattar, Minister of State for Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri S.S. Ahluwalia. Shri Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and other senior level officials of the Central and State Government were also present. 

Speaking on the occasion, Sushri Uma Bharti reiterated the Prime Minister’s statement, “Vikas tab hoga jab jan andolan banega” (A peoples’ movement will foster development). She thanked the people of India for making the Swachh Bharat Mission a true jan andolan. She spoke about the importance of Gobar-dhan as a key component of the ODF-plus strategy in the country. She spoke about the potential of converting waste into energy, and called upon people to accept change, follow change and participate in change happening in rural India under the Swachh Bharat Mission today. She mentioned that under GObar-Dhan, cooking gas would be provided to rural habitations and technical support would ensure that the schemes functioned on a sustainable basis. The Chief Minister of Haryana, Shri Manohar Lal Khattar wished the program success and committed on behalf of the State that Haryana would successfully implement the program with complete people’s participation. 

The guidelines of GOBAR-DHAN scheme were also launched which details of the scheme, implementation arrangements, financing provisions and roles and responsibilities of the Centre, State governments, districts and other stakeholders involved in implementation of the scheme. The IEC strategy for GOBAR-DHAN and successful case studies were also presented and field visits to bio-gas 

plants were also conducted after the launch. The launch was attended by sarpanches from the project villages, implementing agencies, officers from 14 states and district officers.

                It has come to the attention of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Swachh Bharat Mission, that some incorrect estimates of toilet costs constructed under SBM-G are being circulated on social media and reported in print and electronic media. 

This is to clarify that under the Swachh Bharat Mission - Gramin, each eligible beneficiary gets Rs. 12,000 as an incentive/subsidy to build a low cost but good quality household toilet. This centre and the state contribute to this incentive in the ratio of 60:40. The centre releases its share to the states, and it is the states who implement the program on the ground. 

While the average cost of a twin-pit leach pit toilet is about Rs. 12,000, it can vary based on local conditions. In some cases, the beneficiaries may also choose to spend more than just the government incentive in order to build even better quality toilets. Hence it is incorrect to suggest that the incentive is equivalent to the ""cost of a toilet"". 

Over 7 crore toilets have been constructed since the launch of the mission, and the sanitation coverage has more than doubled, from 39% in October 2014 to over 82% today.

                The Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) recently celebrated the culmination of the Champaran centenary celebrations and a weeklong “Satyagraha se Swachhagraha” campaign run in Bihar from 3rd April onwards. On April 10, 2018, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, addressed around 20,000 Swachhagrahis in Motihari, East Champaran district of Bihar. 

In the run-up to this event, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, in coordination with the Government of Bihar, worked to spread the message of Swachhata across the country by initiating the “Satyagraha se Swachhagraha” campaign from 3rd to 10th April. Around 10,000 Swachhagrahis from different parts of the country were invited to Bihar, where they worked with 10,000 Swachhagrahis from Bihar to “trigger” behaviour change throughout the 38 districts of the State and build momentum of the jan andolan further. 

The impetus for this campaign began after the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, took a video conference with District Collectors from the four focus States of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin), namely, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir. At this video conference, the Prime Minister emphasized that there could be no greater inspiration for completing this task, than the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He urged for teams to be formed at the district level to accelerate progress, especially in the run-up to the 101st anniversary of Bapu’s Champaran Satyagraha.

Motivated by the Prime Minister’s address, the districts of the four States showed unprecedented progress in the days that followed. From March 14th to April 10th 2018, Bihar saw 10.2 lakh toilets being built across its 38 districts. Most of this activity was seen during the Satyagraha se Swachhagraha campaign (April 3rd to 10th, 2018), wherein the focused activity by 20,000 Swachhagrahis across the State lent greater momentum to the campaign.

It has been reported by some media outlets that such a rate of progress is impossible based on the calculation of a “per day” or “per minute” rate of toilet construction, working backwards from these figures. This is an incorrect interpretation of the data of the progress reported in Bihar. A twin pit toilet typically takes 3-4 days to construct, and this activity happened in parallel across approximately 34,000 villages in Bihar. Dividing the total toilets constructed in this period (14th March – 10th April, 2018) by the number of villages in Bihar, this works out to 1.1 toilet constructed per day per village, which is easily doable. To calculate a “per minute” rate of these toilets is therefore misleading, as it incorrectly assumes construction of all toilets in one village sequentially.

Some media outlets have raised questions on the toilets constructed during this period. The Bihar government is working on identifying any incomplete toilets after the pits were dug for them in the period of the campaign, and is focusing on completing them urgently. Any misrepresentation of data on part of local administration will be strictly dealt with by the Bihar Government.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed 20,000 Swachhagrahis in Motihari, East Champaran district of Bihar. The event marked the culmination of a weeklong “Satyagraha se Swachhagraha” campaign run in Bihar from 3rd April onwards. At this event, associated with the clarion call “Chalo Champaran”, the Prime Minister also awarded ten Swachhagrahis who have performed outstandingly in their villages.

In the run-up to this event, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, in coordination with the Government of Bihar, worked to spread the message of Swachhata by initiating the “Satyagraha se Swachhagraha” campaign, from 3rd to 10th April. More than 10,000 Swachhagrahis from different parts of the country have been invited to Bihar, where they have been working with 10,000 Swachhagrahis from Bihar to “trigger” behaviour change throughout the 38 districts of the State and build momentum of the jan andolan further. 

Addressing the 20,000 Swachhagrahis gathered in Champaran, the Prime Minister said that their presence on the occasion was a great example of history repeating itself. 100 years after Mahatma Gandhi’s Satyagraha, the grassroots motivators and behavior change agents of Swachh Bharat are now leading a Swachhagraha, he said.

He said that he was confident that Bihar will also achieve the goals of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin). He lauded the State for having recently broken through the 50% mark in terms of rural sanitation coverage, and for building 8.5 lakh toilets in the run-up week to the Champaran anniversary itself.

The Prime Minister mentioned that under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin), in the last 3.5 years alone, 3.5 lakhs villages and over 350 districts, and 35 crore people have shunned open defecation. Nearly 7 crore toilets have been built and 14 States and UTs have already been declared ODF. The Prime Minister appreciated that toilets are now being called “Izzat Ghar” (House of Dignity) in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

 

The Prime Minister quoted a study done by UNICEF that found that a household in an ODF village in India saves Rs.50,000 every year by way of disease treatment costs averted, saving of livelihood by not falling ill, etc. He also mentioned a study that estimates that households in ODF villages in India have significantly better health indicators.

In his address to the gathering, Shri Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar, said that if we inspired the youth to imbibe the ideals and principles of Mahatma Gandhi, then a clean India will surely be built by the people of the country. He said that the Government of Bihar is committed to making the State Open Defecation Free well in time for the timeline set for the Swachh Bharat Mission, i.e. the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, October 2, 2019.

Speaking on the occasion, Sushri Uma Bharti, Minister of Drinking Water and Sanitation, said that Mahatma Gandhi launched the Champaran Satyagraha over a century ago, on 10th April, 1917, to give the country freedom from foreign rule. She added that this day, today, marks the “Satyagraha se Swachhagraha” campaign, which is aimed at achieving freedom from filth. 

In addition to addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister also inaugurated new initiatives by a number of central government ministries.

                The Prime Minister, ShriNarendraModi, will address 20,000 Swachhagrahis in Motihari, East Champaran district of Bihar tomorrow. The event is the culmination of a weeklong “Satyagraha se Swachhagraha” campaign run in Bihar from 3rdApril onwards. At this event, associated with the clarion call “ChaloChamparan”, the Prime Minister will also award ten Swachhagrahis who have performed outstandingly in their villages. Chief Minister of Bihar and Union Minister of Drinking Water and Sanitation will also be present at this event. In addition to addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister will also inaugurate new initiatives of the Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and NamamiGange in Bihar.

Mahatma Gandhi launched the Champaran Satyagraha over a century ago, on 10th April, 1917, to give the country freedom from foreign rule. April 10th, 2018 marks the end of the centenary year celebrations of the Champaran Satyagraha, and is going to be celebrated through the “Satyagraha se Swachhagraha” campaign, which is aimed at achieving freedom from filth. 

To commemorate this landmark, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, in coordination with the Government of Bihar, is working to spread the message of Swachhata across the country by initiating the “Satyagraha se Swachhagraha”campaign, from 3rd to 10th April. More than 10,000 Swachhagrahis from different parts of the country have been invited to Bihar, where they have been working with 10,000 Swachhagrahis from Bihar to “trigger” behaviour change throughout the 38 districts of the State and build momentum of the jan andolan further. 

Background: Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Gramin, launched on October 2, 2014 by the Prime Minister of India, ShriNarendraModi, is the largest behaviour change campaign ever attempted in the field of sanitation in the world. It aims to build an ODF (Open Defecation Free) and Swachh Bharat by October 2, 2019 as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary.

India is witnessing a sanitation revolution with the number of people in rural India, practising open defecation having fallen from 55 crores in October 2014 to 20 crores by April 2018. Sanitation has been proven, by various independent studies, to have a positive economic as well as health impact on families in rural India.

Under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin), 6.7 crore toilets have been built, 3.5 lakhs villages and over 360 districts, and 14 States and UTs have already been declared ODF. A recent survey conducted by an Independent Verification Agency across 90,000 households in over 6000 villages has found the rural toilet coverage to be 77% and the usage of these toilets to be 93.4%. The progress is accelerating every day and the Mission is on track to achieve an ODF India before October 2nd, 2019.

                Summary of the Forecast for the 2018 southwest monsoon Rainfall

 


	Quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal rainfall is likely to be 97% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5%. The LPA of the season rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1951-2000 is 89 cm.


 


	Forecast also suggests maximum probability for normal monsoon rainfall (96-104% of LPA) and low probability for deficient rainfall during the season.


 

IMD will issue the update in early June, 2018 as a part of the second stage forecast. Along with the updated forecast, separate forecasts for the monthly (July and August) rainfall over the country as a whole and seasonal (June-September) rainfall over the four geographical regions of India will also be issued.

 


	Background


India Meteorological Department (IMD) issues operational forecast for the southwest monsoon seasonal (June to September) rainfall for the country as a whole in two stages. The first stage forecast is issued in April and the second stage forecast is issued in June. These forecasts are prepared using state-of-the-art Statistical Ensemble Forecasting system (SEFS) that is critically reviewed and improved regularly through in-house research activities. Since 2012, IMD is also using the dynamical global climate forecasting system (CFS) model developed under the Monsoon Mission to generate forecasts. For this purpose, the latest version of the high resolution (horizontal resolution of approximately 38km (T382) Monsoon Mission CFS (MMCFS) was implemented in January 2017 at the Office of Climate Research and Services, IMD, Pune.

 

IMD’s SEFS model for the April forecast uses the following 5 predictors that require data upto March.

	Forecast for the 2018 Southwest monsoon Season (June–September) rainfall over the Country as a whole


 

2a.       Forecast based on the Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System (MMCFS)

 

For generating the forecast for the 2018 southwest Monsoon season rainfall, atmospheric and Oceanic initial conditions of April 2018 were used. The forecast was computed as the average of the ensemble member forecasts.

 

The forecast based on the MMCFS suggests that the monsoon rainfall during the 2018 monsoon season (June to September) averaged over the country as a whole is likely to be 99% ± 5% of the Long Period Average (LPA).

 

2b.       Forecast Based on the Operational Statistical Ensemble Forecasting System (SEFS)

 


	Quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal rainfall is likely to be 97% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5%.


 


	The 5 category probability forecasts for the Seasonal (June to September) rainfall over the country as a whole is given below:


 


	
		
			
			Category
			
			
			Rainfall Range
			
			
			Forecast
			
			
			Climatological
			
			 
		
		
			
			(% of LPA)
			
			
			Probability (%)
			
			
			Probability (%)
			
			 
		
		
			
			 
			
		
		
			
			Deficient
			
			
			< 90
			
			
			14
			
			
			16
			
			 
		
		
			
			Below Normal
			
			
			90 - 96
			
			
			30
			
			
			17
			
			 
		
		
			
			Normal
			
			
			96 -104

Forecast suggests maximum probability for normal rainfall and a low probability for deficient rainfall during the season.

 


	Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Conditions in the equatorial Pacific & Indian Oceans


 

The moderate La Nina conditions developed in the equatorial Pacific during last year started weakening in the early part of this year and currently have turned to weak La Nina conditions. The latest forecasts from MMCFS & other global models indicate conditions over the Pacific to turn to neutral ENSO conditions before the beginning of the monsoon season.

 

At present, neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are prevailing over the Indian Ocean. The latest forecasts from the MMCFS and global models indicate weak negative IOD conditions may develop during the middle of the monsoon season.

 

As the extreme sea surface temperature conditions over the Pacific and Indian Oceans particularly ENSO conditions over the Pacific (El Nino or La Nina) are known to have strong influence on the Indian summer monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring the sea surface conditions over the Pacific and Indian oceans.

                Ministry of Earth Sciences has augmented the High-Performance Computing (HPC) System at a total cost of Rs.438.9 Cr. The systems are installed at two sites Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune and National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (NCMRWF), Noida with computing capacities of 4 peta flops and 2.8 peta flops, respectively. 


 The Two High Performance Computing (HPC) Systems Pratyush and Mihir installed at IITM, Pune and NCMRWF, Noida respectively have a total computing capacity of 6.8 peta flops. After the current augmentation, the total HPC capacity of the ministry has gone up to 8.0 Peta Flops.

 The Ministry HPC system with a combined capacity of 8.0 Peta Flops is now placed at the 4th position after Japan, UK and USA for dedicated HPC resources for weather/climate community.

 Indian Monsoon is one of the most complex coupled climate systems of the world. The geographic location of India, surrounded with tall mountains and oceans make the system more difficult to simulate and predict. The HPC system is being used for the advanced dynamical prediction systems which are now being used for Seasonal prediction (mainly for SW monsoon season of June to September); Extended range prediction (for next 20 days) and Short range prediction (up to 8 days). The HPC system is also being used for generating probabilistic forecasts for extreme weather. 

The global weather prediction model has a horizontal resolution of 10 to 12 km and the regional models have much finer horizontal resolution of 3 km and less over the Indian domain. These high resolution models will be used for prediction of cyclones and other severe weather events with more accuracy and lead time.

This Information was given by Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences Dr Harsh Vardhan  in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                Highlights

 


	Upcoming Hot Weather Season (April to June-AMJ) is expected to have the above normal sub-divisional average seasonal temperatures (maximum, minimum and mean) over most of the meteorological sub-divisions of the country except the subdivisions of eastern, east central and southern parts for the country that are likely to experience slightly below normal seasonal temperatures.


 


	The AMJ seasonal average temperatures in most of the subdivisions are likely to be cooler than that of last year.


 


	Normal Heat wave (HW) conditions are likely over core heat wave zone of the country.


 


	Background


India Meteorological Department (IMD) issues operational seasonal forecast outlooks for subdivision scale temperatures over the country for both hot and cold weather seasons. These outlooks are generated based on predictions from the Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System (MMCFS) Model and implemented by the office of Climate Research and Services (CRS), IMD, Pune. This year IMD had issued temperature outlook for the pre-monsoon season of March to May (MAM) on 28th February, 2018 in which it was forecasted that warmer than normal temperatures are likely during the MAM season in all meteorological sub-divisions (except Sub Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim) of the country. Now the seasonal temperature outlook for the 2018 hot weather season of April-June (AMJ) is presented now.

 


	Forecast for the 2018 Season (April-June) Temperatures


 

Fig.1, Fig.2 & Fig.3 depict the forecasted distribution of the sub-divisional average maximum, minimum and mean temperature anomalies respectively over India for AMJ 2018. It suggests that warmer than normal temperatures are expected to prevail in most of the subdivisions with maximum anomalies in subdivisions from northwest India and north India. However, normal to slightly below normal maximum temperatures are likely to prevail over subdivisions of eastern, east central and southern parts of the country. Overall, the seasonal (AMJ) temperature anomalies are likely to be colder than those observed during the corresponding season of 2017.

The seasonal average maximum temperatures (Fig.1) are likely to be warmer than normal by ≥1 °C in Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi (HCD) and Himachal Pradesh. They are likely to be between 0.5°C & 1°C in Uttarakhand, west Uttar Pradesh and east and west Rajasthan. Remaining subdivisions are likely to experience near normal (between 0.5°C & -0.5°C) maximum temperature anomalies.

The season averaged minimum temperatures (Fig. 2) are likely to be warmer than normal by ≥1 °C in Punjab, HCD, west Uttar Pradesh and east and west Rajasthan. They are likely to be between 0.5°C & 1°C in Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, east Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, east and west Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Vidarbha, Madhya Maharashtra, Saurashtra and Gujarat. Rest of the subdivisions are likely to experience minimum temperature anomalies of <0.5°C.

The season averaged mean temperatures (Fig.3) are likely to be warmer than normal by ≥1°C in Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, HCD , west Uttar Pradesh and east and west Rajasthan. They are likely to be between 0.5°C & 1°C in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, east Uttar Pradesh, west and east Madhya Pradesh. Rest of the subdivisions are likely to experience mean temperature anomalies of <0.5°C.

The grid point maximum temperatures in the core HW zone during April to June 2018 show nearly equal probabilities for all the three categories; below normal, normal and above normal (Fig.4).This in turn suggests that the normal heat wave conditions are likely to prevail in the core HW zone during the season. The core HW zone covers states of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Orissa and Telangana and meteorological subdivisions of Marathawada, Vidarbha, Madhya Maharashtra and coastal Andhra Pradesh.


	The Monsoon Mission Climate Forecast System (MMCFS)


The research version of the MMCFS was developed by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune in 2012 and has been used to prepare seasonal forecasts since then. The latest version of the MMCFS has a spatial resolution of about 38 km and improved modules of model physics. The seasonal temperature forecast outlook for the April to June 2018 is prepared based on the March 2018 initial conditions using 41ensemble member forecasts.


	ENSO conditions in the Pacific Ocean


The current sea surface temperature conditions prevailing over equatorial Pacific suggest prevalence of La Niña conditions. However, the atmospheric conditions are not suggestive of La Niña conditions. The latest forecast from MMCFS indicates that La Niña conditions are likely to continue at least during the forecast period. However, forecasts from some of the global climate centres indicate weakening of La Nina conditions from the spring season onwards.


	Extended Range Forecast Services


IMD also provides extended range forecasts (7 –day averaged forecasts for the next four weeks) of maximum and minimum temperatures over the country updated every week. This is based on the Multi-model ensemble dynamical Extended Range Forecasting System currently operational at IMD, New Delhi. The forecasts are available through IMD, Delhi website (www.imd.gov.in).


	Short to Medium Range Forecast Outlooks/Updates


In addition to the above, IMD maintains round the clock watch of the temperature scenario and issues heat wave warnings as and when required at meteorological sub-divisions level valid for next 5-days through National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC), Delhi and at district level through Regional Meteorological Centers and Meteorological Centers at states along with daily updates.

                Human Resource Development Ministry today launches Unnat Bharat Abhiyan 2.0 in New Delhi. Addressing the launching ceremony at AICTE headquarters through video message, Minister of Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar said that the students are the real agents of change who can develop, empower and brighten the future of the country.

Shri Javadekar said that Unnat Bharat Abhiyan 2.0 is in line with Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's vision to transform India, in which students from colleges and universities will go to nearby villages to get acquainted with the life of the village people and the problems faced by them in day to day life.

He reiterated the quote of Mahatma Gandhi that India lives in villages and every village has its own specialty and challenges also. He added that this unique initiative of HRD ministry will serve as real Bharat Darshan for students and it is also an opportunity for them to learn about the basic challenges faced by rural people and to bring out practical solutions for their betterment.

The Minister advised students to involve local village people at every stage of problem identification and solving issues relating to health, cleanliness, waste management, plantation, financial inclusion, women and child development etc. Shri Javadekar informed that the Ministry will bring out a practical handbook relating to Unnat Bharat Abhiyan. The Minister also congratulated the delegation from across India present on this occasion and gave his best wishes for the success of this endeavour.

Addressing the launching ceremony of Unnat Bharat Abhiyan 2.0, the Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Dr. Satya Pal Singh said that India had witnessed the migration of rural population in the past, but now the process of sustainable development through the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan 2.0 will help to reverse this migration. He congratulated the Human Resource Development Ministry for launching the higher version of Unnat Bharat Abhiyan and expressed the confidence that commitment of the HRD Ministry will make this campaign a success. He appealed to the professors and students of the Higher Education Institutions to motivate the rural public, particularly the young generations for social economic development of the villages through various schemes and initiatives of rural development. Dr. Satya Pal Singh also congratulated the Indian Institute of Technology – IIT Delhi for developing excellent technology to take the development process to the rural areas. 

Speaking on this occasion, the Secretary (Higher Education) of Human Resource Development Shri R. Subrahmanyam appealed to the student community to take the lead of this programme to make it a national movement. He said that 750 institutions chosen in the first lot have participated in today’s seminar; however, thousands of institutions have offered their willingness to joint this movement. He said that to cover the 45000 villages of the country under this movement, we need the participation of 8252 institutions of Higher Education. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants the participation of every single institute of Higher Education in Unnat Bharat Abhiyan 2.0 to make it a people’s movement. He said that Higher Education Institutions are largely funded by Government and people’s money and their participation in this campaign will be a payback time. He said that the knowledge of Higher Education Institutions should be translated in to field in the social and economic growth of rural people. He said that this is the two ways process, and Higher Education Institutions will also learn from the wisdom of rural people while sharing their knowledge. 

Unnat Bharat Abhiyan is a flagship programme of the Ministry of Human Resources Development, with the intention to enrich Rural India. The knowledge base and resources of the Premier Institutions of the country are to be leveraged to bring in transformational change in rural developmental process. It also aims to create a vibrant relationship between the society and the higher educational institutes, with the latter providing the knowledge and technology support to improve the livelihoods in rural areas and to upgrade the capabilities of both the public and private organisations in the society.

Under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan 2.0, the institutions have been selected on a Challenge Mode and the scheme has been extended to 750 reputed Higher Educational Institutes (both public and private) of the country. Also, scope for providing Subject Expert Groups and Regional Coordinating Institutes to handhold and guide the participating institutions has been strengthened. IIT Delhi has been designated to function as the National Coordinating Institute for this programme and the Ministry intends to extend the coverage to all the reputed Higher Educational Institutes, in a phased manner. Each selected institute would adopt a cluster of villages / panchayats and gradually expand the outreach over a period of time.

Institutes through their faculty and students, will carry out studies of living conditions in the adopted villages, assess the local problems and needs, workout the possibilities of leveraging the technological interventions and the need to improve the processes in implementation of various government schemes, prepare workable action plans for the selected villages. Such knowledge inputs would make their way into the development programmes in rural areas. The Institutes would be expected to closely coordinate with the district administration, elected public representatives of panchayat / villages and other stakeholders and will become very much a part of the process of development planning and implementation.

In this process, faculty and students of such institutes would be re-oriented and connected to the rural realities so that their learning and research work also becomes more relevant to the society.

                Students across the world will now be able to pursue the education in prominent Indian Educational Institutions. In another ground breaking initiative of HRD Ministry, Union External Affairs Minister, Smt Sushma Swaraj and Minister of State for HRD, Dr. Satya Pal Singh jointly launched the Study in India programme of HRD Ministry by launching the  ‘Study in India’ portal (www.studyinindia.gov.in) at the India Habitat Centre in New Delhi today. The integration of e-SANAD portal and NAD – National Academic Depository (of HRD Ministry), was also launched by Smt Sushma Swaraj on the occasion.

While addressing the occasion, Smt. Swaraj said the quest for knowledge has always been fundamental to India’s culture and civilization. Throughout our history, India has made seminal contributions to human thought, philosophy and development. Our ancient philosophical concepts, such as Vasudeva Kuttumbakam and Sarva Dharma Sambhava, remain eternal. The ""Study in India’ is an innovative initiative to attract students from our partner countries in South Asia, South-East Asia, Middle East and Africa to come and experience the very best of academic learning from the top institutions in India. This will be achieved through systematic brand-building, identifying quality institutions for receiving the students, creating suitable infrastructure and facilitation structures. The ""Study in India Portal” will become a single window to cover all aspects relating to studying in India for foreign students.

In a video message on this occasion, Union HRD Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar said ‘Study in India’ initiative will open the gates of prominent educational institution of India for foreign students. He said that to begin with the focus is on students of 30 Asian, African, Middle East and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and hope that families from America will send their children to India for under graduate courses one day. India was the education hub of the world education with long heritage of Nalanda & Takshashila . Now, India is again surging ahead in education sector with more than 40,000 colleges & more than 800 universities. Top most colleges have been granted graded autonomy. Graded autonomy will help educational institutions to expand on their own; they can improve their programs, launch new programs as per the need. They can take in foreign faculty & foreign students , the HRD Ministry added. Shri Javadekar further said that because of the recent reforms in education sector, now India has become a prominent center for affordable and quality education.

While speaking on the occasion Minister of State for HRD, Dr. Satyapal Singh said that India believes in the theory of ‘Vashudhaiva Kutumbkam with the rich history of educational institutions like Takshashila and Nalanda. He said that with the integration of e-SANAD and NAD – National Academic Depository, the education system in India is now more transparent. Expressing gratitude towards the External Affairs Minister Mrs. Sushma Swaraj for launching the Study in India portal, Dr. Satyapal Singh said that for the first time, prominent Indian Educational Institutions have been opened up under this programme which will be of benefit not only to the foreign students but also to India. 

Delivering the welcome speech, Secretary (Higher Education) of HRD Shri R. Subrahmaniyam said that India is a place of wisdom and believes in knowledge without borders. This year 15, 000 seats have been offered by 160 Institutions under the programme, the secretary disclosed. Dr. S. B. Majumdar, Founder President, Symbiosis International University was also felicitated by Smt. Sushma Swaraj on the occasion. 

The Study in India programme would provide one stop solution through the creation of a centralised portal www.studyinindia.gov.in. The website will be supported by an App and a Helpline number. The website will not only provide information on the latest offerings on Indian education but also facilitate admissions to the foreign students and help them make informed choices based on individual aptitudes and career goals. EdCIL (India) Limited, a Mini Ratna Category I CPSE is the implementing agency of the Ministry of HRD for the Study in India education campaign. NIRF ranked and NAAC accredited institutions with a 3.26 score have been included in the programme. The Study in India programme is a joint initiative of Ministry of HRD, Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

                The weblink cisthetaglobal.com carried a news item that 7-8 questions out of the 90 questions of JEE 2018 paper were carried from a model paper of a coaching institution by the name of Narayana  Academy.  In this context, CBSE has stated that these questions or items did not exist in 2016.  Giving more details,  CBSE has explained that the JEE question papers are prepared in original by over 100 item writers.  These item writers are subject experts.  They prepare over 1500 items over a period of two months during the year of the exam.  All these questions are prepared by the item writers in original and they are handwritten.   After that, 90 questions are drawn randomly and 8-9 sets are created.  Any one set is randomly picked for use in JEE.

According to CBSE,   the said 7-8 questions were prepared in original by 7 different item writers and were handwritten. After this, the moderator made many handwritten changes too.  Followed by this, the vetter also made handwritten changes.  The final handwritten version was ready only about 2-3 months back, after which it was sent to the confidential printer. 

CBSE states that it is indeed very strange that handwritten changes in all these 7 questions that CBSE has record of, appear exactly in a so-called website claiming to belong to a particular coaching institute and also claiming to be two years old.  It may be mentioned here that the Press has also carried the statement of the said coaching institute today stating that the items have been doctored to spoil the image of the said coaching institute. 

 CBSE reiterates that all these 7-8 items/questions were originally written only about two to three months back and they cannot and could not have figured in any model paper by any coaching institutions two years back.   There is an atmosphere of falsities and rumour mongering being deliberately perpetuated against a prestigious organisation like CBSE.  CBSE appeals to all not to pay heed to such falsities.

                An Agreement to facilitate Mutual Recognition of Academic Qualifications between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the French Republic has been signed during the recent visit of French dignitaries to India.

 

Signing of MoU with a foreign country is not a unilateral course of action and verily depends on various factors viz.  education system prevailing in that country, response of the foreign country, bilateral relations, mutual benefit to be accrued by signing such kind of MOUs, etc. In some cases it can materialize soon whereas in other cases it may not materialize or take time. In other words, agreement with a country evolves during the course of negotiations and as such it cannot be predicted/planned in advance.

                The Ministry of Human Resource Development has launched the Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan (RAA), a convergent framework across School Education and Higher Education to encourage children towards learning Science and Mathematics through activities related to Science and Mathematics. Some of the interventions under RAA for promotion of science are strengthening of school Science and Mathematics laboratories, Science Fair/Exhibition and Talent Search at district level; provision of mathematics and science kits to schools, visit of students to higher educational institutions and learning enhancement of students. 

 

During last three years, an amount of Rs 952.47 crore has been approved for In- service Teacher training of Maths and Science teachers at upper primary level, learning enhancement programme, computer aided learning and innovations under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). Further, an amount of Rs. 425.39 crore has been approved for in-service training of science and maths teachers, remedial teaching, provision of science and maths kits, science exhibitions etc under Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA). 

 

NITI Aayog under the Atal Innovation Mission is establishing Atal Tinkering Laboratories (ATLs) in schools across India. The objective of this scheme is to foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in young minds; and inculcate skills such as design mindset, computational thinking, adaptive learning, physical computing etc. Till date, 2441 schools have been selected across the country to establish ATLs. 

 

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, suggested a paradigm shift in science education in India. As per NCF 2005, inquiry skills should be supported and strengthened by language, design and quantitative skills. Schools should place much greater emphasis on activities aimed at stimulating investigative ability, inventiveness, creativity and transfer of learning in varied situations. The perspective of NCF-2005, on science has been translated into syllabi, textbooks and teacher support material developed by the National Council Of Educational Research And Training (NCERT). The NCERT has continuously been building capacity of science teachers and teacher educators at the secondary stage for content and pedagogies which promote inquiry, thinking and problem-solving skills in students. NCERT also conducts National Science Exhibition every year to further promote scientific temper among students.

                The Government has announced to step up investments in general and research infrastructure in premier educational institutions, including health institutions, by launching a major initiative named ‘‘Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) by 2022’’ with a planned total investment of Rs. 1,00,000 crore in next four years. Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) would be suitably structured for funding this initiative.

In addition to Government equity, HEFA would leverage funds from the market to service the requirements of the Centrally Funded Institutions (CFIs).

The different areas where resources would include providing World Class infrastructure for teaching in the CFIs, building robust research eco system, providing linkages between Labs, building high-end Labs to support high-end research, completion of construction of (28) new institutions started since 2014 and providing for infrastructure of the institutions that are expected to be opened in accordance with the requirements of the growing economy.

There would be different windows of financing based on the internal revenues of the institutions,  as envisaged in the scheme to be approved.

                In order to address shortage of faculty in premier educational institutions, including Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), various measures have been decided, especially for recruitment of foreign faculty.  These include creation of pan-IIT faculty pool, effective use of VAJRA Scheme of Department of Science & Technology (DST), appointment of eligible OCI Card holders as permanent faculty, hassle-free visa to foreign faculty, reducing of annual income ceiling from US$ 25,000 to Rs.9.10 lakh per year. In addition to this, Government has also launched the Global Initiative for Academic Networks (GIAN) to enable foreign faculty to teach courses in the higher educational institutions in India.  

 

This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.

                The Union Minister of Human Resource Development, Shri Prakash Javadekar, released the NIRF India Rankings 2018 in various categories on the basis of performance of Higher Educational Institutions in a programme held in New Delhi today. Minister of State Human Resource Development, Dr. Satya Pal Singh released the report on the NIRF Rankings during the event. 69 top institutions in 9 categories were given awards at today’s event. Shri R. Subrahmanyam, Secretary, Higher Education, M/o HRD; Shri Surendra Prasad, Chairman NBA; Prof. D. B. Singh, Chairman UGC; Shri Anil Sahsrabudhe, Chairperson AICTE and representatives of award winning higher education institutions were present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Prakash Javadekar said that the idea behind these rankings is to promote quality in education and encourage competition to perform better and to set up new benchmarks of performance in Higher education space. He lauded the efforts of the team under National Institutional Ranking framework (NIRF) for bringing out the most authentic ranking system of the country. The Minister also congratulated all the winner institutions for their excellent performance.

The Minister said that to promote quality education, we are providing support for setting up and upgrading of 10 public and 10 private Institutions of Eminence (IOEs) so as to enable them to reach amongst top 100 of world institutions ranking. The list of 20 IOEs will be released soon. He further said that various initiatives of the HRD Ministry like GIAN, RUSA, SWAYAM, SWAYAM Prabha, TEQUIP III, Smart India Hackathon, etc are in direction to further boost the Quality, Research and Innovation in education.

While addressing on the occasion, Dr. Satya Pal said that to become global leader in education we have to create our own brands so that other countries may follow us. He said that healthy competition gives us a chance to improve and opportunity to excel in various aspects of life. He further said our main focus should be on quality of research which can contribute to the development of the society as a whole. He stressed upon a mechanism which can develop holistic campus in the country.

Secretary, M/o HRD said that the NIRF rankings are the corner stone of various higher education reform measures taken up by the HRD Ministry over the last four years. New categories i.e. law, architecture and medical have also been added in this year’s rankings, Shri Subrahmanyam disclosed.

In this third edition of India Rankings, a total of 2809 institutions have participated in 9 categories. Collectively they have submitted 3954 distinct profiles, some in multiple disciplines/categories. This includes 301 Universities, 906 Engineering Institutions, 487 Management Institutions, 286 Pharmacy Institutions, 71 Law Institutions, 101 Medical Institutions, 59 Architecture Institutions and 1087 General Degree Colleges. 

“India Rankings 2018” have ranked institutions in the disciplines/categories mentioned above, and have also provided a common overall rank across all disciplines for those institutions which have more than 1000 enrolled students.

The parameters used for India Rankings 2018 are broadly similar to those used in previous years. However, some of the sub-parameters have been further tweaked for greater robustness and accuracy. In particular for evaluating Research Impact, parameters for quality of publications have been enhanced to include the number of highly cited papers, (i.e., number of papers lying in the top 25 percentile of citations) in addition to the usual parameters of publications per faculty and citations per paper. 

The performance metrics have been optimized to provide a good discrimination over a large range of possible values. All research related information, including publications, citations, highly cited papers and even patent information about institutes was collected from third party databases to obtain an objective and unbiased picture. For this year’s Perception inputs, a large database of eminent academic and industry peers and employers was deployed. 

The data received from both institutional and third party sources were subject to extensive scrutiny for consistency and correctness by a team of experts. The Rankings List includes 100 institutions each in the Overall, University, Engineering and General College Categories, and 50 each in Management and Pharmacy, 25 in Medical and 10 each in Architecture and Law. Additional rankings in suitably bunched forms are also being provided. Four institutions, which could not easily fit into any of the above categories, have been chosen for a special mention for excellence on a few parameters like Research etc.

Although the Central Government funded institutions, in general continue to do well, some of the state-funded and private universities also appear prominently. Some private institutions and universities have consistently occupied good positions, and some have been rising in their ranks, thus indicating that they offer value for money to their students. Maintenance of consistent or improved positions over previous years clearly indicates that it has not been a one-time random event. This should augur well for Higher Education.

The ranking of General Degree Colleges which was started last year, saw a much more enthusiastic participation this year, with 1087 colleges in the fray. This represents an increase by almost 100% over last year. The ranking list throws interesting light on their geographical spread. Almost all renowned institutions are represented in this year’s ranking. Similarly participation for a place in the overall rank increased nearly 25% over the last year.

This year also saw the beginning of limited ranking of institutions in new areas like Medicine, Law and Architecture.

                The Central Board for Secondary Education has taken the considered decision not to hold re-examination of Class-X maths paper even in Delhi-NCR and Haryana. Therefore the class-X math re-examination will not be held anywhere in the country. Earlier on 30th March, 2018, the CBSE issued a notification stating that re-examination of class-X would be conducted in Delhi-NCR and Haryana if considered necessary after inquiry. 

The Board has said that internal inquiries and analysis based on available material and inputs from the ongoing police investigations are indicating that the alleged leak may be confined to a few alleged beneficiaries. Similarly, the trend of random evaluation done so far for class X Mathematics paper is not indicating sudden spikes or unusual patterns, giving any impression of passing on widespread benefits of alleged leaks to students. Further, the board has come across several fake question papers being put up on social media, obviously with a view to spread panic amongst our students, parents and schools.

Meanwhile, Board is constantly receiving representation from stakeholders indicating anxiety amongst of class X due to the uncertainty surrounding the Maths examination. Also, it has received over 1000 calls on our Counselling Helpline Desk enquiring about whether the re-examination will be held and requesting for announcing the dates for the reconduct of Maths Class X examination.

Keeping in mind the paramount interest of students, the Board has taken the considered decision to not hold the re-examination of Class X Maths paper even in Delhi NCR and Haryana, wherever it is conclusively established, after due enquiry in specific cases, that undue advantage of the alleged leakage has been taken by beneficiaries, action shall be taken as per the provisions of CBSE Examination Bye Laws.

                The University Grants Commission (UGC) vide its letter dated 21st March, 2017 has requested all the Universities to introduce identification mechanisms like photograph and Unique ID/Aadhaar number in students’ certificates. Such features are useful for the purposes of verification and curbing duplication. At the same time, they help in introducing uniformity and transparency within and across the system of higher education in the Country. UGC has also requested all the Universities to inscribe the name of institution in which a student is enrolled for a program of study as well as the mode of delivery (regular, part-time or distance). A copy of the letter dated 21st March, 2017 is available at http://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/8481300_UGC-letter-reg-identification-mechanisms-(2).pdf .

                The Ministry of Human Resource Development has launched the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) on 29th September, 2015 to rank institutions across the country. The parameters for ranking broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.

In India, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) does the institutional assessment and accreditation, while National Board of Accreditation (NBA) does programmatic accreditation of technical programmes and courses.

India Rankings 2016 and 2017 have already been released which are available at ‘https://www.nirfindia.org/Home’. India Rankings, 2018 is set to be released in the first week of April 2018.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued the Mandatory Assessment and Accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions, Regulations, 2012, whereby all eligible Higher Educational institutions are required to get themselves accredited.

To rationalize the expansion of courses in engineering / technical, management etc. and to bring quality in technical education, AICTE has made it mandatory to have NBA Accreditation for institutions seeking new courses / expansion of existing courses.

Ranking promotes competition among the Universities and drive them to strive for excellence. Government has also started a scheme called ‘Institutions of Eminence’ in which 20 institutions both public and private, would be selected on challenge method and they would be actively supported to come up in the global rankings.

In NIRF, to promote Research and Development in Higher Education, ‘Research and Professional Practices’ has been given the highest weightage of 40%, for ranking Universities.

                As per the Unified District Information System on Education (UDISE) 2015-16, there has been an increase in the enrollment of students in science subjects at higher secondary level from 62.18 lakh in 2014-15 to 79.52 lakh in 2015-16. 

The Centrally sponsored scheme of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) envisages universalizing access to secondary schools by providing a secondary school within a reasonable distance (5 kilometer) of every habitation, improving quality of education through making all secondary schools conform to prescribed norms and removal of gender, socio-economic and disability barriers. Under the scheme, there is a provision of appointment of 1 Head Teacher and 5 Teachers (2 language teacher, 1 science teacher, 1 social science and 1 math teacher)for every new/upgraded secondary school and Additional teacher to improve pupil teacher ratio. However, the recruitment and service conditions of Government teachers are primarily in the domain of respective State governments and UT Administration.

 

The Ministry of Human Resource Development has also in 2015 launched the Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan (RAA), a convergent framework across School Education and Higher Education to encourage children towards learning Science and Mathematics and to develop their interest through activities related to Science and Mathematics. One of the interventions under RAA is strengthening of Science and Mathematics laboratories in schools, through the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA). Also other interventions such as Science Fair/Exhibition and Talent Search at district level; mathematics and science kits to schools, visit to higher institutions of students and learning enhancement of students are also approved.

                The Government of India has initiated major reforms in the education sector to improve the quality and access to education. Aimed at expanding access to quality education, new premier higher education institutions have been opened across the country, marking the highest ever such expansion in the history after Independence.

SWAYAM MOOCs portal ( (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) is an indigenous MOOCs portal that provides high quality education - anyone, anytime, anywhere at no cost- has been made operational. The portal has courses by the best teachers in the country and offers video lectures, e-reading material, discussion forum and assessment system - resulting in award of credits to the successful learners. Sofar, more than 1000 courses are made available and more than 33 lakh users are registered in this forum. Upto 20 % credit transfer into the academic record of students, is allowed now, for the courses taken on the SWAYAM portal. 

To reach high quality educational content to the most backward areas using satellite communication, 32 DTH channels have been made functional, under SWAYAM Prabha programme. These channels air 4 hours of new content every day. 

The initiative of National Digital Library (NDL) is a virtual repository of learning resources with a single window search facility. It has already brought together 15 million digital books and journals and 31 lakh learners are using this facility. It supports all academic levels including researchers and life-long learners, all disciplines, all popular form of access devices and differently abled learners. 

Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA) is a new initiative to make use the knowledge base in the higher educational institutions for plugging technology gaps in the rural areas. In this year, 750 institutions are being selected on challenge mode. This is expected to enrich rural India by way of customising existing technology as per local needs and also by improving the implementation of existing government schemes.

Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching (PMMMNMTT) scheme has been launched in Dec, 2014, to address the issues of supply of qualified teachers, attracting talent into teaching profession, raising the quality teaching in schools and colleges.

Recently, the Government has constituted a Committee to draft National Education Policy under the Chairmanship of eminent scientist Dr. K. Kasturirangan which is expected to submit its report by 31stMarch, 2018.

Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat programme has been conceived by Hon’ble PM to promote mutual understanding between States & UTs in India which have diverse cultures, traditions, languages etc., through a process of sustained mutual engagement between the people. All States and UTs are paired with each other for a period of one year, after which the pairing would change. The objective is to break the inhibitions arising from diversity in culture through participative appreciation and engagement by people so that a spirit of oneness is created in the process for the nation. 

Under Swachh Bharat programme the Department recognised the huge role that has to be played by HEIs in promoting Swachhta in the form of an attitude of zero tolerance to anything unhygienic. It has initiated Swachhta Rankings of Higher Educational Institutions and Swachhta Action Plans have been prepared.

Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) is an initiative launched on 30th November 2015 to garner best international knowledge and experience into the country’s higher education so as to enable Indian students & faculty to interact with best academic and industry experts from across the world. GIAN courses are short duration courses and as on date, 1075 courses have been conducted, in which more than 40,000 students gained enriched academic inputs and knowledge. These courses are also video recorded for subsequent use and some are also telecast live, depending upon the available infrastructure.

Government has embarked on building 20 Institutions of higher learning - 10 public and 10 private institutions as “Institutions of Eminence” (IoE), so that they are related among the global best institutions. These institutions to be declared in April, 2018, will have complete academic and administrative freedom and the public institutions will be given 1000 crore fund in next 3 years. 

The best performing Institutions with high accreditation would be given autonomy in functioning. The Graded Autonomy Regulation introduced recently would provide liberal regulatory oversight so that the institution can plan for new courses and would strive for excellence. 

IMPRINT India is an effort to direct research in the premier institutions into areas of social relevance. 10 such domains have been identified which could substantially impact the living standards of the rural areas . More than 2600 research proposals have been submitted by scientists in these areas.  

The Uchchtar Avishkar Yojana (UAY) has been launched to promote industry specific need-based research so as to keep up the competitiveness of Indian industry in the global market. It is proposed to invest Rs. 250 crores every year on identified projects. The Industry is expected to contribute 25 % of the project cost.

Prime Minister Research Fellows (PMRF) scheme is launched to support 1000 bright undergraduate students every year, for direct admission in the research programmes in the reputed institutions like IISc, IITs. The fellowship carries a lot of social recognition and it ranges from Rs 70,000 to 80,000 per month for 5 year period. 

Smart India Hackathon initiative is to promote innovation in the students by encouraging out of the box solutions for common problems faced by the society at large. In the first edition held in 2017, more than 40,000 students have participated to solve more than 600 problems. In 2018, the scope has been expanded to Hardware area also.

National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is the biggest ranking exercise launched in 2015, in which more than 3,500 institutions participated. The first edition of India Rankings 2016 were released in April, 2016. The India Rankings 2018 , the 3rd edition, will be released on 3rd April, 2018. The India Rankings is one of the biggest efforts for bringing in accountability and transparency in the higher educational institutions. The ranks are released in the various categories of institutions namely Universities, Engineering, Management, Pharmacy etc..

Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) has been approved by the Cabinet for creation of a fund with government equity of Rs. 1000 crores, to give a big push for building up robust higher educational institutions. The HEFA would finance the academic and research infrastructure projects through a 10 year loan.  It is expected to spend Rs. 1,00,000 crore in next 5 years, for creation of high quality infrastructure in premier education institutions.

Rashtriya Uchchatar Siksha Abhiyan (RUSA) scheme has been given extension by Cabinet recently to provide more assistance for infrastructure to Universities and Colleges, creation of Model Degree colleges, Cluster universitite3s, Upgradation of autonomous colleges and Vocationalisation of higher education. 

Under the Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme Phase III (TEQUIP-III) focus has been given to the backward States in central tribal belt and north-eastern region. Under this Rs. 2,600 Cr would be spent for improving the quality of teaching and research in the engineering institutions. 

With a view to promoting autonomy for the premier institutions, the IIM Act has declared them as Institutes of National Importance and gave complete autonomy for deciding their dministrative and academic matters, without any Govt interference. 

In accordance with the policy that education should be accessible for everyone, the National Scholarship Portal has been started. Apart from this, the Vidyalaxmi portal provides one-window clearance for the Education Loans with Interest Subvention.

SCHOOL EDUCATION

In order to focus on quality education, the Central RTE Rules have been amended on 20th February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. These would serve as a guideline for States and UTs to ensure that all children acquire appropriate learning level.

A National Achievement Survey (NAS) was conducted on 13th November, 2017 through which the learning levels of around 22 lakh students of Classes III, V and VIII from 1.10 lakh schools across 700 districts in all 36 States and UTs were assessed. This competency based assessment was based on the Learning Outcomes developed by the NCERT. District and State report cards for NAS 2017 have been released by this Department and are available on MHRD website. Through NAS it is for the first time that the teachers have a tool to understand what exactly the child should be learning in various classes, how to teach this through activities and how to measure and ensure that children have reached the required level.

NAS for class X was conducted on 5th February, 2018 in a sample of around 15.5 lakh students in 45,337 schools.  The performance of students was assessed in five major subjects i.e. English, Mathematics, Science, Social Science and Modern Indian Languages (MIL), based on a district wise sampling of schools, to enable States to identify gaps in learning at district level and design strategies to address these gaps. 

The RTE Act, 2009 was amended in 2017 to ensure that all teachers acquire the minimum qualifications prescribed under the Act by 31st March 2019 to reinforce the Government's emphasis on improvement of quality of elementary education. The National Institute of Open schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through Open Distance Learning (ODL) mode.

The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Second Amendment) Bill, 2017 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 11th August, 2017 to provide for a regular examination at fifth class and eighth class at the end of every academic year.  If a child fails in the said examination, he shall be given additional instruction and granted opportunity for re-examination within a period of two months from the declaration of the result.  In case the child fails in the second attempt, the appropriate Government may allow schools to hold back a child in the fifth class or in the eighth class or in both classes, in such manner and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed.  The appropriate Government may also decide not to hold back a child in any class till the completion of elementary education.  

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has decided to make class X Board Examination compulsory from the academic year 2017-18.

A four year B.Ed. integrated programme with multiple pathways and specialization for pre-primary, elementary, secondary and senior secondary teachers will be introduced from the academic session 2019-2020.

In pursuance of the proposal of the Union Budget, 2018-19, to treat school education holistically without segmentation from pre-nursery to Class 12, this Department has prepared an Integrated Scheme for School Education by subsuming the three Centrally Sponsored Schemes of SSA, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE) extending Central support across all levels of school education. 

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) is undertaking an exercise to rationalize the curriculum/syllabus/subject contents from Class I to XII with the objective of all round development of students. Suggestions have been invited from various stakeholders till April 6th, 2018. 

The Department plans to support ‘Operation Digital Board’ in all schools ( class 9 onwards ) and colleges as a joint effort of Centre, States, CSR and community initiatives to provide good quality education by effective use of technology and telecom services and convert every class room in the country (from class IX and above) into a digital class room.

Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) was launched by Government of India in March, 2009 envisaging inter-alia provision of a secondary school within a reasonable distance of any habitation and to improve quality of education imparted at secondary level by making all secondary schools conform to prescribed norms, removing gender, socio-economic and disability barriers etc. In 2013, secondary education the schemes of ICT, vocational education, Girls Hostel and IEDSS were subsumed under the umbrella of RMSA. Under the scheme, 12682 new schools and 37799 existing schools for strengthening have been sanctioned so far. 

e-pathshala has been developed by NCERT (National Council for Educational Research and Training) for showcasing and disseminating all educational e-resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals and a variety of other print and non-print materials. So far, 3,062 audios and videos, 650 e-books (e-pubs) and 504 flip books have been made available on the portal and mobile app.

                The Central Government, the University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) are constantly endeavouring to improve quality of higher education and make higher education practical in the country. The Central Government has launched several initiatives viz. National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), Impacting Research Innovation & Technology (IMPRINT), Uchhatar Avishkar Yojana  (UAY), Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN), Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM), National Academic Depository (NAD), Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP), Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching (PMMMNMTT), National Digital Library, Campus Connect Programme etc. in the field of higher education for qualitative development of education in the country. 

The UGC undertakes maintenance of standards in teaching, research and quality assurance in Universities, Deemed to be Universities and Colleges through framing and notifying regulations, schemes and disbursing grants to the eligible institutions. With a view to sustain and improve the quality of higher education and to undertake academic reforms, the UGC has notified UGC (Minimum Standards and Procedure for Award of M.Phil./ Ph.D Degrees) Regulations, 2016; UGC (Promotion and Maintenance of Standards of Academic Collaboration between Indian and Foreign Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2016; UGC (Open and Distance Learning) Regulations, 2017; UGC (Institutions of Eminence Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2017; UGC (Conferment of Autonomous Status upon Colleges and Measures for Maintenance of Standards in Autonomous Colleges) Regulations, 2018 and UGC (Categorization of Universities (only) for Grant of Graded Autonomy) Regulations, 2018. 

In order to encourage research and development in the country, UGC is implementing schemes, awards, fellowships, chairs and programmes under which financial assistance is provided to institutions of higher education as well as faculty members working therein to undertake quality research covering areas of knowledge across disciplines. Some of the initiatives taken by UGC are (i) Universities with Potential for Excellence; (ii) Centre with potential for excellence in particular area; (iii) Special Assistance Programme (SAP); (iv) Research Projects and (v) Basic Science Research. 

UGC has also requested the Vice-Chancellors of all Universities to upgrade and review their curriculum every three years for making them more skill oriented and interdisciplinary and with a purpose of making the students employable. The introduction of Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) is another important measure taken by UGC to enhance academic standards and quality in higher education through innovation and improvements in curriculum, teaching-learning process, examination and evaluation systems. CBCS provides a ‘cafeteria’ type approach in which the students can take courses of their choice, learn at their own pace, undergo additional courses, acquire credits and adopt an interdisciplinary approach to learning.

Further, Government is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme namely Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) with the aim of promoting access, equity and quality. The focus of the scheme is on serving the unserved and underserved areas. Under the scheme, central assistance is provided, inter alia, for components such as Infrastructure grants to colleges and universities, upgradation of existing colleges to model degree colleges etc. Under these components, funds are provided to institutions for strengthening of infrastructure facilities for construction/renovation of libraries, laboratories, hostels etc and for purchase of equipment in State Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs).

                The Ministry of Human Resource Development has launched the Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan (RAA), a convergent framework across School Education and Higher Education aiming to encourage children towards learning Science and Mathematics and to develop their interest through activities related to Science and Mathematics. One of the interventions under RAA is strengthening of school Science and Mathematics laboratories, through the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA). Further, under RMSA, important interventions i.e. Science Fair/Exhibition and Talent Search at district level; mathematics and science kits to schools, visit to higher institutions of students and learning enhancement of students have been approved. 

Under RMSA, an amount of Rs. 179.73 crore has been approved in 2017-18, for in-service training of science and maths teachers, remedial teaching, provision of science and maths kits, science exhibitions, etc. 

NITI Aayog under the Atal Innovation Mission is establishing Atal Tinkering Laboratories (ATLs) in schools across India. The objective of this scheme is to foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in young minds; and inculcate skills such as design mindset, computational thinking, adaptive learning, physical computing etc. Till date, 2441 schools have been selected across the country to establish ATL.

There is no proposal in UGC at present to increase the number of research fellowships.

                The Goal-4 of Sustainable Development Goals is to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. The major emphasis is on access, equity and quality of education. All the major schemes of the Ministry viz. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyaan (RMSA), Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Scheme, Shakshar Bharat and Rashtritya Ucchatar Shiksha Abhiyaan (RUSA) are being implemented with the objectives of development of educational Infrastructure, emphasis on equal opportunities for all and ensuring quality & standard of education.A number of corrective steps have been taken by the Government to further improve the quality of education in the country. Some important measures are:


	Focusing on quality education, the Central RTE Rules have been amended on 20thFebruary, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. These would serve as a guideline for States and UTs to ensure that all children acquire appropriate learning level. For the first time in November, 2017 National Achievement Surveys (NAS) was conducted for classes III, V and VIII to assess the learning outcomes of students in government and government aided schools on all subjects.
	The RTE Act, 2009 was amended in 2017 to ensure that all teachers acquire the minimum qualifications prescribed under the Act by 31st March, 2019. This would ensure an improvement in the overall quality of teachers and teaching processes, and consequently learning outcomes of children. Further, it reinforces the Government's emphasis on improvement of quality of elementary education.
	The Department is placing a lot of emphasis on the development and provision of e-content for students and also training of teachers, head masters and Principals.
	Government is implementing a centrally sponsored scheme namely RashtriyaUchatterShikshaAbhiyaan (RUSA) with the aim of promoting access, equity and quality in higher education. Under RUSA, inter-alia, central assistance is provided to States for creation of model degree colleges, infrastructure grants to colleges and Universities, creation of Universities either through up gradationof existing autonomous colleges or clustering of colleges. Further, Higher Education FinancingAgency (HEFA) has been set up by the Government to mobilize funds from the market as perrequirements of the centrally funded higher educational institutions.
	The University Grants Commission (UGC) has been constantly striving to develop a system of higher education of quality, appropriate to the national needs and aspirations and in tune with global trends. The Commission is committed to constant improvement of the quality of higher education and defining excellence in the processes of teaching, learning and research. In order to ensure quality of higher education is further streamlined, UGC has notified a number of regulations which are mandatory for every institution of higher education across the country.

                The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has a structured and robust Evaluation system. CBSE, as a part of continuous improvement endeavor, keeps reviewing all its process and activities from time to time to add value and refine them based on experiences. An internal committee of CBSE looked into the existing system to make the system more objective and error free. The study also took into account the experiences of the Regional Offices of the Board for identifying the nature and pattern of usual mistakes in the evaluation process. The feedback and the review of the evaluation process helped the Board to redefine some of the evaluation procedures. Board has added additional layer of supervision for ensuring marking of the answer script strictly as per marking scheme. The additional feature of posting and uploading of marks using IT solution have also added with the provision of auto totaling of marks.

CBSE conducts examination for class X and XII for its affiliated schools as per the scheme of studies offered by the Board and opted by the child. There is no change with regard to pattern in class XII examinations.However, for class X in order to promote vocational education at secondary level, the Board has decided that the failed one subject (out of Math’s, Social Science and Science offered in class X by the Candidate) will be replaced by the 6th vocational subject offered as additional 6th subject as enabling passing criteria. In additional, the Board has also modified the passing criteria as a one-time measure for the batch of class X 2018 examination. This has been done in order to enable the present batch of class X to cope with the new system of assessment introduced by the Board from the year 2018 onwards.

                The Government in association with All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) promotes innovations and research & development in established and new technologies, generation, adoption and adaptation of new technologies, to meet developmental requirements of the country and for the overall improvement of educational process. Towards these ends, the Council operates three schemes, namely, Modernization and Removal of Obsolescence (MODROBS), Research Promotion Scheme (RPS) and Nationally Coordinated Projects (NCP).  

In order to enhance the quality of technical education in the country, the Government is taking the following steps: -

(i)  Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA):  This is a not-for-profit organization that will leverage funds from the market and supplement them with donations and CSR funds. These funds will be used to finance setting up and improvement in infrastructure and research facilities in our top institutions and will be serviced through internal accruals. 

(ii)  PM Research Fellowship:  Under this scheme, the best students who have completed or are in the final year of B. Tech or Integrated M.Tech or M.Sc. in Science and Technology streams from IISc/IITs/NITs/IISERs/IIITs will be offered direct admission in PhD programme in the IITs/IISc. Such students, who fulfill the eligibility criteria, and shortlisted through a selection process, as laid down in the PMRF Guidelines, will be offered a fellowship of  Rs. 70,000/- per month for the first two years, Rs. 75,000/- per month for the 3rd year, and Rs. 80,000/- per month in the 4th and 5th  years. Apart from this, a research grant of Rs. 2.00 lakh will be provided to each of the Fellows for a period of 5 years to cover their foreign travel expenses for presenting research papers in international conferences and seminars. A maximum of 3,000 Fellows (1000 per year) would be selected during a three-year period.

(iii) Smart India Hackathon (SIH):   SIH is being undertaken by MHRD on yearly basis to identify new and disruptive digital solutions for solving the challenges faced by our country. 

(iv) Setting up of virtual classrooms and massive open online courses (MOOCs): Virtual classrooms under SWAYAM and MOOCs are newer forms of technology-enabled learning which help to broad-base quality education across all geographical regions. MOOCs have emerged as an inexpensive mechanism for offering quality education online, to a very large number of learners. The benefits of quality faculty, teaching excellent courses in top institutions, can be transmitted with the help of virtual classrooms and online courses to students & faculty across all institutions irrespective of their physical location thereby making education truly seamless and borderless. 

(v)  National Digital Library: Ministry of Human Resource Development under its National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology has initiated the National Digital Library (NDL) pilot project to develop a framework of virtual repository of learning resources with a single-window search facility. It is being developed to help students to prepare for entrance and competitive examination, to enable people to learn and prepare from best practices from all over the world and to facilitate researchers to perform inter-linked exploration from multiple sources. 

(vi) Training and Research in Frontier Areas:  It is proposed to establish centers of excellence for advanced training and research in the frontier areas including biotechnology, bioinformatics, nano-materials, nano-technologies, mechatronics, higher performance computing engineering/industrial design, etc.  

(vii) Setting up of Inter-Institutional Centres, Creation of Excellence Clusters and Networks, Establishing Alliances across Institutions:  This includes provision for Setting up of Inter Institutional Centers, Creation of Excellence Clusters and Network, Establishing Alliances Across Institutions. 

(viii)  Startup India Initiative in Higher Educational Institutions:  The erstwhile scheme “National Initiative for Technology Transfer” has been revamped as Startup India Initiative in Higher Education. Under this initiative, special efforts would be made to strengthen international research linkages and involve a larger number of Indian institutions in forging such links with industry through a framework of research parks for collaborative and joint research programmes. 

(ix) Implementation of the IMPRINT Research Initiative (Impacting Research Innovation and Technology):  This scheme is meant for adopting engineering and technology as the vehicle to addressing the societal needs and achieving national prosperity. 

(x) National Institutional Ranking Framework:  This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations and broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity and Perception. 

(xi) Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP):  This is a World Bank funded project to enhance quality and equity in selected engineering education institutes and improve the efficiency of the engineering education system in focus States/ Union Territories.

                The Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) provides assistance to State Governments and UTs to ensure free and compulsory quality elementary education for all children in the age group of 6-14 years in accordance with the provisions of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory (RTE) Act, 2009. Against the estimate of 20.78 crore children in the 6-13 age group as per Census, 2011, 19.67 crore children are enrolled at elementary level as per Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), 2015-16.

Universal enrolment at elementary level is the primary goal of SSA. It has provided 2.04 lakh primary and 1.59 lakh upper primary schools for ensuring universal provisioning of schooling facilities. Preference for opening of school is given to tribal areas, and areas with high concentration of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and minority population. Under the SSA, the districts with high concentration of population of SCs, STs and Muslims have been identified as Special Focus Districts (SFDs). The criteria for identifying the SFDs in case of SCs and STs is a population of 25% and above, while for Muslims, it is 20% and above population.

Through the interventions made under SSA in SFDs, at the national level the enrolment share of SC children at elementary level is 19.78% as per UDISE, 2015-16, whereas their share in population is 16.6% (as per Census 2011). Similarly, the enrolment share of ST children at elementary level as per UDISE 2015-16, is 10.35%, whereas their share in population is 8.6% (as per Census 2011). 

Besides, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs), which are upper primary residential schools for girls belonging predominantly to the SC, ST, Other Backward Caste and minorities, have played an important role in furthering the goal of girls’ education in educationally backward blocks of the country. Under the SSA, provisions have also been made for residential schools/hostels for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection.

Additionally, madarsas/makatabs which are affiliated to the State Boards of Secondary Education/State Madarsa Boards and are desirous of introducing the State curriculum, are eligible for grant for textbooks, in-service teacher training, school grant and teacher grant under SSA.

                All educational institutions have been asked to spread awareness about sanitation and hygiene. Department of School Education & Literacy has advised States and Union Territories to encourage school education authorities for promoting cleanliness and hygiene practices in schools by undertaking various activities, including Swachhata Pakhwada, appointment of Student Ambassador, singing Swachhata songs in BalSabha/Children’sassembly, celebrating Swachhata Diwas and drawing/painting competitions focusing on Swachhata in each school. During Swachhata Pakhwada 2017 observed during 1-15 September, 2017, Green School drive was taken up in schools across the country. Dustbins with blue and green colour were used for recycled and unrecyclable wastes, respectively. Planting of trees around school premises and around toilets to utilize waste water for gardening, were also taken up during the drive, in which 6.81 lakhs schools in the country participated. The Departmentof School Education & Literacy has instituted SwachhVidyalaya Puraskar (SVP) in 2016 at district, State and national levels to recognise inspire and celebrate excellence in sanitation and hygiene practices in schools. The SVP aims to encourage schools to achievea higher Swachhata scale and standard, for which a Standing Operating Procedure has been released.

University Grant Commission have issued guidelines on Swachh Bharat- Swasth Bharat Scheme, wherein among other things, Universities/Colleges have been asked to maintain proper waste segregation and disposal system and to ensure that it is implemented at the structural level. Universities/Colleges have also been asked that a separate project must be designed for students which may include embedding instructions about cleanliness, creating awareness camps in organizing cleanliness drives so that cleanliness is inculcated in their attitude and learning. In order to generate peer pressure amongst Higher educational Institutions in the area of hygiene, a Swachhata Ranking exercise was also undertaken based on various hygiene parameters including solid & liquid waste disposable process, water availability, water purity, kitchen hygiene, garbage disposable facility in campus, etc. 3500 Institutions participated in the exercise. Out of these, 25 Institutions were awarded during the Swachhata Pakhwada 2017. This will be an annual exercise so that built in standards of hygiene are upgraded over time through peer pressure.

                The four-day Asia Pacific Regional Workshop of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), jointly hosted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and UNCCD Secretariat, to build the capacity of the Asia-Pacific Region to monitor and report on land degradation, concluded here today. 

Addressing the closing session, Secretary, MoEFCC, Mr. C.K. Mishra said that the workshop will enable country Parties to participate effectively and efficiently in the UNCCD reporting process, to submit the national report in time and in particular for Target 15.3 on Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN). He added that the workshop has not only provided a diverse and multi-disciplinary knowledge sharing platform addressing desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD) issues, but also provided an opportunity to bring all key stakeholders from Asia to India and discuss key aspects of Reporting, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN). The Secretary also lauded the UNCCD experts for their endeavour to take up issues, concerns and challenges of different country parties, while reporting to the UNCCD Secretariat.   

In his remarks, Deputy Executive Secretary UNCCD, Dr. Pradeep Monga, highlighted the importance of addressing land degradation, desertification and drought for developing countries including India. He commended India for its leadership role in supporting the Convention and putting land agenda at the core of SDGs.

Addressing the gathering, Director General of Forests and Special Secretary, MoEFCC, Mr Siddhanta Das, invoked the gathering to come together for such Workshops and contribute towards safeguarding the environment in every possible way. He added that the targets under the Convention can be achieved through carbon sequestration and preventing soil erosion by enriching forests. 

Earlier this week, Union Minister of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MOEFCC) and Chair of the workshop’s inaugural session, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, had highlighted the Government’s commitment to the land agenda and also released the report on Study of Economics of Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought (EDLDD) conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and commissioned by MoEFCC. The report has highlighted that Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought (DLDD) factors had cost India about 2.54% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2014-15.  Pointing out that globally, drylands lose 23 hectares per minute to drought and desertification, the Minister had pointed out that this translated into a loss of 20 million tonnes of potential foodgrain production in a year. Referring to various schemes of the Government that have been launched for capacity-building of the stakeholders at multiple levels, Dr. Harsh Vardhan had mentioned some of the schemes including - Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Soil Health Card Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PKSY), Per Drop More Crop, Swacch Bharat mission, Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP) and National Rural Drinking Water Programme.

The four-day Workshop (April 24-27, 2018) trained the participants in the use of an innovative land degradation monitoring tool by Conservation International, for the reporting process of UNCCD. This can significantly increase access to large amounts of Earth observation data and make it available in a comprehensible form for decision-makers at national and state level, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives underlined in the Convention. The training also focused on the use of new data and methods to estimate the extent and severity of land degradation, and shed light on the declining condition of India’s land resources and its impact on livelihoods. The data presented in the land degradation Tool will be used for reporting to the UNCCD and as part of the indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Participants included delegates from about 40 Asia Pacific countries, as well as representatives from 12 Indian states affected by land degradation, scientists and researchers from scientific institutions of national importance and line-Ministries.   The participants were trained in the use of the state-of-the-art tool called ‘Trends.Earth’ developed by Conservation International, an NGO. The loss of productivity in both natural and managed ecosystems has serious ramifications for food security and nutrition, water availability and employment. Knowing where hotspots or problem areas are, is the first step ahead towards combating land degradation. With this data, policy-makers can prioritize areas for interventions to improve the livelihoods in rural communities that directly depend on healthy land.

The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is the only legally binding international agreement on land issues. The Convention promotes good land stewardship. Its 197 Parties aim, through partnerships, to implement the Convention and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The end goal is to protect land from over-use and drought, so it can continue to provide food, water and energy. By sustainably managing land and striving to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality, now and in the future, not only will the impact of climate change be reduced, but a conflict over natural resources will be avoided.   

The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is the nodal Ministry for this Convention, as well as the other two Rio Conventions - United Nations Framework Convention to Combat Climate Change and the Convention on Biological  Diversity, having their genesis in the Earth Summit in 1992 in Rio De Janerio, Brazil.

                Emphasising the importance of land as a resource and the need to protect and harness its resources in a manner that does not adversely affect its health, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has underlined the critical need to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) by 2030.  Inaugurating the four-day Asia-Pacific Regional Workshop of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan urged the delegates to transform the Workshop into a milestone in combating land degradation, desertification and drought.  

In the global context, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that nearly 24 billion tonnes of fertile soil and 27, 000 bio-species are lost every year.  He stated that nearly 30 per cent of the world’s population lives in dry areas.  “8 out of 21 UNESCO World Heritage Sites are in drylands”, he added.  Lauding some of the success stories of other nations, the Minister mentioned Sahel Integrated Lowland ecosystem Management (SILeM) in Burkina Faso, besides the Capacity and Management Support for combating land degradation in dryland ecosystems in China.  In the Indian context, he highlighted the Sustainable land, water and biodiversity conservation and management for improved livelihoods in Uttarakhand watershed sector, as well as Sustainable Rural Livelihoods Security through Innovations in Land and ecosystem management in India.   Dr. Harsh Vardhan added that India has documented its Sustainable Land and Ecosystem Management practices in the form of SLEM book, published in 2014.

The Minister referred to various schemes of the Government of India that have been launched for capacity-building of the stakeholders at multiple levels.  Among others, he referred to some of the schemes which include - Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Soil Health Card Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PKSY), Per Drop More Crop, Swacch Bharat mission, Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP) and National Rural Drinking Water Programme.  

Addressing the gathering, Deputy Executive Secretary, UNCCD, Dr. P.K Monga said that the main objective of such Workshops is to enable country Parties to participate effectively in the UNCCD reporting process and to submit the national report in time.  In his address, UN Resident Coordinator, Mr. Yuri Afanasiev stressed that land degradation is the single most crucial issue facing the world.  “The good news, certainly for India, is that this problem is combatable and secondly, land degradation, together with issues like energy efficiency are the lowest cost, no-regret measures for the countries to adopt”, Mr. Afanasiev averred.

Earlier, Dr. Harsh Vardhan also released a report on the “Economics of Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought” at the inaugural session of the Workshop.

This Regional Workshop in India is the fourth in a series of UNCCD Workshops held around the world, with Turkey, Ethiopia and Brazil hosting the first two Workshops for their respective regions. This four-day Workshop (April 24-27, 2018) will participation of representatives from nearly 40 Asia-Pacific nations.  The Workshop will also train delegates from 12 land degradation prone states in India.  Scientists and academicians from premier scientific and research-based institutions of the country, along with senior officers of Central Government ministries that work closely with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to monitor the progress of the Convention in India, are also participating in the Workshop.

Desertification was addressed for the first time in 1977 in the United Nations Conference on Desertification. This was followed by the adoption of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Paris on 17th June 1994.  The Convention entered into force in December 1996. It is one of the three Rio Conventions, along with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). India became a signatory to the Convention on October 14, 1994 and ratified it on December 17, 1996. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) is the nodal Ministry to co-ordinate all issues pertaining to the Convention. The Convention holds a biennial Conference of Parties (CoP) to the Convention and the last CoP was held in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, in China, in September 2016. 

Additional Secretary, MoEF&CC, Mr. A.K Jain welcomed the delegates, while Joint Secretary, MoEF&CC, Mr.  Jigmet Takpa delivered the vote of thanks.

                Assuring all technical and policy support, the Centre has empahsised that in the fight against air pollution, the focus will now be on the implementation of city-specific action plans.   This was emphasised at the two-day Stakeholder Consultation to discuss the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) that concluded in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) here today. 

Drawing upon from the experiences of implementation in the States, suggestions at the Consultation included constitution of Chief Secretary level committees in the States for multi-sectoral coordination, area-specific standards, satellite monitoring, enforcement issues and high-resolution inventory for Indo-Gangetic plains. During the discussions, it was also pointed out that studies show that pollution in cities is deeply influenced by emissions from surrounding regions other than local multi-sectoral pollution sources, necessitating the need for a multi-city, multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder coordination.   

The Stakeholder Consultation also provided an opportunity to interact with international experts from Europe, United States, China, Brazil, Japan and World Bank. International experts shared their experiences in the field of air quality monitoring, modelling, management and explained the measures taken in different parts of the world to improve air quality in their respective cities. Success stories from across the world on control of air pollution and possibilities of their replication in the Indian context were also figured in the deliberations. With this objective, specific sessions were organised and sector-specific sessions were conducted to discuss sectoral issues in transport, industries, residential, refuse and dust sectors.  

Several international experiences were shared during the deliberations.  The Chinese representative highlighted the advanced stack emission control technology, which has reduced power plant emissions in China dramatically.  The Brazilian example showed how improvements in the transport sector can reduce pollution in cities, as was the case in Sao Paolo.  The Mongolian example highlighted how the improved cooking stoves can reduce PM 2.5 concentration.  The European experience showed the use of strategies to control  emissions from ammonia in the agriculture sector.  Ammonia is known to react with SO2 and NO2 to form secondary particulates.  The USA example reflected the improvements in vehicular technologies, inspection and maintenance systems and emission trading schemes.  

 

The main objective of the two-day Stakeholder meet was to carry out consultations with the State government bodies on the newly formulated NCAP and to ensure their participation during the stages of formulation and implementation.  Specific technological and management options were also suggested. It was acknowledged that issues arising from city-level pollution also need to be dealt with on a regional scale and coordination between different agencies across various states is required. It was also pointed out that there is a need to empower state-level agencies and provide them with a roadmap for implementation of NCAP.  During the discussions, it was emphasised that the cities must assess their air quality, source contributions and derive action plans based on their local conditions and resource availability.   

In its presentation on NCAP, MoEF&CC indicated its commitment to collaborative and participatory approach for its effective implementation.  It was however, also emphasized that source-based initiatives as measures to address industrial pollution, vehicular pollution and road dust need to be a part of city-specific plans and cannot be integrated in NCAP, which basically provides a broad roadmap to address the issue of air pollution in the country.

    Besides international experts, national experts from Indian Institute of Technology (Kanpur), Indian Institute of Technology (Mumbai), Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (Pune), The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) also participated.

The two-day Consultation was attended by representatives from more than 20 States/Union Territories.  The Consultation was organized with support from Central Pollution Control Board, The World Bank, and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI).  The Stakeholder Consultation was inaugurated by the Minister of State for (EF&CC) Dr. Mahesh Sharma yesterday.

                The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has framed a new draft Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 2018.   The draft notification has been uploaded on the Ministry’s website on April 18, 2018.  Comments have been sought from the public within 60 days of the uploading of the draft Notification

.

The salient features of the draft CRZ Notification, 2018 and changes with respect to CRZ Notification, 2011, are as under:-

 

(i)         The High Tide Line (HTL) has been demarcated by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) and shall be reckoned as a universal standard for the HTL for all regulatory purposes under the CRZ Notification, 2018.

(ii)        Hazard line mapping has also been carried out by Survey of India.  The Hazard Line has, however, been delinked from the CRZ regulatory regime and shall be used only as a tool for Disaster Management and planning of adaptive and mitigation measures.

(iii)       CRZ limits on land along the tidal influenced water bodies has been proposed to be reduced from 100 meters or the width of the creek, whichever is less, to 50 meters or the width of the creek, whichever is less.

(iv)       A No Development Zone (NDZ) of 20 meters has been proposed to be stipulated for all Islands close to the main land coast and for all Backwater Islands in the main land.  

(v)        For CRZ-III areas, two separate categories have been proposed viz.:

 


	CRZ-III A – Densely populated rural areas with a population density of 2161 per square kilometre as per 2011 Census.  Such areas shall have an NDZ of 50 meters from the HTL as against 200 meters from the HTL stipulated in the CRZ Notification, 2011.
	CRZ-III B – Rural areas with population density of below 2161 per square kilometre as per 2011 Census. Such areas shall continue to have an NDZ of 200 meters from the HTL.


 

(vi)       The procedure for CRZ clearances has been simplified and delegations have been made at various levels for recommending/according CRZ clearances to the projects/activities.  Only such projects/activities, which are located in the CRZ-I & IV areas, shall be dealt with for CRZ clearance by the MoEF&CC.  For all other project activities located in CRZ-II/III areas, CRZ clearance shall be considered at the level of the CZMA.

(vii)      As per CRZ, 2011 Notification, for CRZ-II areas, Floor Space Index (FSI) or the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) had been frozen at 1991 Development Control Regulation (DCR) levels.  In the Draft CRZ, 2018 Notification, it has been proposed to de-freeze the same and permit FSI for construction projects, as prevailing on the date of the new Notification.

(viii)     Temporary tourism facilities such as shacks, toilet blocks, change rooms, drinking water facilities etc. have been proposed in Beaches. Such temporary tourism facilities are also proposed to be permissible in the No Development Zone (NDZ) of the CRZ-III areas.

(ix)       Wherever there is a National or State Level Highway passing through the NDZ in CRZ-III areas, temporary tourism facilities have been proposed to be taken up on the seaward site of the roads.  On the landward side of such roads in the NDZ, Resorts/Hotels and other tourism facilities have also been proposed to be permitted subject to the extant regulations of the concerned State.

(x)        Regulated limestone mining is proposed to be permitted, subject to strict Environmental safeguards, in areas adequately above the height of HTL, based on recommendations of reputed National Institutes in the Mining field.

 

The relaxations/amendment proposed in the CRZ Notification, 2018 shall, however, come into force only after the respective Coastal Zone Management Programme (CZMP) framed to the CRZ Notification, 2011 have been revised/updated by the States/UTs, as per the provisions of the CRZ, 2018 Notification and approved by the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change.

The Ministry had constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. Shailesh Nayak to examine the various issues and concerns of Coastal States/UTs and various other stakeholders and to recommend appropriate changes in the CRZ Notification, 2011.  The report submitted by Dr. Shailesh Nayak has been examined in the Ministry and consultations have been held with various stakeholders in this regard.  

The MoEF&CC had received representations from various coastal states/UTs, besides other stakeholders, for a comprehensive review of the provisions of the CRZ Notification, 2011, particularly related to the management and conservation of marine and coastal eco-systems, development in coastal areas, eco-tourism, livelihood option and sustainable development of coastal communities etc.

The Coastal Regulation Zone Notification was last reviewed and issued in 2011, with periodic amendments to some clauses.

                Emphasizing the need to translate the outcome of the deliberations, in the form of suggestions on the ground, Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma has said that the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is expected to play a crucial role in addressing the increasing air pollution across the country in a comprehensive manner.  Inaugurating the two-day Stakeholder Consultation on NCAP here today, Dr. Sharma emphasised the impact of air pollution on health and general well-being of human, floral and faunal population.  He said that stakeholders are and must act as “givers” to the society. 

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri C.K Mishra said, “While as a nation, we need to be concerned at the quality of air, as a Government we need to have that commitment to ensure that there is a defined time-frame that we may set for ourselves after today’s discussions”.   He added that all the states and stakeholders need to spread the campaign for clean air across the country.  The Secretary pointed out that technology is one of the critical elements of NCAP.  “Let us together find solutions that are nationally acceptable, but more importantly, which are locally possible”, Shri Mishra stated.

The Stakeholder Consultation involves all the State Governments, considering that NCAP is a pan-India programme and inputs from states will be useful in evolving an effective implementation strategy.  The overall objective of the NCAP is comprehensive management plan for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution besides augmenting the air quality monitoring network across the country. The NCAP focuses on collaborative and participatory approach covering all sources of pollution and coordination between relevant Central Ministries, State Governments, local bodies and other stakeholders.  

The focus is on intensive awareness, training and capacity-building drive, with specific impetus on augmentation of manpower and infrastructure facilities of CPCB and SPCB under the capacity building component of NCAP. Separate components with emphasis on three tier mechanism for review of monitoring, assessment and inspection for effective implementation under NCAP. A credible, transparent and accountable data collection and monitoring system that is available for timely swift action is to be ensured.

Since air pollution mitigation necessitates collaborative efforts, the success of NCAP is expected to be determined by the participation and contribution of stakeholders. Accordingly, there is a need for consultation with various stakeholders viz. state governments, relevant ministries, institutes, academic institutions and industries.  The approved NCAP has already been shared with state governments and has also been uploaded on the Ministry’s website for inviting comments from the public. 

The key components of NCAP include - city-specific air pollution abatement action plan for 100 polluting cities of the country similar to one for Delhi, increasing the number of monitoring stations, data dissemination, public participation on planning and implementation, setting up of Air Information Centre for data analysis, resource apportionment studies, setting up of national inventory, guidelines for indoor air pollution and setting up of rural monitoring stations.

MoEF&CC has formalized the NCAP as a long-term time bound national level strategy to tackle the increasing air pollution problem across the country in a comprehensive manner.   The total tentative cost of NCAP is estimated at Rs 637 crore.     

Representatives from World Bank and The Energy Resources Institute (TERI), Secretary, Ministry of Coal, Shri Susheel Kumar, Secretary, DST, Prof Ashutosh Sharma, Additional Secretary, MoEF&CC, Shri A.K Jain, Joint Secretary, MoEF&CC, Smt. Manju Pandey, Chairman, Central Pollution Control Board, Shri S.P.S Parihar, Chairman, EPCA, Shri Bhure Lal and other officers of the Ministry were present at the inaugural session of the Consultation.  In addition, officials from State Governments, including officials from SPCBs also participated in the Consultation.

                           Agricultural experts from SAARC nations will present a position paper on ways and means of addressing impact of climate change on agriculture and discuss adaptation measures for climate resilient agrarian systems at the three-day SAARC regional Conference on “Climate Resilient Agricultural Policies, Strategies and Programmes”.  The regional Conference was inaugurated by Chief Secretary of Telangana, Dr.Shailendra Kumar Joshi,at ICAR-National Academy of Agricultural Research Management (NAARM) in Hyderabad today.  More than 80 senior officers and agricultural experts from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka attended the inaugural session of the Conference.The consultation will not only strengthen partnership amongst SAARC countries on climate resilient agricultural systems, but also cover research, economics and innovative policy towards climate smart agriculture in South Asia.  A discussion on the UNFCCC decision on agriculture will also be held during the Conference.

 

Speaking at the inauguration, Telangana Chief Secretary said that there is a unique opportunity to shape and strengthen the process, as well as global attention and action to support climate resilient agricultural systems and dependent communities. “We in South Asia have many things in common in agricultural practices, food systems and therefore, there is a great opportunity to share our experiences towards effective adaptation to climate change”, Dr. Joshi said.

 

In his opening remarks, Adviser, MoEF&CCand APN National Focal Point of India, Dr. J.R Bhatt said, “It is only through combined strength that we can address the looming threat of climate change. The regional consultation provides such a common platform for South Asian countries to learn, share and reflect on the impact of climate change on agriculture. The regional consultation is also opportune because Parties to the UNFCCC at CoP23 had put in place for the first time a joint work programme on climate change and agriculture, the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture.”

 

Delivering the keynote address Dr.Kirit Parikh emphasised on the need to undertake district-level analysis to develop climate resilient agrarian solutions.

 

Among the dignitaries present at the inaugural session were Chairman, IRADe, Dr.Kirit Parikh, Director, NAARM, Dr SrinivasaRao, Director General, India Meteorological Department, Dr. K J Ramesh, Vice Chancellor, University of Hyderabad, Dr. P AppaRao and Mr Yukihiro Imanari representing APN Secretariat and Dr. WART Wickramaarachchi SAARC Agriculture Centre respectively.  The regional consultation has been jointly organized by SAARC Agriculture Centre (SAC), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), India, Bangladesh, Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN), Japan, and ICAR-NAARM. 

 

 

Agricultural experts and officers from SAARC nations at the three-day Conference in Hyderabad

 

SAARC accounts for one-fourth of the global population and around 67 percent of its population lives in rural areas (as per 2014 statistics). Almost half of the workforce is employed in the agriculture sector and around 42 percent of South Asia’s landmass is under agricultural operation. Much of the agricultural production in the region is undertaken by small holders and an average range of landholding in SAARC countries varies between 0.3 to 1.4 hectares. Agriculture plays a central role in South Asian economies, lives and livelihoods. Crops grown in the region are important, both for regional and global food security.

                The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has notified the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules 2018.  The amended Rules lay down that the phasing out of Multilayered Plastic (MLP) is now applicable to MLP, which are “non-recyclable, or non-energy recoverable, or with no alternate use.”  

 

The amended Rules also prescribe a central registration system for the registration of the producer/importer/brand owner.  The Rules also lay down that any mechanism for the registration should be automated and should take into account ease of doing business for producers, recyclers and manufacturers.   The centralised registration system will be evolved by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for the registration of the producer/importer/brand owner.  While a national registry has been prescribed for producers with presence in more than two states, a state-level registration has been prescribed for smaller producers/brand owners operating within one or two states. 

 

In addition, Rule 15 of the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules 2018 on “explicit pricing of carry bags” has been omitted.  

 

Based on several representations received from various stakeholders, MoEF&CC had constituted a committee on issues/challenges faced with regard to the implementation of Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 and Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.  The committee deliberated on several issues related to the Rules and its implementation by various stakeholders and submitted its recommendations to the Ministry.  

 

The Ministry notified the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2018 on March 27, 2018.

                Complaints have been received from the Foreign Diplomatic Missions / UN Organizations regarding unwillingness of vendors / suppliers / E-commerce websites to record the UIN (Unique Identify Number) while making sales to such Embassies / Missions / Consulates or UN organizations.

 

Unique Identification Number (UIN) is a 15-digit unique number allotted to any specialised agency of the United Nations Organisation or any Multilateral Financial Institution and Organisation notified under the United Nations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, 1947, Consulate or Embassy of foreign countries. First two digits of the UIN denotes State code where such entity is located.

 

It may be noted that supply to Foreign Diplomatic Missions / UN Organizations is like any other Business to Consumer (B2C) supply and will not have any additional impact on the supplier’s tax liability. Recording of UIN while making such supplies by the suppliers will enable Foreign Diplomatic Missions / UN Organizations to claim refund of the taxes paid by them in India. Therefore, it is advised that suppliers should record the UIN of the Embassies / Missions / Consulates or UN organizations on the tax invoice.

 

It has been noticed many big brands for groceries, clothing, super stores etc. have been denying this facility to Embassies and Consulates. Such organizations / stores are advised to amend their processes / software and enable recording of UIN when insisted upon by a diplomat or an official of a Foreign Diplomatic Missions / UN Organizations.

 

Attention is invited to Circular No. 43/17/2018-GST dated 13th April 2018 which provides that recording of UIN on the invoice is a necessary condition under rule 46 of the CGST Rules, 2017. If suppliers / vendors are not recording the UINs, action may be initiated against them under the provisions of the CGST Act, 2017.

 

Search functionality for UIN is available on the GST Common Portal in “Search Taxpayer” option. On entering UIN and captcha, details of the entity will be available.

                During 2017-18, total revenue collected under GST in the period between August 2017 and March 2018 has been Rs. 7.19 lakh crore. This includes Rs. 1.19 lakh crore of CGST, Rs. 1.72 lakh crore of SGST, Rs. 3.66 lakh crore of IGST (including Rs. 1.73 lakh crore on imports) and Rs. 62,021 crore of cess (including Rs. 5702 crore on imports). For this eight months, the average monthly collection has been Rs. 89,885 crore. 

While the tax on domestic supplies in a month is collected through the process of returns and gets collected in the next month, IGST and cess on imports gets collected in the same month. Therefore, during the current year, GST on domestic supplies has been collected only in eight months from August 2017 to March 2018, IGST and cess on imports has been collected for nine months, from July 2017 to March 2018. Including the collection of July 2017, the total GST collection during the financial year 2017-18 stands provisionally at Rs. 7.41 lakh crore.

Revenue of the States

The SGST collection during the year, including the settlement of IGST has been Rs. 2.91 lakh crore and the total compensation released to the States for a period of eight months during the last financial year was Rs. 41,147 crore to ensure that the revenue of the States is protected at the level of 14% over the base year tax collection in 2015-16. The revenue gap of each State is coming down over last eight months. The average revenue gap of all states for last year is around 17%.

Return Filing During the year

There has been a progressive improvement in the compliance level observed during the course of the year. Following table shows the percentage of returns filed as on due date and the cumulative level of compliance.

As may be seen, the compliance level as on the due date has steadily increased and, by the end of the financial year, has reached to an average of 65% from around 55-57% observed during initial months. The cumulative compliance levels (percentage of returns filed till date) for initial months has crossed 90% and for July, 2018, has reached 96%. 

There are State-wise variations in the compliance level observed till due date. However, including delayed filings, the State-wise compliance levels converge over a period of time.

                Assam need to grow at more than double digit numbers for enabling its per capita income and some other indicators in health and particularly outcomes in education sector to catch up with the All India average, said Shri N.K.Singh, Chairman 15th Finance Commission at a Press Conference after holding interactive sessions with the State government, representatives of various political parties and local bodies. State has made significant progress in last couple of years in achieving high growth rates in revenue generation and maintaining macro-economic stability specially in maintaining Debt to GSDP ratio, he said. State has an enormous challenge in improving the quality of expenditure further. It was recognized by the Govt. of Assam that despite an increase in the capital expenditure, much more is desired to fill the gap in expenditure needs for infrastructure. 

Chairman noted that significant improvements have been made in the working of the Power sector, not only in the field of availability of power but also in the field of reducing T&D losses and achieving 100% metering. Assam has already subscribed to the UDAY bonds which is appreciable.

Commission empathize with the problems faced by the State of Assam in the form of destruction caused by floods, difficulties in training the river Brahmaputra and other flood management systems. Commission appreciated the creative idea given by Chief Minister Shri Sarbanand Sonowal regarding creation of embankment cum circular road to protect Majuli Island and stated that these will be considered in the broader framework of Disaster Relief and Management. 

Commission noted the complex issues and the uncertainty faced by the state due to GST implementation. While the outcomes needed to be watched further, the Govt of India has assured a 14% revenue buoyancy for four years which covers the first year of the award period of the 15th Finance Commission. The abolition of Planning Commission and the new financing mechanisms need to be considered to ensure that the ongoing growth momentum continues. 

Assam - Key state in Act East Policy
 

State Govt team led by Chief Minister Shri Sarbanand Sonowal and Finance Minister Dr. Himanta Biswa Sharma made a detailed and pointed presentation to explain the nitty-gritty of the state finances in all the sectors. Presentation went on for more than 3 hours. In his welcome remarks, Chief Minister welcomed the Commission and thanked the members for their positive approach in understanding various issues related to the state. During the presentation, State Govt. emphasised on following:


	Budget expenditure has increased from INR 42000 crore in 2015-17 to around 70000 crore in 2017-18 with capital expenditure increasing from around 4900 crore to 12800 crore in the same period.
	Revenue collection has shown an average increase of around 20% annually in last two years other than GST.
	Special consideration and financing mechanism needs to be evolved for the protection of Majuli Island.
	For the purpose of devolution, Sixth schedule areas should be treated as general areas as they are more backward than general areas. 
	Infrastructure needs of the state needs to be seen in context of the strategic position of the state and internal security requirements.
	State Govt. sought to consider giving weightage to some composite index related to Human Development.
	State Government has tailored its development efforts around the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.


The Chief Minister on behalf of the State Government would submit a detailed Memorandum to the Commission. Chairman complemented the Govt. of Assam for making outstanding and enlightening presentation to the commission regarding the opportunities and challenges in all the sectors of the economy of the state. He also stated that the issues raised would receive appropriate consideration during deliberation in the Commission. Assam is the doorway to the Act-East Policy of India, and therefore very critical to India’s strategic and trade relations with its Eastern neighbours. We understand that infrastructural development is very critical for making it successful. Commission also urged the State Govt. to consider the ways to attract more private investment through PPP for infrastructure development.

Interactive session with the representatives of Trade and Industry to be held tomorrow (27th April 2018) 


Earlier, Feedbacks and recommendations were sought from the local bodies by the Commission. Representatives from the local bodies like the Gram Panchayat, Jila Parishad and Anchalik Parishad of the State were present in the meeting to express their views and concerns regarding important issues of their areas. The Urban local bodies like Guwahati Municipal Corporations also put forth their issues and suggestions to tackle these issues to the Commission in the meeting. The Mayor of the Guwahati Municipal Corporation said that as the City’s population is very high, the problems are also many in numbers. He urged the Commission to provide funds to deal with recurrent issues like the artificial flood, maintenance of the water bodies, improving of lanes and bylanes, maintenance of cremation grounds, dumping grounds among other issues. The Commission also met the leaders of various political parties like the BJP, AIUDF, Congress, AGP, CPI, CPM, and others to understand the opportunities and the challenges in the state. It will hold an interactive session with representatives of Trade and Industry on 27th April 2018.


15th Finance Commission is on 3 day visit to the state of Assam from yesterday (25th April 2018). The Commission led by the Chairman Shri N.K.Singh, Members – Shri Shaktikanta Das, Dr. Anoop Singh, Dr. Ashok Lahiri, Dr. Ramesh Chand and Secretary Shri Arvind Mehta along with other officials held meetings with the Hon. Chief Minister, Hon. Finance Minister and other officials of the state at Assam Administrative Staff College, Khanapara.

Commission also held wide ranging interactions with the leaders of various political parties, and Local bodies and received detailed insights into the opportunities and challenges lying ahead for the state.

The Commission appreciates the constructive and useful suggestions made by the State Govt towards empowerment of the states and their development. 

The Commission also placed on record its appreciation for the warm hospitality extended by the State Govt. The Commission also looked forward to continuing interaction with the State Government. Assam is the second state being visited by the Fifteenth Finance Commission, the first being Arunachal Pradesh. As part of the consultative process, Finance Commission will visit different States, understand their developmental requirements and their resource availability, and then firm up its conclusions, recommendations and Report. Commission will finalise its recommendations by October 2019 after completing its discussions with all the State Governments, the Government Of India and relevant stakeholders.

                The Finance Act, 2018 has withdrawn the exemption under clause (38) of Section 10 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) and has introduced a new section 112A in the Act, to provide that long term capital gains arising from transfer of a long-term capital asset being an equity share in a company or a unit of an equity oriented fund or a unit of a business trust shall be taxed at 10 per cent of such capital gains exceeding one lakh rupees. The said section, inter alia, provides that the provisions of the section shall apply to the capital gains arising from a transfer of long-term capital asset being an equity share in a company, only if securities transaction tax (STT) has been paid on acquisition and transfer of such capital asset. 

However, to provide the applicability of the tax regime under Section 112A of the Act to genuine cases where the STT could not have been paid, it has also been provided in sub-section (4) of Section 112A of the Act that the Central Government may specify, by notification, the nature of acquisitions in respect of which the requirement of payment of STT shall not apply in the case of acquisition of equity share in a company. 

In order to have wider consultation in this matter, the draft of notification proposed to be issued under Section 112A (4) of the Act has been uploaded on www.incometaxindia.gov.in.  Stakeholders are requested to submit their comments/ suggestions on the draft notification by 30th April, 2018 at the e-mail address dirtpl2[at]nic[dot]in.

                The Government of India, the Government of Madhya Pradesh and the World Bank today signed a $210 million loan agreement for the Madhya Pradesh Rural Connectivity Project. The Project is expected to improve the durability, resilience and safety of the gravel surfaced rural roads and enhance the capacity of the state to manage its rural roads network. 

The Project will cover 10,510 km stretch of rural roads in Madhya Pradesh that fall under the Chief Minister’s Gram Sadak Yojana (CMGSY) program. Of this 10,000 km will be upgraded from existing gravel to bituminous surface roads, while 510 km of new roads will be built to the same bituminous surface standard. 

""Government of India is making all efforts to ensure that communities in the most remote areas across the country are connected through a road network. All weather road connectivity is crucial for economic growth, especially in the rural areas,” said Shri Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. “The Madhya Pradesh roads project will enhance rural road connectivity in the state which will open up opportunities for economic development and access to social services for beneficiary communities in the state and help in reducing poverty.” 

The agreement for the Project was signed by Shri  Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; Shri Pankaj Jhawar, Chief General Manager, Madhya Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority on behalf of the Government of Madhya Pradesh; and Mr Hisham Abdo, Acting Country Director, World Bank India, on behalf of the World Bank. 

“This project will leverage resources to support innovations in road construction, improve road safety, and reduce carbon footprint in the transport sector by mainstreaming climate resilient technology in road design and construction,” said Mr  Hisham Abdo, Acting Country Director, World Bank India. Gravel surfaced roads are more prone to washouts than paved roads during flood seasons. This project will undertake resilience measures such as surface sealing of roads, embankment pitching, and balancing culverts to prevent damages caused by extreme flood events. 

The transport sector is one of the most significant emitters of greenhouse gases. Alternate sealing options for road construction like polymer modified asphalt, asphalt blended with plastic waste, and multiple surface treatment to be piloted on approximately 20 percent of the length will not only be more cost-effective but will also reduce the carbon footprint of the transport sector. 

This project, on a pilot basis, will engage women self-help groups (SHG) in the post construction maintenance activity. This will involve routine maintenance of off-carriage way parts of the road, while the main carriageway maintenance will remain part of the original contractor’s contract. The SHG members will be trained through the project, and their work will be directly supervised and managed by the Madhya Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority (MPRRDA) field offices. In fact, a direct maintenance contract will be executed between the SHG group and MPRRDA for 3-5 years. 

Recognizing that road safety is a critical issue, the project will strengthen road safety management systems with the objective of reducing fatalities and serious injuries from road accidents. 

The project will focus on improving road accident data collection and analysis at central and state levels through implementation of the Road Accident Database Management System (RADMS); strengthen road safety capacity at the central level; and focus on training. 

The state will pilot a comprehensive Road Safety Program (PCRSP) in districts with most fatal and serious injuries recorded in the recent past. It plans to undertake a bottom-up approach by engaging and empowering local communities to develop customized solutions to improve road safety. 

“The Project will benefit the rural people residing in very small villages in Madhya Pradesh. The construction of sealed roads under the project will help reduce transport costs, improve road safety and minimize post-harvest losses for farmers by ensuring transport services in all seasons. The project will also help in reducing pollution and increase access to jobs, markets, schools and health facility for the rural population thus reducing the migration towards urban areas. It will implement a range of contracting and institutional reform measures and update standards and specifications, with a particular emphasis on road safety,” said Shri Pankaj Jhawar, Chief General Manager (MPRCP), Madhya Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority.

                The Fifteenth Finance Commission of the Government of India is visiting Assam, the gateway to the North East of India from 25th to 27th April 2018. The Commission will assess the state of the finances of Assam, its socio-economic challenges and understand the efforts of the State Government to tackle these. Assam, of late, has made visible strides in growth and socio-economic development, transcending its geographical and historical challenges. However, there are significant opportunities for accelerating the momentum in the State’s health, educational and economic outcomes. Demographic diversities give rise to myriad socio-cultural conditions and contingencies offering developmental challenges of various forms. Notwithstanding recent growth spurt, endemic structural issues need to be addressed in a time bound manner.

 

During 3 day visit, the Finance Commission led by the Chairman Shri N.K.Singh, Members – Shri Shaktikanta Das, Dr. Anoop Singh, Dr. Ashok Lahiri and Dr. Ramesh Chand will have meetings with Chief Minister, Ministers and other officials of the state. Detailed presentations will be made on the finances of the State Government. The Commission will also meet leaders of various political parties, Representatives of Autonomous Councils, Representatives of Trade and Industry viz. Chambers of Commerce/Assam branch of FICCI, Assam Branch of Indian Tea Association, and other stakeholders to understand the opportunities and the challenges in the state. There will also be interactive session with Urban Local Bodies and Panchayati Raj Institutions.

 

Assam is the second state that will be visited by the Fifteenth Finance Commission, the first being Arunachal Pradesh. It is an integral part of the agenda of the Finance Commission to visit different States, understand their developmental requirements and their resource availability, and then firm up its conclusions, recommendations and Report. 

 

Background  :

 

Key Socio - Economic Indicators during 2016 -17


	The economy of the state is primarily agricultural. As per Census 2011, about 50% of the total workforce still depend on agriculture. Even though the state is rich in terms of oil, gas and other natural resources, industrialisation and urbanisation remain limited. 
	Notwithstanding, the service sector has become important in the state's economy in the recent past. 
	Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) at 47 per 1,000 live births was higher than all India average (37 per 1,000 live births).
	Maternal Mortality Rate is also much higher than the National Average.
	Life expectancy at 64.7 years was lower than the all India average (68.3 years).
	The literacy rate of Assam was 72.2 per cent against all India percentage of 73.
	Decadal population growth (16.93 per cent) of the State was lower than that of the country (17.64 per cent).
	Per capita income of INR 67,620 was lower than all India average of INR 1,03,870. 


Commission to explore ways and means to enhance Per Capita Income of Assam

 

The Commission recognizes the special characteristics of Assam and notwithstanding acceleration in growth momentum; it will have to make enormous development strides to catch up with national averages particularly with respect to per capita income. It is a matter of concern that per capita income of Assam is significantly lower than All India average which itself is lower than other emerging markets. Commission, therefore, would seek to explore opportunity of what structural, administrative and other changes are necessary by way of augmenting resources of state and also its proper utilization.

 

The Finance Commission needs to make an in-depth Study of the recent developments and future possibilities of economic growth and development of Assam. This will be based on the various interactions and meetings that the Commission is scheduled to have in Assam during its visit.

                A number of representations have been received seeking clarifications in relation to requirement of e-Way Bill for “Bill To Ship To” model of supplies. In a typical “Bill To Ship To” model of supply, there are three persons involved in a transaction, namely: 


	‘A’ is the person who has ordered ‘B’ to send goods directly to ‘C’.
	‘B’ is the person who is sending goods directly to ‘C’ on behalf of ‘A’.
	‘C’ is the recipient of goods.


 


	
		
			 
			
		
	


 

 

 

2. In this complete scenario two supplies are involved and accordingly two tax invoices are required to be issued:


	Invoice -1, which would be issued by ‘B’ to ‘A’.
	Invoice -2 which would be issued by ‘A’ to ‘C’.


 

3. Queries have been raised as to who would generate the e-Way Bill for the movement of goods which is taking place from ‘B’ to ‘C’ on behalf of ‘A’. It is clarified that as per the CGST Rules, 2017 either ‘A’ or ‘B’ can generate the e-Way Bill but it may be noted that only one e-Way Bill is required to be generated as per the following procedure:

Case -1: Where e-Way Bill is generated by ‘B’, the following fields shall be filled in Part A of GST FORM EWB-01:

                        


	
		
			
			1.
			
			
			Bill From:
			
			
			In this field details of ‘B’ are supposed to be filled.

			 
			
		
		
			
			2.
			
			
			Dispatch From:
			
			
			This is the place from where goods are actually dispatched. It may be the principal or additional place of business of ‘B’.
			
		
		
			
			3.
			
			
			Bill To: 
			
			
			In this field details of ‘A’ are supposed to be filled.
			
		
		
			
			4.
			
			
			Ship to:  
			
			
			In this field address of ‘C’ is supposed to be filled.
			
		
		
			
			5.
			
			
			Invoice Details:
			
			
			Details of Invoice-1 are supposed to be filled
			
		
	


 

Case -2: Where e-Way Bill is generated by ‘A’, the following fields shall be filled in Part A of GST FORM EWB-01:

 


	
		
			
			1.
			
			
			Bill From:

                Fugitive Economic Offenders Ordinance, 2018 has come into force as the President of India has given his assent to the Union Cabinet’s decision to promulgate the said Ordinance. Earlier, the Union Cabinet, in its meeting held on 21st April, 2018, had decided to approve the proposal of the Ministry of Finance to promulgate the Fugitive Economic Offenders Ordinance, 2018.

Fugitive Economic Offenders Ordinance, 2018 (“the Ordinance”) lays down the measures to empower Indian authorities to attach and confiscate proceeds of crime associated with economic offenders and the properties of the economic offenders and thereby deter economic offenders from evading the process of Indian law by remaining outside the jurisdiction of Indian courts.                      

The need for the Ordinance has arisen as there have been instances of economic offenders fleeing the jurisdiction of Indian courts, anticipating the commencement, or during the pendency, of criminal proceedings. The absence of such offenders from Indian courts has several deleterious consequences - first, it hampers investigation in criminal cases; second, it wastes precious time of courts of law, third, it undermines the rule of law in India. The existing civil and criminal provisions in law are not entirely adequate to deal with the severity of the problem. In view of the above context, a Budget announcement was made by the Government in the Budget 2017-18 that the Government was considering to introduce legislative changes or even a new law to confiscate the assets of such absconders till they submit to the jurisdiction of the appropriate legal forum.Pursuant to the above announcement, the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, 2018 was introduced in LokSabha on the 12th March, 2018. The Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, 2018 was listed for consideration and passing in LokSabha on many occasions after its introduction. The LokSabha has since been adjourned sine die and both the Houses of Parliament were prorogued on 6thApril, 2018.          

            In order to address the deficiency in the present laws and lay down measures to deter economic offenders from evading the process of Indian law by remaining outside the jurisdiction of Indian courts, the Ordinance is being proposed. The Ordinance makes provisions for a Court (‘Special Court’ under the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002) to declare a person as a Fugitive Economic Offender. A Fugitive Economic Offender is a person against whom an arrest warrant has been issued in respect of a scheduled offence and who has left India so as to avoid criminal prosecution, or being abroad, refuses to return to India to face criminal prosecution. A scheduled offence refers to a list of economic offences contained in the Schedule to this Ordinance. Further, in order to ensure that Courts are not over-burdened with such cases, only those cases where the total value involved in such offences is 100 crore rupees or more, is within the purview of this Ordinance. The Fugitive Economic Offenders Ordinance, 2018, inter alia provides for–

(i)         making an application before the Special Court for a declaration that an individual is a fugitive economic offender;

(ii)        attachment of the property of a fugitive economic offender and proceeds of crime;

(iii)       issue of a notice by the Special Court to the individual alleged to be a fugitive economic offender;

(iv)     confiscation of the property of an individual declared as a fugitive economic offender or even the proceeds of crime;

(v)        disentitlement of the fugitive economic offender from defending any civil claim; and

(vi)       appointment of an Administrator to manage and dispose of the confiscated property under the Act.

            If at any point of time in the course of the proceeding prior to the declaration, however, the alleged Fugitive Economic Offender returns to India and submits to the appropriate jurisdictional Court, proceedings under the proposed Act would cease by law. All necessary constitutional safeguards in terms of providing hearing to the person through counsel, allowing him time to file a reply, serving notice of summons to him, whether in India or abroad and appeal to the High Court have been provided for. 

            Major impact: It is expected that a special forum to be created for expeditious confiscation of the proceeds of crime, in India or abroad,would coerce the fugitive to return to India to submit to the jurisdiction of Courts in India to face the law in respect of scheduled offences.     

            Since the proposed law would utilise the existing infrastructure of the Special Courts constituted under under the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 and the threshold of scheduled offence is high at Rs. 100 crores or more, no additional expenditure is expected on the enactment of the Bill.      

            No. of beneficiaries:   The Bill is expected to re-establish the Rule Of Law with respect to the Fugitive Economic Offenders as they would be forced to return to India to face trial for scheduled offences. This would also help the banks and other financial institutions to achieve higher recovery from financial defaults committed by such fugitive economic offenders, improving the financial health of such institutions.  

States/districts covered:   The new law would cover all the States and Districts.

Mr. Chairman, 


	Since we met in October last year, global economic recovery has continued to strengthen and the outlook for the next two years is encouraging. The United States, Europe and Asia have benefited from buoyancy in global trade and investments. However, there are concerns that a durable recovery may remain constrained by factors such as the persistence of low productivity in advanced economies (AEs), debt overhang problems in AEs and some emerging market economies (EMEs), rising populism and protectionism, and slow pace of structural reforms, notably in infrastructure sector and labor laws. Measures that reduce structural impediments, strengthen policy buffers, and promote inclusive growth, will lay the basis for enduring recovery. 



	As called upon by the First G20 Meeting of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of G20 leaders in March 2018 in Buenos Aires, we need to deploy all our policy tools to support strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Their implementation should be coordinated with fiscal support that is flexible and focused on high quality investment to support growth and debt sustainability. As earlier called by G-20 Leaders at the Hamburg Summit in 2017, we also need to reaffirm our commitment to cooperative trade and investment framework, based on a principle of level playing field. 



	Growth in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is improving although prospects in some countries are challenging due to the recent commodity price movements. We support a strengthening of structural policy adjustments based on sustainable fiscal and monetary policies to sustain global economic resilience. We also support the implementation of sound financial sector policies to mitigate risks within the international financial system.  


The Role of IMF- Architecture of Global Cooperation 


	Although the quota increases under the 14th General Review of Quotas (GRQ), renewal of New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) and bilateral commitments have helped in maintaining the current lending capacity, the International Monetary Fund would continue to require sufficient resources to respond to actual, potential, or prospective financing needs going forward, in line with its mandate. A strong quota-based permanent resource base for the IMF would serve to strengthen the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN) and mitigate risks to the international monetary system. We strongly support the shared multilateral commitment on completing the 15th GRQ by the 2019 Spring Meetings and no later than the 2019 Annual Meetings as we call for the realignment of quota shares of EMDEs whose under-representation has increased further by 0.5 percentage points in the last update leading to underrepresentation ofEMDEs by 7.5 per cent. We also lend our voice in favour of protecting the quota and voting share of the poorest members under the 15th GRQ. 



	The IMF should continue to strengthen its capacity for multilateral surveillance to identify evolving global vulnerabilities. We welcome the emphasis by the Fund on sharpening its toolkit to serve the membership, especially the low income countries (LICs) with meaningful and timely lending support and policy advice. We welcome the Fund’s engagement and coherence with Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs), which would strengthen the GFSN. 



	We call upon the IMF to develop credible policy advice for rebalancing of the global economy while drawing attention to the adverse implications of policy spillovers on other countries. The intensifying challenges to multilateralism call for unequivocal and forceful voice of the IMF and WTO in favour of rule-based international trading system and against protectionism. 


DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CONSTITUENCY 


	
	
		BANGLADESH 
	
	
	The Bangladesh economy continues to perform well, supported by steady monetary policy management and fiscal discipline. The real GDP growth in FY18 (ending in June 2018) is projected to remain strong at around 7.4 percent compared to 7.3 percent in FY17. After picking up in mid-FY18 following higher flood-related food prices, inflation is expected to decline to below 6 per cent, which is the central bank’s FY18 ceiling. In FY18 so far, point-to-point inflation has risen to 5.8 per cent (annual average CPI inflation is 5.7 per cent) in December 2017. 



	Monetary policy stance will continue to remain prudent, and the authorities remain vigilant against upside risks to inflation and in readiness for policy rate adjustments. Excess liquidity in the banking system has declined in recent months, as credit growth has picked up. The central bank is engaged in strengthening supervision and corporate governance in banks that can lead to lower credit and concentration risks and, subsequently, lower non-performing loans (NPLs). 



	On the external front, the current account balance recorded a deficit of US$ 1.5billion during FY17 so far against a high surplus of US$ 4.3 billion in FY16, because of strong import growth (9.0 per cent) accompanying slight acceleration in exports (1.7 per cent) and a steep decline in remittance inflows (14.5 per cent) resulting in forex reserves depletion and Taka depreciation. The FY18 current account deficit (CAD) is projected at US$ 4.3 billion. Import coverage by reserves – currently at US$ 33.2 billion – is at 6 months in FY18 – slightly lower than in FY17. Bangladesh government is proactively engaging in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations towards widening market access and diversifying the export basket. 



	Fiscal deficit (excluding grants) in FY18 is expected to remain at around 5.0 per cent. Budget financing is to be mainly done through National Savings Certificates (NSCs) and from bank and non-NSC sources. Gross investment as per cent of GDP has risen in FY17 to 30.5 per cent from 29.7 per cent in FY16.While donor support will continue to be essential in meeting additional spending pressures from the Rohingya crisis, the deferral of value added tax (VAT) is not likely to pose any major concern if the strong revenue growth momentum of FY17 continues and expenditures are kept in check. The government's reform initiatives to improve the business climate and ease infrastructure bottlenecks, including developing special economic zones (SEZs), should help crowd in both private domestic and foreign direct investments (FDI) that can create more jobs, raise productivity, and potential growth. 

	
		BHUTAN 
	
	
	Bhutan’s economic growth continued to accelerate in 2016 at 8per cent, in line with the performance of the preceding three years where growth averaged a little over 6 per cent. The high growth continued to be driven by secondary and tertiary sectors. The medium-term outlook is also promising, with the commissioning of new hydropower projects expected to provide further impetus to output and exports, as well as to fiscal revenues. 
	CPI inflation has grown significantly in FY 2016-17 following the price movements in India and the global markets. The overall CPI inflation rose to 5.5per cent in Q2, 2017 from 3.3 per cent during the same quarter in the previous year. Higher inflation was an outcome of both, an increase in domestic demand and temporary issues in the supply chain which led to higher food inflation. 



	Despitethe government’s efforts to pursue sustainable fiscal path over the medium- term through expenditure rationalization and revenue enhancement measures, the revised budget for FY 2016-17 resulted in an overall fiscal deficit of Nu.6.49 billion (4.1per cent of GDP) compared to Nu.1.56 billion in FY 2015-16. However, by the end of 12thfive year plan (FYP, 2022-23) the fiscal deficit is projected to be in a surplus at 7.0per cent of GDP. The improvement is mainly attributed to the commissioning of Mangdechhu, Punatsangchhu I & II hydropower projects in the medium-term. 



	On the external front, the trade deficit improved from 28.4per cent of GDP to 20.9 per cent during FY 2016-17, resulting in a lower CAD of 24.4 per cent of GDP. The deficit is a result of the imports for the construction of hydropower projects. It is expected to decline after 2018-19 with the commissioning of 4 new power plants and the resultant export of power. In the longer run, the current account balance is likely to return to a surplus. Foreign currency reserves also remain at a comfortable level and sufficient to finance 12.5 months of merchandise imports. 



	Credit to private sector growth recorded at 15.4 per cent in June 2017 with a slight increase from 14.7 per cent in June 2016. The growth in credit was mainly contributed by the access to credit transmitted through financial inclusion initiatives. 



	
	
		INDIA 
	
	


16.The Indian economy turned in resilient performance in 2017-18 (April - March). Although real GDP growth moderated to 6.6 per cent from 7.1 per cent a year ago, there was a strong rebound in the second half of the year on the back of a turnaround in investment demand, supported by an acceleration in manufacturing, rising sales growth, a pick-up in capacity utilisation, strong activity in the services sector and a record agricultural harvest. 

17.Several factors are expected to accelerate the pace of growth in 2018-19. There are now clearer signs that the revival in investment activity will be sustained. Global demand has been improving, which should encourage exports and boost fresh investments. On the whole, real GDP growth is expected to expand at 7.4 per cent in 2018-19, with risks evenly balanced. 

18.Since November 2016, headline consumer price inflation has remained below the medium-term target of 4 per cent. An unusual spike in vegetables prices pushed up inflation to a recent peak of 5.2 per cent in December, but it eased in subsequent months to reach 4.4 per cent in February. Several factors are likely to influence the inflation outlook, including a possible moderation in food prices if the monsoon turns out to be normal and is supported by effective food supply management. Countervailing this, upside risks emanate from the distinct hardening bias in crude oil prices, the steady firming up of inflation ex food and fuel mirroring pick up in domestic demand, and spillovers from financial volatility as markets re-price the path of monetary policy normalisation by systemic central banks. Noting that risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, the monetary policy rate was kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent in April 2018 with a neutral stance. 

19.The government is committed to fiscal prudence. Helped by buoyancy in tax revenues and rationalisation of subsidies, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) of the central government has been steadily brought down since 2013-14 to 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2017-18 without compromising on public investment requirements and social sector spending. The GFD is budgeted lower at 3.3 per cent in 2018-19. The government has accepted a debt rule that will bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio to 40 per cent over a period of time by 2024-25. The goods and services tax (GST), which was implemented from July 2017 has reformed the system of indirect taxes by simplifying payments and credits, and improving the efficiency of movement of goods across the country. Automation of tax payments and ‘team based assessment with dynamic jurisdiction’ without direct interface with tax payers has improved overall efficiency and transparency of revenue administration. 

20.Driven by the pace of import growth relative to that of exports, the current account deficit (CAD) expanded from 0.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 1.7 per cent the first nine months of 2017-18. External financing conditions remain comfortable, boosted mainly by robust inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). The UNCTAD’s survey of multinational enterprises ranked India as the third most favoured destination for FDI for 2017-19. Reflecting these developments, India’s foreign exchange reserves at US$ 424 billion were equivalent of 11 months of imports. 

21.Meanwhile, India has persevered with structural reforms over a wide area ranging from a flexible inflation targeting framework for monetary policy; liberalization of FDI flows; a unique identification (Aadhaar) – backed direct benefit transfers; an insolvency and bankruptcy code; the GST; realty reforms; and a swathe of measures for improvement in the ease of doing business more generally. These factors have improved India’s global ranking in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business.

21Growth of the Sri Lankan economy moderated further in 2017, recording an annual growth of 3.1 per cent in 2017 compared to 4.3 per cent annual growth in 2016. Growth in all the three sectors, namely agriculture, industry and services remained moderate. The recovery in the agriculture sector, which was affected by adverse weather conditions was visible towards the last quarter of the year. Growth in the industry sector was supported by the expansion in manufacturing, construction and mining and quarrying activities. The services sector growth was driven by financial services, wholesale and retail trade and other personal services activities. The economy is expected to grow by around 5.0 per cent in 2018 with the realization of foreign investment flows, improved domestic investment climate and continued recovery in key global markets for Sri Lankan exports. With ongoing structural reforms, Sri Lanka’s economy is expected to move to a higher growth path in the medium-term. 

22.Consumer price inflation, which accelerated during 2017 due to domestic supply side disruptions, rising international commodity prices and tax adjustments, moderated towards the desired mid-single digit levels in Q1 of 2017. Headline inflation as measured by the change in National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), which peaked at 8.8 per cent in October 2017, decelerated to 3.2 per cent by February 2018. Core inflation remained at the subdued level of 2.0 per cent by February 2018. The Central Bank maintained a tight monetary policy from end 2015 to maintain macroeconomic stability and to contain the build-up of adverse price pressures and wage inflation expectations. Accordingly, the Central Bank tightened the monetary policy by raising the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) by 1.5 percentage points to 7.5 per cent and raised policy interest rates by 100 basis points during 2016 and a further 25 basis points in 2017. Along with complementary macro prudential policies and tax adjustments, the growth of credit to the private sector as well as overall monetary expansion moderated to the desired levels by the end 2017. The tax revenue collection of the government improved in 2017 although there was some moderation in non-tax revenue. In spite of government’s efforts, budget deficit expanded to around 5.5 per cent GDP in 2017, mainly as a result naturaldisasterrelated expenditure. The ongoing 3-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of US$ 1.5 billion with the IMF continued, and this program is expected to strengthen the performance of the external and fiscal sectors of the economy, in particular. 

23.Sri Lanka’s external sector performance was mixed in 2017. Although earnings from exports grew at double digit rates with the reinstatement of the EU GSP+ facility, imports also increased mainly as a result of increased drought related imports as well as increased gold imports. Increased tourist arrivals as well as other services sector inflows supported the current account although there was a marginal moderation in workers’ remittances. Higher inflows in terms of FDI were observed while inflows to the government were also considerable. Both the rupee denominated government securities market and the Colombo stock market recorded positive net inflows. These developments resulted in an overall surplus in the balance of payments in 2017, and the Central Bank built up official foreign reserves to US$ 8.0 billion by end 2017 from US$ 6.0 billion recorded at end 2016. The Sri Lanka rupee depreciated against the US$ by 2.0 per cent against the US$ during 2017. 

24.Meanwhile the banking sector remained stable with improved soundness indicators, while firm action was taken to resolve issues with regard to some institutions in the non-bank financial sector. The financial sector resilience is expected to improve further with the ongoing transition to IFRS 9 and Basel III regulatory requirements.

                Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of      Finance, Govt. of India said that countries in India’s constituency in the World Bank – Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka – now are the highest growing block in South Asia and the World at large.  Shri Garg said that it will cross 3 trillion GDP this year. It attracts close to 100 billion dollars of FDI and Portfolio Investment and will grow around 7.5% this year. However, it has widespread poverty and faces enormous developmental challenges. Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) was addressing the 97th Meeting of the Development Committee Plenary in Washington D.C. yesterday. The items on the Agenda included Sustaining Financing for Sustainable Development; A Report to Governors on Shareholding at the Spring Meetings 2018; Progress Report on Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management in the World Bank Group Operations; Forward Look Implementation Update; and Update to Governors on Gender Diversity in the Executive Board of the World Bank Group.

 Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) further said that while the World Bank Group - IBRD, IFC, IDA, MIGA – has supported the growth and development of this constituency, it will need to continue in the foreseeable future. This is the reason capital increase has been a matter of critical interest for India. He expressed happiness that there is now an Agreement on the capital increase package and that it is reasonably large – a 13 billion capital increase in IBRD and IFC together, which from the historical context, is a truly unprecedented expansion of capital. Shri Garg expressed India’s support for the shareholding review, including development of dynamic formula and the capital package.  He congratulated the President and top management of WB Group for making it a reality. He expressed hope that increased lending for middle income countries will start flowing soon and single borrower limits revised upwards quickly. Shri Garg also highlighted that the current capital increase package was due in 2015 and that this has been delivered only in 2018.  The next capital review, as agreed, is due in 2020.  He expressed hope and urged the management to start preparation for the same well in time to deliver it on time. He suggested that next year (2019) will be the right time to start working on it. At the end, Shri Garg urged the Bank to become more efficient in its capital management. This would call for having a fresh look soon on IBRD transfers to IDA and efficient deployment of buffer being created now.

 Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs also attended the Restricted Breakfast and Plenary Sessions of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) of the IMF in Washington D.C. yesterday.

The Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Shri Subhash Chandra Garg is currently on an official tour to Washington D.C. to attend the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank and other associated meetings. He is accompanied by Mr. Urjit Patel, Governor, RBI and other senior officials.

                Following is the text of the Statement by Mr Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Govt. of India and Alternate Governor of the World Bank and the IMF, representing the Constituency of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India & Sri Lanka at the 97th Meeting of the Development Committee, World Bank in Washington DC, USA yesterday, 21st April, 2018:

 

1. “Global economic recovery and growth in the last year has been reasonably reassuring. Supported by macroeconomic policy accommodations, trade is now growing faster than global GDP.Global investment rate has also risen. Emerging marketand frontier countries’ growth is poised to be quite widespread in 2018 with improved performance also in the United States, Canada and Europe.

2. The member countries in our constituency continue to grow; spurred by active efforts of the governments to promote investment and undertake structural reforms for private sector growth and integration with the world economy. The regional growth momentum is backed by robust domestic demand, strong FDI inflows, infrastructure spending, and supportive macroeconomic policies. India is poised to remain as the fastest growing large economy in the world. In 2018, we expect India to grow at over 7.4%, Bangladesh at 7.2%, Sri Lanka at about 4.6 % and Bhutan at 7.5%.

3. Our constituency members continue to make notable progress and set an example for other EMDCs. ThusBangladesh has made significantprogress in reducing poverty. Over 20 million people have been lifted out of poverty in last two decades with poverty rate declining below 24%. It has also made rapid progress in human development. Its Infant Mortality Rate (34 per 1,000 live births) and Maternal Mortality Rate (176 per 100,000 live births) are much improved and better than the global averages. Bangladesh's progress towards LMIC category and its eventual transition to 'gap' and 'blend' status under World Bank group are testimony of the massive developmental efforts of the Government.

4. Sri Lanka shines through its momentous progress in human development with its social indicators ranking among the highest in South Asia. The Government launched its Vision 2025 recently which envisions Sri Lanka as a hub of Indian Ocean by transforming it into a knowledge based, highly competitive social market economy. With the Government’s strong focus on fiscal reforms, physical infrastructure, industrial competitiveness and sound financial management, Sri Lankan economy is expected to achieve GDP growth exceeding4.5% in the medium-term.

5. Bhutan has been successful in ensuring inclusive growth with extreme poverty being almost eradicated. Bhutan has also maintained solid growth through focus on hydropower construction and supportive fiscal and monetary policies. Its macroeconomic stability isevident in terms of single-digit inflation, stable exchange rate, and strong international reserves. Bhutan remains one of fastest growing global economies with annual average growth in last decade reaching 7.5%.

6. India continues to be a beacon of growth in the region. Inthe last few years, India has undertaken massive structuralreforms towards formalization of the economy and fostering digital financial inclusion. The country has grown at an average of 7.2% per annum in the last four years and is continuing on the trajectory of sustained growth. India's GDP is expected to reach a volume of $5 trillion by FY2025 by leveraging on digitization, globalization, favorable demographics, and structural reforms. Transformational reforms such as Goods and Services Tax (GST), and initiatives such as Insolvency and Bankruptcy code, recapitalization of banks, and debottlenecking infrastructure investments, will support such elevated growth.

7. India has accorded great priority to addressing its infrastructure deficit to sustain economicgrowth. Steps have been taken to mobilize funds from various sources for development of infrastructure which inter-alia includes launching of innovative financial vehicles such as Infrastructure Debt Funds, Infrastructure Investment Trusts, Real Estate Investment Trusts, laying down a framework for issuance of municipal bonds, relaxation in External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) norms, mainstreaming of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) across infrastructure sectors, establishment of National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and monetization of brownfield projects through Toll-Operate-Transfer(TOT) model etc. India has begun undertaking a major programme of monetizing Brownfield Assets of Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs)as a separate asset class for infrastructure investments.

8. In the field of digitization, India has completed the ambitious task of connecting one hundred thousand gram panchayats through high speed optical fiber network under phase I of the BharatNet project. This has enabled broadband access to over 200 million rural Indians in about two hundred and fifty thousand villages. The Government also proposes to setup five hundred thousand wi-fi hotspots which will provide broadband access to fifty million rural citizens. Further, digitization has been extended to other areas. Around 470 Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs)have been connected to the electronic-National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) network providing a unified national market for agricultural commodities.

9. One of the key features of India’s economic performance in recent years has been the speed and scale of implementation. Recent upgrade of the sovereign rating reflects India’s strength, speed and scale of these ongoing reforms. India rolled out the GST in July 2017, unifying 1.3 billion people into one market. Within a short span of eight months, the monthly earnings from GST have crossed the $12.7 billion mark. Number of dealers registered in GST increased by about 4 million in the fiscal year of rollout which is about 60% higher than unique assesses registered earlier in the VAT network in the country.

10. India’s massive leap in the Ease of Doing Business rankings from 142 in 2014 to 100 in 2017is testimony to India’s commitment to long-term reforms for an open and vibrant economy. This is also reflected in strong FDI inflows which have grown from $34.3 billion in 2012-13 to $60.1 billion in 2016-17.

11. In the arena of financial inclusion, the Jan-DhanYojana, launched in August, 2014, has rapidly expanded banking services for the hitherto deprived sections. Till date, over313 million bank accounts have been opened and savings of about $11.510 billion has been mobilized under the scheme. For providing access to financial facilities by small businesses, India rapidly rolled out the Mudra Yojana in April 2015 and has supported over 115 million small businesses by sanctioning loans of $77.66 billion so far.

12. India is pursuing a path of clean and climate responsible growth. It aims to achieve about 40 percent cumulative installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance.

13. Further, in the social sector, India has initiated several ambitious programmes. India is committed towards ensuring affordable housing for all. For this purpose, Prime Minister AwasYojana has been launched in rural and urban areas of the country. Under this programme, 5.1 million houses each will be constructed in 2017-18 and in 2018-19 exclusively in rural areas. In urban areas, the assistance has been sanctioned to construct 3.7 million Houses. In the recent budget announcement, India has proposed to establish a dedicated Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) in National Housing Bank, funded from priority sector lending shortfall and fully serviced bonds authorized by the Government of India.

14. India has launched Prime Minister SaubhagyaYojana for providing electricity to all households of the country. Under sanitation, we have launched theSwachh Bharat Mission, under which more than 60 million toilets have been constructed. For healthcare, the Indian cabinet has recently approved the National Health Protection Mission, which aims to provide healthcare to more than 100 million families belonging to poor and vulnerablepopulation.India is also committed to double farmers’ income by 2022 as part of India’s firm resolve towards inclusive growth.

15. India’s commitment towards gender equality and education under ‘‘BetiBachaoBetiPadhao’’ is unflinching. SukanyaSamriddhi Account Scheme launched in January 2015 has been a great success. Until November, 2017 more than 12.6 million accounts have been opened across the country in the name of girl-child.

16. Further, India is committed to making education accessible for all. To realize this mission, it has been decided that by the year 2022, every block with more than 50% Scheduled Tribe (ST) population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an Ekalavya Model Residential School, which will have special facilities for preserving local art and culture besides providing training in sports and skill development.

17. I now turn to developments in the World Bank Group.

18. Capital Package for IBRD and IFC: India has been at the forefront ofdesigning and completing the shareholding review of 2015 and also of building consensus for the voice reforms in the World Bank Group.Building on the work done and momentum built, we had collectively decided in the Annual Meetings 2017 that a well-considered proposal on capital increase for the World Bank Group be placed before the Governors in the Spring meeting 2018 for a decision. We are pleased to note that the Board of Directors has pursued this agenda assiduously and we have before us a capital review proposal for consideration.

19. The World Bank Group has been the global leader in efforts to eliminate poverty and to bring about shared prosperity and sustainable development. With a capital infusion of $19 billion by shareholders over the last 70 odd years, the World Bank Group has made investments of over $900 billion in attacking extreme poverty, building infrastructure, improving access and quality in delivery of basic services, combating climate change, and supporting poor countries in macro-economic crisis, natural disasters, pandemics, conflict and climate change. This ability to leverage funds on a global scale is largely dependent on the continued AAA rating enjoyed by the Bank supported by the Preferred Creditor Status accorded to the Bank by client countries. It is therefore, our responsibility to ensure that this institution is adequately resourced to carry on the developmental work with renewed vigor for achieving SDG 2030.

20. We support the proposed joint package of $13 billion paid in capital for IBRD and IFC. This 2X2 recapitalization package represents by & large a balanced and consensual approach to align interests of all stakeholders, with the institutional objectives.Ideally, we would have liked IBRD to stoptransfers from its incometo IDA and avoid any increasein loan pricing. The package arrived at after much deliberations, blends the additional Capital infusion with higher loan pricesand the increased administrative savings from improved budget efficiencies. Hence, we support this package in the spirit of consensus and conciliation for enabling the Bank group to implement its mission effectively.

21. We must, however, state thatas the financing deficit of developing nations has crossed $ 4 trillion per year, this package is still less ambitious, especially for IBRD. Since 2015 –16, we have argued for a minimum $40 billion of annual IBRD lending to effectively support the 2030 Agenda. The background paper for last Annual Meeting spelt out an ambition of $130 billion for the WBG. We are now looking at a further lowered ambition of only $100 billion (nominal terms). We feel that the entire objective of a capital increase exercise should have led to a much higher ambition.

22. The limited lending volume along with competing demands has made resource allocation among different sections of the developing world a critical element of the proposed package. While remaining strongly committed to Bank’s policy to remain engaged with all clients, we appreciate the gradual trend in resource allocation towards the poorer countries. However, the diluted ambition for IBRD limits the funds available for development financing and may have the possible undesirable result of underfinancing of poorer MICs, as assessed against the massive SDG funding requirement in these countries. Hence, we urge that the WBG’s focus on the agenda of poverty reduction, human capital formation and bridginginfrastructure gaps in lower MICs must be pursued vigorously. At the same time, we appreciate the specific challenges of inequality and economic vulnerability faced by many of the UMICs and suggest that the Bank group devise specific innovative products that can efficiently address these in a focused and cost-effective manner.

23. We have taken note of the elements introduced in the proposal for ensuring the sustainability of lending by the Bank. In our judgment, setting aside of capital for a buffer is not very efficient use of paid in capital.We need to explore better options for meeting the requirement of cyclical and systemic crisis lending.We should,therefore,ensure that such buffer is designed in such a way that lending volumes available to poorer countries are enhancedduring normal years. In the days to come, we expect that the design of the buffer will be prudently framed using all options including the three levers of budget efficiency, deferral of income transfers and loan pricing in a balanced manner.

24. The Bank has built a sizable equity from the retained earnings funded largely by the loan pricing income from borrower countries. The loan pricing of IBRD has been increased thrice in the last decade. As against $7.5 billion paid in capital from all share holder members, borrower countries will be bringing about $ 19 billion in loan price income to the Bank in the period 2018-30. The effectiveness of the Bank as a global leader in development agenda arises to a large part from its ability for cost effective financial intermediation.For funding development at low interest rates, leveraging its AAA rating is fundamental raison d'êtreof IBRD’s existence. We had opposed any general price increase as IBRD loans are already very costly. However, to increase lending capacity, we are agreeing to the increase in maturity premium.The provision of some relief to poorer countries through discount and temporary exemption to blends, small states, FCS countries and recent IDA graduates will ameliorate the harshness of another loan price increase in the IBRD.

25. The package may have missed the opportunityfor increasing the share of retained earnings for building the equity base of the Bank Group, since it does not eliminate the transfer of income from IBRD and IFC to IDA. While we recognize the absolute necessity and utility of IDA for financing development in poor countries, we must note that IDA now has built massive equity base of $ 160 billion and its Deployable Strategic Capital stands at 37%. In contrast, the policy ratios and AAA ratings of IBRD and IFC – which have supported IDA - are under real threat. While the transfers comprise a relatively small proportion of IDA funding, they constitute a significant erosion of income of IBRD and IFC. Hence, we have consistently advocated complete cessation of income transfers to IDA. We note with appreciationthe suspension of IDA transfers from IFC income, along with the attendant conditionality of IFC reaching the goal of 40% of its investments in IDA and FCS countries by FY 2030. We would like the Bank managementto explorealternatives to strengthen IDA and to cease dependence of IDA on income transfers from IBRD.

26. On the Compensation methodology review proposals contained in the Package, we welcome the proposed changes in Structure Adjustment component of salary increase which is now capped and aligned to inflation. This is a correct and transparent way to determine annual increase. But, we are still opposedto using savings from salary erosion due to Staff turnover for funding thenewly proposed merit element to replace earlier Salary Progressive Adjustment and Supplementary Merit Increase. We recognize such savings need to accrue to the organization.

27. We welcome World Bank Group’s commitment and accelerated action on the global agendas of Climate Change, Gender and Disaster Risk Management. We believe that climate change poses real threats to development and there is need for balanced mitigation and adaptation action globally, including by the Bank Group, in the spirit of Paris Agreement. We continue to support WBG’s Climate Change informed Development Agendawhich needs to be client driven. Under its Nationally Determined Contributions, India has ambitiously committed to reducing the emissions intensity of GDP by 33%-35% by 2030 relative to its 2005 levels. There is lot of visible action in terms of Renewable Energy generation and positive outcomes in energy efficiency. We are also committed to cooperationin harnessing solar energy and helping other developing countries through the International Solar Alliance..

28. We are fully supportive of the World Bank Group’s FY16-23 Gender Strategy. The Bank has significantly upped the quality, scope and depth of its analytical work on gender equality. Lower women participation in the labour force is a major challengebefore us. We are committed to work on overcoming attitudinal challenges relating to the status, role and empowerment of women in the society at all levels.

29. Progress Report of the Shareholding Review: We have taken note of the Progress Report on the Shareholding Review as part of the Lima Roadmap. In our view, increasing weight of the Developing and Transition Countries (DTC) in the ownership and management of these institutions is quite necessary. We support selective capital increase (SCI) to bring about voice reform to ensure higher representation to the under-represented and support the use of the dynamic formula which would guide us in rebalancing the voice in line with economic weight and IDA contributions.

30.We would have liked to see a stronger and bigger Bank with a larger SCI for IBRD, but have agreed to SCI of 250,000 shares in the spirit of cooperation. On the same lines, we had felt that the use of unallocated shares for adjustment for all under represented shareholders, would have been a fairer method.

31. We find that the Shareholding Report now before the Governors that will enable the increase of the vote share of DTCs in IBRDfrom 46.9% to 47.4%. We would like to underline that this increase has come entirely as a result of dynamic formula and shareholdingrules application and membersdid not have to apply additional level to supporthigher share of DTCs. We are quite confident that in next shareholding review, DTCs share would rise to 50%.

32. IFC has not had a meaningful capital increase since 1992. Even in the last Capital Package during 2010-12, IFC got only $0.2 billion paid in capital compared to $5.1 billion for IBRD. We support the proposal to strengthen IFC to give impetus to the development of private sector for achieving SDGs, building infrastructure and climate resilience. We therefore strongly support the proposal for paid-in capital of $ 4.6 billion by GCI, and $ 920 million by SCI, agreeing to the proposal to align IFC shareholding with that of IBRD as an expedient interim measure. For achieving a stronger IFC ambition, we will also support expeditious work on possible alternatives to callable capital, including risk sharing facility. Such facility will help IFC reach in IDA and FCS countries effectively and efficiently and also ensure financial sustainability of IFC.

33. Although IFC works on a largely commercial basis, with no sovereign guarantees to back its investments, several policy commitments have been proposed in the package relating to investment in IDA and FCS markets and in climate related financing. We hope that IFC will rise to the challenge of delivering on market creation and development impact through its investments within this commitment framework. In this context we would urge IBRD and MIGA to provide effective partnership to IFC in the form of policy support and guarantees support respectively. Working as a coordinated World Bank Group would unlock the value of investments in developing countries in a sustainable and transformative sense.

34. Progress Report on Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management in WB operations: Natural disasters can impose significant economic losses and costs on the affected countries in terms of rehabilitation and reconstruction. Today, natural disasters cost cities approximately $250 billion and this is estimated to rise to $314 billion per year by 2030. In this regard, we appreciate the leadership role played by the World Bank Group in supporting investments in early warning systems to develop capacity for monitoring and forecasting. Mainstreaming of disaster risk management in World Bank Group operations, leading to incorporation of disaster and climate risks in country strategies and facilitating the creation of resilient infrastructure through innovative financing tools, is a welcome step. However, these measures should take into account borrower’s implementation capacity and not price out WB loans for some borrowers on account of their higher implementation costs.

35. India believes in a holistic approach to disaster risk management as detailed in the Prime Minister’s Ten-point Agenda for disaster risk reduction. We support greater emphasis on cross-country learning in this area, especially in hazard risk assessment, disaster resilient technologies and mechanism for integrating risk reduction in infrastructure financing.India hopes to work with WBG in establishing a coalition of countries for Disaster Risk Resilience which would also address Climate Change related disasters.

36. Update in the Forward Look: The global developmental vision, embodied in theForward Look, calls on the World Bank Group to serve all clients, maximize finance for development through private sector, lead on global issues, and improve its business model.We affirm support for the Forward Look Approach of serving all clients.The World Bank Group will need to stay engaged with all client groups, so as to fulfill the primary objective to end global extreme poverty by 2030. Of the 767 million people still in extreme poverty, over 50% are in LMICs, many of which are recent IDA graduates. We would like the World Bank to focus on the challenges and to clearly articulatethe measures for focusing on poverty alleviation and creation of shared prosperity in the LMICs.

37. We are supportive of thestrategic work being done by the World Bank Group for Maximizing Finance for Development. This would potentially restrict the diversion of public funding to sectors and projects that are amenable to private sector financing.While the management is implementing the Cascade Approachthrough IFC and MIGA, we believe that developmental financing operations of IBRD and IDAparticularly in sectors such as education, primary heath, sanitation, are not always amenable to commercial ventures, nor may such an option be desirable without appropriate and robust regulatory framework being put in place. Hence IBRD and IDA’s development operations for supporting human capital, inclusion, resilience and governance must be promoted and enhanced through sovereign financing, even as we make efforts mobilize private capital for the areas of development, offering more immediate returns on investment.

38. We support the ongoing efforts to focus on efficiency and productivity in the business model of the World Bank Group. We welcome measures in this direction, with respect toworkforce growth, corporate procurement, administrative simplification and real estate.The World Bank’s reach and responsiveness to clients in developing countries will have to be measured through improvements in process efficiency, strong knowledge focus, and proactive coordination. This will help us build synergies between the World Bank’s efforts and national initiatives.

39. Gender Diversity Update: It is now universally recognized that greatergender parity has enormous economic and developmental benefits. As the world’s largest democracy, India has constitutionally mandated political representation for women by reserving 33% of seats in local self-governments for them. SomeStates in India have increased thisreservation for women in the local bodies to 50% for stronger empowerment.

40. It is heartening to note that currently, gender diversity of the World Bank Group Board of Executive Directors is better than the average for the last ten years and is, in fact, thehighest for the positions of Senior Advisors and Advisors. We may also mention with pride that the first woman Executive Director was appointed recently for the Constituency of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka. We recognize that much needs to be done to reduce gender gap in every field and we support the Bank’s movement towards this end. We hope that the next steps proposed for enhancing gender diversity on the Board will form the basis of a shared and collective responsibility of shareholder members.

41. Way forward: We have developed the global multilateral compact over the years to deliver growth, shared prosperity and poverty reduction. The attempt to change the discourse and to focus on increased protectionism will only hurt the global economy and welfare of people. We need to renew our compact to prevent spiral down of slow economic growth, rising inequality and irreversible climate impact, conflict and fragility.

42. Without adequate capital and the cooperation and magnanimity of all shareholders, the World Bank Group runs the risk of becoming peripheral to the global challenges and development agenda.As a global cooperative, we must be committed to the inclusive prosperity of our future generations.Hence, I urge all Governors to commit to more ambitious proposals on the financial strengthening and policy commitments of the IBRD and IFC”.

                Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, Government of India led the Indian Delegation to the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) Meeting held in Washington D.C. on 19th and 20th April 2018. The Main Agenda of the Meeting was to discuss prospects and vulnerabilities of global economy, harnessing future of work for inclusive growth and take stock of progress made under G20 Compact with Africa Initiative. 

In his address, Secretary (EA), Shri Garg highlighted that the digital age technologies have profound implications for policies concerning every aspects of the economy. It also has enormous implications for emerging markets and developing countries. He expressed that the response to such a transformation will have to shift from ‘catch up’ growth to adoption/adaption of digital technologies for development and growth.  Secretary (EA) informed that India has started adopting policies and programmes for transforming systems of delivery of services using digital technologies and connecting every Indian with digital technologies and access through Adhaar and other such means. While citing the example of expanding Mobile Data Access, he mentioned that India is now the largest consumer of mobile data in the world with 11 gigabytes mobile data consumption per month. He informed that India is investing in digital technologies, encouraging private sector to adapt these technologies and also addressing the taxation related issues by introducing equalisation levy. 

The Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Shri Garg also participated in the Development Committee Ministerial Lunch Session focused on Rising Public Debt Vulnerabilities in Low-Income Developing Countries. He stressed that in addressing the Sustainable Development Goals, the increasing debt burden in LIDCs is, clearly, a massive hindrance. LIDCs face challenges centered on equitable growth, resilience, finance and partnerships, and leveraging external public and private finance. To mitigate the growing debt concerns of LIDCs, he strongly urged that the IMF and World Bank, and other international organizations must develop and articulate a clear strategy for enhancing public debt transparency on both the debtor and creditor side. The scope of strengthening bilateral and regional financing agreements was also stated by him as important. 

The Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Shri Garg is currently on an official tour to Washington D.C. to attend the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank and other associated meetings. He is accompanied by Mr. Urjit Patel, Governor, RBI and other senior officials.​

                On the basis of inputs provided by Andhra Pradesh (AP) State intelligence Department, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Hyderabad developed intelligence indicating that diesel is being smuggled into India in guise of mineral spirit by certain operators based at Kakinada and Chennai.The said diesel is being brought from Dubai in huge quantities on regular basis through containers at Chennai Port for further illegal sale in State of Tamilnadu, AP and Telangana. 

Accordingly, simultaneous search operation was carried-out by the officers of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Hyderabad and Chennai with the active support of Andhra Pradesh State intelligence at various places across Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu from 17th April 2018 onwards. 

Searches conducted at two Container Freight Stations in Chennai revealed that 14 containers imported at Chennai Port in the name of M/s SAF Petroleum and M/s Aditya Marine landed at Sanco CFS, Chennai and Gateway CFS, Chennai, where the goods were declared as Mineral Spirit. These containers were found to be actually carrying 263.78 MT (3 Lakh litres aprox.) of diesel. On being questioned, this was admitted by the operators and was also confirmed during chemical examination. Simultaneous searches were conducted across Kakinada and Chennai covering 12 places belonging to Operators/Importers, Clearing agents, transportation broker, supervisor, hawala operators etc.

Diesel is a restricted commodity for import as per the Foreign Trade Policy and allowed to be imported only by IOC and other oil marketing companies which meet the requirement of Ministry of Petroleum Resolution No. P-23015/1/2001-Mkt and not allowed to be imported by others. To circumvent the said restriction, the operators of diesel smuggling based at Kakinada hatched a plan and started smuggling ‘Diesel’ in guise of ‘Mineral spirit’. They not only imported the said restricted item but also declared much lower value, around 40% of the actual value, thereby evading customs duty on the said consignments. The opeartors had offices in Kakinada, storage yard at Maraimalai Nagar, Chennai and an office front at Guindy, Chennai to facilitate said smuggling and distribution. A relative of one of the operator from Kakinada was looking after the logistics, moving the diesel into the grey markets in Chennai, Kakinada, Ongole and parts of Telangana. Dummy companies were opened in Dubai to purchase diesel and import the same to Chennai by creating false documents and invoices. The price difference was being adjusted by payments through hawala channels. It is found that in the past these operators have smuggled around 5366 MT (63 lakh litres approx) of diesel valued at around Rs.17.7 crores, which comes to around 285 containers.

As the diesel has been smuggled into India in contravention of provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 and Foreign Trade Policy, 2015-20, the 14 containers of diesel having value of over Rs. 1 crore have been seized under Customs Act, 1962. 4 persons, including the mastermind and one hawala operator have been arrested under Customs Act 1962.  Further investigation is in progress.

                Two day Regional Conference on “Urban Development: Technological Solutions and Governance Challenges” concluded in Ahmedabad, Gujarat today. The Conference was organized by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India in collaboration with the Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), Gujarat Council along with Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS), an autonomous research organization under the Ministry of External Affairs. The Conference was the third lead-up event to the 3rd Annual Meeting of AIIB scheduled to be held on 25th and 26th June, 2018 in Mumbai. Before this Conference, two Regional Conferences have already been held at Kolkata and Vishakhapatnam on the themes of Mass Rapid Transport Systems and Port and Coastal Infrastructure respectively. In total, eight such Regional Conferences will be held on different themes at different places in the country. 

Delivering the Valedictory Address at the conclusion of the aforesaid  two day Conference, Dr.Y.K. Alagh, Former Union Minister of Power, Science and Technology and Chancellor, Central University of Gujarat emphasized that the policy makers must follow bottom-up approach rather than top down approach in case of urban development. He said though there is need for funding the infrastructure financing gap yet smaller towns should also be included as far as planning and development of urban infrastructure is concerned. He said that the views and suggestions of affected people, civil society and other stakeholders must be included in the process of urban planning to make it successful.


The panellists/participants in different Sessions of aforesaid two day Conference included officials from the Centre, State and the local bodies as well as representatives from the civil society, academia and multilateral financial institutions among others.

They cited several examples on what's working and what's not, and gave their expert opinion and suggestions.


Deliberations focussed on four broad categories including Institutional Issues, Resource Mobilization Strategies, Recommendations for Multilateral Financial Institutions, and Suggestions for Policy Reforms.

A detailed report will be prepared and presented during the 3rd AIIB Annual Meeting in Mumbai in the last week of June, 2018. 

Most speakers referred to the infrastructure financing gap in Asia in general and India in particular. 

It was highlighted that among all the infrastructure sectors, the biggest financing gap is faced by Urban Infrastructure.

On institutional issues including those relating to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), it was pointed-out that currently urban development is happening in a haphazard manner due to horizontal spread of urban areas, resulting in inefficiencies and affecting productivity. 

Therefore it was proposed that there is a need to shift to vertical development to improve service delivery and revenues, as well as greater efficiency and productivity. However, concerns on higher energy consumption and lack of dependable electricity need to be addressed.

While the Central Government has initiated holistic urban development programs including Smart Cities, Housing for All and AMRUT etc, however, these are needed to be expedited.

It was emphasized that the New Urban Planning Agenda should incorporate elements from the UN Sustainable Development Goals and take into account the Paris Agreement on Climate Change as well. 

It was pointed-out that while big municipal corporations are better administered and efficient, small municipal corporations are inefficient due to lack of capacity in recovering taxes and user charges. Therefore, the post of a Regional Municipality Commissioners who can oversee and monitor performance of several municipalities, have been created in Gujarat recently.

Aspirational Districts/cities could catch-up with progressive cities if there are dynamic ranking mechanisms promoting competitive federalism. In this regard, there was an emphasis on pushing a Liveability Index and Sustainability Index.

Urban development needs to include social infrastructure apart from physical infrastructure. There was also a need to adopt new technologies including addressing issues of waste management among others.

Referring to the challenges in urban development, the speakers said these also relate to lack of inter-sectoral coordination due to various levels of governance with fragmented autonomy. There is a need to integrate planning and implementation agencies. There is also need to reactivate and strengthen the District Planning Committees for better coordination among urban development agencies including ULBs and other public delivery agencies at the District level. Laws relating to urban local bodies need to be amended in order to strengthen and empower them. 

Further, it was also pointed-out that technological solutions alone would not solve Governance Challenges, and that there was a need for political solutions as well.



Moving on to strategies for resource mobilization, it was mentioned that there is a huge untapped potential in Public Private Partnerships(PPPs), and that PPPs could be used effectively in areas including water treatment, solid waste management, multi-level parking and urban transport.


Other suggestions included leveraging land-based instruments, reforms in Credit Rating Mechanism, greater clarity on municipal assets as collateral, as well as the need for improving efficiency in property tax collection mechanism.


Many speakers suggested that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Real Estate Sector will increase only if there are national standards, transparency in land acquisition and land valuation among others. 

There is a need for a paradigm shift in how cities are financed. So, from largely grant funded cities, there needs to be a shift in approach to a combination of assured grants and more commercial sources of finance, and this means bringing in private players in urban infrastructure space. A major deterrent for entry of private firms in the urban sector is the commercial non-viability of many of the projects. It was recommended that there is a need to develop model transaction documents across the urban infrastructure sector. There was a also a suggestion to explore the feasibility of risk insurance to help increase private sector participation.


Besides, they suggested that urban local bodies should look into innovative resource mobilizing mechanism including issuance of municipal bonds, land pooling and land value capture. There is a need to standardize the use of land value capture finance tools so that they are used more extensively. It was also suggested that there should be a larger dialogue on the implications of debt based instruments on equity.

It was mooted that Multilateral Financial Institutions, while funding, should bring greater focus on sustainability of project through ensuring the 3Rs approach -- (Reduce, Recycle, & Reuse). Multilateral Financial Institutions should play a more active role in bridging funding gaps. 

 

Further there should be urban based planning of industrial corridors. Housing should be an integral part of these corridors running across States. This will help in mitigating migration and decentralizing economic growth.

To address all the challenges in urban infrastructure development, it would need Strategic Long Term Planning. The future strategy for urban development should include reforms in Urban local bodies in terms of addressing 3Fs (Funds, Function and Functionaries). 

Recommendations included fiscal empowerment of urban local bodies, mechanisms to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in user fee collection, empowering the District Planning Committee, embedding authority with a professional bureaucracy, or giving the necessary powers to hire experts from market, all these following a core team approach. 

On problems relating to the lack of reliable and quality data including its adverse impact on policy planning, it was suggested that a database on urban infrastructure should be established to help in long term planning. It was also suggested that there was a need to harness technological tools like Open Data and Artificial Intelligence for continuous up-gradation. The speakers stressed on the need to create robust institutional structure and governance foundation to ensure that resources including financial resources are not wasted.


On the issue of delays in projects, it was pointed-out that the main cause is the problems relating to various permissions from all level of Governments in a hierarchical manner in States. So, for Ease of doing Business, it was suggested that there should be a tool-kit for investors on steps to be taken before, during and after investment. It was also suggested that there was need to re-engineer and restructure institutional designs and procedures, besides simplifying procedures, and changing accounting practices. It was recommended that metro cities need to be cast as the new States. 

Speakers also focused on the need to ensure an inclusive approach to urbanization. They said there was a need for public transport that works for the poor. The 'Housing for All' policy should be re-oriented from middle class towards economically weaker sections and those in informal sector.. There was a reference to the challenges in holding of property without proper land title, and it was suggested that reforms relating to the land title issue would ensure greater lending by the lending institutions.

Policy makers should have greater community engagement during the land acquisition process to have smooth acquisition. The panellists suggested that the ‘poor say’ should weigh as much as the ‘say of the financial organisations and consultants’.

                The first meeting of the BRICS Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors was held in the sidelines of the IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings on 19th April, 2018 in Washington D.C. Ministry of Finance, Government of India was represented in the meeting by Shri Subhash Chandra Garg , Secretary , Department of Economic Affairs (EA).

 

The main issues that the meeting discussed were related to enhancing the project pipelines of New Development Bank (NDB) evenly across member countries, expansion of NDB’s membership, the proposal of the South African Presidency for setting up a working group on illicit financial flows and a BRICS Task Force on Public Private Partnership. Issues related to BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) as well as BRICS Bond Fund were also discussed.

 

Shri Garg , Secretary (EA) in his interventions emphasised that India has been a constructive participant to the discussions on NDB’s membership expansion. He expressed  that a more careful and cautious approach on the value and addition/ benefits   new member will bring to the Bank would be desirable rather than setting deadlines which are practically difficult to achieve.   On the issue of  expansion of NDB’s project pipeline across member nations evenly, Shri Garg  was of the view that the objective has to be balanced with member country’s requirement for infrastructure financing. On the proposal for setting up the Working Group on Illicit Financial Flows and BRICS PPP Task Force, Secretary (EA) expressed India’s appreciation on the proposal. However, he suggested that NDB already has a Project Preparation Fund hence a separate  similar preparation fund for PPP will not be desirable.  This Project Preparation Fund also will be able to serve projects preparation of PPP projects as well.

 

In view of the India’s experience to develop brownfield infrastructure projects as asset class, Shri Garg Secretary (EA) suggested  that the BRICS may consider this more readily available infrastructure asset class for getting finances from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds etc. as sources of financing. He also sought the support of the Presidency in building consensus amongst the BRICS membership on the BRICS Rating Agency proposal. He requested the Presidency to receive and take forward the Report to be submitted by Expert Group set up under the aegis of BRICS Business Council to study the feasibility of the BRICS Rating Agency.

                The Ministry of Finance, Government of India in collaboration with the Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), Gujarat Council along with Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS), an autonomous research organization under the Ministry of External Affairs organised the 2-day Regional Conference on “Urban Development: Technological Solutions and Governance Challenges” which began in Ahmedabad today. The Conference is a lead-up event to the 3rd Annual Meeting of AIIB scheduled to be held on 25th and 26th June, 2018 in Mumbai.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Kumar V. Pratap, Joint Secretary (Infrastructure, Policy & Finance), Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, Government of India said that one third of the Indian population, which lives in urban areas, contributes more than half to the GDP and therefore, urban dwellers are among the most productive segments of the population. He emphasized that augmenting urban infrastructure will cost a lot of money. However, Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) own revenues as a percent of GDP is very low below 1%. According to the Economic Survey 2016-17 of the Ministry of Finance estimates that currently Bengaluru and Jaipur are collecting not more than 5 to 20% of their property tax potential. This implies that cities could increase their resources 5 to 20 fold from property taxes only. He also gave details about the catalytic missions such as Smarty City Mission, AMRUT and the Swachh Bharat Mission of the Central Ministries. 

 

Mr. Mukesh Puri, Principal Secretary, Department of Urban development and Urban Housing, Government of Gujarat spoke about the Governance Challenges and how the administration is planning to overcome those challenges. He said that around 70% of GDP of Gujarat, the tax is coming from the urban areas and there are still many such areas which needs to come under the Corporation for collection of tax for infrastructure development. He spoke about the Government & Corporation Plan of deputing Regional Municipal Commissioners in various areas for unlocking the assets and covering the untapped potential of the local bodies in the State. He also spoke about the town planning schemes of Gujarat and the spending of AUDA for infrastructural development. He said that AUDA has a capital of 1000 crores for 2018-19 out of which 250 crores has been spent on infrastructural development.   

 

 Dr. Ke Fang, Manager (Investment Operations), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)spoke about their role in infrastructural development and their major areas of investment for sustainable infrastructure are renewable energy in sustainable cities, cross border connectivity, regional connectivity such as express way. He emphasized on project financing and educated the audience about the aspiring 6 projects which is about USD 1.2 billion. He informed about a multilateral development bank mission to improve social and economic outcomes in Asia and beyond.

 

The event was attended by eminent experts, policy practitioners, officials from central government, industry leaders, bilateral partners and representatives of the Multilateral Development Banks including AIIB to deliberate on the pertinent issues relating to financing, institutional and regulatory environment, technological options for sustainable future, financial sustainability and other relevant aspects 

 

Ms. Bhagyesh Soneji, Chairperson ASSOCHAM Western Council, highlighted on the missing part and challenges faced in the infrastructure development of the State. She spoke about the DMIC project in Gujarat. She said that nearly 62% of the population has fallen under the DMIC project. She emphasized on the supplies as major rural population has migrated to the urban cities and the challenging part today is to manage supplies. She said that need of an hour today is to build infrastructure to manage the migrated population to the big cities and also for rural-urban infrastructure management.  She thanked all the participants and dignitaries for sparing their time and attending the very important conference. 

 

Professor Amitabh Kundu, Distinguished Fellow, RIS, and Chair of the Inaugural Session of the Conference welcomed all the dignitaries and highlighted the work and research carried-out by the dignitaries present on the dais for sustainable smart urban infrastructural development of the nation and the challenges & way forward. 

 

Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director, Indian Resident Mission, Asian Development Bank, while welcoming all the delegates to the conference addressed the challenges and opportunities faced during their working in India and at state level. He highlighted on the various projects being undertaken by ADB in the country as well as state. He stated in his presentation about the recent economic survey in India that nearly $ 180 bn investment is being projected upto the year 2040. He said that urban infrastructure is growing rapidly and their bank in India has invested around USD 39.4 bn from (1986-2016). In his presentation he also highlighted about the various projects being undertaken in India with ADB viz India-East Coast Economic Corridor. 

 

Prof O. P. Mathur, Senior Fellow and Head, Urban Studies at the Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi thanked all the stakeholders for their active participation. He highlighted on the challenging part of urban infrastructural development. He said that the major challenges faced are; of private finance, as there is no substitute of private finance to public finance, the second issued is of budgetary provision which is very low and not proportionate. He said that there are no clear fiscal space for urban infrastructure development and also there are many untapped opportunities which needs to be tapped for accelerating GDP growth to 9-10%.  

 

Mr. Bharat Patel, Co-Chairman, ASSOCHAM Western Council spoke on the overall perspective of urbanization ratio of 32%, which is still low. He said that total investments of at least $640.2 billion are needed for urban infrastructure and services until 2031 to meet the needs of the growing urban population and improve the standard of living of the existing urban population. To bridge this gap it has been emphasised that the private sector who is not only the primary user of the economic infrastructure but is the key stakeholder in implementation, designing, operations etc. It is equally pivotal to ensure private sector participation in resource generation through effective mechanisms of costs, risks and benefit sharing.

                The Government notified the scheme of Electoral Bonds on Jan. 02, 2018. Electoral Bond is a bearer instrument in the nature of a Promissory Note.

 

The Purchaser is allowed to buy electoral bond (s) only on due fulfillment of all the extant KYC norms and by making payment from a bank account. The Bond does not carry the name of payee or any other details by which the buyer can be identified. Likewise no detail of political party depositing the bonds is noted on the electoral bonds. Thus, any particular bond cannot be identified or associated with any particular buyer or political party deposits it.  

 

The Electoral Bonds have some built in security features to eliminate chances of forgery or presentation of fake bonds. These include a random serial number invisible to the naked eye. This number is not noted by the SBI in any record associated with buyer or political party depositing a particular electoral bond. It is, thus not linked to any party transaction when the Bank issues a bond to the buyer. As such the number is not being used or can be used to track the donation or the buyer.

 

SBI does not share the serial number with anybody, including the Government and users.

                Doubts are being raised about the manner of filing the quarterly return by composition dealers in FORM GSTR-4. In particular, there is a doubt with respect to the instruction at Sl. No. 10 appended to the said FORM which reads as below:

For the tax periods July, 2017 to September, 2017 and October, 2017 to December, 2017, serial 4A of Table 4 shall not be furnished.

In this regard, it is hereby clarified that since auto-population of the details of the inward supplies including supplies on which tax is to be paid on reverse charge is not taking place, taxpayers who have opted to pay tax under the composition levy shall not furnish the data in serial number 4A of Table 4 of FORM GSTR-4 for the tax periods January, 2018 to March, 2018 and subsequent tax periods.

There has been unusual spurt in currency demand in the country in last three months.   In the current month, in the first 13 days itself, the currency supply increased by Rs.45000 crores.  This unusual spurt in demand is seen more in some parts of the country like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, MP and Bihar. 

The Government of India with the Reserve Bank of India have taken all steps to meet this unusual demand. We had adequate reserves of currency notes which have been used to meet fully the extraordinary demand generated so far.  We continue to have in stock adequate currency notes of all denominations, including of Rs.500, 200 and Rs.100 to meet any demand. 

The Government would like to assure all the people that there have been adequate supply of currency notes which have met entire demand so far. The government would also like to assure that it would be supplying adequate currency notes to meet even higher levels of demand if such demand were to continue in the coming days/months.  

The Government is taking all steps to ensure that ATMs are supplied with cash and to get non-functional ATMs normalised at the earliest.

                Atal Pension Yojana (APY) is being implemented through the APY Service Providers comprising of Public Sector Banks(PSBs), Private Sector Banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Cooperative Banks and Department of Post both in urban and rural areas across the country. The total number of subscribers registered under APY as on 12th April 2018 has crossed 97.60 lakhs.

The scheme provides for a co-contribution from Government of India for those who have registered before 31/3/2016 with an amount of 50% of the subscribers contribution up-to a maximum of Rs. 1000/- and these subscribers will be eligible for co-contribution for a period 5 years from 2015-16 to 2019-20 only those subscribers who are not income tax payers and not part of any other social security schemes are eligible for Government of India co-contribution. 

Keeping in view the above, the Government of India through PFRDA has released co-contribution for the FY 2016-17 for nearly 14 lacs eligible subscribers amounting to Rs. 120.92 crores. The Subscribers who have any pending contributions in their APY account till March 2017 won't be paid with co-contribution.

                A Loan Agreement for IBRD loan of USD 48 million for the “Meghalaya Community - Led Landscapes Management Project (MCLLMP)” was signed here today with the World Bank. The Loan Agreement was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary (MI), Department of Economic Affairs on behalf of the Government of India and Mr. Hisham A Abdo Kahin, Acting Country Director, World Bank (India) on behalf of the World Bank. A Project Agreement was also signed by Mr. P. Sampath Kumar, Commissioner & Secretary to the Government of Meghalaya & CEO, Meghalaya Basin Development Authority (MBDA) and Mr. Hisham A Abdo Kahin, Acting Country Director, World Bank (India).

 

The Objective of the Project is to strengthen community-led landscapes management in selected landscapes in the State of Meghalaya. The Project consists of three components: (i) Strengthening Knowledge and Capacity for Natural Resource Management; (ii) Community-led landscape planning and implementation and (iii) Project Management and Governance. 

 

The closing date of the Project is 30th June, 2023.

 

Meghalaya’s natural resource such as land, water sources and forests is a source of livelihood for a majority of the population in the State. The Project will help manage these depleting resources, by strengthening the communities and traditional institutions. Restoration of degraded and highly degraded landscapes under the Project will increase water for local communities and improve the soil productivity which will in turn increase incomes and reduce poverty.

                Under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action 5, exchange of rulings on Permanent Establishment (PE) by Authority for Advance Rulings is required to be done not only with the countries of residence of all related parties with whom taxpayer enters into transaction, but also with the country of residence of the immediate parent company and the ultimate parent company. Therefore, in order to implement the recommendations made under Action 5 of BEPS Action Plan to bring greater transparency in cross national transactions, Form 34C and 34D (Forms for Advance Rulings) are required to be modified so that details such as name, address and country of the residence of non-resident’s immediate parent company or ultimate parent company etc. are captured at application stage itself. 

            Further, vide Finance Act, 2017, the definition of the term “applicant” for the purpose of Advance Rulings has been amended by substituting clause (b) of section 245N of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act). Therefore, consequential amendments are required in Rule 44E and respective Forms to bring them in harmony with the amendment to the Act. 

            Accordingly, a draft notification has been framed and uploaded on the website of the Income Tax Department atwww.incometaxindia.gov.infor comments from stakeholders and general public.The comments and suggestions on the draft Rules and Forms may be sent by 30th April, 2018 electronically at the email address, ts.mapwal[at]nic[dot]in.

In these cases, the Certificate of Incorporation (COI) issued by MCA contains a mention of both PAN and TAN. 

 

Finance Act, 2018 amended section 139A of the Income-tax Act, 1961  removed the requirement of issuing PAN in the form of a laminated card. Hence, it is clarified that PAN and TAN mentioned in the COI issued by MCA shall also be treated as sufficient proof of PAN and TAN for the said company assessees.

                A Protocol to amend the existing Double Taxation Avoidance Convention (DTAC) between India and Kazakhstan, earlier signed on 9th December, 1996 for the avoidance of double taxation and for the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, was signed on 06.01.2017. The said Protocol has entered into force on 12.03.2018 and was notified in Official Gazette on 12.04.2018.

Salient features of the Protocol are as under:

(i)  The Protocol provides internationally accepted standards for effective exchange of information on tax matters. Further, the information received from Kazakhstan for tax purposes can be shared with other law enforcement agencies with the authorisation of the competent authority of Kazakhstan and vice versa.

(ii)  The Protocol inserts a Limitation of Benefits Article, to provide a main purpose test to prevent misuse of the DTAC and to allow application of domestic law and measures against tax avoidance or evasion.

(iii)  The Protocol inserts specific provisions to facilitate relieving of economic double taxation in transfer pricing cases. This is a taxpayer friendly measure and is in line with India’s commitment under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan to meet the minimum standard of providing Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) access in transfer pricing cases.

 (iv) The Protocol replaces the existing Article on Assistance in Collection of Taxes with a new Article to align it with international standards.

                Approximately 1.5 Million rural residents in State of Madhya Pradesh are going to directly benefit from improved livelihoods, education and mobility with the USD $ 140-Million loan approved by the Board of Directors of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in a Meeting held recently in Beijing. The Project, co-financed with the World Bank, aims to improve the rural road connectivity and management for residents of about 5,640 villages who use the rural roads for daily activities.

Livelihoods of the rural population will be improved by expanding income earning opportunities through better farm-to-market road connections. Moreover, more children are expected to enroll in higher education programs and school attendance is expected to further improve. The road maintenance pilot under the Project will employ more women, contributing to gender equality and income generation.

“Promoting sustainable growth in India through investment in rural infrastructure will require substantial financing,” said AIIB Vice President and Chief Investment Officer D.J. Pandian. “I am glad that AIIB’s participation in this project will contribute to reducing this financing gap and enhance overall development in the region.”

In addition to the above, the Project also aims to improve durability and accessibility, and enhance resilience to climate change of the gravel surfaced rural road in State of Madhya Pradesh while building the capacity of the State to manage its rural road network and road safety.

The planned activities under the Project are:

· Upgrading the gravel surfaced roads to a sealed surface standard.

· Providing additional linkages to villages with potential for high growth.

· Enhancing institutional capacity through implementing/upgrading a rural road asset management system and strengthening design and research and quality assurance capacity of the implementation agency.

· Developing road safety management capacity with road accident data management system and piloting a comprehensive road safety program.

· Supporting design, implementation and management.

AIIB Director General of Investment Operations SupeeTeravaninthorn said that this Project will provide sustainable and safe last-mile connectivity to small villages and improve mobility of the rural population of Madhya Pradesh. He said that the Project will stimulate economic development in the entire State of Madhya Pradesh and improve the livelihoods of the rural population, especially rural women and girls. It is a typical reflection of our priorities of enhancing economic growth and sustainability through infrastructure investment.

i. GST rate on supply of food and drinks in a mess or canteen in an educational institution attracts GST at 5% without INPUT Tax Credit (ITC).

ii. If schools up to higher secondary level supply food directly to students, then the same are exempt from GST.""

                15th Finance Commission began its 4 day visit to the State of Arunachal Pradesh yesterday (5th April 2018). The Commission had meetings with the State Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister, Council of Ministers and other officials of the State. The Commission also held wide ranging interactions with the leaders of various political parties, Tribal Leaders, Local bodies and Leaders of Businesses and received detailed insights into the opportunities and challenges lying
ahead for the State. The Commission also met the State Governor Brigadier (Dr.) B.D.Mishra.

Innovative Measures required for Vertical Devolution to NE States: State Govt.

The Chief Minister welcomed the 15th Finance Commission and thanked for choosing Arunachal Pradesh as the First State for the Commission’s visit. Detailed presentations were made by the Team Arunachal led by the Chief Minister, Shri Pema Khandu on the finances of the State Government, giving in depth understanding of the efforts made by the State for the development of them State and its projection for the award period of the 15th Finance Commission.

The Chief Minister urged the commission to consider innovative measures for vertical devolutions, specially for the North Eastern States, looking at their special requirements.
 

The Land of Rising Sun – Opportunities and Challenges

The State Government team led by the Chief Minister and the Chief Secretary Shri Satya Gopal in their 4 hours long presentation outlined the opportunities and challenges for the state and outlined broad contours of their demands. Some of the points highlighted by the State Govt. are as follows:

1. Arunachal Pradesh must be seen from the viewpoint of its peculiar geographical location, hilly terrain, hostile topography, limited working season, lack of infrastructure which creates cost disabilities. This aspect
needs attention.

2. In North Eastern Region, Arunachal Pradesh stands second after Tripura in respect of total capital expenditure incurred as percentage of GSDP. state needs more funds for infrastructure development.

3. On account of the lack of investment from private sector and low resource base, Government is the major provider of employment and also funding to create infrastructure.

4. Physical as well digital connectivity is the biggest bottleneck for various developmental programmes.

5. Credit Deposit Ratio in the State is less than 30 against a norm of 60, which shows that the outreach of the banking sector and financial inclusion in the State is very poor.

6. In a disaster prone State like Arunachal Prasdesh, Corpus of NDRF grant needs to be enhanced and Adhoc releases should be available at the beginning of the year.

7. Environment Conservation, Biodiversity of the State and the challenges related to the Climate Change should be taken into account in the context of developmental efforts made.

8. Special compensation should be made under CAMPA to strike a balance between economic activities and environmental benefits accrued by the forest cover which is 80% of the State.

9. Compensatory development plan is required for development of Tirap, Changlang  and Longding Districts.

The Chief Minister on behalf of the State Government submitted a detailed Memorandum to the Commission. 

Much has been achieved, Yet much remains

The Commission appreciated the constructive and useful suggestions made by theState Government towards empowerment of the States and their development.

The Commission also placed on record its appreciation for the warm hospitality extended by the State Govt. and stated that the issues raised would receive due attention during deliberation in the Commission. The Commission also looked forward to continuing interaction with the State Government. The Commission will finalise its recommendations by October 2019 after completing its discussions with all the State Governments, the Government of India and relevant stakeholders.

                The Government of India, Government of Maharashtra and the World Bank signed here today a US$ 420 million project to help Small and Marginal farmers in the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra. The project will help inincreasing climate resilient practices in agriculture and ensuring that farming continues to remain a financially viable activity for them.

        The aforesaidproject is expected to benefit over 7 million people spread over an area of 3.0 million ha and cover 5,142 villages across 15 most climate vulnerable districts of the region.The $420 million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 6-year grace period, and a maturity of 24 years.

          The Agreements for the Maharashtra Project for Climate Resilient Agriculture were signed by ShriSameer Kumar Khare,Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; Shri Bijay Kumar, Additional Chief Secretary, Agriculture Department on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra; and Mr.Junaid Ahmad,Country Director, World Bank, India on behalf of the World Bank.

The Maharashtra Project for Climate Resilient Agriculture will be implemented in rural areas largely dependent upon rainfed agriculture. The project will take up a series of activities at the farm and watershed level. It will scale up climate-resilient technologies such as micro irrigation systems, expand surface water storage, and facilitate aquifer recharge, which is expected to directly contribute to a more efficient use of scarce water resources. By adopting climate-resilient seed varieties which have short maturity, are drought and heat resistant, and salt tolerant, the project will help reduce risks of climate-related crop failure, and help enhance farmer’s income.

In recent years, climate variability has affected agriculture in Maharashtra, where farming is largely dominated by small and marginal farmers. Farmers have low crop productivity and a high dependence on rainfall. Severe drought in the past has affected the state’s agriculture performance.At the watershed level, project activities include building drainage lines and preparing catchment area treatment plans that promote a more efficient use of surface water for agriculture, complemented with a more sustainable use of groundwater, which will ultimately improve the availability and quality of water at the farm level.

To strengthen emerging value chains for climate-resilient agricultural commodities, the project will improve the capacity of Farmer Producers Organizations to operate as sustainable, market-oriented, agri-enterprises. It will help mainstream the climate resilient agriculture agenda in various local institutions that deliver agricultural services to the farming community.

India’s per capita emission of Green House Gases (GHG) is also on the rise, though current per capita levels of 2.44 t CO2 equivalent in 2012, is still among the lowest in the world. In absolute terms, the agriculture sector is the second largest contributor with around 18 percent of the country’s total GHG emissions. This project will help mitigate that through carbon sequestration which involves planting trees in upper catchment areas and afforestation; growing fruit trees on small orchards; and incorporating crop residues (biomass) into the soil.

Speaking in the occasion, theJoint Secretary, DEA, MoFShri Khare said that the Government of India accords high priority to welfare of farmers and is implementing several schemes to revitalize the agriculture sector and improve the economic condition of farmers. To cope with climate change, agricultural systems must be resilient and adapt to change. The Project will strengthen the resilience of small and marginal farmers against adverse climate events by promoting agricultural technologies and farming practices that are aimed at improving soil health, water-use efficiency and crop productivity.

 

Emphaising the importance of the project Mr. Junaid Ahmad said that for India to sustain its growth across generations and become one of the world’s largest middle-class economies, the country needs to shift to a more resource-efficient growth path, which is inclusive. This project will help the rural poor, largely dependent on rain-fed agriculture, use more climate-resilient farming technologies and conserve water, a scarce resource. The project will also support the state government to shift towards a new paradigm that puts climate resilience at the core of agricultural growth and rural development in Maharashtra.

Lead Agriculture Economist Mr. Patrick Verissimo andSenior Agriculture SpecialistMr. Ranjan Samantray, the World Bank’s Task Team Leaders for the project said that state climate modeling results show that the annual mean temperature in the project area will increase by around 1.3 to 1.5 degree Celsius by the 2030s. The increase in rainfall during this period is also likely to get distributed over a shorter number of rain days. The Government of Maharashtra recognizes the need for a structural shift to make agriculture more sustainable and is keen to build climate resilience in agriculture which this project will support the Government in achieving.

                 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulator and supervisor of the banking system, as per power conferred by relevant provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, and other relevant statutes. RBI has informed that the guidelines/norms and procedure for audits have been issued by RBI, in consultation with Government of India. Accordingly, banks are to put in place appropriate control and audit procedures for their business activities. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) are subject to annual Statutory Central Audit and Statutory Branch Audit. In addition, Risk-Based Internal Audit and Concurrent Audit are undertaken by all PSBs in terms of RBI guidelines. Further, quarterly review of accounts is conducted by Statutory Central Auditors. Stock Audit is undertaken by banks as per their policies. RBI has further apprised that, in the wake of SWIFT-related fraud involving significant amount reported recently by Punjab National Bank (PNB), it has constituted an Expert Committee, to look into, inter alia, the factors leading to an increasing incidence of frauds, and the role and effectiveness of various types of audits conducted in banks in mitigating the incidence of such frauds.

 

 

With regard to details concerning ensuring that defaulters do not flee to foreign country, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has informed that in case requests are received from agencies concerned for revoking or suspending passports of defaulters, the same is carried out expeditiously in MEA. Further, in order to deter economic offenders from evading the process of Indian law by remaining outside the jurisdiction of Indian courts, Government has introduced the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, 2018 in Parliament. The bill provide for attachment of property of a fugitive economic offender, confiscation of such offender’s property, and disentitlement of the offender from defending any civil claim. In addition, with a view to enable banks to inform relevant authorities of passport details, if need arises, Government has advised all Public Sector Banks to obtain a certified copy of the passport of the promoters/directors and other authorised signatories of companies availing of loan facilities of Rs. 50 crore and above. The advisory further states that in existing cases, where loans of Rs. 50 crore and above are given, banks may collect passport details.

                As per the World Economic Situation and Prospects 2018 report of the United Nations, the Indian economy is projected to grow at 7.2 per cent in 2018-19 and 7.4 per cent in 2019-20. The report indicates that the outlook for India remains largely positive, underpinned by robust private consumption and public investment as well as ongoing structural reforms.

 

Share of public sector (including public financial corporations, public non-financial corporations and General Government) in total Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) increased from 21.4 per cent in 2011-12 to 23.3 per cent in 2014-15 and further to 25.1 per cent in 2016-17 (the latest year for which data is available). The share of public GFCF in GDP at current prices increased from 7.0 per cent in 2014-15 to 7.2 per cent in 2016-17. The average contribution of public sector GFCF to GDP growth was 9.5 per cent from 2014-15 to 2016-17, as compared to 3.0 per cent in 2012-13.

 

The confidence in the Indian economy has increased on account of policy measures taken up by the Government and the Reserve Bank of India. Moody’s rating agency upgraded India’s local and foreign currency issuer rating to Baa2 with a stable outlook from Baa3 on the expectation that continued progress in India’s economic reforms will enhance India’s growth potential over time. According to World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business 2018 Report, India’s ranking improved by 30 positions to 100th rank in 2018. As per the World Economic Forum, India’s rank in Global Competitiveness Index is 40 out of 137 countries in 2017-18, improvement over 71 out of 144 countries in 2014-15 and 55 out of 140 countries in 2015-16.

 

The Government of India has taken various initiatives to improve the confidence in the Indian economy and boost the growth of the economy and which, inter-alia, include; fillip to manufacturing, concrete measures for transport and power sectors as well as other urban and rural infrastructure, comprehensive reforms in the foreign direct investment policy, special package for textile industry, push to infrastructure development by giving infrastructure status to affordable housing and focus on coastal connectivity. For highways development the Bharatmala Pariyojana has been launched. The Government has launched a phased program for bank recapitalization. This entails infusion of capital to the public sector banks, which is expected to encourage banks to enhance lending. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was enacted to achieve insolvency resolution in a time bound manner. The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has provided a significant opportunity to improve growth momentum by reducing barriers to trade, business and related economic activities. Budget 2018-19 included various measures to provide a push to the economy, which among others, include major push to infrastructure via higher allocation to rail & road sector, reduced corporate tax rate of 25 per cent for companies with turnover up to Rs. 250 crore which is expected to help 99 per cent of MSMEs, etc.

 

This was stated by Shri P. Radhakrishnan, Minister of State for Finance in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.

                As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, banks are to have a loan recover policy, prepared and duly vetted by their boards. A number of mechanisms are available to banks to effect recovery, such as filing of a suit in Civil courts or in Debts Recovery Tribunals and action under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act. In addition, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 has been enacted for time-bound resolution of stressed assets. Further, the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 has been amended to provide for authorisation by the Government to RBI, for issuing directions to banks to initiate the insolvency resolution process under the Code, and in pursuance of such directions, banks have filed applications in case of severs/large credit exposures before the National Company Law Tribunal. Further, keeping in view the enactment of the Code, RBI has recently issued a Revised Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets, which provides for time-bound resolution of high-value stressed accounts.

 

As per data reported by PSBs, 1,77,614 properties have been attached and auctioned by them and an amount of Rs. 15,196 crore has been recovered during the financial years 2014-15 to 2017-18 (till 31.12.2017).

 

As per RBI data on global operations, as on 31.12.2017, the details of Gross Loans and Advances of Scheduled Commercial Banks, are given below.

No targets for collection of GST have been fixed. In the absence of any past precedent, it shall be difficult to compare the GST revenue collection with the corresponding months of the previous years due to a number of factors like overlap of taxpayers pre and post introduction of GST, variation in exemption limits between Centre and States and among States and mechanism of apportionment of fund under IGST.

 

      As per provisions in Section 7 of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, the loss of revenue arising on account of implementation of GST regime and compensation for loss of revenue to the States shall be provisionally calculated and released at the end of every two months for five years. The GST Compensation paid to the States on bimonthly basis for the period of July 2017 to February, 2018 is as below: -

                The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has clarified that the pension received by a taxpayer from his former employer is taxable under the head “Salaries”. The Finance Act, 2018 has amended Section 16 of the Income–tax Act, 1961(“the Act”) to provide that a taxpayer having income chargeable under the head “Salaries” shall be allowed a deduction of Rs 40,000/- or the amount of salary, whichever is less, for computing his taxable income. Accordingly, any taxpayer who is in receipt of pension from his former employer shall be entitled to claim a deduction of Rs 40,000/- or the amount of pension, whichever is less, under Section 16 of the Act.  

Earlier, the representations were received seeking clarification as to whether a taxpayer, who receives pension from his former employer, shall also be eligible to claim this deduction.

                The two-day Regional Conference on “Enhancing Port and Coastal Infrastructure” concluded in Visakhapatnam today throwing much light on SAGARMALA project,port & coastal infrastructure and Regulatory issues; Investment in Coastal Areas for Promoting Blue Economy; Developing the Shipping Ecosystem- Ship Repair and Dry Docks; Catalyzing the Modal Shift for Inland Waterways and Coastal Shipping; Strengthening India’s Maritime Support Infrastructure-Containerization,Bunkering and Dredging.  The Government of India is hosting the third Annual Meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) on 25th & 26th June 2018 in Mumbai.This Conference was lead-up to the annual conference.

 

The conference saw eminent delegates representing partner institutions, academia, civil society organizations and experts from various fields expressing their views on how to address Asia’s infrastructure gap in an environmentally and socially friendly way for creating a sustainable future through sound infrastructure investment.

 

Recognizing the vital role of the private sector in bridging the infrastructure gap, the participants at the meet emphasized upon devising innovative solutions that mobilize private capital, in partnership with multilateral development banks, governments, private financiers and other stakeholders. As the private sector is not only the primary user of the economic infrastructure but is the key stakeholder in implementation, designing, operations, etc. Panelists during the course of deliberations also opined that there is a necessity to revisit the existing regulatory  mechanism regimes through effective dialogue with different stakeholders including private investors, domain experts and regulatory bodies among others.  It was also felt that the infrastructure needs and communication networks are to be prioritized keeping in mind the environmental demands while addressing development goals.     

 

Panelists representing varied fields under the chairmanship of Mr. Rajesh Tripathi, CMD, Dredging Corporation of India Ltd., Visakhapatnam, emphasized on the need for developing suitable ecosystem for a flourishing shipping trade with the support facilities like ship repair and dry docking infrastructure.  They dwelt upon the existing gaps which need to be filled up in the current scenario in order to catch up with leading nations in waterway transportation resorting to use of technology and innovative ideas like promoting unmanned vehicles.  

 

Identifying the importance of inland waterways development and the need to promote coastal shipping eminent panelists under the chairmanship of Mr. P.L. Haranath, Deputy Chairman, Visakhapatnam Port Trust, opined that despite having extensive network of inland waterways in the country they are primarily under-utilized and emphasized the need for a modal shift for maximizing the use of waterways, as transportation by waterways are cheaper while at the same time they invite huge capital investments.   The need for international financial funding for developing and maintaining inland waterways was also discussed.   

 

To build up on the country’s maritime support infrastructure panelists under the chairmanship of Capt. S.V. Subhedar, CEO, Indian Coastal Conference deliberated upon innovative methods to be incorporated for the increase in trade by focusing on the support systems of the shipping industry, viz., containerization, bunkering, and dredging.  Shri Sabyasachi Hajara, Director, Apeejay shipping felt that government’s handholding is needed with the support of major users of the waterways for cargo transport. As shipping is an international activity, he observed that worldwide the shipping community is moving towards zero emission norms. Cargo Competence and Capital are the three key factors for flourishing shipping industry.  He pointed that in the international arena of shipping sector India’s stake is just one per cent, which must be improved.  It was also opined that reduction of logistic cost and time is another aspect which needs to be studied so as to become globally competent.

 

Earlier, on Day- 1 of the session Shri Kailash Kumar Aggarwal Joint Secretary (Sagarmala), Ministry of Shipping, suggested that the SAGARMALA project, the flagship initiative of the Central government, would help achieve Blue Economy – sustainable development of oceans and water body resources, and significant reduction in logistics cost. Shri Aggarwal said port-led development and inland waterways were being encouraged to help save Rs. 35,000 crore per annum in terms of logistics cost and increase the share of water-borne transport with a freight modal mix from 6 to 12 per cent.  He said under SAGARMALA, the government wanted to take up various projects in the next 20 years.

 

At the end of the day it was agreed up on that the Port and Coastal Sector play a key role in a country’s economic and social development.  It was also felt that as sea-borne trade grows, there is a need to modernize and develop ports for efficient capacity utilization.  Use of advanced technology for ship building and repairing besides improving overall coastal infrastructure assumed significance during the discussions.

 

During the valedictory Shri Shakil Alam, Director, M/o Finance and Dr. Vishwapati Trivedi, Former Secretary, M/o Shipping summed up the two-day session and Dr. Shailesh Nayak, Former Secretary, M/o Earth Sciences delivered the Valedictory Address.

                It has been decided by the Government to put in place an IT-Grievance Redressal Mechanism to address the difficulties faced by a section of taxpayers owing to technical glitches on the GST portal. In this regard, GST Council has delegated powers to an IT Grievance Redressal Committee to approve and recommend to the GSTN the steps to be taken to redress the grievance and provide relief to the taxpayer. The relief could be in the nature of allowing filing of any Form or Return prescribed in law or amending any Form or Return already filed. However, where the problem relates to individual taxpayer, due to localised issues such as non-availability of internet connectivity or failure of power supply, this mechanism shall not be available. 

 

The mechanism inter alia envisages that taxpayers shall make an application to the field officers or the nodal officers where there was a demonstrable glitch on the Common Portal in relation to an identified issue, due to which the due process as envisaged in law could not be completed on the Common Portal. The IT Grievance Redressal committee shall examine and approve the solutions as may be necessary for an identified issue.

 

The Circular also seeks to address the problems faced by the taxpayers who could not complete the process of filing of TRAN-1 by due date, due to IT-glitch such that the process of digitally signing/ validating TRAN-1 could not be completed. The taxpayer would be allowed to complete the process of filing such TRAN 1, stuck due to IT glitches, by 30th April 2018 and the process of completing filing of GSTR 3B which could not be filed for such TRAN 1 shall be completed by 31st May 2018. 

 

The last date for filing of TRAN 1 is not being extended in general and only the taxpayers, who have been identified in terms of the circular issued in this regard, shall be allowed to complete the process of filing TRAN-1.

 

The decision relating to filing of TRAN-1 shall benefit 17,573 taxpayers who shall consequently be able to avail Rs. 2582.98 cr. as CGST credit and Rs. 1112.77 cr. as SGST credit. For further details, circular no. 39/13/2018-GST dated 03.04.2018 may be downloaded from the website www.cbec.gov.in.

He said that AIIB also focuses on mobilizing the private sector for its major participation in infrastructure development of Port and coastal areas.

Under the scheme, a subscriber would receive a minimum guaranteed pension of Rs.1000 to Rs.5000 per month, depending upon his contribution, from the age of 60 years.  The same pension would be paid to the spouse of the subscriber  and  on  the  demise of  both  the  subscriber  and  spouse,  the accumulated pension wealth is returned to the nominee.

Now APY can also be opened through a complete digital channel through eNPS platform. A subscriber can view and print the ePRAN card and Statement of Transactions. Further, the subscriber can register complaints/ grievance by providing his/ her PRAN details on https://npslite-nsdl.com/CRAlite/grievanceSub.do.

                The provisional figures of Direct Tax collections for FY 2017-18 show that net collections are at Rs.9.95 lakh crore which is 17.1% higher than the net collections for FY 2016-17. The net Direct Tax collections represent 101.5% of the Budget Estimates (Rs.9.8 lakh crore) and 99% of the Revised Estimates (Rs. 10.05 lakh crore) of Direct Taxes for F.Y. 2017-18.

 

Gross collections (before adjusting for refunds) in FY 2017-18 have increased by 13% to Rs.11.44 lakh crore. Refunds amounting to Rs.1.49 lakh crore have been issued during 2017-18.

 

The growth rate for net collections for Corporate Income Tax (CIT) is 17.1% and for Personal Income Tax (including STT) is 18.9%. 

 

However, it is reiterated that the aforesaid figures are as yet provisional and subject to change pending final collation of data of collections.

 

During FY 2017-18, 6.84 crore Income Tax Returns (ITRs) were filed with the Income Tax Department as compared to 5.43 crore ITRs filed during FY 2016-17, showing a growth of 26%. There has been a sustained increase in the number of ITRs filed in the last four financial years. As compared to 3.79 crore ITRs filed in F.Y. 2013-14, the number of ITRs filed during F.Y. 2017-18 (6.84 crore) has increased by 80.5%.  

 

During FY 2017-18, the number of new ITR filers has also increased to 99.49 lakh (as on 30.03.2018) as compared to 85.51 lakh new ITR filers added during FY 2016-17, which translates into a growth of 16.3%.

 

The increase in total returns filed and new returns filed during FY 2017-18 is a result of sustained efforts made by the Income Tax Department in following up with potential non-filers through email, SMS, statutory notices, outreach programmes, etc. as well as through structural changes made in law and the Government’s emphasis on widening of tax net.

                As per decision of the GST Council, e-Way Bill system became mandatory from 01stApril, 2018  for all inter-State movement of goods. The implementation of the nationwide e-Way Bill mechanism under GST regime is being done by GSTN in association with the National Informatics Centre (NIC)and is being run on portal namely https://ewaybillgst.gov.in. 

On day-1, total of 2.59 lakh e-Way Bills were generated on the e-way bill portal. Till 2:00 pm today, 2,04,563 e-way bills have been generated. A total of 11,18,292 taxpayers have registered on e-Way Bill Portal till date. Further20,057transportershave enrolled themselves on the e-Way Bill Portal.

To assist and answer queries of taxpayers and transporters, the Central helpdesk of GST has made special arrangements with 100 agents exclusively dedicated to answer queries related to e-way bills. Separately, state tax authorities have started helpdesk in local language, details of which are available on the GST portal. Central as well as State Tax Authorities have declared Nodal Officers for e-way bills. Detailed FAQs are kept on the portal for the guidance of the users.

E-way Bill can be generated through various modes like Web (Online), Android App, SMS, using Bulk Upload Tool and API based site to site integration etc. Consolidated e-way Bill can be generated by transporters for vehicle carrying multiple consignments. 

Transporters can create multiple Sub-Users and allocate roles to them. This way large transporters can declare their various offices as sub-users. 


There isa provision for cancellation of e-way Bill within 24 hours by the person who has generated the e-way Bill. The recipient can also reject the e-way Bill within validity period of e-way bill or 72 hours of generation of the e-way bill by the consignor whichever is earlier.

                In line with commitment of government to liquidate all pending GST refunds, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has successfully concluded refund fortnight cum special drive from 15th March, 2018 to 31stMarch, 2018.

During the period, all field formations of CBIC worked hardto provide refund relief to the exporters. Special refund cells manned by experienced staff were put in place throughout the country. The exporter awareness campaigns using both print media and social media were carried out so that the benefit can be extended to maximum exporters. All field formations were tasked to go extra mile in order to facilitate the sanctioning of refunds. The Circulars, Instructions etc were issued by CBIC to clarify the issues which threw new challenges while sanctioning of refunds. 

The success of these effortsis visible in the amount of refunds sanctioned during this period. By the end of 31st March,2018 another Rs. 4265 crore IGST refund has been sanctioned in the refund fortnight taking the total tally to Rs. 9604 crore. Total 2,73,017 Shipping Bills with the payment of IGST have been filed by the exporterstill 31st January, 2018. The number of Shipping Bills disposed of till 31st March, 2018 is 2,28,829 which is about 83% of those Shipping Bills filed till January end. The eligible IGST claims transmitted by GSTN to Customs of the period till 31stJanuary, 2018 are of Rs 10,720 crore, out of which Rs 9,604 crore have been sanctioned which is about 89.6% of those eligible claims transmitted by GSTN.

As regards to ITC refunds, Rs. 1,136 crore has been sanctioned during the special drive making the total figure of ITC sanctioned equal to Rs. 5,510 crore by end of this fiscal. As per the latest available data:


	1,61,325 refund applications have been filed in FORM GST RFD-01A on the common portal, in which an amount of Rs. 17,471crore has been claimed. Of these, 60,183 refund applications are in relation to zero rated supplies, in which an amount of Rs. 14,649crore has been claimed. Taxpayers are required to submit a copy of these RFD-01A application to the jurisdictional tax office, along with all supporting documents.
	However, only 26,620 refund applications (out of 1,61,325 applications) have been actually received in the Central or State tax offices. Of these, 17,734 applications have been disposed off.
	Of the total amount claimed of Rs. 17,471 crores, an amount of Rs. 8,012 crores has already been sanctioned (Rs. 5,510 crore by Centre and Rs. 2,502 crore by States).  


Thus, in all, Rs 9,604 crore (IGST refunds), Rs. 5,510 crore (ITC refund by Centre) and Rs 2,502 crore (ITC refund by States) all totalling to Rs 17,616 crore has been sanctioned.

Apart from this, an amount of Rs 16,680 crore duty drawback has been disbursed to exporters during the period from 1.7.2017 to 31.03.2018. An amount of Rs 1,833.25 crore approx. has been disbursed to exporters against RoSL claims during financial year 2017-18.

The momentum gained during this fortnight would be carried on in future. The CBIC is dedicated to sanction all the legitimate refund claims of exporters. The efforts are being made to resolve those issues which are still pending in consultations with GSTN.

                SIDBI celebrated its foundation day today as day of Sampark (connect), Sanwad (interaction), Suraksha (security) and Sampreshan (disseminate).Chairman Managing Director of SIDBI Shri Mohammad Mustafa launched a series of initiatives from its Lucknow bank headquarters. He mentioned that the occasion is an opportunity to look within and reinvent our strategy for course correction and development. 

While flagging off its ‘MSME contact programme’; he called upon bank’s officers to use the day long stay at MSMEs to come closer in understanding their opportunities, challenges and the eco system so as to grasp as to what can be done to ease the way they do business. He told this is what SIDBI has been created for and learning with footprints at field level is the true spirit of the organisation. In his interaction CMD mentioned that SIDBI has taken a series of steps both from direct lending (launch of growth support to MSME -SMILE loans around 8.12% and enhancing its footprint through string of Resident Representative Office ) as also policy advocacy ( launch of CRISIDEX, to gauge MSME aspirations, and MSME pulse, the health tracker for MSMEs).

A new step forward in commencing Bancassurance services for MSMEs was also taken. An MoU was signed with The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and two MSMEs were issued insurance policies. SIDBI is thus evolving as one stop solution provider.

While launching the revamped SIDBI website (www.sidbi.in) on this occasion CMD mentioned that it is an attempt to reimagine the site to reflect the new vibrant face of SIDBI aiming to transform the MSE ecosystem. Besides providing crisp and precise information about the various strategic interventions made by SIDBI, it exhibits a great potential for the MSME aspirants through its other offerings in the form of a ""Contactless Loan Platform"" likely to be introduced on the website shortly. Chairman SIDBI also launched Samridhhi- the virtual assistant on banks revamped universal loan portal www.udyamimitra.in. It will answer standard queries of aspirants 24*7.

During the day, a ‘Bankability Kit’ (brought in partnership with Bank of Baroda and IDBI Bank) was also launched. It is a step to look beyond financial literacy and be a trusted guide for aspirants and existing entrepreneurs to know entrepreneurial self, know banker & know banking. It covers what bankers look at, how to communicate with banks, the care to be taken, do’s and don’ts etc.

Mr. Mustafa mentioned that the coming year will see a slew of measures to create a large positive impact on MSME sector. New SIDBI will endeavour to contribute to NEW and Entrepreneurial India in a manner that no one can imagine MSME without us. He mentioned that while next year will be year of Direct Finance, Institutional financing shall be growth engine and Promotion & Development shall be core strategy. In order to have feet on street, SIDBI shall endeavour to work with teachers and colleges in some states to motivate people to become job creator and not job seekers. The plan is to create a network which will result in selection of model entrepreneurs every year who will be supported by SIDBI in creating sustainable business models. SIDBI is also planning to start MSE award to recognise change-maker MSEs at bottom of pyramid.

                Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) released a discussion paper today on regulation of fee payable to insolvency professionals (IPs) and other process costs under Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). The discussion paper is available at www.ibbi.gov.in.

IBBI invites suggestions and comments on the issues discussed in the paper, including the following:

i.     Whether the elements of costs listed in the paper are comprehensive? Are the elements of costs / fee classified / grouped appropriately? Please suggest modifications.

ii.    Should the elements of the insolvency resolution process cost (IRPC), including fee payable to IPs, Insolvency Professional Entities (IPEs) and other Professionals, be regulated? 

iii.   Should the fee be disclosed by interim resolution professional (IRP) / resolution professional (RP), and then published on the web site of the respective Insolvency Professional Agency or the IBBI? Is disclosure of fee good enough for regulation of fee? 

iv.   Should the industry and /or the Board promote development of best practices in respect of fee of the IRP and the RP and other fee associated with CIRP? What should be the elements of best practice? Should best practice for determination of fee good enough for regulation of fee?

v.    Should the fee payable for various services under CIRP be further (beyond disclosures and best practices) regulated? If so, how should the fee payable to the IRP/RP, Insolvency Professional Entity (IPE) and professionals engaged under CIRP be regulated? Should there be a ceiling, a floor or a band for fee payable to the IRP/RP, IPE and other professionals. Should it be a percentage linked to some variable of the corporate debtor? Should it be decided based on estimation of man hours of services required in a CIRP? Please elaborate.

vi.   How should the fee and costs associated with CIRP be ascertained and minimized? 

vii.  Is there any further suggestion / comment on costs and fee associated with CIRP?

 

The suggestions and comments may please be mailed at feedback@ibbi.gov.in latest by 20th April, 2018.

                As per decision of the GST Council, e-Way Bill system became mandatory from today i.e. 01st April, 2018  for all inter-State movement of goods. The implementation of the nationwide e-Way Bill mechanism under GST regime is being done by GSTN in association with the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and is being run on portal namely https://ewaybillgst.gov.in. 

Heralding a paradigm shift in movement of goods from one State to another, trial run for e-way bills under the current GST regime was started on 16th January 2018 for the entire country. 

A total of 10,96,905 taxpayers have registered on e-Way Bill Portal till date. Further 19,796 transporters, who are not registered under GST, have enrolled themselves on the e-Way Bill Portal. 1,71,503 e-waybills have been successfully generated on the portal from 00:00 hours till 17:00 hrs of 1st April, 2018.

To answer queries of taxpayers and transporters, the Central helpdesk of GST has made special arrangements with 100 agents exclusively dedicated to answer queries related to e-way bills. 

E-way Bill can be generated through various modes like Web (Online), Android App, SMS, using Bulk Upload Tool and API based site to site integration etc. Consolidated e-way Bill can be generated by transporters for vehicle carrying multiple consignments. 

Transporters can create multiple Sub-Users and allocate roles to them. This way large transporters can declare their various offices as sub-users. 

There is a provision for cancellation of e-way Bill within 24 hours by the person who has generated the e-way Bill. The recipient can also reject the e-way Bill within validity period of e-way bill or 72 hours of generation of the e-way bill by the consignor whichever is earlier.

Harsimrat Kaur Badal today inaugurated the second mega food park in Uttarakhand at Mahuakhera Ganj village, Kashipur in Udham Singh Nagar district. The park- M/s Himalayan Mega Food Park Private Ltd has been set up at a cost of Rs 99.96 crore and will benefit around 25,000 farmers in this as well as neighbouring districts.

The Mega Food Park in this district was inaugurated by the Union Food Processing Industries Minister in the presence of Union Minister of State for Food Processing Industries Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti and Uttarakhand State Finance Minister Shri Prakash Pant & Uttarakhand State Transport & Social Welfare Minister Shri Yashpal Arya. The first Mega Food Park in the state located at Haridwar has already become operational.

Giving details of the project, Smt Harsimrat Badal said the mega food park, which has been set up in in an area of 50.14 acres, would have a central processing centre as well as well as three Primary Processing Centres (PPCs) at Ram Nagar, Ramgarh and Kaladungi. She said the park would also have facilities for primary processing and storage near the farms. She said the park would not only benefit farmers of Udham Singh Nagar but also those of nearby districts of Nainital, Garhwal, Almora and Champawat.

The facilities being created at Central Processing Centre (CPC) of this Mega Food Park include Multi-Purpose Cold Storage of 1,250 MT, Aseptic Brick Filling Line of 7,500 pack per hour, Dry Warehouse of 6,000 MT, Fruit & Vegetable Processing Line input capacity 7 MT/Hr for Tomato Paste, 8 MT/Hr for Apple, 10 MT/Hr. for Carrot, 5 MT/Hr. for fruit pulp, QC & Food Testing Lab and other related food processing facilities.

The Union Minister said the mega food park would leverage an additional investment of about Rs. 250 crore in 25-30 food processing units in the park and would eventually lead to a turnover of about Rs. 450-500 crore annually. “The Park will also provide direct and indirect employment to 5,000 persons and benefit about 25,000 farmers in the CPC and PPC catchment areas”, she added. The Minister highlighted that the modern infrastructure for food processing created at Park will benefit the farmers, growers, processors and consumers of Uttarakhand and adjoining areas immensely and prove to be a big boost to the growth of the food processing sector in the State of Uttarakhand.

The Minister also highlighted how her ministry, under the visionary guidance of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, was focusing on boosting the food processing industry so that agriculture sector could grow exponentially and become a major contributor to doubling the farmer’s income and ‘Make in India’ initiative of the government.

She said the food processing industry ministry is creating Mega Food Parks with modern infrastructure facilities for food processing along the value chain from farm to market with strong forward and backward linkages through a cluster based approach. She said the sector would contribute towards doubling farmers’ income in the coming years by working to achieve this goal through implementation of projects under the flagship scheme of ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana’. Smt Badal also thanked the Uttarakhand State government for the support extended by them in setting up the mega food park.

                “Safdarjung Hospital has been a premier learning space for young physicians and has the unique distinction of giving birth to three medical colleges. The Institute has contributed significantly to affordable and quality healthcare to lakhs of patients” This was stated by Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, at the Platinum Jubilee celebration function of Safdarjung Hospital, here today. 

Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State, Ministry of Culture, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Smt. Anupriya Patel, Ministers of State for Health & Family Welfare also graced the occasion. 

Speaking at the celebration function, Shri Nadda stated that the Institute has traversed a long illustrious journey of glorious 75 years. “The stalwarts who formed the foundation of this premium healthcare institute, I salute and congratulate them,” Shri Nadda added. He further said: that let us remember this day as one where we decide to take it to the heights of pioneering healthcare, and envision where this Institute shall be as it celebrates 100 years of serving the people with the best health services. Shri Nadda also suggested that the celebrations should continue for one year where various activities are conducted. “A focussed committee can be formed of its alumni who can guide the direction in which Safdarjung hospital should proceed. Let’s build on its strength- a hospital for the common man, providing quality healthcare,” Shri Nadda elaborated. 

Pointing to the disconnect often witnessed among doctors and patients in various hospitals, the Health Minister stated that this is many a time due to lack of communication between them. He suggested that high quality qualified counsellors may be appointed to communicate with the patients and their attendants. “They need to be professionals who are qualified in communication. This is important as patient load increases and patient-doctors altercations tend to increase,” Shri Nadda elaborated.

Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State (I/C), Ministry of Culture, an alumini of the hospital himself, highlighted the accomplishments of the Safdarjung Hospital and stressed on the importance of compassion among doctors. He saluted the founding fathers and stalwart doctors for their valuable contribution. He stressed on the need for doctors to show empathy and compassion to the patients.

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health & Family Welfare said that the services at the hospital are progressing steadily and he is confident that it will one day become India’s top hospital. He further said that doctors and healthcare should not be commercialised as doctors are still revered as god on earth. Shri Choubey emphasised importance of ethical practices and compassion among doctors.

Smt. Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare congratulated the doctors and faculty at the Safdarjung and said that the Institute is one of the world’s largest public sector hospitals with a mission to deliver free and affordable healthcare to every child, woman and man and provides world class medical education to young doctors who shall become the torchbearers in this millennium. She also highlighted various initiatives undertaken by the Centre to enhance the quality of services at Safdarjung Hospital.

The dignitaries released a stamp also to mark the occasion.

                The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has restricted the manufacture of Oxytocin formulations for domestic use to public sector only. It has also banned the import of Oxytocin and its formulations. 

The High Court of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla, had, in its judgment dated 15.3.2016 in CWPIL No. 16 of 2014 titled ‘Court on its own motion’ versus State of Himachal Pradesh and others, observed that there is large scale clandestine manufacture and sale of the drug Oxytocin leading to its grave misuse, which is harmful to animals and humans. Amongst others, it had also observed that the feasibility of restricting the manufacture of Oxytocin only in public sector companies should be considered.

The matter was considered by the Drugs Technical Advisory Board, a statutory body constituted under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. The Board recommended that Oxytocin formulations for human use be regulated and restricted to be supplied only to registered hospitals and clinics in public and private sector to prevent its misuse. 

The Central Government, on the basis of the recommendations of the Board and after examination of the matter, was satisfied that unregulated and illegal use of Oxytocin is likely to involve risk to human beings or animals and that in the public interest it is necessary and expedient to regulate and restrict its manufacture, sale and distribution to prevent its misuse by unauthorised persons or otherwise.

Accordingly, the Central Government has regulated the manufacture for sale or for distribution of Oxytocin under section 26A of the said Act in the following manner:-


	The manufacture of Oxytocin formulations for domestic use shall be by public sector undertakings or companies only and the label of the product shall bear barcodes.
	The manufacture of Oxytocin formulations for export purposes shall, however, be open to both public and private sector. The packs of such manufacture for exports shall also bear barcodes. 
	The manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of Oxytocin shall supply the API only to the public sector manufacturers for manufacture of formulations for domestic use.
	However, for manufacture of formulations for export purpose, the API will be supplied to the manufacturers in both public and private sector.
	The Oxytocin formulations meant for domestic consumption will be supplied by the manufacturers to the registered hospitals and clinics in public and private sector directly. 
	The manufacturers can also supply the formulations to the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya JanaushadhiPariyojana(PMBJP) and Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) outlets or any other Government entity which may be specified by the Central Government for this purpose. However, these outlets will further supply the drug to the registered hospitals and clinics in public and private sector.
	Oxytocin in any form or name will not be allowed to be sold through retail Chemist.


The regulations with regard manufacture of Oxytocin for domestic use will come into force on 1st July 2018. However, the ban on import takes immediate effect.

                The Hon’ble Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today presided over the 8th convocation ceremony of PGIMER and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, in presence of Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Smt Anupriya Patel, Ministers of State for Health and Family Welfare.

Addressing the participants, the Vice President of India stated that RML is one of the best medical institutions in the country serving people since last 75 years. The Vice President further stated that education and health are two pillars of a country and Swasth Bharat is ‘Samruddha Bharat’. Shri Naidu also emphasized on the the Ayushman Bharat National Health Protection Mission and said that it will protect around 50 crore people (from about 10 crore families) from catastrophic healthcare spending. He also appreciated the Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) initiative of the Health Ministry that is drastically reducing the expenditure incurred by common patients on treatment of cancer and heart diseases.

In his address, the Vice President further stated that the government is committed to providing Universal Health Coverage to all. He further stated that there is lopsided supply of healthcare services in the country and urged other stakeholders like private players, NGOs, and civil society organizations to supplement the efforts of the government. He also stressed on the need for doctors to provide services in the rural areas.

Congratulating the students, Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare stated:  “As you step into the brave new world of 21st Century to engage with the cutting edge of medical science, technology and research, do not forget the larger purpose of always working to improve the health of the poor, the needy and the underprivileged”. The Union Health Minister further said that no patient should be denied treatment on account of being poor or belonging to lower strata of society.

Speaking at the function, Shri Nadda said that there is a tremendous crisis of skilled human resources in health sector at all level. “We have now planned for a rapid expansion of medical education in the country. Practice of medicine needs sound knowledge, analytical ability and specific skills in respective areas. It’s a great challenge to produce high quality health care providers at all levels. We need the teachers and academicians to develop such human resources in health. In this regard, the country has a lot of expectation from all of you,” Shri Nadda elaborated.

Highlighting the reforms initiated by the Ministry, Shri J P Nadda stated that the Government has increased the age of retirement of doctors to 65 and is setting up of more medical and nursing schools. He further said that the government is also multi-skilling doctors to overcome the shortage of specialists. Shri Nadda said that the introduction of National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) would benefit students’ fraternity across the country as they will not have to appear in multiple entrance exams and such an exam will lead to greater transparency, reduce the burden on prospective students, mitigate litigation in various courts of law with respect to the examination process and ensure better standards of Medical Education.

Shri Nadda further said that suitable amendments have also been carried out in the Graduate Medical Education Regulations and Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations for making common counseling for admission in Medical Colleges mandatory and existing medical colleges are being upgraded by setting up of Super Specialty Blocks in 70 such medical colleges in the entire country.

“We are expanding the network of our medical colleges in a big way by upgrading 58 district hospitals to medical colleges. 24 more new Medical Colleges have been announced in this year’s budget. 20 State Cancer Institutes and 50 Tertiary Cancer Care Centers are also being set up. The government’s vision is delivery of high quality tertiary care services to our citizens,” Shri Nadda stated.

Degrees were awarded to the 116 students of which 91 were MD/MS students and 25 were DM/MCh super-specialty students. 9 Gold Medals were awarded to the students in the department of Cardiology (DM), Urology (MCh), Burn & Plastic Surgery (MCh), General Surgery (MS), Paediatric (MD), General Medicine (MD), Anaesthesiology (MD), Super Speciality Gold Medal Post Doctorate (MD/MCh) and Gynaecology (MS).

                Ministry of Health and Family Welfare organized a National consultation with States/UTs to seek feedback on draft guidelines for implementing PMRSSM, on 23rd April, 2018 at New Delhi. The workshop was attended by CEOs of the State Health Agency, State Nodal Officers and Senior IT officials of the state agencies.  Most of the States participated in the consultations, except for few like Delhi & West Bengal.

The consultation was inaugurated by Ms Preeti Sudan, Secretary MoHFW and Mr. Indu Bhushan, CEO (designate), PMRSSM. Mr. Manoj Jhalani, Additional Secretary-MD, NHM, also participated in the inaugural session. 

Secretary, MoHFW, while welcoming the participants, briefed the states on the broad contours of the mission and encouraged increased participation from the states. The CEO (designate), PMRSSM highlighted the importance of the mission in the Indian healthcare landscape and the need to focus on its successful implementation. Mr. Indu Bhushan mentioned that States would get ample flexibility to contextualize the scheme based on their local needs. He stressed the importance of Additional Data Collection Drive being undertaken during Ayushman Bharat Diwas on 30th April, alongside the awareness generation activities. 

The states were divided into three sub groups to ensure detailed deliberations and seek in-depth inputs on the draft set of guidelines. This included guidelines on beneficiary identification process, empanelment of hospitals, portability of the benefits, model tender document, modalities of premium release and other related aspects. Based on the inputs received from the states, each sub group presented the summary of proposed changes and inputs they had suggested during the discussion. 

Based on the feedback received from states, Ministry will release model RFP (Request for Proposal) and operational guidelines latest by 2nd Week of May. Most States were keen to release their RFP in the May month itself.  

Each state also shared the roadmap and the progress made for the implementation of the mission. All states showed their keenness to join the mission. The states shared their individual timelines.

                “Kayakalp has been instrumental in inculcating a sense of ‘ownership’ amongst all stake holders. This sense of ‘ownership’ has translated into “commitment for Swachhta.’’ This was stated by Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfareduring the national felicitation ceremony of Kayakalp awardees (2017-18) for their work in maintaining high standards of sanitation and hygiene in public health facilities, here today.

 

SmtAnupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, SmtPreeti Sudan, Secretary (Health), ShriParameswaranIyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and Dr. Promila Gupta, DGHS, were also present at the event.

 

ShriNadda congratulated the awardees and said that cleanliness is no more a one-time activity but is integrated in our day-to-day practices and has become a habit. Kayakalp has played a pivotal role in gaining trust and confidence of community in public health facilities.He further added that the zest and zeal shown by the hospitals and their collective efforts in improving cleanliness, hygiene and infection control practices should continue unabated. 

 

Referring to the ICT based application ‘MeraAspataal (My Hospital)’ that captures patients’ feedback about their experience in the health facilities on the services that they received or sought to receive, ShriNadda said that about 1000 government hospitals are now connected and patients can now give  their feedback on various aspects of healthcare services including cleanliness, housekeeping, behavior of the hospital staff, etc. “We are now making a paradigm shift by seeking their views on quality of experience in a public healthcare facility. This will help us improving the experience of people at a health facility and will also increase the accountability of the public health systems,” ShriNadda elaborated.

 

The Union Health Minister further stated that health is at the centre-stage with the launch of Ayushman Bharat. He said that National Health Protection Mission (NHPM) will protect around 50 crore people (from about 10 crore families) and at the same time Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) will deliver comprehensive primary health care. “The H&WC would provide preventive, promotive, and curative care for non-communicable diseases, dental, mental, geriatric care, palliative care, etc. He further stated that the Government has initiated universal screening of common NCDs such as diabetes, hypertension and common cancers, which will eventually help in reducing the disease burden.

Speaking at the function, SmtAnupriya Patel stated that maintenance of the hygiene and cleanliness of health facilities is not only related to aesthetics and patient satisfaction, but it also reduces the incidence of Hospital Acquired Infections. She further stated that the Health Ministry is collaborating with other Ministries to ensure that the goals of sanitation and cleanliness are achieved. 

 

The Health Ministers gave away the awards to the winners under various categories. Under the Central Government Hospitals Acategory, the first prize of Rs2.5 Crore was given to the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER),Chandigarh was judged as the runner-upin this category with Rs. 1.5 crore prize money.Commendation Award of Rs. 50 Lakh was given to JIPMER, Puducherry along with Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi.

                “Convergence between Ministries, States and stakeholders is critical to achievements of shared goals for health of women, children and adolescents.”  This was stated by Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare at the curtain raiser event for the 2018 Partners’ Forum, a global event which will provide a unique platform for learning and exchange between countries on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCH+A). Speaking at the function, Shri Nadda further stated that the Government is committed to collaboration for expanding universal health coverage for women, adolescents and children.

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Smt. Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Smt. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health), Dr Michelle Bachelet, former President of the Republic of Chile and incoming board chair of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH), Ms. Priyanka Chopra, Partners’ Forum Champion and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and Dr Aparajita Gogoi, National Coordinator, White Ribbon Alliance were also present at the occasion, along with other senior officials, advocates and experts.

Highlighting the achievements of the Ministry, Shri J P Nadda said that we have accelerated our progress towards our target of 90% full immunization coverage. Earlier the increase in full immunization coverage was 1% per year which has increased to 7% per year through ‘Mission Indradhanush’.  “We have launched the Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI), the special drive will focus on improving immunization to more than 90% by December 2018,” Shri Nadda said. The Union Health Minister further stated that India is officially acknowledged as being Yaws-free and has been validated for Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination (MNTE).

Shri Nadda further said that Ayushman Bharat-National Health Protection Mission (NHPM) is a major step towards Universal Health Coverage. It will benefit around 50 crore people (from about 10 crore families) by providing coverage from secondary and many tertiary hospitalizations. Shri Nadda also informed the participants that to provide comprehensive primary care, the Government will transform 1.5 lakh sub health centres to Health and Wellness Centres (HWC). “The Ministry is now moving towards provision of comprehensive primary care through the Health and Wellness Centres”, he said. He further stated that in a step towards provision of comprehensive primary care, the Government has initiated universal screening of common NCDs such as diabetes, hypertension and common cancers at the sub-centre and Primary Health Centre. “This will enable the strengthening of preventive and promotive health, improve patient referral and access to secondary care services, Shri Nadda added. Shri Nadda also highlighted India’s commitment to RMNCH+A through policy and programmes, including the new school health programme and implementation of UHC that drives progress within this strategic framework. 

Underscoring the importance of the 2018 Partners’ Forum, Dr Michelle Bachelet said that cross-sectoral and multi-stakeholder partnerships were vital to push forward for progress on improved health at every life stage. Dr Bachelet emphasized the need for global sharing of best practices and technical expertise at the civil society, academic, private sector and governmental levels to change public discourse and lead society into adopting innovative methods to resolve issues and improve health indicators in children, adolescents and women. She introduced the 12 Success Factors case studies of best practice RMNCH+A programmes and initiatives which will be launched at the 2018 Partners’ Forum, including Intensified Mission Indradhanush. 

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare said that quality, equity and dignity in healthcare are the core concepts addressed in the National Health Policy and that will drive progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Shri Choubey stated that by ensuring the quality of maternal and newborn care in health facilities, preventable maternal and infant deaths can be ended by 2030, as envisioned by the EWEC Global Strategy to which India is committed. 

Smt. Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, said that sanitation, hygiene and menstrual health of girls are high on Government agenda. She further stated that multi-sectoral collaboration is what stands out in the push for progress towards improved RMNCH+A outcomes. Gender inequalities and discrimination have clearly established effects on RMNCH+A outcomes, and these must be explicitly weaved in all discussion around women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health. 

Ms. Priyanka Chopra highlighted the importance of a healthy childhood with good quality health care as it sets the course for positive adolescence, adulthood and parenthood. “We need to give girls the same opportunities as boys if we want them to be healthy and successful”, she said. She further stated that across the world, girls have become community leaders due to the support of the community. “Let’s start valuing the girl child. I hope that by lending my voice I can make a difference to their lives,” Ms Priyanka Chopra added.

The 2018 Partners’ Forum will be held in New Delhi on 12 and 13 December 2018. It will be a unique platform for learning and exchange for the alliance of 1,000 organizations to align objectives, strategies and resources, and agree on interventions to improve maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health. The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health is an alliance of organisations in 77 countries from the sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health communities, as well as health influencing sectors. 

Also present during the function were senior officers of the Ministry, representatives of PMNCH partners, as well as leading advocates, implementers and experts on maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health.

                Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare inaugurated the 69th Foundation Day celebrations of the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute (VPCI), here today. At the function, the Union Health Minister released a compendium on the list of Research Publications of VPCI from 1949-2017 and also unveiled the ‘Daily Digital Pollen Count Information for Public’. Prof Randeep Guleria, Director AIIMS, New Delhi and Prof. Yogesh K Tyagi, Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi, were also present at the event.

At the function, Shri J P Nadda said that the Government has rolled out a new `National Strategic Plan (NSP)’ to End TB by 2025 and VPCI and the Ministry should work together towards achieving this target. The target of eliminating TB by 2025 is quite ambitious. We are aiming to reach 3 million TB patients which means we would reach out to additional 1.1 million missing patients. I expect a major role to be played by the Institute in achieving success in this ambitious goal of Ending TB by 2025 as they have rich experience in the field of chest infections, he said.

Shri J P Nadda further said that the Government is transforming 1.5 lakh sub-centres into health and wellness centres to provide comprehensive primary health care as close to the community as possible, enable universal screening of five common non-communicable diseases to promote early detection, encourage lifestyle modifications, and ensure treatment and adherence to treatment. “VPCI can contribute by developing awareness programmes on chest infections that can be embedded in these health and wellness centres,” the Union Health Minister elaborated.

Shri J P Nadda further stated that the Government has announced Ayushman Bharat- National Health Protection Mission (NHPM) that will cover over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) providing coverage upto 5 lakh rupees per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. “More than 1300 packages are included in NHPM and VPCHI with their experience in chest infections can contribute in these packages, he said. Shri J P Nadda also assured all support to the Institute for exploring international collaborations with reputed institutions around the globe.

Also present at the function were Prof. Raj Kumar, Director, VPCI and Prof. Kavita Gulati, Faculty member of VPC, along with other senior officers and faculty of VPCI.

                The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has notified new sets of specified health warnings for all tobacco product packs by making an amendment in the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labeling) Rules, 2008 vide GSR 331(E) dated 3rd April 2018 “Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labeling) Second Amendment Rules, 2018”. The amended Rules will be applicable w.e.f. 1st September 2018. 

The new set of specified health warnings shall be-


	Image-1, which shall be valid for a period of twelve months following its commencement.

One of the most important key features of the new set of specified health warnings will include telephone Quit-line number “QUIT TODAY CALL 1800-11-2356”. This will help in creating awareness among tobacco users, and give them access to counseling services to effect behavior change. It is also likely to lead to an increase in demand for tobacco cessation. Further, now the same set of warning images shall be on both smoking and smokeless forms of tobacco products.

The toll free Tobacco Quit-line Services [1800-11-2356] provides counseling and strategies for quitting tobacco use. As per the recent second round of Global Adult Tobacco Survey [GATS -2, 2016-17] conducted in the age group 15 years and above, 61.9% of current cigarette smokers, 53.8% of current bidi smokers and 46.2% of current smokeless tobacco users thought about quitting because of warning label on packets of cigarette, bidi and smokeless tobacco.

The said notification along with printable version of warnings is available on the Ministry’s website i.e. www.mohfw.gov.in. Printable versions of the new warnings in all regional languages shall also soon be made available on Ministry’s website. In view of the above, it is informed that before the new set of specified health warning come into force from 1st September, 2018, the existing specified health warnings on tobacco product packs shall be continued till 31st August, 2018, as per amendment made in the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labeling) Rules, 2008 vide GSR 283 (E) dated 26th March 2018.

                Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi addressed heads and senior officials of around 331 Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) at the CPSE Conclave-Vision 2022 in New Delhi today. This was the first time in 75 years that a conclave of all CPSEs was held. Speaking on this occasion the Prime Minister said that CPSEs are the wealth of nation and will be an important catalyst to fulfil the vision of New India by 2022. The Prime Minister went on to say that with this Conclave a new beginning is being made by CPSEs to transform themselves into Profit and Social Benefit Generating Enterprises. The Prime Minister outlined three mantras for CPSEs- Incentives, Imagination and Institution building in order to bring about this transformation. Unique incentives, not necessarily financial, will energize the public enterprises. Imagination will bring about technological changes for which leadership is required and institution building will transform the public enterprises from Maharatna into New India Ratna Enterprises. 

The Prime Minister went on to give a formula of 5 Ps which will prepare the CPSEs to compete with the best companies in the world-Performance, Process, Persona, Procurement and Preparedness. In a few years, India will become a 5 trillion dollar economy andthis will be possible due to the collective efforts of all CPSEs which will be the third arm of revenue generation for the India’s GDP. 

Prime MinisterModi put forth five challenges and asked for roadmaps with measurable targets to be prepared within 100 days towards fulfilling the vision of New India by 2022. The five challenges put forth by the Prime Minister are:


	How will the CPSEs increase their Geo Strategic Reach?
	How will CPSEs will reduce India’s import bill?
	How will CPSEs work in coordination with each other for innovation and research?
	How will CPSEs use CSR funds for the 115 aspirational districts, which are to be brought on par with national indices?
	What new model CPSEs will offer to the development of New India?


The Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Anant Geete welcomed the Prime Minister at the Conclave. The Minister of Statefor Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, Babul Supriyo along with Secretaries of Ministries of Government of India and other top officers were present on this occasion.

                A five-day Day training programme, aimed at enhancing the preparedness of Airport Emergency Handlers (AEHs) to respond to CBRN emergencies at the airports, concluded today at the Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Airport in Patna. The training programme was conducted in collaboration with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS). 

CBRN emergencies pertain to threats emanating due to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear material. 

During the training, NDMA jointly with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) also conducted its first-ever full-scale Biological Management Emergency Exercise. The exercise was based on a suspected Ebola outbreak scenario. ""Biological emergencies are extremely complicated to handle and require utmost expertise not only in handling the victims but also in screening them before they escape out in community"", said Dr. Saurabh Dalal, NDMA.

Shri Alok Kumar, Deputy Commandant, NDRF, said that mock drills with simulated situations of biological disasters are conducted by the NDRF regularly to fine tune the response mechanism in case of threats arising out of usage of biological agents.

Stakeholders from several departments, including Airport Management, Health and Medical services, Customs, Immigration, Fire Services, State Disaster Management Authority and Disease Surveillance units participated in the mock exercise.  

Shri U. K. Mishra, Member, Bihar State Disaster Management Authority (BSDMA), Shri Vijay Sinha, Commandant, 9th Battalion, NDRF, Shri Pushkar Sahay, NDMA and Shri Rajender Singh Lahauria, Airport Director, Patna, attended the valedictory function and congratulated the participants.

                A multi-State mock exercise on earthquake was conducted by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in three North Eastern States of Tripura, Nagaland and Mizoram today for assessing the preparedness and response mechanism of the State Governments in a disaster situation. The exercise was conducted in collaboration with the respective State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs).

The exercise simulated the 1897 Shillong earthquake measuring 8.7 on the Richter Scale, which had devastated the entire Shillong plateau and affected the whole of northeast.

The simulation exercise was conducted simultaneously in all districts across the three States at select locations, including hospitals, shopping malls, schools and high-rise residential buildings to assess and improve the administration’s capacity in mobilising resources and reaching out to the affected communities swiftly.

The exercise started with sirens indicating the occurrence of tremors. Everybody ducked under the tables while covering their heads. Once the tremors stopped, evacuation drills were conducted. Soon afterwards, State Emergency Operation Centres (SEOCs) were activated.

Simultaneously, EOCs at the districts also got activated, assessed the damage, formed rescue teams under Incident Commanders and dispatched them to the respective locations. Rescue drills were conducted in coordination with various agencies, such as Traffic control, Fire Fighting department, Ambulances, Police and Civil Defence. People buried under the rubble were rescued and sent to hospitals after administering first aid and triage.

Afterwards, NDMA experts carried out post-exercise analyses, wherein independent observers from the Army shared their feedback and suggested ways to further streamline response mechanisms.

""Mock exercises strengthen the capacity and response mechanisms of all stakeholders. These also help improve coordination among various agencies, which is the key to a successful post-disaster response,"" said Lt. Gen. N.C. Marwah (Retd.), Member, NDMA. 

Today’s exercise was preceded by orientation-cum-coordination conferences and tabletop exercises in all the participating States to ensure the smooth facilitation of the exercise.

This exercise is significant as the entire North East is located in the seismic zone V. n earthquake can cause major damage in terms of lives and infrastructure. This mock drill will ensure better response in the event of a disaster to reduce loss of lives. It will also generate awareness among the local population who are the first responders in case of any disaster.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) conducted table-top exercises at Tripura and Nagaland today (April 25, 2018), and at Mizoram yesterday (April 24, 2018). These exercises were held in the run-up to the mock exercise on earthquake preparedness to be held in these North Eastern States tomorrow (April 26, 2018). 

Concerned officers from all districts and stakeholder departments participated in the exercise. The districts confirmed that their Disaster Management Plans (DMPs) had been updated, Response Teams identified and other preparations for the exercise had been put in place. This was followed by presentations by various stakeholder departments. 

The table-top exercises were conducted based on scenarios created in collaboration with State Departments as per seismic mapping and other related hazards. 

Independent observers were briefed about their role and standard feedback forms were given to them. Sites for the mock exercise and administrative arrangements were finalised. 

Earlier, Coordination-cum-Orientation Conferences were also held to ensure the smooth facilitation of the mock exercise, which is being conducted by NDMA in collaboration with the State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs). 

The National Disaster Guidelines significantly focuses on Prevention, Mitigation and Preparedness for a disaster situation. In its efforts towards improving the management of a disaster situation, NDMA has so far conducted more than 600 mock exercises across the country on various disasters.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) will conduct a mock exercise on earthquake preparedness in three North Eastern States - Tripura, Nagaland, Mizoram - on April 26, 2018. The exercise, which is being held in collaboration with the respective State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs), will help participating agencies and stakeholders in evaluating the  effectiveness of their disaster response plans. 

This exercise is significant as the participating States fall under seismic vulnerability zone V. 

In the run-up to the exercise, orientation-cum-coordination conferences were held on April 12, 2018 at the State Capitals for working out the detailed modalities and preparations required for the Mock Exercise. Concerned officials from various stakeholder departments such as the Army, Health, Police, Firefighting, Civil Defense, Transport, Electricity, Public Relations and Traffic Control attended these preparatory conferences. 

Preparedness measures required to be taken at individual, societal and institutional levels to minimise the effects of an earthquake were discussed. NDMA experts briefed the stakeholders on the Incident Response System (IRS), which attributes roles and responsibilities at each level to improve coordination. This helps enhance preparedness and ensure a swift response by reducing adhocism in response. 

Table Top Exercises will be conducted in all the three States before the actual mock exercise. The mock exercise will be followed by a detailed debriefing session where gaps and shortcomings, if any, for improving preparedness will be discussed. Independent observers will be deployed to monitor the entire exercise.

The exercise will help in filling gaps, ensuring better communication and improving coordination among various stakeholders and agencies. It will also generate awareness among the local population about the Do's and Don'ts to be followed before, during and after an earthquake. 

Capacity building and improving disaster preparedness is an ongoing exercise. NDMA has so far conducted more than 600 mock exercises for various disaster situations across the country in its efforts to improve preparedness and response during for various disaster situations.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is conducting a basic training programme at the Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Airport in Patna. The five-day training programme, aimed at enhancing the preparedness of Airport Emergency Handlers (AEHs) to respond to CBRN emergencies at the airports, started today.

CBRN emergencies pertain to threats emanating due to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear material. 

The training programme is being conducted in collaboration with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS). 

Earlier, four such programmes have already been conducted - one each in Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai and Varanasi.         

The programme consists of lectures as well as field training, including live demonstrations of detection and decontamination including use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Apart from equipping the airport emergency handlers to handle CBRN emergencies, the training programme will also enable them to provide medical first aid and initial psycho-social support. 

Experts from the domain departments viz. Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), INMAS, NDMA, etc. will deliver lectures and hold demonstrations on various areas related to CBRN emergency management. 

A total of 200 personnel will be trained on various aspects of CBRN emergencies. This includes sensitization of 150 working level staff in a half day module.

A team of NDRF, trained for CBRN emergency, is posted in Patna and their expertise will also be utilized in the programme.

                Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh held a meeting with Shri N K Singh, Chairman of the 15th Finance Commission and members of the Commission on 19.04.18. Ministers of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir and Shri Kiren Rijiju, Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba and Senior Officers from MHA were present during the meeting.

 A presentation was made during the meeting which stressed that the responsibilities of Ministry of Home Affairs have increased manifold in meeting the diverse and varied internal security challenges, even though ‘public order’ and ‘police’ are constitutional responsibilities of states. The capabilities of states alone are not adequate to meet the threats of insurgency and terrorism which have national and international links, it added.

Shri Rajnath Singh pointed out that MHA also has other challenges that include – improving sense of security amongst the public, making vulnerable sections such as women and children safer, improving effectiveness of police, meeting cyber threats, providing immediate relief and rehabilitation during natural disasters etc.

He said due to concerted and coordinated efforts of the Central Government and the State Governments, there has been a significant and steady improvement in the overall security situation in the hinterland, in the North-Eastern States and in the areas affected by Left-Wing Extremism. But relentless efforts are needed to be made continuously in order to consolidate the gains and spread successes in the new areas, he added.

The Finance Commission was briefed about the various schemes being implemented by the MHA, which require continued capital expenditure such as Modernisation of Police Forces (MPF), Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), Immigration, visa, Foreigners Registration and Tracking (IVFRT), Coastal security, border infrastructure, Integrated Check Posts. Further capital investment is also required to make appropriate use of new technologies for cyber security, border management etc.

Accordingly, the Ministry has projected budgetary requirement of more than 3,50,000 crores for the period 2020-2025 for internal security, Central Armed Police Forces, police modernization, Border security, disaster management and Union Territories. A detailed memorandum will be submitted later.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said that the Union Territory of Diu is on the way to soon emerge among the league of Smart Cities. Addressing a function after inaugurating and laying foundation of various development projects in Diu today, Shri Rajnath Singh said the tiny Union Territory was selected for the Smart Cities Project during the final phase of bidding and is today on the verge of realising this dream. A total of Rs. 1,400 crores would be spent under this project, of which Rs 701 crores would be the contribution of Government. 

He said that some of the important projects to be undertaken under the scheme are:


	Construction of a continuous coastal promenade connecting Ghogla-Jalandhar-Chadrika Mata beach- upto Chakratirth beach
	Development of an all-inclusive Mobile App for the convenience of tourists for online room reservation, ticket booking, parking etc.

Some other projects would be taken up under PPP mode and/or through other Government schemes under the Smart Cities programme. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said that unprecedented development has taken place in Diu during the last four years. Fund allocation has jumped fifty percent in four years from 103 crores in 2013-14 to Rs 150 crores in 2017-18. He pointed out that the Central Government is responsible for the development of Union Territories and has completed several development projects during the last four years. Enumerating some of them, Shri Rajnath Singh highlighted establishment of solar power projects of combined capacity of 9 MW which made Diu a power surplus district. Further, there is a proposal to set up windmill power project. He announced that as part of developing a new education hub, three educational institutions, - Diu College, Polytechnic College and a Food Craft Institute - will begin academic sessions from 2018-19. He also expressed confidence that the construction of a four lane highway connecting Somnath and Diu will be completed soon, which will give a fillip to the tourism sector in the region.

He added that for the benefit of a large number of fishermen living in Diu, the length of jetties has been increased by 500 metres and a parking harbour of 175 metres in length and 85 metres wide was also built in Vanakbara village.

During the visit, Shri Rajnath Singh laid foundation for the following projects: -


	Construction of a pile jetty in Vanakbara village at a cost of Rs.3.77 crores.
	Building of an Annexe Circuit House at a cost of Rs. 20.60 crores
	Establishment of first phase of sewerage network, including a common sewage treatment plant, in Diu costing Rs.20.70 crores
	New school buildings at Kamleshwar, Zampa and Ghoghla.


He also inaugurated the 450 metres long Jogging Track in Ghoghla built at a cost of Rs.4.37 crores which was built using tensile roof structure and weatherproof materials.

Shri Rajnath Singh reiterated that the Government is committed to the development of poor and backward communities. He informed that a campaign has been launched coinciding with the Birth Anniversary of Dr. BR Ambedkar on 14th April that will run till 5th May during which officials of the Central Government will monitor progress of the various development projects being undertaken for the welfare of the marginalized communities.

                Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh today reiterated the government’s commitment for the development of marginalized communities and inaugurated several development projects in the Union Territory of Dadra Nagar Haveli. 

Highlighting the natural advantages of beauty and greenery of Dadra-Nagar Haveli, Shri Rajnath Singh said it could be a very good destination for tourists.  In addition, because of its proximity to Mumbai, Dadra-nagar haveli has the potential to be a centre of industrial development as well as a hub for film-making as the industrial electric tariff here is very low than other states. Further, there is a single window permission system and proximity to trade routes which makess many new avenues of development possible.

The Union Home Minister informed that a campaign titled ‘Gram Swaraj Abhiyan Yojana’ has been launched coinciding with the birth anniversary of Dr. B. R.  Ambedkar on 14th April that will run until 5th May during which officials of the Central government will make field visits and monitor progress of various development schemes launched for the benefit of marginalized communities. Among these schemes are Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Ghar Yojna (Soubhagya). 

Shri Rajnath Singh expressed satisfaction that so far 11,437 people have benefitted under Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana.  Further 300 more households will be added to the beneficiaries after relaxation of scheme guidelines. 

He inaugurated several development projects and welfare schemes as enumerated below: 


	Swabhiman Scheme: The Scheme aims to provide nutritious and balanced diet to pregnant women, lactating mothers and school going girls in the age group of 11-14 years.   Launching the Scheme, Shri Rajnath Singh said that it will benefit approximately 6,000  women who constitute 80 percent of the target group in Dadra-Nagar Haveli, suffering from malnutrition and anemia.
	Silvassa Sports Complex: Coupled with Silvasasa stadium and Sayali Cricket stadium, the new Sports Complex will encourage various sports including Swimming, Squash, Table-tennis, Snooker and Billiards on par with international standards. The Union Home Minister expressed hope that this Sports Complex, built at a cost of 6.95 crore rupees, will inculcate healthy life style and passion for sports. 
	Labour Housing Complex (Sparsh): Under this project, 48 good quality flats (45,000 sq. m. area) at a cost of Rs. 5.5 crore were built by Omnibus Industrial Development Corporation under the CSR scheme of various industries. The Union Home minister said that the houses would alleviate  housing problem of workers coming from all over the country and contribute to the success of Make in India scheme.
	Sewerage System Scheme (Phase-II part-2) in Silvassa- Amli town:   He said that the scheme is aimed at providing sewage facilities for the central area as well as outskirts by establishing four pumping stations and some other works at a cost of Rs. 15.59 Crore.
	Expansion of sewage Treatment Plant: Under the scheme, the capacity of the existing sewage treatment plant in Silvassa-Amli will be expanded to treat 5 MLD sewage more. to cover needs of the increasing population until 2026.
	Expansion of Silvassa- Amli water supply scheme to meet needs of growing population upto the year 2046  at a cost of Rs. 37.61 Crores. 
	High level Bridge at Kauncha:  Shri Rajnath Singh said, several villages including Kauncha, Jamalpada, Gunsa, Dudhani etc. do not have direct connectivity and people of these areas are suffering in times of medical emergencies.  Currently they are using a ferry boat service  which is not sufficient to meet daily travel needs of students and vehicles. The proposed high level bridge will improve connectivity to the neighbouring villages in Gujarat also by providing inter-state connectivity to Tukwada in Gujarat, Nasik, Triambhakeshwar  and Shirdi in Maharashtra.  The bridge is planned to be 900 metres long and 10.5 metre wide. It will cost Rs. 54.73 Crore.


Shri Rajnath Singh expressed confidence that these development schemes will add to the development of the region and improve the quality of life of the people.

                The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has been implementing the ‘National Policy and Action Plan’ since 2015 to combat Left Wing Extremism (LWE). This envisages a multi-pronged strategy involving security and development related measures.

The significant features of the new policy were zero tolerance towards violence coupled with a big push to developmental activities so that benefits of development reached the poor and vulnerable in the affected areas. 

MHA had categorized 106 districts in 10 states as Left Wing Extremism affected. These districts are covered under the Security Related Expenditure Scheme (SRE) of the MHA for the purpose of reimbursement of security related expenditure like transportation, communication, hiring of vehicles, stipend for surrendered Maoists, temporary infrastructure for forces etc to the states. Out of 106 districts, 35 districts which accounted for 80-90 % of country-wide LWE violence were categorized as ‘Most Affected Districts’. This categorization provided the basis for focused deployment of resources - both security and development related. Over the last few years, a number of districts have been carved into smaller districts. This has resulted in the geographical area of the 106 SRE districts to be spread over 126 districts and that of the 35 most affected districts to be expanded to 36 districts.

Over the last four years, there has been a substantial improvement in the LWE scenario. Incidents of violence have seen a 20% decline with a 34% reduction in related deaths in 2017 as compared to 2013. The geographical spread of LWE violence also shrunk from 76 districts in 2013 to just 58 districts in 2017. Besides, just 30 of these districts account for 90% of the LWE violence in the country. At the same time certain new districts have emerged as the focus of expansion by the Left Wing Extremists. 

MHA recently undertook a comprehensive exercise in consultation with the States to review the affected districts in order to ensure that the deployment of resources is in sync with the changed ground reality. Accordingly, 44 districts have been excluded and 08 new districts have been added to the list of SRE districts. 

In order to counter Maoist efforts to expand their influence in the tribal areas at the tri-junction of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, three districts of Kerala have been included in the list of SRE Districts. Despite the fact that there is hardly any violence in the new districts, the move is pre-emptive.

As a result of the exercise, 90 districts in 11 States will now be covered by the Scheme, down from 126. The list of ‘Most Affected Districts’ has been pruned to 30, down from 36. The revised categorization is a more realistic representation of the actual LWE scenario.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh launched the web-based application ‘e-FRRO’ (e-Foreigners Regional Registration Office) at a function here today. Speaking on the occasion Shri Rajnath Singh said that it has been a constant endeavour of the Home Ministry to provide fast and efficient services to foreigners visiting India so that they have a pleasant experience of their stay here. 

He said the e-FRRO scheme is aimed at building a centralized, transparent online platform for the foreigners to avail visa related services and to provide Faceless, Cashless and Paperless services to the foreigners with user friendly experience.  

The e-FRRO scheme would be a quantum jump in improving the ease of service delivery with respect to foreigners visiting and staying in India. In the new system, foreigners would be able to get as many as 27 Visa and Immigration related services in India from the comfort of their place of stay. Using the e-FRRO application, foreigners can apply online on the portal and obtain the service(s) through email/post without appearing in person at the FRO/FRRO office. 

It may be noted that the online services offered by E-FRRO scheme are not available even in some of the most advanced countries in North America and Europe.

In 2017, more than one crore foreigners visited India and out of them approximately 3.6 lakhs had to visit FRRO offices spread across the country for various visa-related services. With the launch of the online e-FRRO scheme, their physical visit to the FRRO offices thus been obviated.

 The e-FRRO scheme has been implemented on the IVFRT platform with negligible extra expenditure, taking a cue from the already successfully running e-Visa scheme. It may be noted that the e-Visa scheme has earned revenue of more than Rs 1400 crores since its launch in Nov 2014. 

Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba, Director IB Shri Rajiv Jain, senior officials of MHA, NIC, MEA and Dept of Tourism were present on the occasion.  

In the present system, foreigners staying in India on Visa duration of more than 180 days have to get themselves registered with their respective FROs/FRROs. Similarly, foreigners requiring different kind of visa related services such as Visa extension, Visa Conversion, Change of address, Change of Educational institutions, Exit permits etc are currently required to visit the FROs/FRROs office.

Some of the salient features of the e-FRRO include online FRRO Service delivery mechanism without requirement of visiting FRRO/FRO Office barring exceptional cases. Using this application, foreigners are required to create their own User ID by registering themselves. Afterwards, they can apply online through registered User-ID for various Visa and Immigration related services in India viz. Registration, Visa Extension, Visa Conversion, Exit Permit etc.

The necessary Immigration/Visa document e.g. Registration Permit/Certificate (RP/RC), Visa Extension Certificate etc will be sent by post on the address mentioned in the online application. It would also be electronically sent to the foreigner to his registered email ID. In case of exigency, the foreigner can visit the FRRO/FRO office directly for grant of service.

e-FRRO has already been implemented and is running successfully as a pilot project in four FRROs (Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai) since February 12, 2018.   Now it has been rolled out in the remaining eight FRROs, - namely Kolkata, Amritsar, Hyderabad, Cochin, Thiruvananthapuram, Calicut, Lucknow and Ahmedabad.

Advantages of e-FRRO include facilitation of legitimate foreigners through “Digital India” vision of the Government, foreigners need not visit FRRO/FRO office – “Services from the comfort of home”, convenient and Time saving, exclusive dashboard for User friendly experience and Uniform & Standardized Services across the Country.

Major changes w.r.t. current C-FRO (Centralized Foreigners Registration Office) system and e-FRRO are as under:- 


	
		
			
			Current C-FRO System 
			
			
			Proposed “e-FRRO” 
			
		
		
			
			Foreigner needs to take appointment online and visit FRRO/FRO office mandatorily.  
			
			
			
				There would not be any requirement of mandatorily visiting FRRO/FRO office. However, in certain exceptional cases, the foreigner will be intimated to visit the FRRO / FRO on scheduled date and time for interview. 
			
			
		
		
			
			Endorsement in Passport and Signed/Stamped RC/RP given to the applicant. 
			
			
			
				No endorsement in Passport. 
				Digitally signed Immigration document.
				Emphasis on online verification.
			
			
		
		
			
			Manual Interface 
			
			
			
				Online , Cashless, Paperless
			
			
		
		
			
			Lack of expertise at FRO level in dealing with foreigners. 
			
			
			
				Uniform and Standardized services through FRROs under Bureau of Immigration.
				FROs to be consulted online by FRROs.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said the Government is promoting the emergence of India as a medical destination to the world. Addressing the 127th Founder's Day Celebrations of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here today, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has taken several steps towards boosting medical tourism such as extending e-Visa to 161 countries. Besides, the MHA has extended the duration of stay on e-Visa from 30 to 60 days and also allowed triple entry in e-Medical Visa cases.

Speaking about the Health Sector, Shri Rajnath Singh said in a country of 125 crore people, providing Healthcare to All is a huge challenge. We have very skewed doctor-patient ratio. If we see Health Sector spending, it constitutes just 1.16 percent of the GDP. But we are determined to increase it significantly, at least to 2.5 percent.

Shri Rajnath Singh said given the huge income disparity in India, the Prime Minister Shri Narenda Modi introduced the Ayushman Bharat scheme to provide the best healthcare for the poor and needy. He said Ayushman Bharat is the National Health Protection Scheme, which will cover over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries), providing medical insurance cover up to Rupees 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization.

The Union Home Minister said providing universal healthcare will not be possible without the participation of the private sector. “You will agree that whereas people should get affordable healthcare they should also get universal health cover. To ensure Care and Cover both, we need huge investment in health sector. This can happen only with active contribution of private sector,” said Shri Rajnath Singh. “We see private sector in health sector as our strategic partner,” he added.

Shri Rajnath Singh said the basic rule for good health is hygiene and the Swachh Bharat Mission has been launched by the Prime Minister as the first step towards achieving the goal of universal healthcare.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said social and religious groups including NGOs and Women’s Organizations must be actively involved in deradicalization efforts. Chairing the 21st Meeting of the Governing Council of the National Foundation for Communal Harmony (NFCH) here today, despite being the second most populous country, India has been negligibly affected by radicalization. Full credit for this goes to the minorities and their religious leaders and the composite culture and traditions of our country, he added.

Shri Rajnath Singh said communal harmony is an issue that concerns not only Ministry of Home Affairs alone, but everybody has a stake in it and it is a characteristic of our entire nation. He said we should leverage the digital platform to promote communal harmony and asked for proper narratives to be developed for the social media. The Union Home Minister assured that he will visit Ajmer Sharif soon accompanied by members of NFCH Governing Council to promote the spirit of communal harmony that this shrine symbolises.

Shri Rajnath Singh said we are the fastest growing economy in the world and among the top ten largest economies in the world. As we aim to break into the top five and eventually emerge among the top three economies, our growth should not be hampered by terrorism.

Speaking on the occasion, the Union Minister for Textiles and Information & Broadcasting, Smt. Smriti Irani said the Government is committed to promote communal harmony despite certain mischievous elements attempting to create a wrong perception about the communal situation in the country. She said the NBT and Directorate of Publications Division will organise exhibitions and sale of books sensitizing communal harmony in sensitive areas.

Religious and social leaders, who are members of the NFCH Governing Council, also gave their valuable suggestions on fostering communal harmony in the country. There were various suggestions for addressing the issue of communal harmony like revisiting the role and structure of NFCH, augmentation of its budget, enhancement of inter-faith dialogues, organising international conferences, symposia, publication and exhibition of books, documentaries and television programmes and promotion of communal harmony through social media. Other suggestions included convergence of related schemes of various ministries promoting communal harmony, organizing conferences, poetic recitations and music concerts in the universities, academic institutions and in the public fora. It was also highlighted that the school children and the dropouts should be targeted for inculcating values of social harmony. 

Home Minister agreeing with the most of the suggestions decided that he would form some committees including the members of the Council to cull out actionable points for formalizing them in the form of final decisions.

                The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has asked the State Governments to take all necessary precautionary measures to prevent any untoward incident in view of the forthcoming Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14. 

The MHA has asked that patrolling should be intensified in all sensitive locations to ensure that no loss of life and property takes place and prohibitory orders may be issued wherever necessary. The advisory stressed that District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police may be asked to take all necessary steps for ensuring that law and order situation remains firmly under control in the areas of their jurisdiction. The MHA has advised them to activate community policing initiatives to ensure peace and harmony.

The communication was issued in the wake of reports of vandalism of statues in some parts of the country and violence during Bharat Bandh on April 2 and April 10.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said women are the catalysts of change in our society. Addressing the gathering after giving away the Young Women Achievers Awards 2017-18, organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), here today, Shri Rajnath Singh said a country cannot rise if half its population remains unequal. No force can stop India’s emergence as a developed country with such a vast capable, efficient and talented women workforce, he added. 

Citing the provision of 33% reservation for women in the Police Forces, the Union Home Minister said their representation in the CAPFs is increasing at a fast pace now. He said the Government has effected several structural and procedural changes to encourage women entrepreneurship. Shri Rajnath Singh said the Government has directed maximum institutional financing facilitating loan approvals for Women, Dalits, Backward and weaker sections. With women empowerment, a New India will emerge in five years, he added.

A senior official of the State Government functions as State Coordinator and coordinates with the RGI/Government of India in regard to various activities.

•The NRC update work is done under the supervision and control of the Registrar General of Citizen Registration (RGI). The administrative and operational matters are handled by the State Government as per their extant rules.

 

Major impact: 

The preparation of NRC is the most extensive citizen engaging exercise, which touches the life of every resident of Assam. It is part of the action for the fulfilment of Assam Accord and understanding arrived in a tripartite meeting held in 2005 at the level of Prime Minister. The National Register of Citizens, Assam will contain the names of genuine Indian citizens and will help the government to check illegal immigration in India.

 

Background:

The NRC Assam, the Register containing names of Indian Citizens in Assam, was prepared in 1951 as a non-statutory process by recording particulars of all the persons enumerated during 1951 Census. The Assam agitation (1979-85) against the illegal foreigners led to the signing of Assam Accord on 15th August 1985 between the Central Government, State Government, All India Students' Union (AASU) and All Assam GanSangramParishad (AAGSP), which stipulated 24th March, 1971 as the cut-off date for identification and deportation of illegal migrants from East Pakistan (Bangladesh). Accordingly, the Citizenship Act, 1955 was amended by inserting section 6A as special provisions for Assam.

In a tripartite meeting of the Central Government, State Government and AASU chaired by the Hon'ble Prime Minister in May, 2005, it was agreed to update NRC, 1951. The modalities were approved by the Government of India in consultation with the Government of Assam.

In pursuance of the Supreme Court's direction, the exercise of NRC update in Assam commenced in December 2013 to be completed over a period of three years. The Supreme Court is continuously monitoring the progress of NRC update and has given various directions from time to time.

                Modernisation of Police Forces is a continuous process and their requirement of modern weapons keeps evolving over time. The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) are provided with latest state-of-the-art weapons as per their requirement to tackle the terrorist and naxalite activities in the country. For further modernisation of the CAPFs, a Modernisation Plan-II for CAPFs is under implementation. 

So far as State Police Forces are concerned, they are primarily the responsibility of the States. However, the Government of India supplements the efforts of State Governments by providing central assistance to strengthen police infrastructure. To equip the security system with state-of-the-art technology in view of the increasing terrorist and naxalite activities in the country, the Government has approved an enhanced outlay under the umbrella scheme of “Modernisation of Police Forces (MPF)” with a total outlay of Rs. 25,061 crore. Under this umbrella scheme, a sub-scheme of “Assistance to States for Modernization of Police” with an outlay of Rs. 7,380 crore has been approved for the period from 2017-18 to 2019-20. This sub-scheme is in continuation of the scheme of Modernisation of State Police Forces. Under this sub-scheme central assistance to States is provided for acquisition of security/surveillance/communication equipments, modern weaponry, forensic equipments etc.  

This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hanraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.

      All available Electoral Rolls upto 1971 and 1951 NRC were digitized and made available in public domain, both online and offline, for the benefit of the public. As such, even in case of loss of documents by the public due to natural calamities etc., substantial data were available in public domain to enable them to submit their NRC application forms. No complaint has been received from any quarter to the effect that genuine Indian Citizens have not been able to apply for NRC due to loss of document in flood or any other natural calamities or non-availability of record.

This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.

                ‘Prisons’ is a State subject as per entry 4 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.  The administration and management of prisons is primarily the responsibility of respective State Government.  However, the Ministry of Home Affairs has advised all States and Union Territories (UTs) to make use of Aadhaar for identification of visitors to ensure that facilities are being availed by authorized individuals.  The Ministry of Home Affairs has also advised all States and UTs that prison inmates should also be Aadhaar seeded so that various aspects of day to day prison administration like production before court, return to prison, transport, health facilities, interview, free legal aid, parole, temporary release mechanism, educational/vocational training, release from prison etc. can be regulated by use of Aadhaar.   These advisories are also available on Ministry’s website viz. www.mha.gov.in

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh made a statement in the Lok Sabha today on violence during Bharat Bandh. Following is the full text of the statement:

“Madam,

Yesterday, there have been incidences of violence and arson in some parts of the country. During Bharat Bandh, 8 people lost their lives in violence. (M.P 06, U.P 01 & Rajasthan 01). During the bandh, there have been clashes between the police and the protesters.

I would like to convey my deep condolences for the people who have lost their lives.

I fully appreciate that there is widespread anger amongst the people, following the Supreme Court order. I wish to inform the house that Government of India was not party in that case. People have taken to the streets.

Through the House, I want to assure the people that there has been no dilution in whatsoever by my Government, rather after coming to power and examining the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, we have taken a decision to strengthen it. In 1995, the Government passed the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (PoA) Amendment Act. As part of the amendment to SC/ST PoA Act, new offences were added. It was observed that due to the delay in filing of charge sheet, the victims/witness who were vulnerable were influenced and silenced. In order to protect them, the provision of witness protection was introduced. The compensation payable to the victims was also enhanced. There has been a new provision where action against Government Servants shall be taken against those found negligent in implementing the Act.

I wish to assure you that our Government is fully committed to the welfare of SC/ST.

Immediately after the judgement of Supreme Court, a decision was taken by my Government to file a review petition in the Supreme Court. The Ld. Attorney General has made an appeal in the Supreme Court for an urgent hearing and the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the matter at 2 o’clock today. This shows the prompt action by Government and does not leave any doubt regarding the intention of the Government to protect the interest of the SC/ST. I wish to also inform that after the judgement of the Supreme Court on 20th  March, 2018 within the span of only six working days, without losing any time and acting swiftly, the Government has filed a review petition in the Supreme Court.

I also wish to inform that there have been widespread rumours regarding the issue of reservation which are false and baseless.

Our Government is fully committed to protect the interests of the SC/ST community. We have issued advisory to all the States to ensure that no breach of Law and Order takes place and safety of lives of citizens and properties are ensured. We have provided all assistance to the States immediately on their request. The Home Ministry is keeping a close vigil and is in constant touch with the State Governments.

Through this House, I appeal to all the citizens to maintain peace and harmony amongst themselves. I also appeal to all the Political parties to help maintain peace and harmony.”

                Shri Hardeep Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs emphasised on the importance of behavioural change in people and participation of private sector as critical to the success of the ambitious Swachh Bharat Mission that the country has embarked upon. He was speaking at the India Sanitation Conclave 2018 organised by FICCI here today. He exhorted the private sector to play an active role at grassroots level in effecting behavioural change in people like maintaining and using toilets. He said that the Swachh Bharat Mission has shown unprecedented momentum after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s clarion call for ‘Swachhta’ from the ramparts of Red Fort in 2014. He expressed happiness that the flagship scheme has become a mass revolution and has truly acquired the dimensions of a ‘Jan Andolan’. 

Underlining the efforts of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs(MoHUA) in the domain of Urban Sanitation, he said as of April 2018, there are 2050 ODF Cities with 100% door to door waste collection being practiced in 51,734 wards and around 47 lakh units of individual household latrines and 3.19 lakh seats of community and public toilets built as of March, 2018. He said that to foster a healthy competition between cities for improving cleanliness standards, MoHUA has been conducting Swachh Survekshan surveys which has grown from survey of 73 cities in 2016 to 4023 cities /towns in the latest round of Swachh Survekshan conducted from 4 January to 10 March 2018.

Sh. Puri also mentioned the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the United Nations to be achieved by 2030, particularly the SDG 6 - Ensure access and sanitation for All.  He said that achievement of the SDGs will be achieved mainly through the collective efforts of all which are effectively supplemented by the programs being implemented by the Government such as the Swachh Bharat Mission.

He congratulated the India Sanitation Coalition for bringing the private and public sector together and enabling cross learning and facilitating more effective actions for sustainable intervention in the WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) space. He also presented the ISC - FICCI Sanitation awards 2018 to individuals and institutions in various categories for their commendable work and efforts in the Sanitation sector.

                Sh. Hardeep Puri, Minister of State(I/C), Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs reiterated the Centre’s commitment for In-situ redevelopment of slums areas in Delhi to achieve the vision of housing for All. He was speaking while laying the foundation stone for the In-situ redevelopment project at Kathputli Colony in the presence of Sh. Anil Baijal, Lt. Gov of Delhi, here today.  Secretary, Housing & Urban Affairs Sh. Durga Shanker Mishra and Vice Chairman of DDA Sh. Uday Pratap Singh were also present on the occasion.  Addressing the gathering, Sh Puri stated that the project at Kathputli Colony will be not only a slum re-development project but also rekindle hope and trust between the State and similarly placed citizens in other slums. He further said that this redevelopment project, which was conceived way back in the year 2009, is finally seeing the light of the day and will provide clean, well planned and habitable units together with adequate social infrastructure to the people of Kathputli colony.  

The Minister further informed that this is one of the first re-development projects under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. As per the Agreement with the private partner in this project, the developer has to construct 2,800 EWS houses (30.5 Sq. mtr. each) and in the interim provide transit camp with 2,800 porta cabin dwelling units and other amenities/ facilities for jhuggi dwellers.  The developer will meet his cost through building and disposing of freehold flats and commercial built up area equivalent to 10% of EWS FAR on lease hold basis.   

Apart from the residential units, the project involves provision of community facilities in an area of 0.25 acres, which include Heritage/ Exhibition Museum, Kaushal Kala Vikas Kendra, Multipurpose Hall, Basti Vikas Kendra, Health Centre, Shishu Vatika, Amphitheater, essential Retail Outlets, Police Post, Religious site, Selling booths/weekly market, Art & Craft, Children’s Park and area for marriage ceremonies.  Thus, it will be a self-sufficient unit with all the facilities available to the residents within their vicinity. Adequate facilities and provisions are proposed to be provided for performance, training on the ground and to conduct their performance sessions. Along with this, display areas for their artefacts are also provided so that they can showcase and sell and even export, their art and handicrafts to visiting tourists which will enable them to earn for themselves and will help for their socio-economic upliftment.  The amphitheatre being constructed will enable the community to hold large public performances. 

DDA is implementing the project under the ambitious Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in which one of the verticals provides for in-situ rehabilitation of existing slum dwellers is undertaken using land as a resource through private participation.  The cost involved per dwelling unit is ₹ 1,12,000/-  and ₹ 30,000/- for maintenance for a period of five years.

                Diu Smart City has become the first city in India, that runs on 100% renewable energy during daytime setting a new benchmark for other cities to become clean and green. Diu had been importing 73% of its power from Gujarat until last year. It has now adopted a two-pronged approach whereby a 9 MW solar park spread over 50 hectares rocky barren land has been developed besides installing solar panels on the roof tops on 79 government buildings thereby generating 1.3 MW annually. To further enhance its solar capacity, Diu offers its residents a subsidy of Rs 10, 000-50,000 for installing 1-5KW roof top solar panels. Diu is saving about 13,000 tonnes of carbon emissions every year. Due to low-cost solar energy, power tariffs have been cut in residential category by 10% last year and 15% this year. 

To improve traffic management in Bengaluru Smart City, a prototype of an intelligent traffic management solution is currently being tested in collaboration with the Electronics City Township Authority (ELCITA). It will provide traffic information that is currently unavailable, and help improve management of commuter traffic. It involves capturing video streams from several cameras and processing them using artificial intelligence so that typical traffic management tasks such as vehicle detection, traffic density estimation and control of traffic lights can be automated for real-time performance. 

To revitalise urban public spaces and socially activating the area besides generating economic activity, Jaipur Smart City Ltd (JSCL) has planned to develop night bazaar at Chaura Rasta, in the heart of Pink city. The JSCL would register up to 700 vendors who will be allowed to set up stalls, including eateries, between 9pm and 1am. The project will provide entertainment, culture and shopping to citizens after office hours.

                The 1st regional workshop on star rating of garbage- free cities, organized by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in collaboration with the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) was inaugurated by Smt. Meenakshi Lekhi, Member of Parliament in the presence of Sh. Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA. Sh Naresh Kumar, Chairman, NDMC & Sh. V K Jindal, National Mission Director - SBM(Urban) were also present at the event. Addressing the gathering, Ms Lekhi said that a coordinated approach with decentralized solutions should be put in place for tackling the huge generation of Municipal waste in the cities. Emphasizing on the importance of public participation in making cities garbage free, she also propounded for enforcing penalties for violators of hygiene and cleanliness principles.     

Sh. Durga Shanker Mishra said that along with the annual Swachh Survekshan activity, the star rating of garbage free cities will create a healthy competition among the cities across the countries to achieve the goals of cleanliness and 100% solid waste management.  The day -long workshop was attended by over 250 Urban Local Body (ULB) officials, including Mayors and Commissioners, from New Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, Haryana and neighbouring ULBs of Uttar Pradesh. The workshop was held to familiarize and build the capacities of state and city officials and other relevant stakeholders about the newly launched Star Rating Protocol of Garbage- Free Cities by MoHUA, which is a holistic evaluation system for the entire solid waste management (SWM) value chain. 

The Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) focuses on two key objectives- eradication of open defecation and 100% scientific solid waste management (SWM) across all 4041 statutory towns and cities. To continue the momentum on scientific management of solid waste and motivate cities to achieve more cleanliness, the Star-Rating Protocol of Garbage Free Cities was launched by MoHUA on January 20, 2018.  The 7-star rating is innovatively designed on a SMART (Single metric, Measurable, Achievable, Rigorous verification and Targeted towards outcomes) approach – making it the first-of-its kind rating tool for assessing cleanliness of cities and towns in India. The system, based on 12 parameters, builds on the spirit of healthy competition among cities and the aspirations of cities to progress towards higher standards of “Swachhata” and its sustainability. This was the first in a series of 17 workshops scheduled to be held across all states by June 2018 to institutionalize the protocol towards a Garbage Free India. 

 

STAR RATING OF GARBAGE FREE CITIES -Parameters of star rating system

It is a single metric rating system, based on 12 parameters:

 


	Door-to- Door Collection
	Segregation at source
	Sweeping of public, commercial and residential areas (no visible eyesores on


streets)


	Waste Storage Bins, Litter Bins and material recovery facility
	Bulk Waste Generators compliance
	Scientific Waste Processing, Scientific Landfilling and C&D Waste Management
	User Fees, Penalties, Spot Fines for littering and Enforcement of Ban on Plastic
	Citizen grievance redressal and feedback system
	Eradication of crude dumping of garbage and dump remediation
	Cleaning of storm drains and surface of water bodies
	Waste Reduction
	Visible beautification in the city.


Key Features of 7-star rating-Designed on a SMART approach: 


	SINGLE METRIC - Rating criteria encapsulates all components of MSWM as well as plastic waste, waste in drains and water bodies
	MEASURABLE - Criteria under each star rating has measurable parameters (e.g.% of HHs covered by D2D collection, % of waste processed, etc.)
	ACHIEVABLE - Each criteria and associated parameter has been devised to ensure that it is realistically achievable by cities.
	RIGOROUS VERIFICATION - Robust 2-step verification mechanism of both self-declaration and third party verification. Cities rated 1, 2 and 4-star must carry out self-assessment and self-verification, while 3-star, 5-star and 7-star cities will need to be certified through an independent third party. Moreover, a city should be ODF before going for 3-star and above certification.
	TARGETED TOWARDS OUTCOMES – Based on verifiable outcomes rather than inputs and processes (e.g. remediation of dumpsites, regular sweeping, collection of user charges, etc.)


 

Strengths of star rating protocol 


	Outcome-based tool rather than process based, hence will enable institutionalization of good practices such as source segregation, scientific waste processing, penalties &amp; spot fines for littering, and compliance of bulk waste generators, etc.
	Designed to enable cities to gradually evolve into a model (7-star) city, with progressive improvements in their overall cleanliness.
	At the 7-star level, 3R components of 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) incorporated.

                Shri Hardeep Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs has launched Smart Imprest Cards & e- Measurement Book ( e-MB) on PFMS portal  for CPWD, here today.  Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary, M/o HUA, officials of Ministry of Finance and banks were also present at the launch function. With the launch of e-MB module on PFMS Portal in CPWD, this will be the first integrated web based module in Civil Ministries to monitor both the financial progress i.e. utilization of funds   along with related physical progress captured as per  schedule of  various items of works through e-MB in all  projects/works undertaken by CPWD.

The launch of Smart Imprest cards with end to end digitization of entire process introduced for the first time in Civil Ministry will enable maximization of Digital payments   to achieve ultimately 100% digitization of payments in MoHUA thereby also fulfilling objectives of Digital India mission. The Smart Imprest cards are proposed to be introduced in more than 400 offices of Ministry spread all over the country.  Three accredited banks i.e Axis bank for main Ministry, SBI for CPWD and IDBI bank for Printing are partnering with MoHUA for this roll out on all India basis.  

Government’s major construction organization Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has undergone a major digital transformation. This has been done by networking of all the 400 field offices of CPWD across the country by rolling out a special integrated web based system of Public Financial Management System (PFMS) ensuring digital payments and accounting w.e.f July 2017.   With this, CPWD has become the first organization of any civil ministry to become 100% digital at the field level.  

CPWD executes around 15,000 Projects/works across the country involving annual payments of 15,000- 20000 crores every year by its 400 field offices located all over the country  including  Remote, Hilly and North-Eastern parts. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has evolved a special CDDO module of PFMS for CPWD which was developed by PFMS team of Controller General of Accounts (CGA), Ministry of Finance.  CDDO module of PFMS is an advanced online web based end-to-end integrated system/solution of e-payments (digital), e-accounting with Management Information System.  This module enables real time monitoring of expenditure in respect of all CPWD projects thereby ensuring efficient utilization of funds along with greater transparency and accountability in expenditure.  

            After digitization of CPWD Payments in July/August 2017, a process was initiated to digitize the Schedule of Agreements and Measurement Book to track physical progress of works/projects implemented by CPWD. A special integrated portal of e- Measurement Book module on PFMS has been evolved by office of CCA in MoHUA in consultation with CPWD which has been developed by PFMS team of CGA   to enable online real time monitoring of physical progress of any work/project undertaken by any CPWD division in the country.  A Pilot run of e- MB module for all projects costing more than 15 lakhs has been implemented in all CPWD Divisions in Delhi region. Based on its success and stabilization, it is proposed to roll out E-MB module in all 400 CPWD offices in the country. 

This is the first integrated web based module in Civil Ministries to monitor and track both the financial progress i.e. utilization of funds along with related physical progress captured through e-MB as per schedule of various items of works in CPWD works/projects.  Considering Government of India’s emphasis of transitioning from mere “Outlays” to result oriented “Outputs and   Outcomes”, this web based e-MB module will facilitate better comprehensive results based monitoring of CPWD works/projects on a real time basis.

CPWD became the first field Organization in Civil Ministries to achieve 100% digitization of payments in July 2017 on web based PFMS portal with coverage of all its 400 field offices spread in the country.  Consequent to digitization of payments in CPWD done in July 2017, around 97% of payments made in MoHUA were through cashless/digital mode. However around 2-3% payments were made through issue of cheques. This included around 8000 ‘B’ category cheques issued for Imprest related cash payments. To maximize cash less transaction in the M/o Housing and Urban Affairs and achieve 100% digitization of payments, it has been decided to discontinue issue of Cheque payments.  Further as a step forward, it has been decided to introduce Smart Imprest Cards in lieu of ‘B’ Category cheques earlier used for Imprest payments.

In this age of data exploding from every nook and  corner, many would google every piece of information and hence it is important to be credible.  .

                Electronic-Challan-cum-Return (ECR) is a monthly return filed by the employer every month through employer e-sewa portal. The return has member wise details of the wages and contributions including basic details for the new and existing members (members who have joined or have left service in the wage month for which the return is uploaded). The approval of uploaded ECR results in generation of challan using which the employer has to remit the EPF & allied dues.  

In order to assist the employer to create the correct ECR file every month, EPFO has provided an offline tool for employers for validating ECR before uploading at Unified Portal.  This tool will facilitate the employers to pre-validate the ECR and also carry out amendments in the ECR file before uploading on Unified Portal.  It is available for download at www.epfindia.gov.in.in>>OurServices>>For Employers>>ECR Validation Tool.

                EPFO has taken a number of e-initiatives to provide services and timely information to all its stakeholders in tune with the government’s motto of minimum government and maximum governance.  It has now been decided to publish the age-band wise estimate of all new subscribers as declared by their employers. The new employees have been categorised in six age bands like less than 18; 18-21; 22-25; 26-28; 29-35 and more than 35years of age. The information can be accessed at https://epfindia.gov.in/site_docs/exmpted_est/Payroll_Data_EPFO.pdf?id=sm5_index. This data can be helpful in policy making, planning and research work as the planners may have an idea as to what is the estimate of employees in different age band. 

 

EPFO has so far been intimating its members by way of SMS on credit of their respective monthly contribution into their accounts.  Now, credit information is available through e-passbook online and UMANG mobile App as well as through missed call service for all members.  EPFO members whose monthly contribution is regularly received may view their contribution details using any of these options.

 

However, the members whose contributions are not deposited in time remain uninformed.  It has now been decided that an intimation by way of SMS/email shall be sent to members who have registered their Mobile Number / email ID against respective Universal Account Number.

                Union Minister for Labour and Employment, Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar today called for special drive for increasing the registration and to stream line welfare benefit delivery mechanism so as to ensure that all the Building and other Construction (BOC) workers get their benefit. Addressing the National Conference on Building and Other Construction Workers Shri Gangwar said it is matter of concern that while there are more than 5 crore workers in the construction and building sector only 2 crore 86 lakhs have been registered so far. 

 

The Minister said the Hon’ble Supreme Court had expressed concern over the cess fund lying unutilised with the States and have passed directions to register all the BOC workers and fully utilise the fund for their welfare. He added that the Supreme Court has emphasised the need for making Model Scheme which should include social security benefits of health, pension, Safety, education to standardize the social security schemes across the states which has been collected though the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 and Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Cess Act, 1996. He requested the States and other stakeholders to make use of recently launched National Portal to facilitate registration of BOC workers.

 

The day long Conference was Chaired by Labour and Employment Minister and attended by the State Labour Ministers, Chairman of the Central Advisory Committee on BOCW, Chairmen of the State Welfare Boards, representatives of CTUs, representatives of Employers, social partners, and senior officers of the States and the Central Government. The Conference was held to discuss on issues relating to working conditions, safety and welfare of construction workers.

 

 

Secretary (L&E), Shri U.P. Singh mentioned that it has come to notice that registration of a BOC workers, belonging to other States, is generally discouraged and that welfare benefits are not portable across the States which may be the major reason behind poor utilisation of cess fund.  He requested the States to maximise registration, facilitate registration of migrant BOC workers and utilise cess fund to ensure social security benefits to the workers as stipulated under the Act and as underlined by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its judgement. 

 

The building and other construction workers (BOCW) are one of the most vulnerable segments of the unorganised sector workers in India. 

 

One important outcome of the Conference was constitution of a Committee, having representatives from the States and other stakeholders, to draft a Model Welfare Scheme to provide standardised Social Security to of BOC workers.

                The basic rate of minimum wages for the scheduled employments in the Central sphere was last revised and notified on 19.01.2017. A component of minimum rates of wage, Variable Dearness Allowance (V.D.A.), was last revised on 01.10.2017.

 

Rates fixed for the scheduled employments in the Central sphere are applicable to establishments under the authority of Central Government, railway administration, mines, oil-fields, major port or any corporation established by a Central Government. These rates are equally applicable to contract and casual labourers/worker.

 

The implementation of the Act is done by the Centre as well as the States in respect of their respective jurisdiction. In the Central Sphere, the enforcement is secured through the Inspecting Officers of the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) commonly designated as Central Industrial Relations Machinery (CIRM) across the Country for workers falling under the Scheduled Employment in the Central Sphere including CPSUs and Railways establishments through regular inspections. In case of non-compliance, penal provisions against the defaulting employers are invoked.

 

This Ministry is in constant endeavor towards implementing the revised rates of minimum wages. As far as employees in Railway are concerned guidelines were issued in December, 2017 to Ministry of Railways/Railway Board. Ministry of Railways has also issued instructions to its Zonal Offices across the country for strict compliance of minimum wages in December, 2017.

 

The data of inspections, amount of claims, action taken against defaulting employer under the Minimum Wage Act, 1948 in the Central Sphere for the last three years is at Annexure ‘A’.

                The exact domicile of freed bonded labourer is not centrally available as the Central Government releases financial assistance for rehabilitation of freed bonded labourers based on the proposals from the States. The Chhattisgarh Government, since 2012 till date, sought financial assistance for rehabilitation of 2682 freed bonded labourers.  

Prior to the revamp of the bonded labour rehabilitation scheme with effect from 18.5.16, the financial assistance for rehabilitation of a freed bonded labourer was Rs.20,000/- which was borne by the Centre and the States in the ratio of 50:50. The revamped scheme, namely the Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labourer, 2016, provides, inter-alia, financial assistance  for rehabilitation of a rescued bonded labourer at the rate of rupees one lakh for adult male beneficiary, Rs. 2 lakh for special category beneficiaries such as children including orphans or those rescued from organized & forced begging rings or other forms of forced child labour, and women, and Rs. 3 lakh in cases of bonded or forced labour involving extreme cases of deprivation or marginalization such as trans-genders, or women or children rescued from ostensible sexual exploitation such as brothels, massage parlours, placement agencies etc., or trafficking, or in cases of differently abled persons, or in situations where the District Magistrate deems fit. The financial assistance for rehabilitation under the revamped scheme is fully borne by the Central Government and linked to conviction. However, immediate assistance of Rs. 20,000/- may be provided by the District Magistrate, which is reimbursed by the Central Government.

The District Magistrate provides the rehabilitation cash amount directly to the concerned freed labourer as prescribed under the Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labourer, 2016.

Rehabilitation cash amount is provided to the freed labourer by the District Magistrates, following which the Central assistance is reimbursed on receipt of the proposals from State Governments on their fulfilling the requirements stipulated in the Scheme.

                One hundred and fifty participants from 31 countries and 400 entrepreneurs from India will participate in the four day International SME convention being held in New Delhi from 22ndto 24th April. The Ministry of MSME has engaged with over 35 International Trade Development organisations to attract and invite able and willing entrepreneurs and encourage people to people contact with select Indian Entrepreneurs from key sectors of the International counterparts. The convention has specific focus on inclusion of MSMEs in the Make in India program & empowering women entrepreneurs.

The MoMSME recognizing the potential of sustainable Indian SMEs in collaborating with International Companies not only for setting up manufacturing operations in India but also for utilizing the reach and market access of International Counterparts for promoting and exporting Made in India products and services. Need was felt to create a platform which could allow Entrepreneur – to – Entrepreneur exchange of ideas, free and fair business discussions, mutual sizing of opportunities and ways to address them. 

India is home to more than 60 million MSMEs, majority of who are in low-tech areas and serve the local domestic markets. Of these, a small percentage, have the ability and capability to derive access to International Markets, with the vast majority of enterprises working as ancillaries. Together the MSMEs constitute a single largest employer after the Agriculture sector in India. Highly developed economies have banked on their small and medium enterprises for both GDP Growth as well as higher employment resulting in higher per capita incomes.

Giriraj Singh MoS (I/c) MSME delivering the valedictory address at the Conference of Development Institutes, Technology Centres and Tool Rooms under the Ministry of MSME

 

Giriraj Singh MoS MSME emphasized the need for more agro clusters under the MSME Ministry for job creation. He said it is quite alarming that women are losing employment and are forced to migrate to cities. To minimize both unemployment and migration, the Minister said that the agro-clusters can act as catalyst for creation of more jobs in rural India especially for women.

The Minister was delivering the valedictory address at the end of the two-days’ Conference of Development Institutes, Technology Centres and Tool Rooms under the Ministry of MSME. The Minister also desired that wide publicity should be given to the successful ventures of MSME Ministry like clusters and tool rooms so that many more may be set-up in the country. 

The Minister further added that the schemes under MSMEs in different Ministries should reach the village level for which he urged the Development Institutes to coordinate with district functionaries.

A total of 3,55,604 applications had been received for Haj which included 1,89,217 male and 1,66,387 female applicants. 

This year, a total of 1,28,002 pilgrims will go through Haj Committee of India which include about 47 per cent females. 47,023 Haj pilgrims will go through Private Tour Operators.  Besides, for the first time Muslim women from India will also go to Haj without “Mehram” (male companion).

Officials from Haj Committee of India, Vrihan Mumbai Mahanagar Palika, Disaster Management agencies and doctors informed them in detail, all the process related to Haj including accommodation, transport, health and safety of Haj pilgrims at Makkah-Madina. For the first time, Female Haj Assistants will be deployed to monitor various facilities for women Haj pilgrims.

                Shri R K Singh, Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Government of India, on the occasion of 127th Birth Anniversary of Bharat Ratna Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar launched a number of initiatives for the welfare of the underprivileged, today.

At this occasion, Shri Singh expressed the Government’s commitment to provide 24*7 power supply to all. He said that every household in country will get electricity connection by December, 2018 under ‘Saubhagya’. Emphasising the importance of renewable energy for rural areas, the Minister said, “Off-grid solutions will empower the local women and provide a reliable source of electricity for school going children so they can study and progress well. Thus, it will help in integrating the deprived sections of society with the mainstream.”                                                                             

Of the several initiatives launched, Shri Singh inaugurated Assembly & Distribution Centre for Solar Study Lamps at Mahuli village in Arrah. In this centre, local women Self Help Group (SHG) will assemble Solar Study Lamps and distribute them to underprivileged students who do not have access to electricity. Thus the Centre will not only provide kerosene-free affordable illumination to students, but also empower rural women with the skills to assemble, distribute and repair solar lamps.

This initiative is part of the Government of India’s scheme of providing 70 lakh Solar Study Lamps in five States where rural household electrification levels are low. In Bihar, the target is to provide more than 18.84 lakh underprivileged students with Solar Study Lamps. Around 4.57 lakh such lamps have already been distributed to students of the State.

Shri RK Singh also laid the foundation (remotely) for a solar photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturing plant in Sherghati block of Gaya district. This plant will be first of its kind in the State, and will be entirely owned and operated by local women Self Help Group Federations. For this purpose, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Bihar Rural Livelihood Promotion Society (BRLPS) - Jeevika, IIT-Bombay, and the Cluster Level Federation of women self-help group members.

Initiating the Govt of India’s Gram Swaraj Abhiyan, Shri Singh flagged off the UJALA van from Arrah. The van will travel across Bihar distributing the LED bulbs and spreading awareness about energy efficiency and energy conservation. As part of this initiative, 16000 Indian villages with a significantly large number of low income households will be able to buy LED bulbs for a special price of Rs. 50 under the Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) programme. In Bihar, 635 villages will benefit under this programme. The LED bulbs will equip homes with energy-efficient, cost-effective lighting, and higher lumen output than conventional incandescent bulbs.

The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is launched by the Government to promote social harmony and apprise rural communities of various government welfare schemes and initiatives. The campaign will be implemented between 14th April and 5th May, 2018 in 16000 villages across India.

The event was graced by the officials from Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, EESL, IIT Bombay, Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society - Jeevika and District Administration of Bhojpur.

Background:

After the success of 10 lakh solar study lamp scheme, Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, Government of India launched a scheme for providing 70 lakh solar study lamps to students of underserved areas of five States where the rural household electrification level was less than 50 per cent as per Census 2011. These states are Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh. Under the Scheme solar study lamps are provided to students for which they have to contribute a small amount of Rs. 100/- only.

The scheme is being implemented by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), along with IIT Bombay. So far over 11 lakh solar study lamps have been distributed under the scheme.

                                 The National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) an autonomous body under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has called for ‘Expression of Interest’ (EoI) for the first offshore wind energy project of India. The global EoI is intended to shortlist prospective offshore wind energy developers for a 1000 MW offshore wind energy project in Gulf of Khambat, off the coast of Gujarat. The proposed area is located 23-40 km seaward side from Pipavav port. MNRE plans to install at least 5 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2022. 

As per the National Offshore Wind Energy Policy notified on October, 2015, National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE), Chennai is the nodal agency to carry out the necessary studies/surveys before final bidding and act as a single window for facilitating necessary clearances required for development of offshore wind project in India.

The first offshore LiDAR was installed in Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat for measurement of wind resource and NIWE is collecting wind speed data from November, 2017 onwards. Areas off the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are two identified areas for development of offshore wind power. The second LiDAR would be installed off Tamil Nadu coast by September, 2018. In addition NIWE is planning to set up few more LiDARs for assessment of offshore wind resources. Besides necessary Geo-Technical and Geo-Physical studies off the coast of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are underway.

At global level, it has been observed that, offshore wind energy while being better than onshore wind in terms of efficiency is also becoming competitive and comparable in terms of tariffs. With a large energy market in India, the EoI is expected to evince keen interest from leading players of offshore wind turbine manufacturers and developers. Indian industry can also participate along with suitable tie up with global players.

 With the announcement of this first offshore wind energy project, the Government is attempting to develop this sector in India and envisages to replicate similar success as on-shore wind power sector. This would help the country towards attaining energy security and achievement of National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC) targets.

(ii)     The scheme will have both    Central Component - National Level activities including ""National Plan of Technical Assistance"", ""Mission Mode project on e-Panchayat"", ""Incentivization of Panchayats"" and State component - Capacity Building of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs),

(iv)    The implementation and monitoring of the activities of the scheme will broadly be aligned for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with main thrust on Panchayats identified under Mission Antyodaya and 115 Aspirational districts as identified by NITI Aayog.

(v)     The Scheme will converge capacity building initiatives of other Ministries with particular focus on those Ministries which will be impacted substantially by this Scheme,

                    (vi)    Sunset date for RGSA will be 31.03.2030.

States/districts covered:

This scheme will extend to all States and UTs of the country and will also include institutions of rural local government in non-Part IX areas, where Panchayats do not exist.

Impact:

The approved scheme of RGSA will help more than 2.55 lakh Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) to develop governance capabilities to deliver on SDGs through inclusive local governance with focus on optimum utilisation of available resources. The key principles of SDGs, i.e. leaving no one behind, reaching the farthest first and universal coverage, along with gender equality will be embedded in the design of all capacity building interventions including trainings, training modules and materials. Priority will be given to subjects of national importance that affects the excluded groups the most, e.g. poverty, primary health services, nutrition, immunization, sanitation, education, water conservation, digital transactions etc.

The scheme is designed keeping in view programmatic convergence with Mission Antyodaya GPs and 115 Aspirational districts as identified by NITI Aayog. As Panchayats have representation of Schedule Castes, Schedule Tribes and women, and are institutions closest to the grass­roots, strengthening Panchayats will promote equity and inclusiveness, along with Social Justice and economic development of the community.

Increased use of e-governance by PRIs will help achieve improved service delivery and transparency. The scheme will strengthen Gram Sabhas to function as effective institutions with social inclusion of citizens particularly the vulnerable groups. It will establish the institutional structure for capacity building of PRIs at the national, state and district level with adequate human resources and infrastructure. Panchayats will progressively be strengthened through incentivisation on the basis of nationally important criteria which will encourage competitive spirit among them.

Implementation strategy and targets:

The Central Government and the State Governments will take action for performing and completing the activities approved for their respective roles. The State Government will formulate their Annual Action Plans for seeking assistance from the Central Government as per their priorities and requirement. The scheme will be implemented in a demand driven mode.

Background:

The Finance Minister, in his budget speech for 2016-17, announced the launch of new restructured scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA), for developing governance capabilities of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A Committee under the Chairmanship of the Vice Chairman-NITI Aayog was constituted to restructure the existing scheme of this Ministry as Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan.

The Committee held several meetings, consultations etc. with various stakeholders and submitted its report with set of recommendations which were accepted by Government and formed the basis for the formulation of this scheme.

In his Budget Speech for 2017-18, the Finance Minister announced to undertake a Mission Antyodaya to bring one crore households out of poverty to make 50,000 Gram Panchayats poverty free. Accordingly, convergent action with Mission Antyodaya has been integrated into this scheme.

This was done as a part of Swachhata Pakhwada being observed by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs from 16th to 30th April, 2018. 

e-Vidhan is a mission mode project to digitize and make the functioning of State Legislatures in India paperless.  It is a part of the broader Digital India Programme of the Government and is likely to contribute to the cleanliness & environment by reducing the use of papers to a great extent.

The Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is the Nodal Ministry for the project. It is taking all the necessary steps for rolling out the Project in all the States at an early date. One of the key component of the strategy devised for implementation of the project is to create Project Monitoring Units both at Central as well as State levels.

                The 30th lecture of the “Lecture Series” organized by the Central Vigilance Commission was delivered by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Member, Finance Commission of India here today on the topic “India Economy – the Structural Question ”.

            Shri Shaktikanta Das began his lecture with a discussion of the broad features of the Indian economy since Independence – a mixed economy with the presence of a dominant public sector as well as the presence of private enterprise and centralized economic planning characterized by a system of licences and permits. The positive features of following such a path of economic development were the development of human resources on a large scale, the growth of the public sector and achievement of agricultural self-sufficiency due to the green revolution. The restriction of private enterprise as well as low rates of growth of the economy were identified as structural drawbacks of this period.  

He characterized a robust economy as having the following features: existence of sound macro-economic parameters, achievement of inclusive growth and the removal of artificial restrictions and impediments, wherever possible, in an economy. He identified two periods of structural reforms of the economy, viz. in 1991 as well as in 2014-17 as being very significant milestones. The 1991 economic liberalisation was characterized by the ending of industrial licensing and permits, devaluation of currency, reforms of the financial sector including the emergence of SEBI as a market regulator and the rapid growth of sectors such as the telecom sector in India.

He addressed concerns such as the need for correction of the Debt/GDP ratio and the importance of improving the quality of public expenditure. He explained how measures such as the use of the Outcome Budget, the ending of the Vote on Account due to the shifting of the date of the budget, the merger of the Railway Budget with the General Budget and the ending of the distinction between Plan and Non-Plan expenditure were important structural reforms in this process. These measures have had a positive impact on the quality of public expenditure. 

The discussion on the 2014-17 structural reforms covered monetary policy reforms (the amendment of the RBI Act and the constitution of the Monetary Policy Committee), Inflation Targeting, FDI policy reforms including the increase of Sectoral caps for foreign investment and the abolition of the FIPB, the ongoing banking sector reforms, taxation reforms and the implementation of the GST as well as Demonetization as a means to target the parallel economy. 

The lecture was followed by a question and answer session.  

Full time and part time CVOs based in Delhi/NCR attended the lecture along with CMDs, Board of Directors and other officers of the vigilance administration.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, DrJitendra Singh paid a visit to the offices located in LokNayakBhawan, here today. The officers of Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT), Department of Pensions & Pensioners’ Welfare and Department of Space, for which DrJitendra Singh is Minister of State, are located here and it houses around 300 employees. This was a surprise visit paid by him to personally understand various functional aspects of these departments.

During his visit, DrJitendra Singh met the officials working in the departments and interacted with them regarding their working conditions and understand any difficulties faced by them during their functioning. He conducted an inspection of the office and also supervised the swachhta/cleanliness status of these departments. While going from seat to seat, he interacted with the entire staff of all the three departments. These visits help in keeping the morale of employees high and also motivate them, he said.

Thereafter, the Minister conducted a joint meeting of all the officers in which welfare activities of employees, cadre management activities of 19,000 officers of CSS, SSCS and CSSS as well as welfare activities pertaining to Central Government Pensioners were discussed. The Minister also visited the DoPPW NIC centre which manages the Pensioners’ portal and all the online activities of the Pensions Department such as CPENGRAMS, Sankalp, Anubhav, Bhavishya and Mobile App. The Minister appreciated the online processing of Pension settlement on Bhavishya. The Minister also appreciated the Department’s initiative of Pension Adalats considering the fact that the number of Pensioners now exceed the number of working staff.

While briefing him, Joint Secretary, Pensions informed the Minister that there was an abandoned store-house on the ground floor outside the building which had been lying in a dilapidated state from several years. The same is being renovated and shortly would be used as a facilitation centre for Pensioners as well as a convention centre for small activities of the Department of Pensions.

The Minister while briefing the officers of DoPT mentioned that it might be a good idea to have some institutionalized service from the department’s side for certain outdoor work of officers and staff so that they can give their maximum time to the department’s activities.

After the visit, DrJitendra Singh said that the purpose of his visit was to understand the ground working conditions of the employees working in various departments located here. He said that DoPT is an important department of Government of India and performs various important functions including cadre management and meeting training requirements. Speaking about Department of Pensions, he said that the department has taken various initiatives including organizing Pensions Adalats, SCOVA meetings and others including Pensions Portal, Anubhav scheme, Sankalp and Bhavishya. The Convention Centre being built by the Department of Pensions will help in meeting their regular requirements, he added. He also talked about e-office initiatives being implemented by departments.

The Minister also visited the Department of Space Branch Secretariat located in LokNayakBhawan. It also has a liaison unit for ISRO which represents the DoS ISRO Headquarters at Bangalore.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed Civil Servants on the occasion of Civil Services Day. He said the occasion is one of Appreciation, Evaluation and Introspection. He described the Prime Minister's Award as a step towards motivating civil servants, and congratulated the awardees. He said the awards also indicate the priorities of the Government.

He said that the priority programmes such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Deendayal Upadhyay Kaushalya Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and Digital Payments, for which awards have been given, are important programmes for New India. 

Speaking on the subject of Aspirational Districts, the Prime Minister said that these 115 districts could become growth engines for their entire States. He stressed on the importance of Jan Bhagidaari, or public participation, in development. He said 2022, the seventy-fifth anniversary of independence, can become an inspiration for working towards achieving the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters. 

The Prime Minister asserted that all available technology, including space technology, should be used for improving governance. He said it is important for civil servants to keep pace with emerging technologies worldwide.

He described civil servants as people with great capability and said that these capabilities can contribute in a big way, for the benefit of the nation.

The Prime Minister also released two books ‘New Pathways’ and ‘Aspirational Districts: Unlocking Potentials’.  The first book ‘New Pathways’ is a Coffee Table Book consisting of significant details of 28 successful Innovations and 34 Success Stories relating to implementation of Priority Programmes viz., PMAY-U, PMAY-G, DDUGKY, PMFBY and Promoting Digital Payments in Districts shortlisted for Prime Minister’s Awards, 2018. ‘Aspirational Districts: Unlocking Potentials’ book relates to development of Strategies for transforming Aspirational Districts and the approach towards development of relevant social and other parameters. NITI Ayog is coordinating the initiative for development of Aspirational Districts. 

During the event, “New India-shaping the future”, a film by DARPG was also screened. The film shows initiatives of the 11 districts/organizations selected for PM Awards this year.

Speaking on the occasion, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space Dr Jitendra Singh said that it is a platform for civil servants to share their best experiences. He said that during the last four years, the entire format of the Civil Services Day has changed and now the work done for implementation of priority programmes is rewarded under PM awards. He said that in the year 2016, only 74 districts had participated for the PM awards and this number has risen significantly to 599 districts in 2017 and to 643 districts this year.

The Minister also said that Prime Minister had given the mantra of ‘minimum government, maximum governance’. The citizens are essential stakeholders of governance, he added. Speaking about the grievance redressal mechanism of the DARPG, he said that now there is CPGRAMS Portal, dashboard and timelines to redress the grievances of the citizens. He added that the grievances have increased significantly from about 2 lakhs in a year in 2014 to about 16 lakhs in a year now. This is due to the fact that the department has been more responsive, sensitive and  prompt to the grievances of the citizens. He also spoke about Pensions Portal, Anubhav and Jeevan Pramaan initiatives of the Department of Pensions & Pensioners’ Welfare. The Minister said that DARPG has also started holding regional conferences outside Delhi and has already held such conferences in places like Guwahati, Nagpur, Jaipur and Chandigarh among others. 

The Cabinet Secretary, Shri P. K. Sinha said that this year four priority programmes have been chosen for PM awards. These include Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Promoting Digital Payments, Pradhan MantriAwas Yojana – Urban & Rural, and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana. He informed that 103 out of 115 aspirational districts have participated for PM’s awards this year. He assured that the civil servants will work to fulfil the dream of Prime Minister’s ‘New India’. 

Later the Prime Minister presented 15 awards to the winners in various categories. Under the priority programme, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, District West Tripura (Tripura) was awarded under NE & Hill States category and Beed (Maharashtra) was awarded under Other States category. Under ‘Promotign Digital Payments’ Programme, Bishnupur (Manipur) was given award under NE & Hill States category, Daman (Daman & Diu) was awarded under Union Territory and Sonipat (Haryana) was awarded under Other States category.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that translating “legislative intent” into “programmatic content” and demonstrating to the common citizens what “Surajya” actually looks like in day to day administration, the civil services have an enormous opportunity today. He was delivering the inaugural address at the 2-day event of the 12th Civil Services Day, here today. The Vice President said that a clean, competent, people-friendly, proactive administrative leadership is the need of the hour. He further said that ‘Swarajya’ has to be meaningful for each Indian and, for this ‘Surajya’ is inevitable. There is a need for honest introspection into the effectiveness and efficiency of our administrative structures and processes, he added. He said that the focus has shifted to “implementation” and “innovation” and it is becoming increasingly clear that “business as usual” approach will not do. We must collectively transform India into a nation that we can all be proud of, he added.

The Vice President called on officers of Civil Services to reorient their approach to look upon themselves as catalysts of change, as facilitators of change, as inspirational leaders for an aspirational India. He further said that it is the collective responsibility of the executive, the legislature, the judiciary and the media to identify, combat and root out evils including casteism, communalism, corruption, inequality, discrimination and violence. We need to be sensitive to these unpleasant realities and try to alter them by being unbiased and evenhanded, he added.

Addressing the session, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space Dr Jitendra Singh said that the main objective of the Civil Services Day is to acknowledge and recognise the good work done by the civil servants. He added that this is a platform for civil servants to share their best experiences and reorient themselves to the emerging requirements of the New India. He added that during the last four years, the entire format of the Civil Services Day has changed and now the work done for implementation of priority programmes is rewarded under PM awards. This year four priority programmes have been chosen, he added. He said that 643 districts have participated for PM awards this year. He appreciated that 103 districts out of 115 aspirational districts have participated for these awards and 75 aspirational districts have participated under Innovation category. 

 

The Minister also emphasised on the Government’s mantra of ‘minimum government, maximum  governance’. He said that these days the expectation level for civil servants has risen. He also emphasised on the conducive working environment for civil servants and citizen participation. Speaking about the grievance redressal mechanism of the department, he said that now there is CPGRAMS Portal, dashboard and fixed timelines to redress the grievances of the citizens. He added that the grievances have increased about 8 fold since the year 2014. This is due to the prompt response and active mechanism for grievance redressal, he said. He also spoke about Pensions Portal, Anubhav and Jeevan Pramaan initiatives of the Department of Pensions & Pensioners’ Welfare.  

 

On the occasion, the Vice President released a book titled “Emulating Excellence -Takeaways for Replication, Prime Minister’s Awards – Priority Programmes 2017 & 2018 contains 9 chapters on best practices for priority programmes in which PM Awards were given on CSD, 2017 and are being given on CSD, 2018. 

 

Earlier, the Vice President inaugurated an exhibition put up by DARPG on identified Priority Programmes and Innovations. Success stories of identified priority programmes i.e. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Promoting Digital Payments, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana– Urban & Rural, and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana are displayed and shortlisted Innovation by Aspirational districts and Central and State organisations are also showcased. Creative works of Civil Servants including books, music, paintings etc. are showcased in the Exhibition. 

 

Delivering the welcome address, the Secretary, DARPG, Shri K. V. Eapen said that 4 identified Priority Programmes will be given PM awards this year while two awards shall be given to organizations of Central/ State Government/Districts for innovations out of which one award will be given to an Aspirational District. The Aspirational Districts have been included in PM awards for the first time, he added.  He also said that a new category of awards for Additional Secretary/Joint Secretary level officers and Director/ Deputy Secretary serving in Government of India has also been introduced this year to recognize their contribution towards bringing about transformational improvements in processes/systems. He added that highest number of applications have been received from districts for the PM awards this year. He informed that CSD2018 App has been created so that instant feedback can be given on the sessions. He also said that role of civil servants has become important since the challenges have become more complex and expectations have risen significantly.  

 

A film on Journey to PM-Awards was also screened during the function. In this film complete selection process of PM awards including changes made in the process during 2016, 2017 and 2018 have been showcased.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh launched an online dashboard developed by Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) here today. The dashboard will monitor public grievances on real time basis and periodically review progress of systemic reforms. The systemic reforms and their monitoring metrics, catering to grievance issues are highlighted on the dashboard. This will enable concerned Ministries/Departments to monitor implementation of these reforms. 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the DARPG is the nodal department for the dashboard that was launched today, but it will also be helpful to the concerned Ministries/Departments to monitor the implementation of various initiatives and will provide inputs to them. He said that DARPG should create awareness among departments/ministries about this dashboard so that they can benefit the citizens to the maximum out of it.  He said that the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi works on the principle of ‘maximum governance, minimum government’ for the benefit of the citizens of the country. He said that grievances received by the Government has increased many times, due to the prompt response given by the Department and faith of public in the Government. He said that an analysis has been done by the department on the causes of grievances and this has helped in the indepth understanding of the causes and taking corrective steps. The Minister said that the number of pensioners is more than the number of working employees in the country. The pensioners are a big resource for us and we should do an analysis how best to tap their potential, he added. The ‘Anubhav’ initiative can provide various inputs to us in assessing the ministries/departments, the Minister said. 

On the occasion, the Minister also released the Project Monitoring Report on ""Monitoring of Systemic Reforms and Public Grievances"" as well as the Reports ""Grievance Data Analysis, Study of CPENGRAMS and Systemic Reform Recommendations"" and ""Recommendations for Anubhav portal"". A Grievance Analysis Study through the Quality Council of India (QCI) was initiated in 2015 in respect of top 20 highest grievance receiving Ministries/Departments (from 01.01.2012 to 19.08.2015). The Study involved identification of top grievance prone areas and focus on root cause analysis. The Reports recommended systemic reforms to impact and bring about improvements in service delivery. In order to monitor the implementation of the reforms/ recommendations made, a Project Management Unit (PMU) was set up by DARPG in August, 2016. 

A presentation on the study of grievances in various ministries and their causes was also given on the occasion. The presentation included discussion about root causes of grievances in various ministries including Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Railways, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Communication & IT, Ministry of Finance and others. It was said that analysis of root causes of grievances has helped the departments of take suitable action on the main causes in their ministries/departments e.g. reduction in the average response time and others.

Secretary, DoPT, Shri C. Chandramouli, Secretary, DARPG, Shri K. V. Eapen and senior officers of various ministries were also present on the occasion.

Representation of OBCs in the Central Government services is less as compared to the percentage of reservation for them because reservation of OBC started in September, 1993. 

As per available information, representation of OBCs as on 01.01.2012 was 16.55% which has now increased to 21.57% as on 01.01.2016. Therefore, there is an increasing trend in the representation of OBCs in the posts and services of Central Government.

Department of Personnel & Training has issued instructions to all Ministries/Departments to constitute an in-house Committee to identify backlog reserved vacancies, study of the root cause of backlog reserved vacancies, initiation of measures to remove such factors and to fill up such vacancies through Special Recruitment Drive.

            Out of these 299, charge sheet has been filed in 107 cases (103 in 2015 and 4 in 2016). 3 cases resulted in conviction in 2015.

 

The cases referred by Supreme Court are under active investigation.  However, due to following reasons, time frame for filing Charge-sheets can not be fixed.

 


	In some cases, investigation requires scrutiny of voluminous documents and examination of large number of witnesses.
	In some cases, investigations has to be done in foreign countries for which Letters Rogatory has to be executed, which is a time consuming process
	Many cases remain pending even after conclusion of investigation for want of sanction for prosecution from the competent authority or for want of expert opinion. 
	Large vacancies in CBI amongst the ranks of Investigating Officers and Law Officers affect the speed of investigations.

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production

  

 

Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

 


	
	
		Crude oil production by ONGC during March, 2018 was 1879.17 TMT which is 6.6% lower than the monthly target and 2.71% lower when compared with March, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-March, 2017-18 was 22249.12 TMT which is 3.56% lower than target for the period but marginally higher by 0.14% than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production with respect to target are as under:
	
	
	Additional production planned from WO16 cluster from October’17 onwards could not be realized due to delay in implementation of “Conversion of Sagar Samrat to MOPU” Project.
	Production planned from project ‘Integrated Development of B-127 Cluster’ from Oct.’17 onwards could not be realized due to delay in implementation of project. Production targeted by pre-monsoon of 2018 from B-127 wells.
	NBP field of Western offshore which was affected due to ESP related issues was normalized by 15.02.2018 through rig intervention.
	Increase in water cut in wells of Heera, Neelam and B-173 fields. 
	Frequent power shutdowns and low gas injection pressure in Mehsana and Assam hampered artificial lift operations.
	Increase in water cut in Mehsana and Assam. 


 


	
	
		Crude oil production by OIL during March, 2018 was 281.53 TMT which is 11.32% lower than monthly target and 3.98% lower when compared with March, 2017.

Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
	
	


 


	Less than planned contribution from old wells – Rise in water cut in wells and decline in total liquid production of wells of Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari Fields.
	Less than planned contribution from work over wells.


 


	
	
		Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during March, 2018 was 880.96 TMT which is 2.43% lower than the monthly target but 1.74% higher than March, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-March, 2017-18 was 10058.94 TMT which is 5.38% lower than target for the period and 4.5% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
	
	


 


	RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 85 oil wells closed due to various reasons like high water cut, requiring WOJ, etc; Underperformance of Bhagyam. 
	CY-ONN-2002/2 (ONGC): Full fledged production yet to be realized owing to non-grant of PML.


 

Natural Gas


	Natural gas production during March, 2018 was 2782.61 MMSCM which is 11.12% lower than the target for the month but 1.18% higher when compared with March, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production during April-March, 2017-18 was 32649.30 MMSCM which is 7.07% lower than target for the period but 2.36% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II.

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan and U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry co-chaired the inaugural meeting here today of the U.S.-India Strategic Energy Partnership, which President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced during their June 26, 2017 Summit in Washington, D.C.

 

The Partnership affirms the strategic importance of energy cooperation to the U.S.-India bilateral relationship and sets the stage for deeper and more meaningful engagements through government and industry channels. As leading global partners, the United States and India believe that energy cooperation can serve as a centerpiece in the bilateral relationship. 

 

Through the Partnership, the United States and India collectively seek to enhance energy security, expand energy and innovation linkages across our respective energy sectors, bolster our strategic alignment, and facilitate increased industry and stakeholder engagement in the energy sector. 

 

Today, Secretary Perry and Minister Pradhan led a high-level discussion with senior U.S. and Indian government officials that outlined their vision for the Strategic Energy Partnership and key areas of engagement. Under the Partnership, the United States and India will pursue four primary pillars of cooperation: (1) Oil and Gas; (2) Power and Energy Efficiency; (3) Renewable Energy and Sustainable Growth; and (4) Coal. Both parties may consider establishing additional pillars of cooperation based on mutual agreement.

 

The Strategic Energy Partnership elevates the role of energy in advancing shared goals, including universal energy access, strengthened energy security and increased energy efficiency. The Partnership will create important opportunities for advancing favorable policies and commercial investments in support of these goals, including in natural gas markets. In keeping with the shared objectives to provide a stronger business orientation to our energy cooperation, both sides noted with appreciation the growing investment of Indian companies in the United States and the beginning of oil and gas exports from the United States to India.

 

Recognizing the significance of civilian nuclear energy for meeting the growing global energy demands in a cleaner and more efficient manner, India and the United States are engaged in the implementation of the 2008 Agreement for cooperation concerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which represents an important milestone in our strategic relationship. In this regard, the two sides reaffirm their strong commitment to early and full implementation of our civil nuclear partnership, including the Westinghouse civil nuclear project at Kovvada.  Cooperation in this area is being pursued through relevant bilateral mechanisms.

 

As a first step in realizing the full potential of the Strategic Energy Partnership, the United States and India are pleased to announce the U.S.-India Natural Gas Task Force. The Task Force provides a team of U.S. and Indian industry experts with a mandate to propose, develop, and convey, innovative policy recommendations to Government of India in support of its vision for natural gas in the economy of India. The work of the Task Force is expected to advance the strategic and economic interests of both the United States and India.

 

Strategic Energy Partnership teams will convene soon to further develop action plans for the respective pillars of cooperation.  The U.S. and Indian co-chairs will receive reports from the pillar teams on a regular basis.

                Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) was launched in the state of Telangana on the birth anniversary of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, at Suryapetby by the  Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship  Dharmendra Pradhan, in the presence of Shri Bandaru Dattatru, MP . PMUY LPG connections were distributed to the BPL Women beneficiaries by the dignitaries on the stage.

PMUY has been a revolutionary initiative that has transformed the lives of more than 3.57 crore households spanning across the length and breadth of the country. The initiative is in line with Governments aim to eradicate energy poverty, thereby promoting economic empowerment.

Addressing the gathering Minister for Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Dharmendra Pradhan said that the scheme has been impacting the lives of women from BPL families in a major way by reducing the drudgery of cooking with polluting fuels and will go a long way in reducing indoor pollution. He said that the main mantra of PMUY is “Mahilaon Ko Mila Samman, Swachh Indhan Behtar Jeevan”.  He said in order to educate the BPL families, Government is organizing ‘Gram Swaraj Abhiyaan’ from 14th April – 5th May across the country showcasing 7 schemes of the central government. He also announced that on 20th April 2018, ‘Ujjwala Diwas’ will be celebrated by way of Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Panchayats at 15000 locations in which large number of PMUY LPG connections will be distributed. LPG Panchayats will focus on the key themes of Health, Economic cost, Safety, Environment and Empowerment. He conveyed that 20 Lakh connections will be distributed in the state of Telangana and for that the total distributorship will be raised from 700 to 1000 in the State in future. 

The overwhelming response to the PMUY initiative and its efficient implementation & monitoring have led the Government to revise the initial target of releasing 5 crore connections to 8 crore by the year 2020.To achieve this enhanced target, additional categories have been included under extended Ujjwala scheme viz. SC, ST, Most BC, Antyodaya Anna Yojana etc.

                My colleague Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan Ji,

Participating Ministers,

Heads of International Organisations,

CEOs

Delegates and 

Friends

It gives me great pleasure to be with you all at this Valedictory Session of the IEF Ministerial Meeting. I am indeed happy to see that about 40 Energy Ministers, 10 Heads of International Organisations and top CEOs have engaged extensively over the
last two days. Such a broad swath of participation is a rare event in the world. I am delighted that this event took place in India. 

During the inaugural session,you heard from my Prime Minister about the importance energy occupies in his policy matrix. His vision has always been to promote energy access, energy sustainability, energy efficiency and energy security.
I am sure, these objectives also guide most of you. Geo-politics is a complex and evolving subject. Geo-politics of oil is even more complex. I hope that your discussions over the last one and a half days have provided more solutions rather than raising more questions.
Oil and Gas are not only strategic commodities,
but price variations impact people down to the bottom of the pyramid. 

As the third largest consumer of energy, we carefully observe the shifts in centre of gravity of the oil and gas world, the potential technology disruptions, the financialization of the oil markets,
climate change imperatives and innovations.
All these elements have an ingrained capacity to create sudden and disruptive pressure on the operations of global energy assets and energy supplies. 

As the External Affairs Minister, energy is beginning to occupy more and more space in my world view. Energy is a key engine of our economic growth. It is also a key element of our diplomatic engagement and outreach. 

India took the lead during CoP 21 in Paris.
India and France announced the formation of the International Solar Alliance (ISA).
Today ISA is a reality.
Of the 121 prospective nations,
61 have joined the alliance,
32 have also ratified the framework agreement. The successful first ISA summit in Delhi last month saw the participation of 23 Heads of State and Government and over 75 Ministers. Our commitment is amply reflected in our efforts at a national level.
In India, we have started the world's largest renewable energy expansion program. 

We will generate 175 GW of electricity from renewable sources of energy by 2022, of which 100 GW will be from solar power. We have already achieved 20 GW installed solar power. Time again has come for India to take the lead, which according to most projections will lead incremental growth in energy consumption and show the way towards green and clean energy. 

We have been working to promote “Climate Justice” to protect the poor and vulnerable from
adverse impacts of climate change.Several schemes have been launched to achieve universal access to
clean, sustainable & affordable energy for our poor. 

Prime Minister Modi launched the Saubhagya Scheme in September 2017. It aims at electrifying 40million additional households by December 2018 at
an investment of US$ 2.5 billion. 

Currently, India’s per capita energy consumption is almost one tenth of that of some of the advanced countries. I assure you that we will be responsible in our incremental energy consumption. However, in this regard, India expects the world to share technology knowhow and partnership to achieve the objective of providing clean and affordable energy to its citizen.On the oil and gas front, the rapid expansion of infrastructure and enhanced energy availability has been marked by two clear objectives:
(i)  promote energy access; and
(ii) promote clean and affordable energy. 

India accords high priority to promoting a gas based economy. Currently natural gas forms a
relatively small share of the energy mix. Gas infrastructure projects of over US $ 8 billion are under implementation across the country.
We aim to increase share of natural gas in energy mix from current 6.5% to 15% by 2022. In the last 20 months, under the UJJWALA scheme,35 million new households have started using LPG, taking LPG penetration from 56% in 2014 to 80%. India will leap from Euro IV to Euro VI fuel by
April 2020. There is also a concerted effort of replacing Fossil Fuels by Bio-Fuels.

We are well aware that just as energy is a
key pillar for our economic growth & development, it is also the same for our neighbours. Our government has been following ‘Neighbourhood First’ in our foreign policy. In line with this policy, we strongly believe that our efforts to build our oil and gas infrastructure should also benefit our neighbours and promote economic development and raise their standards of living. We appreciate the close cooperation of our neighbours in this regard. India supplies 100% of the domestic requirement of petroleum products to landlocked Nepal since 1974. 

Last week Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Oli of Nepal jointly initiated work on a petroleum product pipeline between India and Nepal. We are also working with Nepal to increase availability of LPG and natural gas and build an
efficient distribution system. 

India is engaged with Bangladesh to
build a pipeline to supply Diesel to Parbatipur and natural gas to power plant at Khulna. Work is also in progress to build LNG terminals, both land based and floating. 

In Bhutan too, India supplies 100% of their petroleum products requirements. We are working closely with them to increase LPG penetration based on our own successful Ujjwala programme.

The Sri Lankan government has been according priority for enhanced use of gas. In this context, India is engaged in setting up an LNG terminal in Sri Lanka to introduce gas as an important and sustainable energy source. In Myanmar, we are working closely with the government to promote use of LPG and provide diesel to the North West region through refineries in our North Eastern states. 

A new policy framework has been
brought in by our Government, termed as the Hydrocarbon Exploration & Licensing Policy (HELP).

The key elements are:
(i)         A single uniform license for exploration and development of both conventional & unconventional hydrocarbon prospects;

(ii) A simple and easy to administer Revenue Sharing Contract Model;

(iii) Full freedom in pricing & marketing of crude oil & natural gas produced;

(iv) Simplified fiscal regime with no levy of cess on crude oil, exemption of custom duty, and,

(v)  low graded royalty rates including zero royalty for deep water and ultra-deep water areas during
first seven years.

India is becoming an increasingly attractive investment destination, particularly in oil and gas sector. You are all familiar with the massive economic transformation India is undergoing under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi. 

The overhauled indirect tax system with the introduction of GST, programmes to promote skills and domestic manufacture, and the increasing ease of doing business augers well for FDI.Energy fuels growth. Energy fuels aspirations. Energy should also fuel sustainability.
No country, international organization or company alone can provide all the answers. 

I am confident that the new ideas, new solutions and new approaches provided by  IEF Ministerial Meeting will ensure that we are all better off and the earth is a greener and happier place.
As Helen Keller says, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.”

I thank you for your attention.

                Hon’ble External Affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj ji, 

His Excellency Dr. Sun Xiansheng, Secretary General, International Energy Forum;

My esteemed ministerial colleagues from various countries;

Heads of International Organisations;

CEOs of global oil and gas companies;

Delegates and Friends from media

At the outset, let me thank you all for making the last two days, “Days of Energy”. Let me also thank you for fuelling them with your valuable insights. It is rare for such a distinguished cross-section of Energy Ministers, Heads of International Organisations and CEOs to gather and debate at one place.  When such a meeting does take place, that too on a neutral platform which the IEF provides, the global discourse on energy gets richer, more focused and result-oriented.

Today, we find ourselves at a critical juncture faced with a rapidly-transforming energy landscape bringing in changes that are not reversible. We are at such a point, when we have to assess the impact of disruptive technologies, innovations, changes in trade and investment patterns, geopolitics and climate change issues.  

It is not easy to sum up the rich intellectual discussions which have taken place in the last two days. However, we have attempted a “Concluding Statement” which reflects on the discussions that have taken place. A copy of the concluding statement has been distributed. The statement will also be put up on IEF website and shared with the media.

I note with satisfaction that the substantive agenda for this meeting, which was drawn up in an inclusive and consultative process of the Executive Board, proved stimulating and thought-provoking. We also experimented with a new format for this Ministerial Meeting. Instead of sitting around a table and relying on speeches, we opted for an interactive format in order to generate deeper multi-way dialogue on key issues. The moderators brought in their wide experience to tickle the participant’s intellect and have a substantive and in-depth discussion. 

I am happy to share that there was as much discussion on the sidelines as was inside the two meetings halls. This is exactly what we hoped for - a multi-way and multi-dimensional discussion on energy issues.

You heard from Prime Minister Modi yesterday about his vision.  Sharing his vision, Prime Minister Modi mentioned 4 pillars – energy access, energy efficiency, energy sustainability and energy security. He also mentioned that Oil and Gas are a commodity of trade but also of necessity. The world needs to move from roller coaster prices to stable and responsible pricing, that balances the interests of both the producer and consumer. He called for a mutually supportive relationship between producers and consumers. The neutral platform of the IEF is the perfect place to build a global consensus on energy-related issues.

While this is the vision of my Prime Minister, it has resonance with most Governments. Energy has to fuel growth. Growth has to fuel development. Development has to raise the standard of living of our people and make the world a happier and more equitable place to live in.

At this stage, I would also like to share an Indian perspective on our expectations from the global hydrocarbon industry as we go forward. India, as already mentioned during this conference, is presently the world’s 3rd largest energy consumer. By all accounts, India’s oil & gas demand is expected to increase nearly 3 fold from 229 Million Metric Tons currently to 607 Million Metric Tons in 2040. 

Our rural areas are fast emerging as key demand centers for auto-fuels. At the same time, India is rapidly urbanising: our urban population is tipped to increase from 31% in 2011 to almost 41% in 2030. India is also demographically a young country with half of our population below 25 years of age and about 65% people below 35 years of age. With more and more people coming out of poverty, an aspiring middle class, larger than the population of several countries, has come into existence. Upward social mobility has also led to changed consumption patterns and more energy-intensive lifestyles. 

In order to meet the exploding energy needs of its vast population, India imports a large proportion of its crude oil and gas requirements. The average Indian energy buyer is also highly price conscious. It is in this context, therefore, that as a large and reliable consumer of energy, India has often advocated the concept of Reasonable and Responsible energy pricing. With the technological advancements in solar, wind and other renewables driving down energy prices, there are alternatives available today for average consumers. I would like to utilize this platform to urge both producers and consumers, once again, to work for a more equitable pricing regime rather than trying to artificially manage the volume of production and price of crude. 

Before closing, let me add a word about investment, which the theme for this Ministerial Forum rightly recognizes, as a key element influencing global energy security. The hydrocarbon industry needs continuous investment in terms of technology, resources and manpower to realize its true potential. I would like to reiterate that the Indian hydrocarbon sector is open for investment. We invite and welcome investors to invest in India’s upstream, midstream and downstream sectors as well as for technological, R&D and academic collaborations.

The schedule of this Ministerial meeting was tight, but I hope that during your stay in Delhi, you got a taste of India - its vibrant economy, its culture, its traditions, its food and I do hope that you will come back to India very soon. 

Thank you all.

                In line with the Government initiative of ease of doing business, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for delegating the powers to Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Finance Minister to award the Blocks/Contract Areas to successful bidders under Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) after International Competitive Bidding (ICB) based on the recommendations of Empowered Committee of Secretaries (ECS). Under HELP, Blocks are to be awarded twice in a year. Therefore, this delegation of powers will expedite the decision making process on awarding blocks and give a boost to the initiative of ease of doing business.

 

Impact:

 

Under the NELP Policy, ECS considers the Bid Evaluation Criteria (BEC), conducts negotiations with the bidders wherever necessary and make recommendations to CCEA on award of blocks. The CCEA approves the award of blocks. The entire process, including Inter Ministerial Consultations (IMC) is quite lengthy and time consuming. In consonance with the Government initiativeof 'Ease of Doing Business', it is desirable to shorten the duration of time taken foraward of the Blocks / ContractAreas.      Under     the      NewHydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy' the competitive bidding will be continuous and blocks will be awarded twice a year. 

 

Background:

 

Government of India launched a new policy regime for Exploration & Production (E&P) sector namely Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) in 2016 which is paradigm shift from earlier policy regime. The main features of new Policy regime are Revenue Sharing Contract, single Licence for exploration and production of conventional as well as unconventional Hydrocarbon resources, marketing & pricing freedom, etc. Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) under HELP, is main innovative feature wherein investor can carve out Blocks of their own interest and submit an Expression of Interest (Eol) throughout the year. Based on the areas for which expression of interest has been expressed bidding will be conducted every 6 months.

 

Government received an overwhelming response in first Eol cycle of OALP which started on 1st July, 2017 and closed on 15th November, 2017. In the first Bid round, 55 blocks, having an area of 59282 sq.km spreading across 11 States have been offered for bidding. The bidding process is being handled through a secured and dedicated e-bidding portal.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today gave its approval for issuing a notification amending clause 3(xiii) of the notification dated 03.11.2015 issued by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural gas under Section 12 of the Oil Fields (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 (ORD Act, 1948). 

 

Due to this amendment relaxation is granted under the Petroleum & Natural Gas Rules 1959 (PNG Rules, 1959), to Coal India Limited (CIL) and its subsidiaries for not applying for grant of license/lease under the PNG Rules, 1959 for extraction of Coal Bed Methane (CBM) under their Coal Bearing Areas.

 

Impact:

The decision is in line with the Government’s initiatives of ‘Ease of Doing Business’.  It will expedite the exploration and exploitation of CBM, enhance the availability of natural gas and reduce the gap in demand and supply of natural gas. The increased development activities for exploration and exploitation of CBM gas reserves in-and-around the block will generate economic activities which in turn has potential to create employment opportunities in CBM operations and in the industries.

 

Background:

Government of India has earlier issued a notification on 03.11:2015 granting rights to CIL and its subsidiaries for exploration and exploitation of CBM from all coal bearing areas for which they possess mining lease for coal. Clause 3(vi) of the Notification provides that the ""Lessee shall submit application under the P&NG Rules 1959 for grant of Mining Lease (ML) for CBM to MoP&NG along with detailed recommendations of Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL).""

                An Indian Consortium consisting of IOCL, BPCL and HPCL and Saudi Aramco signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) here today to jointly develop and build an integrated refinery and petrochemicals complex, Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. (RRPCL) in the State of Maharashtra.  Saudi Aramco may also seek to include a strategic partner to co-invest in the project.  

The strategic partnership brings together crude supply, resources, technologies, experience and expertise of these multiple oil companies with an established commercial presence around the world. 

A pre-feasibility study for the refinery has been completed, and the parties are now finalising the project’s overall configuration. Following the signing of the MoU, the parties will extend their collaboration to discuss the formation of a joint venture that would provide for joint ownership, control and management of the project.

The refinery will be capable of processing 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day (60 million metric tonnes per annum, or MMTPA). It will produce a range of refined petroleum products, including petrol and diesel meeting BS-VI fuel efficiency norms. The Refinery will also provide feedstock for the integrated petrochemicals complex, which will be capable of producing approx. 18 million tonnes per annum of petrochemical products.

In addition to the refinery, cracker and downstream petrochemicals facilities, the project will also include the development of associated facilities such as a logistics, crude oil and product storage terminals, raw water supply project as well as centralised and shared utilities.

RRPCL will rank among the world’s largest refining & petrochemicals projects and will be designed to meet India’s fast-growing fuels and petrochemicals demand.  The project cost is estimated at around Rs.3 lakh crore (USD 44 billion).

Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said that this a joint partnership between the consortium from India consisting of IOCL, HPCL and BPCL and Saudi Aramco & an additional strategic partner on a 50:50 basis.  

The Minister said that this project, with an estimated investment of over Rs. 3 lakh crore, would bring huge benefits to the Region, the State of Maharashtra and the entire country in terms of large-scale employment generation, direct and indirect, as well as all-round economic development of the Region.  This project is in line with the vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister of India and His Highness the King of Saudi Arabia

Saudi Aramco President and CEO, Amin H. Nasser said that the signing of MoU marks a significant development in India’s Oil & Gas Sector. He further stated that participating in this mega project will allow Saudi Aramco to go beyond the role of crude oil supplier to a fully integrated position which supports India’s future energy demands.  He also noted the opening of Aramco Asia’s New Delhi Office in 2017 with a mandate to expand the Saudi Aramco’s international portfolio in this key economic growth region.

                The Prime Minister has announced that on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti  a “Gram Swaraj Abhiyan” would be organised starting from 14th April to 5th May, 2018.  This Abhiyan is being undertaken for reaching out to poor households, spreading awareness about government welfare schemes and other people centric initiatives.

As a special initiative during the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan, universal coverage under seven welfare programmes including Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) in 21058 identified villages with large number of underprivileged households across the country has been contemplated. Highest importance is given to saturate these villages with the benefits of seven welfare programmes. 

 

Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan held a video conference today with all State Heads of LPG representing three Oil Marketing Companies (OMC) and discussed about preparations undertaken for universal coverage of Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana in the identified villages during the campaign period.  OMCs have informed that nearly 15000 LPG Panchayats will be organised on 20th April 2018 as a part of Gram Swaraj Abhiyaan and 15 lakhs LPG connections will be released Under PMUY on the same day to celebrate the Ujjwala Diwas’.

 

Shri Pradhan further directed the OMC officials to saturate the identified villages with 100% LPG coverage on a mission mode and directed the senior officials of the Ministry and Oil PSUs to visit the identified villages to interact with the beneficiaries.

                The Petroleum & Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said that we decided to proactively advance the roll-out of BS-VI fuel in Delhi from April 2018, instead of April 2020 after taking stock of the alarming pollution situation in Delhi in winters.BS-VI fuel will bring down sulphur by 5 times from the current BS-IV levels – this is an 80 percent reductionwhich makes it extremely clean. It will improve emissions from the existing fleet, even from the older vehicles on road. BS-VI is as clean as CNG or even cleaner than CNG in some respects Pradhan said today at the launch of BS-VI compliant automotive fuels in Delhi and addedwe plan to extend the availability of these fuels across the country by 1st April 2020.

 

According to a Centre for Science & Environment study, air pollution takes 10,000-30,000 lives in Delhi every year. We believe that early migration to BS-VI fuels in the National Capital of Delhi will help in saving thousands of precious lives by bringing down vehicular pollution significantly.

 

However, to take full advantage of the availability of such superior fuels, the vehicle technology has to move to BS-VI. Introduction of BS VI fuel will only give partial benefits if BS VI compliant vehicles are not put on the road. I am told that our auto-companies are already making BS VI cars in India and exporting them to developed countries. I am sure they can also do so for our own country. Pradhan appealed to all automobile manufacturers to start selling BS VI vehicles, wherever BS VI fuel is available.

Our Ministry is trying to contribute towards solving the problem of pollution due to agricultural stubble burning and other causes by implementing 2G Ethanol plants,increasing share of gas in primary energy basket from 6% to 15%, initiating 9th Gas Development Bidding Round,Unbundling of Gas sector to promote Gas-based Economy and other measures for Cleaner Fuel.

With the introduction of BSVI, India joins the small list of Asia - Pacific nations -Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines and China. And China he said is using it only for heavy vehicles.

Director General of Centre for Science and Environment SmtSunitaNarain complimented the Ministry for the proactive step.

                Definition of Village Electrification:

Definition of village electrification is a legacy issue which, though, mandates electrification of at least 10 per cent households in a village, but does not imply restricting household electrification only to 10 per cent.As per recent reports from the States, household electrification level in rural areas is more than 82per cent ranging from 47to 100per centacross various States. Had the definition been cause, such level of household electrification could not have been achieved. The variation in level of electrification across various regions and states within the country is primarily because of its size, heterogeneity in terms of topography; location; resources and also because of varying efforts made by the States for household electrification. The Government has already moved out of this dichotomy and launched ‘Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana’- Saubhagya to achieve universal household electrification in the country by 31stDecember 2018. Therefore, the debate over definition of village electrification in the present scenariohas lost the significance.

                The Government kicks off a Pilot Scheme for Procurement of Aggregate Power of 2500 MW on competitive basis for 3 (three) years under medium term i.e. from generators with commissioned projects but without Power Purchase Agreement. The Ministry of Power had recently issued the model bid documents, model PAPP and PPSA on 6th April, 2018. The Guidelines for the said scheme were issued on 10th April, 2018.

PFC Consulting Limited (A wholly owned subsidiary of PFC Ltd) has been appointed as Nodal Agency and PTC India Limited as the Aggregator. PTC India would sign three-year (mid-term) Agreement for Procurement of Power with successful bidders and Power Supply Agreement with the Discoms.

Under the scheme a single entity can be allotted maximum capacity of 600 MW. The Scheme assures a minimum off-take of 55 per cent of contracted capacity. The Tariff will be fixed for three years without any escalation.

PFC Consulting Limited is in process of inviting the bids in first week of May, 2018 under the scheme. The bidding will be conducted on the DEEP e-Bidding Portal and with L1 matching for bucket filling without reverse auction.

This scheme is expected to revive the power demand which has affected the generators not having Power Purchase Agreements.

The Chief Minister stated that he intended to launch the Saubhagya scheme in Meghalaya on the 20th April, 2018, and invited Shri Singh to be present. Shri Singh accepted the invitation and agreed to be present. 

Chief Minister also mentioned that if freight subsidy was provided for the coal meant for power plants, it might help in reducing the electricity rates in the State. 

Both Minsters discussed the ways for expediting the projects stuck-up due to various reasons. On the issue of shifting of a transmission line in Meghalaya (for laying a new railway line), Shri Singh emphasised that this shifting should be done without any disruption of supply to the consumers.

                Indian Railways has emerged as the most preferred mode of transportation given the low cost of transportation, faster service, reliability and safety offered by railway system. Needless to mention that railways are the green mode of transportation. In 2017-18, around 29 million vehicles were produced in country registering a growth of 14.78 percent over the same period last year. Given the current low car penetration, rising prosperity and the increasing affordability of private vehicles, the automobile industry is poised to grow even faster in India.  These vehicles need to be transported to the far flung areas of the country. Indian Railways in recent time have undertaken a number of initiatives to capture automobile traffic. 

Member Traffic, Shri Mohd Jamhsed stated that “Year 2017-18 has witnessed a paradigm shift in the marketing efforts of Indian Railways to attract automobile traffic and enhance our freight basket.  Specially in the later half of 2017-18, under the guidance of Minister of Railways, Shri Piyush Goyal, we decided to liberalise Automobile Freight Train Operator (AFTO) policy to encourage more private investment in special wagons, procurement of our own BCACBM (high-capacity railway wagons) and NMG wagons. In April, 2018, we have taken two game changing decisions to allow handling of automobile from all container terminals and to allow loading automobile and auto spares in privately owned wagons in different directions for optimal utilisation of stock”.

Indian Railways is working closely with automobile industry to develop policies which are mutually beneficial to industry as well as Railways.  The following noteworthy steps have been taken in 2017-18 to attract automobile traffic by Indian Railways:


	Meeting has been conducted with all stake holders in automobile business including Society for Indian Automobiles Manufactures (SIAM), M/s Maruti Suzuki, M/s Hyundai Motors, M/s Tata Motors and automotive logistics providers on 28.09.2017 in Rail Bhawan.
	In view of the issues raised by the stakeholders the AFTO policy has been liberalized viz. registration fees for the AFTO scheme has been reduced from Rs. 5 crore to Rs. 3 crore; and condition of minimum procurement of 3 rakes under the scheme has been relaxed to one rake. The revision was issued on 13.10.2017.
	So far 28 routes have been notified for operation of BCACBM rakes.
	Now, Auto Hubs are already functional at Walajabad (Southern Railway) and Farukhnagar (Northern Railway). Works are underway for up-gradation of facilities at these auto hubs. Further General Manager’s of all Zonal Railways have been asked to identify terminals to be developed as Rail Auto Hubs.
	Conversion of 17 additional NMG rakes has been approved out of which 4 rakes have already been inducted.
	10 BCACBM rakes have been included in Railway's RSP for 2018-19.
	The agreement for licensing of commercial plots at Detroj of Ahmedabad division duly agreed by M/s Maruti Suzuki India Ltd finalized and loading started in March 2018.  


The positive results of these initiatives are visible in the enhancement of automobile loading in 2017-18. During 2017-18, the loading from automobiles traffic has increased by 16% and earning from automobile traffic has increased by 18% as compared to 2016-17.

In April, 2018 Indian Railways has liberalised AFTO Policy. Earlier, the transportation of automobile and auto spare by AFTOs was permitted only in one direction. With the coming up of auto-hubs across the country, this restriction has now been lifted. AFTOs will be able to utilize their rakes for loading in different directions and will be able to optimize the utilization of their rakes. 

The loading of automobile loading was permitted only from auto hubs, Private Freight Terminals’ (PFT) and Railway good sheds with automobile handling facility.  This condition has severely restricted automobile loading on account of limited availability and capacity of such terminals. It has been decided that the automobile loading/unloading shall be permitted from all Inland Container Depots (ICDs), Container terminals managed by Container Train Operators. This shall result in availability of additional 86 locations in addition to the earlier auto hubs, PFTs and Railway good shed with automobile handling facility.

Automobile Industry is quite ecstatic with these reforms and committed to increase market share of Indian Railways in automobile transportation. Railways would certainly emerge as most preferred carrier of automobiles in the country.

                The Union Minister of Railways and Coal, Shri PiyushGoyal chaired a detailed meeting with Chairman Railway Board and Members, Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety, GMs of 5 Railway zones and other senior officials in New Delhi today. During the meeting, he reviewed the plan to completely eliminate Unmanned Level Crossings (UMLCs) from Indian Railways. The meeting started with a 2 minute silence in the memory of the victims of Kushinagar accident. 

The very first meeting held by Shri PiyushGoyal after taking charge as Railway Minister was on Safety Issues on 7th September 2017. He had directed that all UMLCs should be eliminated in the next one year. Significant progress has been achieved in this regard with only 58 UMLCs remaining on the A, B and C routes which account for more than 80% of the Indian Railways traffic.

Indian Railways has taken many steps towards reducing accidents at UMLCs with 79% reduction in UMLC accidents in the last 4 years (47 accidents in 2013-14 reduced to 10 in 2017-18). The average rate of elimination of UMLCs has also increased by nearly two thirds over the last four years. Now only 3,479 UMLCs remain on the Broad Gauge network. 

A multipronged strategy is now planned to eliminate the remaining UMLCs which will include manning of UMLCs, construction of Railway Under Bridges (RUBs), Railway OverBridges, diversion, etc. This will be done through simultaneous execution of work on track sections. A detailed review was done with the GMs of five critical zones (NR, WR,NER, NWR, ECR) with significant number of UMLCs. 

Progress of elimination of UMLCs will also be shared transparently online through a website to increase accountability and public monitoring.

Target for eliminating UMLCs in 11 zones will be September 2018. For the remaining 5 zones targets will be set shortly.

Shri PiyushGoyal reiterated the aim of Safety First for Indian railways and emphasized that every life saved is worth its weight in gold.

                The Union Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal inspected Coaches with new colour scheme along with Minister of State of Youth Affairs & Sports (Independent Charge), and Minister of State of Information & Broadcasting Colonel Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore on 25.04.2018 at New Delhi Railway Station. Chairman Railway Board, Shri Ashwani Lohani , Member Rolling Stock, Railway Board, Shri Ravindra Gupta and General Manager, Northern Railway Shri Vishwesh Chaube were also present on the occasion.

 

Ministry of Railways is considering modifying the exterior color scheme of Integral Coach Factory (ICF) designed conventional coaches running in Mail & Express trains to give them more vibrant and pleasing look. Accordingly, as per direction of Railway Board, Northern Railway painted 7 different color schemes on ICF designed sleeper coaches. These vibrant and innovative color schemes were developed, jointly by National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad and Railways. 

 

After the inspection, it was decided to try out one color scheme with mix of fawn and Teak shade after some improvements. This new color scheme will be first tried out in limited number of coaches on trial basis and based on the feedback. Further proliferation on larger number of ICF designed coaches shall be considered thereafter. Indian Railways is already taking measures to upgrade the interiors of coaches, especially toilets through schemes like Upgrade to Swarn Standard for its premium service like Rajdhanis and Shatabdis, thus passengers can expect a complete makeover of coaches for a more pleasing travel experience in near future.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in the interactive session Bharat Ki Baat Sabke Saath has lauded the efforts of Senior Citizens of India for giving up subsidy for travel in Indian Railways.  While interacting at the event in London, PM recounted his days spent at Railway Station & the enriching experience he gathered there from. PM also noted the remarkable progress made by Indian Railways in Infrastructure creation.

Indian Railways have registered a significant rise in the number of senior citizens who have chosen to give up the subsidy. From 15th August, 2016 to 31st March, 2018 about 40 lakh esteemed senior citizens have voluntarily given up concessions resulting in benefit of Rs. 77 crore  savings to Railways from this single initiative. Option for giving up of concession in passenger fare for senior citizens to the extent of 100% was already available. Further, Indian Railways has popularized it along with giving the option to avail either the full concession provided to them on rail tickets or half of it.

The scheme of “Give it up” Senior Citizen concession has been a great success. Indian Railways is thankful to the citizens, who have opted for giving up senior citizen concession.          

At present, male senior citizens get 40 per cent while women get 50 per cent concession on the total fare. Though there are many categories of passengers including sportspersons and differently-abled persons who avail concessions, the major beneficiaries are in the senior citizen segment.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi recently inaugurated a railway line and passenger train service in the insurgency-infested Kanker district in North Bastar, Chhattisgarh. The much-awaited railway line, which connects Dallirajhara in Balod district to Bhanupratappur in North Bastar was flagged off by the Prime Minister via video-conferencing on the birth anniversary of the architect of Constitution Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar at village Jangla in Bijapur district. The inaugural passenger train was run by all – women staff. 

The railway track is part of the rail project linking Dallirajhara – Rowghat – Jagdalpur, which is 235 km long. With the inauguration of the new line, North Bastar (Kanker) is linked to Durg – Raipur directly. Dallirajhara-Rowghat – Jagdalpur line will reduce rail distance between Raipur to Jagdalpur by about 260 kms. This will boost socio-economic interaction between the capital of Chattisgarh and backward areas in and around Bastar region.

           Apart from boosting people to people interaction, this railway line will contribute to exploration and development of iron ore-rich Rowghat. At present Bhilai Steel Plant gets its iron- ore supplies from Dallirajhara mines. Iron ore reserves of these mines are depleting day by day. In future, Rowghat mines will be the primary source of iron ore for Bhilai Steel Plant.

Dallirajhara – Rowghat – Jagdalpur project is being executed in two phases Dallirajhara to Rowghat (95 kms) and Rowghat to Jagdalpur(140kms). The first phase is being executed by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, a PSU under the Ministry of Railways. It is being funded completely by Steel Authority of India Limited. Out of total 95 kms two sections, Dallirajhara – Rowghat and Rowghat – Bhanupratappur, 17 kms each has been completed and dedicated to the nation. Work on the remaining section of 60 kms is in progress. The second phase between Rowghat to Jagdalpur (140 Kms )is being executed by IRCON, , a PSU under the Ministry of Railways. Cost of this phase is being shared between IRCON(26%), NMDC(43%), SAIL(21%) and Govt. of Chhattisgarh(10%).

This project after completion will bring remote, densely forested areas over rail map of Chhattisgarh. Rowghat will develop as growth point with forward and backward linkages and will have the overall positive impact on economic development of surrounding region. As this line will connect people of this region to Capital City Raipur, it would help open new opportunities of higher education and tertiary medical care for the people of this region. This rail line can truly be said as “Pragati Ki Railgaadi” for people of this region.

                While India is having one of the best runs at CWG 2018, less known is the  Indian Railways contribution in this outstanding effort. Railway Sports Promotion Board’s  (RSPB) 49 athletes and 4 coaches formed a part of the Indian continent in Weightlifting, Wrestling, Hockey, Athletics and Basketball and gymnastics forming around one fourth of the total contingent. Almost entire women hockey team comprised of Railway girls

  It is a matter of great pride that forming 25% of the Indian contingent, RSPB athletes clinched 40% of the total golds won by India. In all the Railway athletes won 10 Golds, 1 Silver and 4 Bronze medals in these CWG games. 

In Wrestling 7 railway wrestlers formed a part of the Indian team and every single one of them bagged medals for India a whopping 100% strike rate !!!. 5 Gold medals were won by Sushil Kumar, Rahul Aware, Sumit Malik , Bajrang and Vinesh  while  Sakshi Malik and Kiran bagged Bronze.

In  Weightlifting  6 out of the 10 Railways’ lifters won a medal for India… 5 of them Gold. While  Mirabai Chanu, Sangita Chanu, Poonam Yadav, Satish Sivalingam and RV Rahul got India the gold; Pradeep bagged a Silver.

In Boxing Manoj Kumar of Railways won a Bronze medal and Navjeet  Dhillon put up a spirited performance winning a Bronze in Discuss throw.

The Railway Sports Promotion Board, which celebrates 90 years of its inception later in 2018, has been doing a yeoman’s job in promoting and nurturing sports in India. Not only does it provide a sustainable source of livelihood through its liberal recruitment policies, but also nurtures the sportspersons with round the year training, camps, diet, medical support and in their post playing years grooms them into coaches and technical support team. With an excellent infrastructure spread throughout the country and its in-house team of coaches and support staff, it provides an unparalleled sports eco system for the 29 games disciplines under its belt.

It is no surprise therefore, that in any international event nearly more than a fourth  of the athletes are from Railways contributing to a substantial chunk of medals for India. Railways coaches, technical officials and support staff form the backbone of the National federations.

As far as Women’s Sports in India is concerned it would be no exaggeration to say that RSPB single handedly has supported the rise of Women's Sports in India thus empowering them and encouraging young girls to pursue sports. One of the first organisations to raise women wrestling team in India, RSPB’s incentive policies including out of turn promotions, increments and the recent policy initiatives 330 days Special Casual Leave for outstanding athletes ; 3-4 camps followed by tournament exposure, off season training has paid rich dividends .

Once again RSPB has convincingly proved Think Sports Think Railways

                The Union Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal today interacted with Food and Beverages Industries Players through video conferencing while fasting from Thane. The meeting was attended by key players from the Food & Beverage industry viz. Hindustan Unilever Limited, Café Coffee Day, Nestle, Travel Food Services, MoM, Bikanerwala, Taj SATS, R.K. Associates, Arenco Catering, Jubliant Food Services, Punjabi Ghasitaram Halwai (P) Ltd., CAFS, etc. The meeting was also attended by Senior officials from Ministry of Railways & IRCTC.

The meeting was held with the objectives to bring on board important suggestions issues, problems faced by key industrial players of F&B industry who are important stake holders in delivery of catering services on Indian Railways. 

Following items were raised in the meeting with key industrial players of F&B industry:-


	Issue of rate of Ala-carte and standard items served on mobile catering having not increased since 2012. 
	Rates should be increased automatically with time by indexing it with WPI/CPI. Market driven prices should be given by Railways with periodical revision.
	Non increase in Rates of food items over years has impacted quality of mobile catering services.
	Adequate arrangement of catering services on non – pantry trains.
	Improvement in Pantry cars and its cleanliness issues.
	Issues of failure of equipments on-board pantry car and non-redressal and to establish a system for their grievances for timely rectification of the same. 
	Members have requested for limiting the entire A-la-carte menu and only bouquet of catering products to just 8 - 12 meals/items and the same be permitted for sale. This will help in reducing overcharging and provide better quality of service.
	Members have suggested that all catering items should be priced in multiples of 5 which will aid the passengers and reduce instances of overcharging. Eradication of unauthorized hawking on station and in trains.
	To follow the airline model having less variety but superior quality.
	Introduction of hot food vending machines on Platforms and trains.
	Ready-to-Eat meal & E-Catering should be proliferated.


 

 

 

 

Minister of Railways touched upon following issues in this freewheeling discussion and dialogue with the players of F&B industry:-

 


	There was a great stress and emphasis by Minister of Railways to warn and discourage the existing Contractors of Catering Services from indulging in corrupt practices or in harassment of customers. He categorically stated that only approved items with the stated quantity and prices as approved in the policy should be served to the customers.
	Appreciating the demands raised by the licensees/contractors, Minister of Railways issued instructions for comprehensive improvement and sprucing up the infrastructure/equipments of the Pantry car and monitoring the same intensively with the use of mobile application.  
	Licensee, Railway and IRCTC are important stakeholders in this endeavor to deliver catering services to bonafide passengers and hence, they should sit together and have a free and frank discourse so as to sort out all the problems and gaps in catering service delivery currently faced by Indian Railways. 
	The Terms and Conditions of existing Contracts should be studied threadbare and solutions related to issues of quality, infrastructure and revision of rates should be found out within that framework so as to move on a sustainable paradigm of catering services. 
	Railway is at the forefront in its service to poor & middle classes population and there should be absolutely no compromise on the quality of services rendered by catering contractors.  In this context, Minister of Railways stressed that all the errant contractors who compromise of quality and indulge in corrupt practices should be shown the door and railway should frame an “Exit Policy” for the same.  
	All the stakeholders in the delivery of catering services should endeavour in reduction of catering complaints of the passengers and to bring about a “Wow” experience.  
	All the waiters/service delivery agents who are at the cutting edge should be counselled and warned against the practice of soliciting tips.  If they are found guilty of the same, they will not only be de-boarded but also blacklisted and booked under relevant provisions of law.
	There was an underline focus to drive home the point that all the caterers/licensees should issue bills/proper receipts and for this POS machines should be proliferated in a big way for both mobile and static catering units over Indian Railways. 
	In order to bring the catering services over Indian Railways in sync with the global best practices, Ready-to-Eat (RTE) meals should be proliferated over Indian Railways in a big way and the long list of number of items served on board trains should be rationalized and standardized.

                Pursuing sustainable growth through preserving the environment is one of the hallmarks of Indian Railways. To further spread its green initiatives, Indian Railways had entered into partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in July 2016. As part of this partnership, CII is facilitating various railways’ production units, workshops and other units go the Green way and in the process equipping them to green the operations and practices. 

CII’s GreenCo Rating System is a first-of-its-kind rating in the world that facilitates companies in improving their overall green performance. GreenCo focus on major environmental areas including- energy efficiency, renewable energy, water conservation, waste management, resource conservation, green supply chain, product stewardship and life cycle assessment. 

As on date, GreenCo Rating is being implemented in 42 facilities (production units and workshops) of Indian Railways. 26 facilities of Indian Railways have achieved rating levels ranging across Certified, Bronze, Silver and Gold levels, while the others are in the process of implementation. More than 400 companies across several sectors from the manufacturing and services verticals are also in the process of this certification.

GreenCo has helped Indian Railways bring in a focused approach towards green practices by strengthening its energy conservation initiatives, facilitating renewable energy opportunities, water management and waste management. Indian Railways has also utilized GreenCo as an opportunity to work with its suppliers in greening their operations. The awareness and training imparted to employees and other relevant stakeholders is extremely impressive. Indian Railways has not only reduced the environmental impact, but has also been realizing substantial benefits, both tangible and intangible. The participation in GreenCo rating process has helped the Indian railways manufacturing units and workshops in achieving approximately Rs 10 crores per year of saving.

Two Railway stations, two Railway schools and administrative buildings of IRICEN, ICF and SCR headquarters have also been certified green as part of this effort.

Green Rating System has been facilitating inculcating green practices in individuals, and across IR as an organization. IR units have started excelling in areas, in addition, have also explored fields that were not in focus earlier and have put in efforts to improve performance.

                Beginning with the introduction of 57 bio-toilets in one train i.e. Gwalior-Varanasi Bundelkhand Express in January 2011, Indian Railways has provided about 1,25,000 bio-toilets in its coaches till March 2018. This covers about 60% of coaching fleet of Indian Railways. During 2017-18, IR has installed highest ever bio-toilets in coaches which is 40% higher than the set target of 40,000 bio-toilets and 64% higher than the fitment of 34134 bio-toilets in 2016-17. 

Presently, Indian Railways have commissioned and operating 27 sections as Green Corridors. All the trains plying on these sections are running with all the coaches equipped with bio-toilets. Thus, there is no direct discharge of human waste from the trains running on these Green Corridors.

“Bio-Toilet project” of Indian Railways is an innovative & indigenous development of technology. This technology is first of its kind being used by any railroad in the world for On-board accelerated digestion of human waste. These bio-toilets are fitted underneath the lavatories and the human waste discharged into them is acted upon by a colony of anaerobic bacteria that convert human waste mainly into water and small amount of bio-gases. The gases escape into atmosphere and waste water is discharged after chlorination onto the track. Human waste, thus, does not fall on the railway tracks thus improving cleanliness and hygiene at platforms, and facilitate track and coaches maintenance staff to perform their work more efficiently. The Bio-toilet project is very much aligned with ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’, launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India.



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The technology for Bio-toilets has been innovated, designed and is ‘Made in India’. It has been developed jointly by Indian Railways’ Engineers & DRDO’s scientists. It is one example where the technology developed for defence applications has been utilised for civilian purpose. Adaption and large scale deployment   of the technology has been facilitated by collaboration between DRDO, RDSO and the field units of Indian Railways. 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As per estimation, approx. 4,000 MT of human waste is discharged from train coaches every day. With the proliferation of bio-toilets in 60% coaches commensurate human discharge in open, has been eliminated. 

In addition to earnest efforts being put in by Indian Railways, the success of this important project largely depends on the co-operation of its valued customers/ passengers by not throwing any in-organic material like paper, bottles, paper/ plastic cups, polythene, napkins, nappies, cloth, ghutka pouches, cigarette/ bidi  buds etc. in toilet pans/ bowls.

                In order to meet the urgent travel requirements of High Official Requisition (HOR) holders, which includes Central Government Ministers, Judges of Hon’ble Supreme Court/High Courts of various States, Members of Parliament and other emergent demands, who are on the waiting list, a limited number of berths have been earmarked as Emergency Quota in different trains and in different classes. The quota is released by the Railways in accordance with the priority as per warrant of precedence and well established practice being followed since long.  At the time of allotment of berths/seats, emergency quota is first allotted for self travel of HOR holders/Members of Parliament, etc., strictly as per their inter-se seniority in warrant of precedence. Thereafter, other requisitions received from various quarters are considered and the remaining quota is released taking into account various factors like status of passengers travelling, nature of urgency like travelling on government duty, bereavement in the family, sickness, job interview, etc.     

Emergency Quota Cells are located at Zonal/Divisional Headquarters and at some of the important non-Headquarter stations.  These Cells normally function under the control of a gazetted officer supported by requisite number of staff posted by Zonal Railways.

                Steps taken by Railways to cut down use of diesel fuel and energy/fuel efficiency in its operation system as under-


	Minimum Inventories of all major Railway Consumer Depot (RCD)s have been reduced from 15 to 5 days.
	Use of B-5 blended High Speed Diesel (HSD) with 5% Biodiesel in the Diesel Locomotives has been started.
	Trip ration is being reviewed properly to tighten the slack trip rationing.
	The performance of loco pilots is being monitored regularly. List of bad & good runners are being identified on the basis of fuel consumption vis-a-vis trip ration. Bad runners are being counseled & monitored by loco inspectors. Monitoring of Loco Pilots using dynamic brakes and performing coasting according to the topography are being done.
	To avoid idle running of the Engine of  Diesel locomotive, a Joint Procedure Order (JPO) has been jointly issued at Railway Board level with operating department and accordingly at Zonal Railways level also for shutting down of diesel locos in case of idling of the locomotive. Monitoring of idling of diesel locomotives has been started through Remote Monitoring and Management of Locomotive and Trains (REMMLOT) fitted in Diesel Locomotive.
	Rationalization of fueling pattern has been implemented based on landed price of HSD oil. The cheaper RCDs are fueling more to diesel locomotive to avoid fueling at costlier location of RCDs.
	All Overaged Broad Gauge Diesel Mixed Traffic Engine (WDM2) locos have been withdrawn from mainline service.
	Conversion of Driving Power Car (DPC) of DEMU trains in dual fuel (Diesel + LNG/CNG) mode has been started to use CNG in place of HSD.
	Auxiliary Power Unit has been introduced in Diesel locos for automatic shutting down of the diesel locomotive while standing idle. 
	Retro-fitment of Micro-processor control system in diesel Locomotives have been executed to achieve fuel efficiency.
	Common Rail electronic Direct Injection (CReDI) system has been developed and are being fitted in Diesel Locomotive. 
	Miller cycle based turbochargers and Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) Turbochargers have been developed for ALCo locomotives to achieve fuel efficiency.


Expected positive results yielded are as under:-


	
	
		
		
			4 % saving in fuel consumption has been realized at Eng Test Bed with the use of CReDI on ALCo locomotive engine and 2.5% saving in fuel consumption on HHP locomotives. 
			Approx. 23 nos. of  DPCs have been converted and running in duel fuel (Diesel + CNG) Mode. Diesel displacement of upto 20% has been achieved.
			Reliability verification testing of Miller cycle based turbocharger has been completed in field. Approx. 2% fuel saving and 20% reduction in NOx is expected by use of miller cycle based turbocharger. Performance evaluation on engine test bed is scheduled in next month.
			Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) turbocharger has been fitted on a WDG3A loco and 2.5% fuel saving (approx.) has been realized on test bed.
		
		
	
	


Details of plan for use of solar energy are as under:-

 


	 Indian railways has planned for 1000 MW of solar power plants by 2020-21 with 500 MW at railway rooftops for non-traction use and 500 MW land based for mostly in traction use. The solar power from land based plants shall be mostly used in train operation.
	 IROAF is implementing provision of Solar Panels on roof top of coaches and Brake Vans of freight trains for taking up part hotel load (electric lighting and fans load).
	 In Goods train, Solar Panels on trial basis have been fitted on the roof top of 50 Nos. Guard Brake Vans.
	 In passenger Trains Solar panels on trial basis has been fitted on the roof top of 06 Nos. Trailer Coaches of Diesel Electric Multiple Units (DEMU).
	 Indian Railways has planned for 1000 MW of solar power plants by 2020-21 with 500 MW at railway rooftops for non-traction use and 500 MW land based for traction use. The solar power from land based plants shall be used in train operation.
	 Tender for 700 Nos. more Guard Brake Vans is likely to be uploaded by March, 2018 end.
	 Tender case for 250 Nos. Trailer Coaches of DEMU for Flexi Solar Panels was discharged and Re-Tender is expected to be completed by the end of March, 2018.
	 The fitment of Solar Panel is also planned in 10 Exhibition Coaches of Swachhata  Express, which is to be flagged off in April, 2018.

                Maintaining cleanliness is a continuous process and every endeavour is made to keep the coaches including toilets in properly maintained and in clean condition.  Some of the major initiatives taken by Indian Railways towards improvement of cleanliness in trains are as follows:

(i) Cleaning of train coaches including toilets of trains is done at both ends including mechanized cleaning. 

(ii) On Board Housekeeping Service (OBHS) has been provided in more than 980 pairs of trains including Rajdhani, Shatabdi and other important long distance Mail/Express trains for cleaning of coach toilets, doorways, aisles and passenger compartments during the run of the trains.

                In order to boost Ease of doing Business in Indian Railways, Research Design & Standards Organization (RDSO) is keenly approaching Indian industry through Vendor meets being organized in various cities where senior officers of RDSO interact with the prospective vendors, educate them about the features and ease of using the new online vendor registration system.

 The first such vendor meet in coordination with Laghu Udyog Bharti, Rajkot was organized on 24.01.2018 at Rajkot in which Queries/Doubts from the around 200 vendors present were resolved on the spot by senior officials in a Question-Answer session. Similar Vendor meets have since been held at other cities such as Faridabad, Ludhiana, Sahibabad, Coimbatore, Pune and Noida on 22.02.2018, 07.03.2018, 09.03.2018, 15.03.2018, 04.04.2018 and 05.04.2018 respectively. The efforts are being very well appreciated by industry. Further such meets are planned in April and May 2018 at seven more places. Details are as under:-

As a result of these actions, applications for fresh registration for RDSO items have increased from about 25 (average) per month earlier to 60 (average) per month now. From the period 01.11.2017 to 16.03.2018 RDSO has created 1231 nos. of Vendor Account Registration, Received payments in 208 cases and 27 Vendors delisted.  

In this way, RDSO has opened up its arms to the Indian industry and poised itself as an industry friendly organisation. This has been very well received and appreciated by one and all.

These machines were inaugurated and flagged off by Shri M.K. Gupta, Member Engineering, Railway Board at Faridabad. Seven number of such machines are planned to be included within next six months in the present fleet of 874 track maintenance machines over IR for deployment on heavy density Routes. 

 

The New 09-3X- Dynamic Tamping Express costing about ₹ 27Cr each is a latest high output integrated tamping machine having multiple functions, so far being carried out by different machines. It can measure pre & post track geometry, correct the track to required geometry, can tamp three sleepers simultaneously, stabilize and measure post tamping track parameters under load to ensure quality of work done. This eliminates the need for a separate stabilisation machine which reduces operating costs and track possession time. This machine will vibrate & compact the loose stone ballast after tamping for safe movements of trains. These machines have been manufactured in India under MAKE IN INDIA initiative with imported components. 42 more such machines have been planned to be included in Indian Railway maintenance fleet over next three years. This will further improve the safety, reliability and economy in maintenance of tracks over Indian Railways. This will also eliminate manual measurement of track quality after maintenance.

 

Three operations including manual interface is now combined in one machine.                                          

               

Tamper                        +        Stabilizer      +     Post Tamping Parameters   =          09-3XDynamic   

 

For practical hands-on training to operate such advanced track maintenance machines a new 3D state-of-the-art tamping simulator has been installed and commissioned at Indian Railway Track Machine Training Centre Allahabad (IRTMTC) recently. This type of advanced technology simulator is presently available only in five countries including India.

                          

 

India Railway has planned complete mechanisation of inspection, monitoring, relaying and maintenance of track by 2024. Sh A.K. Khandelwal, Executive Director Track Machines, Railway Board and Siegfried Fink, MD, Plasser India were also present during the inspection and Commissioning of these machines at Faridabad.

                Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP to provide better protection and security of passenger area & passengers and for matters connected therewith. Policing on Railways being a State subject, prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains are the statutory responsibility of the State Governments, which they discharge through Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police. 

The following steps are being taken by the Railways to provide security to passengers- 

1. On vulnerable and identified routes/sections, 2500 trains (on an average) are escorted by Railway Protection Force daily, in addition to 2200 trains escorted by Government Railway Police of different States daily. 

2. Security Help Line number 182 is made operational over Indian Railways for security related assistance to passengers in distress.  

3. Surveillance is kept through CCTV cameras, provided at about 394 stations over Indian Railways, to ensure safety and security of passengers. 

4. An Integrated Security System (ISS) consisting of surveillance of vulnerable stations through Close Circuit Television Camera Network, Access Control etc. has been sanctioned to improve surveillance mechanism over 202 railway stations. 

5. Through various social media platforms viz. Twitter, Facebook etc., Railways are in regular touch with passengers to enhance security of passengers and to address their security concern. 

6. Drives are conducted from time to time against the entry of unauthorized persons in trains and railway premises. 

7. Regular coordination is made with the State Police/GRP authorities at all levels for prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains.

                Improvement of catering services is an on-going process. In its endeavour to provide quality and hygienic food to the passengers, a new Catering Policy has been issued on 27th February 2017. As per Catering Policy 2017, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC) has been mandated to carry out the unbundling by creating a distinction primarily between food preparation and food distribution on trains. In order to upgrade quality of food preparation, IRCTC is to set up new kitchens and upgrade existing ones. Further, detailed instructions/guidelines have been issued to the Zonal Railways for conducting joint inspections by Medical, Commercial and concerned infrastructure maintenance departments to inspect each and every catering unit (mobile and static) including base kitchens/cell kitchens on all Railway divisions/zones. Apart from this, regular and surprise inspections are done by Food Safety Officers, Designated Officers and Joint Food Safety Commissioners. A joint team of ticket checking staff and RPF/GRP staff also conduct surprise checks to prevent unauthorised vending on stations and trains. General Managers of the Zonal Railways have been requested to monitor such drives personally. Food samples collected by Food Safety Officers are sent to the nominated accredited Laboratories under Food Safety & Standard Act for analysis and testing. Penalties are imposed in cases of detection of unsatisfactory food samples and prosecutions are carried out as per provisions of Food Safety & Standard Rule -2011. 

At present, 378 mobile and 9208 static catering units are operational in Indian Railways. As per Catering Policy 2017, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC) has been mandated to carry out the unbundling by creating a distinction primarily between food preparation and food distribution on trains. At present, IRCTC has taken over almost all mobile units in phased manner from Zonal Railways and they are contracting out mobile units centrally. Details of the names of the contractors (companies/firms) providing catering services in trains are as under:-

                With a view to provide more accommodation to travelling passengers, Indian Railways, subject to operational feasibility, commercial viability and availability of resources, augments the load of existing services, which is an on-going process. 

Indian Railways, as a matter of policy, have already decided that all the Mail/Express trains (except fully reserved trains like Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto, etc.) introduced after 2007-08, shall have at least 6 general class coaches in their standard composition as per feasibility. Besides, to cater to the travelling needs of General Class passengers, Indian Railways operates fully unreserved services like Jan Sadharan, Janseva, Jan Nayak Express and also operates Passenger trains and Intercity services for short distance travel. With this end in view, Indian Railways in the Railway Budget 2016-17, has announced to introduce the Antyodaya Express, a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service, and also to add two to four Deen Dayalu coaches in some long distance trains for unreserved travel to enhance the carrying capacity for the unreserved class passengers. 4 pairs of Antyodaya trains have already been introduced so far. 

Accordingly, 507 coaches including 150 General class coaches have been attached on permanent basis during the year 2017-18 up to February 2018, in existing trains. 

Further, to clear extra rush of passengers during festive season, vacations, religious congregations (like Kumbh, Ardh Kumbh, Sabrimala, Urs, etc.), Melas, etc., Indian Railways to the extent feasible and justified, not only operates special trains but also augments the loads of existing trains to create extra accommodation for travelling passengers. With this end in view, Indian Railways operated 33,775 trips of special trains and utilized 91,958 coach trips, during the year 2017-18 (up to February 2018), which is also an on-going process on Indian Railways.

                Agreements have been signed with ALSTOM (France) and General Electric (USA) for manufacturing and maintenance of electric and diesel locomotives. As per contract 800 electric locomotives and 1000 diesel locomotives are to be manufactured and supplied from the factory set up by the companies at Madhepura (Bihar) and Marhowra (Bihar) respectively over a period of 11 years. Two Joint Venture (JV) companies have been set up for this purpose. Ministry of Railways is a 26% stakeholder in these two JV companies. The companies would also undertake maintenance/supervision of the first 500 locomotives by setting up maintenance facilities at Saharanpur, Nagpur, Roza and Ghandhidham.

The project envisages transfer of technology for maintenance to Indian Railway staff in terms of providing benchmarking of maintenance facilities as well as global practices in undertaking maintenance of these locomotives. The maintenance facilities would revert back to the Indian Railways on completion of the maintenance obligations following which the maintenance would be carried out by Indian Railways staff. These projects were approved by the Cabinet in 2010 and subsequently the bidding documents were also approved by the Cabinet in 2014. The companies were selected through an international competitive bidding process. Compliance to the requirement of national security and public interest is a part of the eligibility criteria.

The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) of Government of India had issued the consolidated Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy which allows FDI in Railway Infrastructure sector on automatic route in the areas namely :- 

(i) Suburban corridor projects through PPP; 

(ii) High speed train project; 

(iii) Dedicated freight lines; 

(iv) Rolling stock including train sets and locomotive/coaches manufacturing and maintenance facilities; 

(v) Railway Electrification; 

(vi) Signalling systems; 

(vii) Passenger terminals; 

(viii)Infrastructure in industrial part pertaining to railway line/sidings including electrified railway lines and connectivities to main railway line; and 

(ix) Mass Rapid Transport Systems. 

Further, the Indian Railways undertakes outsourcing of certain facilities like cleaning, pay and use toilets, retiring rooms, parking etc. on need based manner to improve efficiency. 

Interest of the railway staff is taken into consideration while outsourcing.

                There is a well established system of inspection of bridges on Indian Railways. All the bridges are inspected twice a year, one before the onset of monsoon and one detailed inspection after the monsoon. In addition, certain bridges are also inspected more frequently depending upon their condition. Repair / strengthening / rehabilitation / rebuilding of railway bridges is a continuous process and is undertaken whenever so warranted by their physical condition as ascertained during these inspections and not on the basis of age. If the corrective / remedial measures are expected to take a long duration due to the complexity of the site situation, etc., suitable safety measures like imposing speed restrictions and keeping such bridge under close watch are taken till the bridge is repaired / strengthened / rehabilitated / rebuilt. During last five year (2012-13 to 2016-17), a total of 3675 bridges have been repaired / strengthened / rehabilitated / rebuilt on Indian Railways. As on 01.04.2017, a total of 3017 railway bridges are sanctioned for repaired / strengthened / rehabilitated / rebuilt.

                First Aid Boxes containing essential drugs and dressing materials are provided with the guards of all passenger carrying trains. In addition, Augmented First Aid Boxes with wide range of medicines, disposable medical material, etc. have been provided with the Train Superintendents/ Guards of Rajdhani/Shatabdi Express trains and some nominated trains. Front line staffs deployed on trains are also trained in rendering First Aid. The Station Masters of all stations have details of doctors, clinics and hospitals, both Government and Private, in the vicinity of the station, so that their services could also be availed, in emergencies. Ambulance services of both Railway hospitals and State Governments are utilized when required. 

A pilot project of deployment of doctors in Duronto Trains was undertaken for a period of two years. During the Pilot Project, it was noted that serious patient could not be treated on board and had to be de-trained for medical treatment at a hospital only because the medical equipments, such as ECG machines etc. do not function properly on the trains due to noise/ vibration etc. 

The issue of rendering Medical Assistance/ First Aid to the passengers was examined by Hon’ble Supreme Court and it was ordered that a committee of experts be constituted by All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and recommendations of the committee be implemented by Ministry of Railways. Accordingly, the recommendations of the committee were obtained and have been implemented.

                It has been decided to eliminate all Unmanned Level Crossings (UMLCs) on Broad Gauge (BG) route in next 2 years by either of the following methods:- 


	Closure – Closing unmanned level crossings having NIL/negligible Train Vehicle Unit (TVU). 
	Merger – Merger of unmanned level crossing to nearby manned or unmanned gates or subway/Road Under Bridge (RUB)/Road Over Bridge (ROB) by construction of diversion road. 
	Provision of Subways/RUBs. 
	Manning – The unmanned level crossings which cannot be eliminated by above means will be progressively manned based on rail-road traffic volume, visibility conditions. 


 

Other steps taken to avoid accidents at level crossings are as follows: 

(i) Global Positioning System (GPS) tracker to ensure presence of Gate Mitra at UMLCs will be provided by June 2018. 

(ii) Public awareness campaigns are being done at different places like villages, Gram Panchayat, weekly market, bus stands, schools and other public places. 

(iii) Periodic inspection of such level crossings is being carried out. 

(iv) Social awareness campaigns are being done to educate road users with the use of print and electronic media for observance of safe practices prescribed in Motor Vehicles Act and Indian Railways Act. 

(v) Short Message Service (SMS) campaigns are being done to create awareness amongst road users. 

(vi) Nukkad Nataks are being organized at public places with theme “Safety at Level Crossings”. 

(vii) Joint ambush checks along with civil police are being carried out to counter misadventure in front of approaching trains. 

(viii) Level crossing awareness week is being organized every year in June by the Zonal Railways.

                A Multi Modal Logistics Park at Balli Station near Madgaon in Goa state on Konkan Railway route was inaugurated by CMD Konkan Railway Shri Sanjay Gupta and   P K Agarwal, Director, Container Corporation on 28.03.2018. The park has been set up with an investment of Rs 43 Cr. as per the MoU entered between Konkan Railway & Container Corporation of India Ltd.(CONCOR).

 

 

The distance between JNPT port of Mumbai and Goa is around 650 Km. Presently containers from Goa reach JNPT via road in 30-40 hrs. After completion of Container Depot at Balli the containers could reach JNPT within 16 to 18 hrs which will not only save the time but also cost of transportation, relieving congestion on road and last but not least the fuel which in turn would affect reduction in pollution. 

Both Trade & Industry in Goa will greatly benefit from the economic transport solutions & state of the art facilities that CONCOR will be providing in partnership with Konkan Railway at this facility. In the first year of operations itself, the facility is likely to generate additional source of revenue for Konkan Railway.

 

The facility is initially spread over 81,300 square meters with a scope for expansion as the traffic may grow in future. This Logistics Park will be able to handle both Domestic and Exim Container Traffic. In addition to container traffic, commodities transported by both open and covered wagons can also be handled from here. 5000 square meters of Custom Bonded Warehousing space is also being created and a host of value added services like stuffing, repackaging etc will be available to its users.

                Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that road safety is a matter of national  concern,  and only active cooperation of all stakeholders can reduce the number of road accidents and related fatalities in the country. Inaugurating a Workshop with Industries on Road Safety in New Delhi today, the Minister noted with concern that India has the world’s largest number of deaths due to road accidents. He called upon industry leaders and other stakeholders to take a pledge to help bring the number of fatalities down by 50 percent.  Shri Gadkari said that in the last few years all stakeholders including the corporates, automobile manufacturers, NGOs and the governments have made collective efforts in this direction, resulting in a small reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents, but a lot more needs to be done in this regard.  

Outlining the initiatives and steps taken to improve vehicle safety and overall road safety, the Minister said his ministry has adopted the 4E principles of Education, Enforcement, Engineering and Emergency care to address the problem of road safety. For ensuring vehicular safety, the standards of buses have been upgraded, air bags and speed alert device have been made mandatory for all cars, and every two-wheeler will have ABS to avoid skidding. He said, the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2017, waiting to be cleared by Rajya Sabha, comprehensively promotes safety on the road. It would also promote the development of an efficient, seamless and integrated multi-mode public transport system. 

Laying a lot of stress on improved road engineering, Shri Gadkari said that his Ministry has identified 789 black spots on national highways across the country and these are being rectified on a priority basis. He called upon the corporates to come forward in identifying more such black spots in the country so that these too can be rectified. He also called upon them to come up with technology that can ensure better and safer roads for the users. In addition to this, the Minister solicited the cooperation of the corporate houses for getting health check-ups done for drivers. 

Addressing the workshop, Union Health Minister Shri J P Nadda emphasized upon the triple principals of Law, Awareness and Enforcement. He insisted upon behavioral, cultural and environmental changes for avoiding accidents. The Minister outlined his ministry’s initiatives on first respondent training, organ donation, etc. He informed that in order to reduce mortality and morbidity occurring due to road traffic injuries, his ministry is implementing “National programme for Trauma Care” with a focus on improving pre-hospital, hospital & rehabilitative services for injury victims. He said, National Injury Surveillance (NIS), Trauma Registry and Capacity Building Centre have been established at Dr. RML Hospital. NIS has been connected to eight Government Hospitals of Delhi for collection of injury related data. Under NHM, support is also being provided for more than 8,800 Dial-108 ambulances which is predominantly an Emergency Response System (ERS), primarily designed to attend to patients of critical care, trauma & accident victims etc.

The workshop is being conducted as part of MoRTH’s Road Safety Week. It is being attended by senior representatives from leading industry and business bodies including ASSOCHAM, FICCI, CII, SIAM, Uber, Ola, etc. FICCI has committed to undertake road safety awareness campaigns in schools. It has instituted road safety awards, entries for which will soon be invited. A walkathon will be organized between Delhi and Chandigarh. 8000 members of CII committed for enforcing helmet discipline in their premises. They also offered to conduct medical check-ups for commercial drivers and improve road safety. ASSOCHAM representative pointed out the need to improve road infrastructure in hilly areas, and assured their commitment to work with the government. SIAM is creating a strong database of accidents for providing road safety through better analysis of the causes. It has also promised to triple its driver training output. Uber India has committed to provide medical and eye care to 4.5 lakh driver partners in the next six months, while Ola has promised to provide similar facilities to one million drivers in three years.

The Ministry organizes the Road Safety Week every year to create awareness among public and improve upon the safety of road users. This year, Road Safety Week is being organized from 23rd to 29th of April and the focus is on schools and commercial drivers.

                Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that India is exploring an agreement with South Korea for introduction of Highways Information System in the country. This would be developed on lines of the system run by the Express Highways Information Corporation of South Korea, with integrated monitoring of a highway at a centralized control room. 

Inaugurating the 29th National Road Safety Week in New Delhi’s Vigyan Bhavan today, the Minister spelt out the ministry’s priorities in ensuring safety of road users in the country. He informed that he has fixed a target of bringing down the number of road fatalities to half from the around 1.5 lakh accidental deaths reported when he took over. Shri Gadkari said, though progress has been achieved in this respect, he is still not satisfied and aspires to keep working in this direction.

The Ministry organizes the Road Safety Week every year to create awareness among general public and improve upon the safety of road users. This year, Road Safety Week is being organized from 23rd to 29th of April and the focus is on schools and commercial drivers. Addressing the participants Shri Gadkari requested that every student be made a road safety ambassador for his family and for the society. Various activities have been organized for school / college students, drivers and all road users. 

The Minister gave away awards to fifteen school children who won the national level essay competition on road safety.

Outlining the initiatives and steps taken to improve vehicle safety and overall road safety, the Minister said his ministry has adopted the 4E principles of Education, Enforcement, Engineering and Emergency care to address the problem of road safety. For ensuring vehicular safety, the standards of buses have been upgraded, air bags and speed alert device have been made mandatory for all cars, and every two-wheeler will have ABS to avoid skidding. He said, the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2017, passed by Lok Sabha is waiting to be cleared by Rajya Sabha. This bill comprehensively promotes safety on the road. It would also promote the development of an efficient, seamless and integrated multi-mode public transport system. 

The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has launched a scheme for setting up of Driving Training Centre to provide quality training to commercial vehicle drivers, improve road and environment safety and strengthen overall mobility on roads. 789 road accident black spots have been identified on NHs of which 139 black spots are rectified, work on 233 black spots are awarded and in progress. Ministry had issued guidelines for taking up of Road Safety Audits on National Highways either as part of all new projects. Detailed Road Safety Audits in a length of 610 km have been sanctioned on National Highways in last two years. Installation of crash barriers at accident prone locations on National Highways in Hilly Terrain has been sanctioned in a length of 183 Km at a cost of Rs 108.25 crore.

Shri Gadkari also released a paper on road safety by Indian Road Safety Campaign. IRSC is a youth led national mission promoting road safety, led by students and alumni of IIT Delhi. It is currently working on creating awareness on road safety, developing technologies, simplifying laws and improving the post-accident emergency care system. IRSC organizes an annual road safety championship called as the Safer India Challenge in collaboration with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and various state polices involving the youth to come up with innovations in this area. The Safer India Challenge’18 was launched on the occasion. In addition to this the Minister also released a short story collection on road safety theme entitled “Have a safe journey”

                The Group of Ministers on Transport constituted by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has recommended a uniform structure of road tax for vehicles across states. In its meeting held  in Guwahati today, the GoM observed that a uniform tax structure will put a   check  on people registering their vehicles in low tax states and running them in other states.   This would also bring necessary relief to genuine cases requiring transfer of vehicles.

The GoM, headed by Shri Yunus Khan, Minister for Transport, Rajasthan and comprising State Transport Ministers, seeks to find solutions to the various problems plaguing the road transport sector in the country so as to improve road safety and facilitate ease of transport. Today’s meeting in Guwahati, inaugurated by Assam Chief Minister Shri SarbanandaSonowal,was held to deliberate upon One Nation- One Tax and One Nation- One Permit proposal. 

The GoM has also recommended a national bus and taxi permit on lines of such permit for goods transport. Public transport in the country is growing annually at a rate of just about 2 percent, as against a 20 percent annual growth in private transport.  A national permit will give the much needed fillip to public transport and help reduce road  congestion and its attendant problems.

In order to promote alternate fuel for vehicles the GoM had proposed liberalization of permit system for electric vehicles. In addition, it has recommended raising the tax on diesel vehicles by 2 percent while lowering the tax on electric vehicles.

                Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that reduction in logistics cost can substantially increase the country’s exports. He said, the government is concentrating on road improvement, reducing traffic density and introduction of alternative sources of fuels for the transport sector. All highways with over ten thousand PCU road density are being upgraded to four lanes, those with over twenty thousand PCU traffic units to six lanes and those with over thirty thousand PCU to eight lanes.

Launching the joint study report on Insurance Requirements of the Indian Logistics and Warehousing Industry and their Customers in New Delhi today, the Minister informed that his Ministry has understood the need for bioethanol to fully cater to the gasoline blending demands of the nation. There is a potential for  producing around 30 billion litres of ethanol annually from surplus agro-residues in the country. He also highlighted the importance of logistics and collection models suited for the country.  

The research study has been conducted by Transport Corporation of India and the Insurance Institute of India. It aims at providing an academic base for the Logistics and Warehousing Industry to educate their customers on utilising the full potential of insurance mechanism. It is understood that the report will help the logistics industry to protect their business interests in a better way.

                Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has announced development of a new highway alignment between Delhi and Mumbai. A sum of one lakh crore rupees will be spent on this expressway. The Minister also disclosed plans for a Chambal Expressway which would be connected to this Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, and is likely to benefit states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where the backward areas will also shine like Gurugram.

Addressing a media event in New Delhi today, Shri Nitin Gadkari outlined major initiatives of his ministry for de-congestion of Delhi NCR. A total of ten projects are underway costing 35,600 crore rupees. He said, about forty thousand commercial vehicles enter Delhi on a daily basis, which cause increased pollution and congestion in the city state. An ambitious scheme of developing Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways around Delhi was taken up, and the Eastern Peripheral Expressway will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on the 29th of this month. Similarly, to ease traffic in East Delhi, Delhi-Meerut Expressway was envisaged, and its Delhi-Dasna portion will also be inaugurated by PM on 29thApril by a road show.

Shri Gadkari informed that work on signal free corridor from Dhaula Kuan to Airport has been awarded at a cost of 260 crore rupees. He said, eight-lane fully access-controlled Dwarka Expressway is being developed in four packages. While three packages have already been awarded, the work on the Expressway is likely to start in a month’s time. Total investment on the project is 9500 crore rupees. Additionally, under improvement of Mahipalpur at Rangpuri, a bypass is being envisaged to connect Dwarka/ NH8. Regarding development of major junctions on NH8 in Gurugram like the flyover/ underpass at IFFCO Chowk, Signature Tower intersection, Rajiv Chowk and  Hero Honda Chowk,  the Minister informed that the work, costing Rs 1000 crore, has been substantially completed.

Expenditure of Rs 1,16,324 crore was incurred on construction of National Highways during the year 2017-18.

Addressing media in New Delhi today, the Minister announced adoption of international system of counting of Lane Kilometres from the coming Financial Year onwards. He said, the ministry has so far been calculating construction of National Highways in linear length, which did not truly reflected the amount of work completed. 

Shri Gadkari informed that the work on construction of Eastern Peripheral Expressway is almost completed, and will soon be opened for public. This fully access-controlled expressway has entry and exit points through designated interchanges only. Toll will be collected only for the distance travelled, for which, toll plazas will be equipped with electronic toll collection system. The Minister said, this project worth Rs 4420 crore is going to be completed in a record time of about 500 days, against the targeted 910 days. This will be the first expressway to be fully solar powered. Eight solar power plants of four megawatt capacity have been installed on the expressway. The expressway will reduce pollution and decongest the national capital, as non-delhi bound commercial vehicles will not entre the city.

 The Minister also announced that the work on construction of 14-lane highway from Delhi to Dasna, under the ambitious Delhi-Meerut Highway project, will be completed in record time of 15 months, against the targeted 30 months. A cycle track of 2.5 metres on both sides of the highway is a unique feature. Two new 4-lane bridges on both sides of the existing major bridge on river Yamuna will convert it to a 16-lane bridge. This is the first bridge in the country to have vertical gardens with solar system and drip irrigation.

                With near universal geo-tagging of assets and payment of wages and materials through the Electronic Fund Management System (EFMS), a transparent Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has made concerted efforts to create durable assets. The thrust has been on Natural Resource Management (NRM), both on community and individual beneficiary lands of small and marginal farmers.  Due to these concerted efforts, 143 lakh hectares have benefitted through Water Conservation efforts under MGNREGS over the last 3 years.  This includes construction of over 11 lakh farm ponds in the last 2 years, large scale Water Conservation Schemes and vermi composting pits.  National evaluation by Institute of Economic Growth, New Delhi and assessment of individual beneficiary schemes for livelihood by Council for Social Development have indicated improvements in productivity, acreage, incomes and water table through MGNREGS works.  All State Governments have taken keen interest to use MGNREGS as a livelihood resource even under individual beneficiary schemes for poultry sheds, goat sheds, dairy sheds etc.  90 days of wage labour under Pradhan MantriAwaasYojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) housing and Rs. 12,000/- for household toilet wherever SBM Resources are not available has been provided under PMAY-G.

 

        Considering the importance of Water Conservation especially during April to June period of peak demand for work in rural areas, the Government of India has released adequate funds for large scale thrust on completing 43.62 lakh Natural Resource Management works which are under implementation.  It has also urged the States to accord maximum priority to Water Conservation works during the first quarter of 2018-19 including River Rejuvenation.  Successes in River Rejuvenation have encouraged MGNREGS to undertake similar works in other States as well.  The Hon’ble Prime Minister on the National Panchayati Raj Diwas on April 24, 2018 has exhorted Gram Panchayat Pradhans to lead a Community owned movement for Water Conservation using MGNREGS resources to insulate villages from vagaries of monsoon.  On the 25th April 2018, Hon’ble Prime Minister has urged all the Chief Secretaries of States in the Pragati Review to assign top most priority to Water Conservation works under MGNREGS in the April to June period.  There are no fund constraints in any State and technical training to field functionaries for Natural Resource Management has been given under the Samarthya Capacity Development Programmein partnership with Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, Department of Land Resources and Central Ground Water Board as part of the thrust on 2,264 stressed Blocks under Mission Water Conservation.

                Roads are primary to any development agenda. PMGSY, since its inception in 2000, has been able to provide connectivity to 1,52,124 habitations (85.37% against 1,78,184 eligible habitations). Sensing the importance and urgency of rural roads for national development the target date for completion of PMGSY-I has been preponed from 2022 to 2019. Working towards this accelerated target, sanctions have been given to 1,66,012 habitations (93%) against the target of 1,78,184 eligible habitations. PMGSY through its all-weather roads has contributed this key ingredient of development to 11,499 new unconnected habitations for the first time in 2017-18. 

Less than 1% eligible habitations remain to be sanctioned for new connectivity under PMGSY, remaining 6% habitations are either not-feasible or sanctioned by the States from their own resources. Connectivity has been provided to 1,52,124 habitations (including 16,380 habitations connected by the States). In addition, 2109 habitations of 100-249 population have been connected. Under the program, 5,50,533 kms of road length has been constructed.

This centrally sponsored programme implemented in partnership with the state governments, has seen greater focus and consistent improvement in pace and quality in the last three years. The pace of construction of PMGSY roads reached an 8 year high of 134 kms per day in 2017-18 as against an average of 73 kms during the period 2011 to 2014. A total of 48,751 kms of PMGSY roads, connecting 11,499 eligible habitations have been constructed in 2017-18 at an average rate of 134 kms per day. Year-wise progress is as under:

PMGSY II was launched in 2012-13, so far, 13 states have moved to stage II of the programme. As against a target of 50,000 km, 32,024 km has been sanctioned and 17,705 km road length has been upgraded. Other states are likely to move to PMGSY II in FY 2018-19.

Cabinet has approved a special project for Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremist Areas (RCPLWE) in December 2016. Out of 340 roads of 5,411.81 kms and 126 bridges approved by the Cabinet 268 roads of 4,134.69 km and 181 bridges were also sanctioned in 2017-18. Works in these areas are likely to be completed by 2020. This is over and above the special provision for 100-249 population villages in 267 LWE Blocks, where work is likely to be completed by 2020.

Improving roads, improving lives  

PMGSY not only strives to build roads but good quality roads. The in-built frame work of Quality Management mechanism in PMGSY is a combination of in-house quality control measures and independent verification at state and national levels. 39,811 inspections by State Quality Monitors (SQMs) and 9,204 inspections by National Quality Monitors (NQMs) at the National level were done in 2017-18. This intensified Monitoring has impacted Quality grading positively; 13.98% completed roads were graded as unsatisfactory in 2013-14, the quality of roads has improved substantially, in 2017-18 with 7.46% completed roads graded as unsatisfactory. Rectifications are carried on these roads after the inspections to remove all inconsistencies. 

Transparency 

As a measure of Transparency and Accountability, the scheme has put in place a Citizen Feedback system through the MeriSadak App. In addition to Hindi and English, the App is available in 10 regional languages also. This provides a direct interface with the citizens and this G2C platform enables citizens to provide real time feedback on the implementation of the PMGSY programme. Out of 25,414, complaints/feedback related to PMGSY, final replies have been sent in 24,791(97%) cases. 

New Technology; green roads

Use of non-conventional, locally available construction materials (waste plastic, cold mix, fly ash, jute and coir geo-textiles, iron and copper slag, cell filled concrete, paneled cement concrete etc.) and “Green Technologies” have been encouraged for climate resilient roads in PMGSY. There has been wide acceptability of these technologies. In the last few years, 33,888 km of road length has been sanctioned and 17,785 km of road length has been constructed. During the financial year 2017-18, a record length of 6,313 kms has been constructed using green technologies. Rajasthan, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Jharkhand are using this in building green PMGSY roads.

 

Key Priorities for PMGSY for financial year 2018-19

All eligible habitations under PMGSY-I are targeted to be completed by March 2019. Accordingly, Ministry has set a target of construction of 61,000 kms road length by providing connectivity to 19,725 habitations during the financial year 2018-19. Similarly, a target of about 12,000 kms has been set for construction of roads using green technologies. During the financial year 2018-19, about 8,670 inspections of National Quality Monitors and 35,630 inspections of State Quality Monitors are targeted to be completed.

Community Contracting initiative in Rural Roads.

 

Maintenance of roads assets created under PMGSY is a big focus for the Ministry and through various advocacy workshops etc Rural Road Maintenance policies have been framed for 23 States. Maintenance software eMarg used in MP will be replicated in all states to streamline maintenance systems of rural roads. 

A pilot was initiated by the Ministry to involve SHGs in roads maintenance. Uttarakhand Rural Roads Development Agency (URRDA) under the guidance of National Rural Roads Development Agency (NRRDA) initiated Community Contracting for “Off-Carriageway Maintenance” in rural roads through the registered all Women Mahila Mangal Dal (MMD). Community contracting for roads maintenance is not only used as a tool for empowerment of women, it also empowers the community to maintain roads especially in hilly terrains. This model has been successfully tried in Badwani District of MP as well.

 

Use of IT

 

Satellite imagery is being used to verify the completion of road length being reported by States on the programme software i.e. OMMAS as well as to verify habitation connectivity.  The work of GIS has commenced in all the Districts in the 28 States and GIS has been completed in 19 States. Further use of geo spatial technology for mapping rural roads built under PMGSY are being geo mapped using remote sensing technology, through NRSC and CGARD –NIRD.

                In the 2nd week of the current Financial Year, Ministry of Rural Development has already released Rs. 23,147 crore to various States/UTs under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The funds, besides clearing all wage and payment liabilities of previous year, will also ensure smooth implementation of the scheme in the coming months of FY 2018-19.

In line with the commitment of Central Government towards release of funds by 10th April, 2018, the Ministry has released Rs. 14,995 crore for wages and Rs. 8,152 crore for material expenditure under MGNREGS. This release includes the amount pending as liability for the work done in the last weeks of FY 2017-18. 

The States/UTs have been advised to ensure that all the pending liabilities are duly cleared. The Ministry is closely monitoring the compliance. It is important to mention here that the Central Government has an initial budget provision of Rs. 55,000crore in FY 2018-19 which is the highest since inception of the programme. Last year the initial budget provision was Rs. 48,000crore which was revised upwards during the later stages. 

The Central Government pays for 100% of the wage expenditure and 75% of the material expenditure under the scheme. The total expenditure in FY 2017-18 under the scheme was Rs. 64,189 crore. In FY 2017-18, Six States (Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Meghalaya) who are on the National Electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS) released a cumulative of Rs. 1,570 crore over and above their matching state share. NeFMS has been a great enabler in transferring MGNREGA wages directly to beneficiaries’ bank/post office accounts and there is no hassle if States want to contribute their share or more. 

Labour Budget for FY 2018-19 has been finalized through a participatory process with the States/UTs. In FY 2017-18, a total of 233 crore persondays were generated which is 101% of the approved labour budget of 231 crore. The programme’s increased outreach is reflected in the lowest number of Gram Panchayats with nil expenditure (11512) in FY 2017-18 since inception. Also, about 86% of the total payments in FY 2017-18 were generated within 15 days of closure of Muster Rolls.

There has been a continued emphasis on creation of durable and productive assets and on completion of ongoing works.

                Hon’ble Prime Minister launched Pradhan MantriAwasYojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) on 20th November, 2016 from Agra.  The erstwhile rural housing programme, Indira AwaasYojana (IAY), was restructured into PMAY-G.  To achieve “Housing for All by 2022”, a target of completing one crore PMAY-G new pucca houses in rural areas by 31st March, 2019 and 2.95 crore pucca houses by 2022 was set. Of these, 51 lakh houses were to be completed by 31st March, 2018, which included completion of expected 2 lakh incomplete IAY houses as well.

Completion of houses under the rural housing programme of the Ministry from 2013-14 to 2017-18 is as follows:                                                                                                            (No. in lakh)

*States have reported physical completions on the ground and progress is being uploaded on AwaasSoft portal as uploading requires release of final installment, geo-tagged photos etc. 40.25 lakh houses already uploaded. Rest also by this month.

The performance of the rural housing scheme has shown upward swing, increased nearly four times in the last four years. This is despite the fact that it took a few months to complete the process of beneficiary registration, geo-tagging, account verification etc. after the programme’s launch on 20th November, 2016. 

Towards meeting the target of construction of 1 crore PMAY-Gramin houses by December, 2018, while more than 76 lakh beneficiaries have been sanctioned houses, approximately 63 lakh beneficiaries have received 1st installment. Highest number of PMAY-G houses have been completed in the State of Uttar Pradesh during the financial year 2017-18 followed by Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. In fact almost all States who have the highest number of PMAY-G beneficiaries like Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Maharashra, Jharkhand etc., are on course for completion of PMAY-G houses within the prescribed time-frame. So far 38.22 lakh PMAY-G houses have been completed. With Assam and Bihar also speeding up completion of houses we hope to complete 60 lakh PMAY-G houses by June, 2018 and 1 crore by December, 2018.

Construction of bigger and better houses has been possible due to transparent beneficiary selection, capacity building of beneficiaries, timely availability of funds to the beneficiaries, structured monitoring and course-correction based on the feedback on implementation

 

The faster completion of quality houses under PMAY-G has been facilitated by payment of assistance directly into the beneficiary account through IT-DBT platform directly from single State Nodal Account maintained at the State level. Use of IT-DBT platform has ensured transparent, hassle-free and quality programme implementation.  Payment to beneficiaries under PMAY-G, is routed through Public Financial Management System (PFMS). Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) has led to:


	
	
		Reduction in  time and cost in house construction 
		Transparency leading to stoppage of leakages
		Ease in tracking fund flow to beneficiaries
		Better quality of construction of houses.
	
	


A total of 1,92,58,246transactions through electronic cheques (Fund Transfer Orders) have been done by State Governments during 2016-18, to transfer assistance amount of Rs. 65,237.50 crores directly to beneficiaries’ accounts (as on 5th April 2018).

Space technology and IT platforms are being used to monitor complete cycle of house construction, right from identification of beneficiary to each stage of construction of houses to completion and each stage is being geo-tagged.

 Ministry of Rural Development has developed a Performance Index incorporating various parameters of progress under PMAY-G. The Index acts as a tool not only to monitor progress of PMAY-G on various parameters across States, Districts, Blocks and Gram Panchayats but also instills healthy competition among them. It also helps in identifying areas of improvement and to motivate them towards better performance in implementation of the programme. The ranking of State/UTs and below on Performance Index is done on real time basis and changes everyday based on the performance of the State / UT and below. The national ranking of districts has also been introduced recently which places the performance of a district in the national perspective.

To ensure quality construction of a house and to facilitate availability of trained masons in the rural areas, Rural Mason Trainings are being organized. A total of 25,000 trainees have been enrolled, out of which 12,500 trainees have been trained and certified. The rural mason training has been initiated in 11 States and the States of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh have taken the lead and have the highest number of certified rural masons. It is targeted to train 1 lakh rural masons by March, 2019 which will contribute towards not only the quality construction of PMAY-G houses in rural India but also to the skilled manpower pool of the country. In addition this will also help in getting better livelihood opportunities for the trained Masons.

States have also taken adequate steps to ensure continuous availability of construction material at reasonable prices so that the pace and quality of construction is not adversely affected.

Pucca houses constructed under PMAY-G with facilities like toilet, LPG connection, electricity connection, drinking water etc., are changing the rural landscape at a very fast pace. In some states PMAY-G houses are coming up in clusters/colonies which are generally for landless beneficiaries and these are provided many facilities in convergence with various Central and State schemes.

Technology has been used to empower the poor. House designs prepared by UNDP-IIT, Delhi or by the concerned states have been made available to beneficiaries to choose the house designs that they like. 168 house designs typologies, suitable to local conditions and using locally available construction material, have been developed for 15 States. These house designs are cost effective & disaster resilient and they have been vetted by Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee. Bouquet of these house designs has resulted in technically sound houses of different designs coming up in rural areas which are a treat to watch. These homes are not only changing the rural landscape but also bringing about a social transformation in villages across the country.  The poor are getting safe homes and can live with dignity.

                Under the National Social Assistance Programme Government is committed towards extending direct transfers to over 30 million old age, widow and differently abled beneficiaries belonging to below poverty line families. The cash transfers being facilitated under the National Social Assistance Programme are an important subset of overall social security net including food security and health insurance extended by the Government to families facing deprivation.

          Ever since the strategic decision to bring the NSAP scheme within the umbrella of ‘Core of Core’ scheme in 2016, the financial commitment towards meeting the 100% requirement of the scheme by the Central Government is continuously increasing.For the year 2018-19, an amount of Rs. 9975 crore has been allocated to NSAP schemes, which is 38% more than the budget allocation of 2014-15 which stood at Rs.7241 crore. An amount of Rs.8696 crore has been released to States/UTs under NSAP during 2017-18, which is 23% more than the releases of 2014-15.

          To enhance transparency and elimination of inclusion and exclusion errors, a number of steps have been taken by the Government. Data of all the beneficiaries under NSAP has been digitized over NSAP-PPS. Further, with due consent,  173 lakh beneficiaries have got their Aadhaar numbers enrolled with the scheme. Government has decided to extend the date for adoption of Aadhar Based Payment System (ABPS)upto 30th June,2018.With rapid progress in this direction,eventually system is aiming at moving towardsAadhaar based payment mechanism(with consent) to facilitate end-to-end digital transactions with complete elimination of any possible inclusion errors.Aadhaar based payment will facilitate payment to old, widows and disabled in their own village through a Banking correspondent/Post Office.

          At the beginning of the financial year 2017-18 only six States/UTs namely Gujarat, Lakshadweep, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman& Diu, Jharkhand and Maharashtra were disbursing the NSAP assistance through digital transactions and reported 1.73 crore transactions under direct benefit transfer mode. With special efforts, in the financial year ending 31st March,2018,twentyStates/UTsi.eAndhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Daman & Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Delhi,  Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand,  Lakshadweep Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya,Puducherry, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh, have reported total transactions of 10.73 crore through DBT mode. Hence, in comparison to digital transactions through DBT in 2016-17, there has been  a quantum jump of 520% in 2017-18.In the year 2017-18, value of digital transactions stood atRs.6791.70 crore, which is about 78% of the total releases in the year.

With a view to have greater impact on addressing the issue of multi- faceted deprivation, more and more emphasis is being given to addressing the issue of convergence. Apart from extending monthly assistance to the tune of Rs. 300 to 500 per month under National Disability Pension Scheme, special provisions have been made for the persons with disabilities in other rural development programs as well. For providing drinking water at work sites, management of crèche etc., priority is given for handicapped persons under MGNREGA Work and to appoint worker as mate. Disabled workers are paid wages equivalent to other workers. Other priorities set for disabled persons are special discount in rates, selection of suitable work for them and organization of groups for disabled persons.Under MGNREGA in FY 2017-18, around 4.7 lakh disabled workers were provided employment; thereby generating 1.57 crorepersondays.

DDU-GrameenKaushalYojana Guidelines mandates each State has to ensure that at least 3% of State target for skilling should be ear marked for persons with disabilities (PwDs). DDU-GKY Guidelines also provides that PwD projects may have separate training centres and the unit costs may be different from those for regular projects. Accordingly, Ministry has notified a separate   Framework for projects for PwD under DDU-GKY in alignment with Common Norms for Skill Development schemes. Currently, a total of 243 projects have been sanctioned under DDU-GKY in the country in which PwD candidates have also been proposed to be trained. Apart from this, 5 projects have been sanctioned exclusively under DDU-GKY for skilling 1500 PwD candidates.In the FY 2017-18 (upto February 2018), 912 PwD candidates have been trained under DDU-GKY projects, as against 662 candidates in FY in 2016-17.

Pradhan MantriAwasYojana(G) also has the provision for States to ensure that at least 3% beneficiaries are disabled persons.Under PMAY (G), 5682 houses were sanctioned for differently-abled persons; of which 1655 have been completed.

                Mission Footprint

Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is a flagship programme of the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) that seeks to alleviate rural poverty through building sustainable community institutions of the poor. The centrally sponsored programme is implemented in partnership with the State governments. The Mission, launched in 2011, has seen a rapid expansion in the last three years. During FY 17-18, 820 additional blocks were covered under the “Intensive” strategy. Cumulatively, the Mission is being implemented in 4,459 blocks spread across 586 districts of 29 States and 5 Union Territories (UTs).

 

Community Institution Building

 

The financial year 2017-18 has seen more than 82 lakh households mobilized into 6.96 lakh Self Help Group (SHGs) across the country. Cumulatively, more than 4.75 crore women have been mobilized into more than 40 lakh SHGs. Further, the SHGs have been federated into 2.2 lakh village level federations and more than 19,000 cluster level federations. Cumulatively, these community institutions have been provided more than Rs. 4,444 crore as capitalization support.

 

Financial Inclusion 

 

As part of its financial inclusion strategy, the Mission closely works with the Department of Financial Services (DFS), Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Indian Bank Associations (IBA) to provide bank credit to SHGs. As a result of the sustained efforts made on both the supply and the demand side the SHGs have been able to access substantial amount of bank credit. The loan outstanding to SHGs have increased from Rs. 22,238 crores in FY 2013-14 to 64589 crore as of Feb’18. Cumulatively, Rs. 1.55 lakh crore worth of bank credit has been leveraged by the SHGs during the last five years. The quality of the portfolio has also shown a marked improvement with NPA declining from 23% prior to the Mission to 2.4% in the current year. This is a result of sustained efforts made by the states to promote timely repayment of loans by the SHGs.

 

Financial Services in Remote Areas

 

The Mission has also achieved significant success in improving the last mile delivery of credit services through the agency of SHGs. About 1,518 SHG members have been deployed as Banking Correspondents Agents (BCAs) to provide last mile financial services including deposit, credit, remittance, disbursement of old age pensions and scholarships, payment of MGNREGA wages and enrollment under insurance and pension schemes. As of Feb,’18, 1.78 Lakh SHG members had availed banking services through the BCAs and over 8.9 lakh transactions amounting to Rs. 187.92 crores had been completed.

 

Interest Subvention

 

DAY-NRLM also provides Interest Subvention to women SHGs availing bank loans amounting to Rs.3.00 lakhs, to subsidize the cost of borrowing. The interest subvention effectively reduces the cost of borrowing to 7% per annum. In respect of 250 districts, an additional interest subvention of 3% is also allowed on timely repayment of loans, reducing the effective interest rate to 4% per annum. Since the inception of the scheme, a cumulative amount of Rs. 2,324 crores has been provided as interest subvention.

 

 

Mahila Kisan Shashaktikaran Pariyojana and Value Chain Initiatives

 

In order to promote agro-ecological practices that increase women farmers’ income and reduce their input costs and risks, the Mission has been implementing the Mahila Kisan Shashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP). As of March 2018, more than 33 lakh women farmers were being supported under this scheme. Further, about 8 lakh Mahila Kisans have been mobilized into 86,000 Producer Groups (PGs) which are federated into 126 Producer Companies (PCs). These value chain development initiatives have contributed significantly to the farmers’ income from agriculture, horticulture, dairying, fisheries and Non-Timber Forest Produce (NTFP) related activities. Small and marginal farmers producing Maize, Mango, Floriculture, Dairy, Goatery etc., have benefited significantly through the value chain interventions across different states. As of February 2018, more than 1.05 lakh SHG members have been covered under these interventions. In order to enhance agricultural productivity, the Mission promoted 4,150 Custom Hiring Centre/ Community Managed Tool Banks across multiple States. These hiring centers enable small and marginal famers to hire farm equipment and services such as soil testing, cold chain management etc., at nominal rates.

 

Community Livelihood Professionals

 

The community driven implementation strategy is the cornerstone of the Mission. This is borne out by the fact that more than 1.72 lakh community members have been trained and deployed to provide support to the community institutions in a variety of themes, such as bookkeeping, training and capacity building, financial services etc.  This also includes more than 22,000 Community Livelihoods Resource Persons (CLRPs) such as Krishi Sakhi and Pashu Sakhi who provide 24 X 7 door step extension services to the small and marginal farmers including dairy farmers.

 

Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme & Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojana

 

As part of its non-farm livelihoods strategy, DAY-NRLM is implementing Start-Up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP) and Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY). SVEP aims to support entrepreneurs in rural areas to set up local enterprises. Implemented in 17 States since 2016-17, about 16,600 enterprises have been supported under SVEP resulting in gainful employment for about 40,000 persons.

 

 

Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY), was launched in August 2017 to provide safe, affordable and community monitored rural transport services to connect remote rural villages. As of March 2018, proposals from 17 States have been approved and 288 vehicles are operating.   

 

Deendayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana

 

DAY-NRLM has another sub-scheme viz., Deendayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY). DDUGKY aims at building placement linked skills of the rual youth and place them in relatively higher wage employment sectors of the economy.

 

In FY 2017-18, as of Feb’18, 1.28 lakh rural youth have been trained and 69,320 have been placed. During the financial year 2017-18, 514 projects for training 5.93 lakh rural youth have also been sanctioned across the country till Feb 2018. Further, KAUSHAL PANJEE- mobile app for registration of prospective training candidates was also launched. As of 31st March, 2018, 7.56 lakh candidates have been registered in the Kaushal Panjee application.

 

The CIPET and Indo German Tool rooms have also been engaged as Project Implementing Agency of DDUGKY program for high end training with better placement & salary.

 

Rural Self Employment Training Institutes

 

The Mission, in partnership with 31 Banks and State Governments, is supporting Rural Self Employment Institutes (RSETIs) for skilling of rural youth to take up gainful self-employment. At present 586 RSETIs in the country are supported by the Mission. These RSETIs cover 566 Districts in 28 States and 4 UTs. In FY 2017-18, a total of 4.23 lakhs candidates have been trained and 3.34 lakhs candidates have been settled. Of those settled, 1.52 lakhs candidates have successfully got credit-linkage from banks for setting up their ventures, including 8911 candidates who have got loans under PM Mudra scheme. Out of total candidates trained in RSETIs, 60% are women.

 

In FY 2017-18, RSETI scheme has been aligned with Common Norms for Skill Development schemes and National Skill Qualification Framework. A total of 26 RSETIs have completed construction of their own buildings in FY 2017-18. Cumulatively, since FY 2014-15 till FY 2017-18 a total of 16.97 lakhs candidates have been trained and 12.51 lakhs candidates have been settled.

 

Independent Assessment of DAY-NRLM

 

Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA), was entrusted to carry out the independent assessment of design, strategy and impacts of DAY-NRLM. As part of the study, survey of nearly 4500 households spanning across 746 villages was conducted during January – March 2017.

 

The results indicate that the households in the treatment areas: 


	have a higher number of livestock assets as compared to control areas - On an average, each household in a Mission village had more than 2.34 productive livestock assets compared to a similar household in non-Mission village
	show a higher proclivity to save in formal institutions;
	have a higher loan size (about 67% more than the loan size in the control areas) and are more likely to borrow from formal financial sources; NRLM households also pay a lower rate of interest
	have 22% higher (net) income than the households in the control areas, largely due to income from enterprises. On an average, each NRLM village had 11 enterprises more than the non-NRLM villages – suggesting livelihood diversification in NRLM villages.
	participate more in PRIs - NRLM households participate 3 times more than their counterparts


 

 

Key Priorities for the Mission for FY 2018-19

 

Mission Expansion

 

The Mission seeks to expand to 750 additional blocks during FY 2018-19. The focus of expansion will be 102 aspirational districts, 50000 Mission Antyodaya GPs, clusters identified under Shayama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission and Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) GPs. It is proposed to mobilize 100 lakh households into 9 lakh Self Help Groups during the financial year.

 

Promotion of Farm Livelihoods

 

DAY-NRLM plans to include another 5 lakh women farmers under its farm livelihoods interventions like sustainable agriculture, livestock and NTFP based activities with major focus on North East states. Further, the Mission aims at supporting an additional 75000 SHG member households through farm-based value chain initiatives. It would also promote 15 large size farm-based producer enterprises to provide market linkages to women producers.

 

In addition, organic cultivation will be promoted in 1000 village clusters across States. Besides, to strengthen the extension services to small and marginal farmers on sustainable agriculture, improved livestock management and NTFP related activities an additional 3000 Community Resource Persons would be developed through intensive training. DAY-NRLM has also planned to promote another 1500 Custom Hiring Centre to enable the small and marginal farmer having timely access to agriculture implements and machinery.

 

Promotion of Non-Farm Livelihoods 

 

It is also expected that Start Up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP) will support an additional 25000 entrepreneurs during the year 2018-19. In addition, it is expected that by March 2019, about 1500 vehicles will be operating across 17 States under Aajeevika Gram Express Yojana (AGEY).

 

Setting up of Rural Haats

Development of haats has emerged as one of the most important strategies to market SHG products and agricultural produce. To facilitate marketing of rural produce, it is proposed to set up haats at village and block levels in convergence with MGNREGS and the District and State level using DAY-NRLM resources. The maintenance of the haats will be entrusted to a committee comprising of representatives of women SHGs, Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and local government officials.

 

It is proposed to set up 4567 rural haats across the country during FY 2018-19

 

Enabling rural poor’s access to formal sources of finance

 

The Mission will continue to promote access of SHGs to bank credit and other financial services. In FY 18-19, it is planned to link 22 lakh SHGs to bank credit for total loan amount of Rs. 42500 crores, taking the SHG Bank loan outstanding to Rs. 75000 crore.

 

The Mission will make efforts to expand Banking services to underserved regions through alternate channels in partnerships with various banks.

 

Deendayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana

 

More emphasis will be placed on long-term training for better placement outcomes. The Industries will be invited to partner as Project Implementing Agency (PIA) and/or own a training batch. It is proposed to have proactive engagement with Industry heads through workshops & conferences. It is envisaged that the increased engagement of Institutions of MSME & other prestigious Government Institutions for taking up DDUGKY program will lead to high end training with better salaries & District-wise survey for skilled manpower requirement.

 

The overall budgetary allocation has been increased from Rs 810 Crores in 2017-18 to Rs 1200 Crores in 2018-19

 

Rural Self Employment Training Institutes

 

An increased involvement of State Government has been envisaged in planning and implementation of skill development of rural poor through RSETIs. This would facilitate better mobilization (using Kaushal Panjee app) and identification of needy candidates in rural poor households. The mission is launching Standard Operating Procedures for greater transparency, efficiency and Quality assurance in the implementation of skill training in RSETIs. Mission is facilitating partnership of Industry Bodies with RSETIs to enable scaling up of rural entrepreneurs.

* Figures of FY 2017-18 are provisional as data uploading for March’18 will continue up to 20th April, 2018.

The table clearly brings out remarkable progress made in generating payment within 15 days from a low of 26.85% in 2014-15 to 85.75% in 2017-18.  The total expenditure of Rs.63,887 crore in 2017-18, is nearly Rs. 25,000 crore more than what was spent in 2013-14.  Likewise, for livelihood security and durable assets, thrust on expenditure on agriculture and allied works can be seen with the percentage rising from 48.7% in 2013-14 to 68.46% this year.

The criticism of the MGNREGS was that works remain incomplete for a long time leading to poor quality assets and unsatisfactory livelihood security.  The thrust on completion of works over the last two financial years led to the completion of nearly 1.20 crore assets in 2016-17 and 2017-18 which is nearly equal to what was being completed in four years. Geo tagging of MGNREGA assets which started on 1stSeptember, 2016 is going on with around 80,000 assets being geo tagged on daily basis. More than 2.84 crore assets out of a total of 3.34 completed assets since inception of the programmes have been geotagged and put in public domain.

The Institute of Economic Growth Study (2017) on Natural Resource Management, found beneficiaries saying that 76% assets created were good/very good and only 0.5% was unsatisfactory. The thrust on completion shall continue.  Governance reforms have been the hallmark of MGNREGS over the last three years with use of IT/DBT, and geo-tagging effectively. The verification of Job Cards and efforts to provide a Job Card to every deprived household as per the Socio Economic Census-2011 has yielded very positive results.  As the table above indicates 96.31% of expenditure is now through Electronic Fund Management System as against 37.13% in 2013-14.

Individual beneficiary schemes have been the focus with around 60% of total works taken up in FY 2017-18 belonging to this category. Moreover, there has been emphasis on Natural Resource Management works. Nearly 40 to 50 lakh hectares of land covered through Natural Resources Management for water conservation each year, rejuvenation of rivers, construction of nearly 5 lakh farm ponds every year over the last two years, thrust on roadside plantation and social forestry, provision of goat-shed, poultry-shed and dairy shed as individual beneficiary schemes have led to the creation of livelihood security through durable assets leading to improved incomes. MGNREGS provides 90/95 days work (approx Rs.18,000) for the one crore Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin) (PMAY (G) beneficiaries.  It also provides Rs.12,000 perIndividual Household Latrine (IHHL) wherever required and not provided for under Swach Bharat Mission Grameen (SBM-G). Realizing the importance of Anganwadi Centres as pro-poor initiative where poor women can leave young children in a secure environment, MGNREGS funds have been used for large scale construction of Anganwadi Centre buildings. Nearly 20,000 buildings have been completed in FY 2016-17 and FY 2017-18. Likewise, MGNREGS provided support for Solid and Liquid Waste Management and vermi-composting on a large scale.  Many state specific projects have emerged leading to generation of wealth from waste. 2.33 lakh Vermi/NADEP composting pits were completed in FY 2017-18.  

The approval of works for FY 2018-19 have already been completed through a process of decentralised planning and appraisal of proposals.  The thrust on 2,264 Mission Water Conservation Blocks which are water stressed regions will continue.  Likewise, support for IHHLs and 90-95 days of work to PMAY (G) beneficiaries will remain a priority.  In FY 2018-19, Gram Sabhas have come up with proposals for nearly five thousand Gramin Haats and their construction to enable producers specially Women Self Help Groups (SHGs) to sell their produce directly to wholesalers.  These will be taken up on priority.  River rejuvenation and support for irrigation is also a major area of activity which will be undertaken on large scale in FY 2018-19. FY 2018-19 will also see large scale convergence of women SHGs and their livelihood diversification with MGNREGS resources. All arrears to States are being released before 10th April, 2018 after due verification of financial documents to be submitted by the States/UTs. With a provision of Rs.55,000 crore at BE stage in FY 2018-19 funds for carrying out works at speed will be ensured in the first quarter of April to June, 2018 when the demand for work is normally very high.  There shall be no shortage of funds as long as financial discipline, guidelines, transparency norms are fully followed.  Over 6,500 Barefoot Technicians have been trained, nearly 4100 Resource Persons have been capacitated in handling of Social Audits and more than 55,000 SHG women have been trained to become social auditors. 26 States have set up their independent Social Audit Units.Social Audit has been provided full support and will continue to be a priority in FY 2018-19. Improvements like mandatory Citizen Information Boards, adoption of simpler seven register system and improved record keeping with photographs, etc., physical display of progress at Gram Panchayat level and forms of public accountability and community participation will be fully emphasized in FY 2018-19.

                A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on technical knowledge sharing for establishing a nationwide Time Stamping & Time Synchronization network and traceability of Time signal to UTC NPL Time, was signed between Council of Scientific and Industrial Research -National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL) and Department of Telecommunications (DoT), Ministry of Communications.

The MoU was signed by Dr. D.K. Aswal, Director, CSIR-NPL and by Mr. Amit Mishra, DDG, Department of Telecommunications in the presence of Dr.Girish Sahni, Director General, CSIR and Secretary, DSIR and Shri Prabhash Singh, Member (Technology), Department of Telecommunications, senior officials from DoT, CSIR and CSIR-NPL. 

Dr. D K Aswal, Director, CSR-NPL, emphasized that the Nationwide, Time Stamping & Time Synchronization network consisting of 22 numbers of Time Synchronization Centers (TSC’s) will be set up by DoT with technical assistance from CSIR-NPL.  This network will provide synchronizing pulse in Indian Standard Time(IST) to all Telecom & Internet Service providers in all the 22 LSA (Licensed Service Areas) in the country. The project will be implemented in two phases.  In the first phase TSC’s is to be set up in four metro LSA’s and in the second phase remaining of the 22 LSA’s will be covered. 

The primary purpose of synchronizing the telecom network with IST time stamp is to enable the security agencies to overcome the difficulty in analyzing and correlating the cyber events in this era of greatly increasing network speed with advancement of telecom technology (2G to 3G to 4G to 5G etc.).The implementation of the project will also improve the telecom network efficiency by reducing packet loss due to reduced slips in better synchronized digital network.

Dr. Girish Sahni, DG, CSIR and Secretary, DSIR, on the occasion said that the time set on Indian Telecom Networks should be in Indian Standard Time (IST) zone to uniquely identify the user(subscriber) of network on tracing of the IP address and other parameters. Presently,Telecom Service Provider (TSP) / Internet Service Provider (ISP) are taking the reference time from different sources viz. GPS from GNSS, he pointed out. These sources do not have the traceability with IST. “Telecom Networks” should be in IST time zone synchronized with CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL) – the keeper of Indian Standard Time.

Shri Prabhash Singh, Member (Technology), appreciated the technologies developed by CSIR and its laboratories.  They are of high value to Indian stakeholders, they be industry or Government Department and Ministries.  He pointed out that after establishment & implementation of a PAN India Time Synchronization and Time Stamping across the Indian Telecom Network, all the network of the TSP/ISPs will be traceable with the Indian Standard Time which will eliminate the problem of the Time Synchronization among the TSP/ISPs. He elaborated that this will lead to better efficiency of Telecom Network and reduce the Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) call drop, improve the Quality of Service of the network, Voice, Video. The Time Standardization will help to curb cybercrimes and will also help to identify and correlate the various digital financial transactions, Shri Singh opined.

Accuracy of the time depends upon the distance between the Time Synchronization Centre (reference source) and the location of the TSP/ISPs Centres. Therefore, stratum-1Time Synchronization centre shall be established at all the 22 LSAs across the country.

                Paradip Port, Kamarajar Port & VO Chidambarnar Portunder the Ministry of Shipping are all set to pioneer water recycling and desalination of sea water in the port premises. The Union Minister for Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari, chaired a meeting of port chairmen recently to discuss desalination technologies and their application at major ports, and directed that desalination plants should be installed with immediate effect. The initiative would benefit areas near the ports like Thoothukudi near Tuticorin, where a 13 million litreper day plant will be able to serve 20% of Tuticorin city’s requirement after port utilization. It will also help serve the water needs of  the entire Chennai Port and 1% of the city’s requirement at lower costs. This initiative is in line with the Ministry’s agenda to promote water conservation and reuse of water.

During the meeting the idea was mooted  for use of new technology based containerized RO (Reverse Osmosis) based plants which can reduce the cost of producing desalinated water and would be cheaper than current water procurement cost at certain ports. Shri Gadkari directed all ports to install desalination plants immediately.

While addressing the meeting Shri Gadkari said that the desalination plant at portsshould be used for meeting the potable water needs of ports as well as the neighboring community. Shri Gadkari also said that efforts should be made to extract methane, carbon dioxide and bio-CNG from water. He has also directed port chairmen to explore feasibility about using treated sewage water for cleaning rail coaches at different railway stations, and nearby power plants. 

The issue of power cost contribution to overall desalination cost was analyzed. Shri gadkarisuggested that  cheaper power sourcing options like renewable energy through windmills and solar farms should be explored. This willhelp bring down the cost of producing desalinated water by about 20%.Desalination benefit may vary from port to port depending on municipal water purchase price and energy tariffs.

                The Jawahar Lal Nehru Port Trust has been working on an innovative transport solution to achieve seamless and faster movement of cargo from the port to respective destinations through Direct Port Delivery. Four successful bidders have won the mandate for five routes- from JNPT to Gujarat, to Goa and Bengaluru, to Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Indore and Hyderabad, to Ahmednagar and to local regions in and around Mumbai. A meeting of these bidders was held at JNPT last week to take stock of the preparedness for the roll out of the new system from May 2018.

DPD is increasingly being accepted as the optimal way of transporting cargo directly from the port to the importers and accounts for close to 39 per cent of the total cargo traffic from JNPT at present. About 1600 importers who have opted for DPD mode of transport will benefit from this process. An exporter or importer will be able to book his cargo sitting in his office, through a technology backed platform. This new transport solution will promote


	Easy co-ordination between port and customers
	End to end delivery  
	Faster evacuation of containers from the Port area
	24X7 Vehicle tracking
	Container  tracking through  mobile
	24x7 Customer service

                Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Shipping, Road Transport & Highways and Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenationwill be on an official visit to the Republic of Koreafrom 9 April 2018. 

During the 4 day visit, Shri Gadkari will focus on taking forward the bilateral cooperation between India andKorea in shipping, ports, inland waterways, highways, river interlinking and infrastructure sectors. An Undertaking on Mutual Recognition of Certificate of Competency of sea-farers will be signed during the visit.

Known for maritime technology prowess, Republic of Korea had partnered with the Ministry of Shipping in the Maritime India Summit held in Mumbai during April 2016. This visit will further promote the bilateral cooperation. Shri Gadkari will visit Samsung Heavy industries, Busan Port, National Transport Information Centre in Seoul, and address a business forum on the maritime sector and also a seminar on India- Korea Infrastructure Corporation Forum. An interaction with financial institutions and investors is also scheduled.

The Minister will meet his counterpart, Minister of Ocean & Fisheries and Minister for Land, Infrastructure & Transport and interact with the captainsof  RoK trade and industry. 

India and RoKhave an institutional framework for cooperation through the memorandum of understanding (MoU)for cooperation and mutual assistance to facilitate development of ports, port-related industries and maritime relationship.

The visit of Shri Gadkari is aimed at strengthening ties between the two nations and further cementing cooperation in areas including sharing of technology, experience in port development and operation and joint participation in port-related construction, building andengineering projects of mutual interest amongst others.

Before leaving for Seoul, Shri Gadkari said, “Mutual Recognition of Certificate of Competency of sea-farers is an important step for both countries. Signing of the Undertaking will pave the way for recognition of maritime education and training, certificates of competency, endorsements, training documentary evidence and medical fitness certificates for seafarers issued by the Government of both the countries.”

He said thatthe undertaking with the Republic of Korea for mutual recognition of Certificate of Competency (CoC) will be beneficial to both the countries as Korea is a large ship owning nation while India is a large seafaring nation with around 1,54,349 Indian seafarers. This agreement will facilitate Indian seafarers to work on Korean ships as there is requirement of seafarers on their ships. Korean entities as of now own more than 500 foreign going ships.

“ This will lead to increase in the employment opportunity for Indian seafarers”, the Minister added.

Shri Gadkari said, “we are looking to have partnership in the field of ship building, smart transportation system, water conservation &recycling, eco-friendly energy system for marine industries and technology to develop our rivers to drive economic growth”. 

FICCI is partnering to organize a coinciding visit of a business delegation from India comprising of firms with business interests in Maritime, Highways and infrastructure sectors.

                “Industrial Training Institutes played a vital role in economic development of the country, especially in terms of supplying skilled manpower to industries. We have focused extensively on modernization of our institutes. It is our endeavour to establish at least one ITI in each block of the country by end of 2018”, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has said.

Addressing the State representatives, Pradhan said, “Vocational Training is a concurrent subject and thus it is imperative that Centre and State governments work closely to ensure a paradigm shift in addressing the issues relevant to skill development and identify the gaps in skill development, so as to achieve the objectives in terms of quantity, quality, outreach, and mobility while building this largest human resource exercise that we have undertaken. The States should align themselves to reforms being done to our central initiatives like Pradhan MantriKaushalVikasYojana (PMKVY), Pradhan MantriKaushalKendras (PMKK), Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS).”

Emphasising on the need for strengthening institutional mechanisms for skill development at the State level and bringing in a more robust framework, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship,and Petroleum & Natura Gas and Shri Anantkumar Hegde ,Minister of State for Skill Development today launched an array of initiatives at a day long State Skill Development Ministers Conference in New Delhi. The workshop saw a participation from more than 90% of the States, discussing the skills agenda.

The conference witnessed the launch of new courses for ITIs for India’s youth, as an endeavour to promote emerging skill areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Robotic Process Automation, Internet of Things, Robotics, Big Data Analytics, 3D Printing, etc. which would be in high demand globally in the coming days. Keeping this in mind an MOU was signed today between Director General of Training(DGT)&National Association of Software Services Companies(NASSCOM) for enabling Skill Development & Continuous learning for ITI trainees & trainers.

 

Recognising the concurrent nature of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), the conference marked the launch of new Affiliation Norms 2018 for ITIs is which restores the primacy of State Government in the ITIs Affiliation process. Affiliation Norms 2018 aims at establishing high quality Institutions for Skill Training in all parts of the country especially the un-served blocks.  To ensure transparency in the affiliation process, a Portal has also been designed and was launched at the event.The portal has a three-stage processwhich simplifies the overall affiliation process.

 

MSDE also today announced a Self-Grading exercise for ITIs to provide “Star Rating” to each institute,to ensure quality assessment of ITI and a healthy competition between them. 

 

MSDE also today commenced its partnership with Ministry of Home Affairs which has ""Surrender-cum-Rehabilitation Scheme for Left Wing Extremists"", where surrendered Left-Wing Extremistscan take admission in an institute and they are supported with stipend amounting uptoRs. 6000/- per month for a  period of uptothree years. It has been found that most of such people do not have requisite qualification for getting admission in Industrial Training Institutes. MSDE has realized this situation and accordingly relaxed the entry qualification by tweaking the existing Craftsmen Training Scheme, so that they may secure gainful wage or self-employment after acquiring skill in ITIs. Shri Pradhan today presented the offer of admission to two such beneficiaries at the event.

 

Urging the States to take the mission to the last mile, Shri Hedge said, “We have introduced an array of schemes and initiatives today, but the real results will only be seen when they reach the masses. Our endeavour both at the Centre and State level should result in transforming the life of the person living in the last mile. Only Skill development can change the future of the country.” 

A common portal under National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) at http://apprenticeshipindia.orgwas also launched to integrate all apprenticeship training under both designated and optional trades. The new portal will provide all the stakeholders a uniform user experience with customized dashboard to respective user requirements. It will have more automated modules with minimal outside intervention. 

Skill Development Ministers from Bihar, Maharashtra,Manipur, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and other states participated. 

The conference witnessed discussion between the Central and the State Governments on the critical need for scaling up concerted efforts to enhance skill development in India, in the context of the country's transition to a knowledge-based economy, through the creation of a professional skilled workforce. Governmental efforts, especially in the recent past, in the arena of skill development through various schemes and programmes, management structures and processes, and the challenges encountered within these initiatives were discussed at the day- long session held with the States.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated the “Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial (DANM)” at 26, Alipore Road, Delhi at the place of Mahaparinirvana of Dr. Ambedkar here today. The memorial is dedicated to the life and contributions of Dr. Ambedkar, the principal architect of the Constitution of India. The Foundation stone of DANM was laid by the Prime Minister on 21st March, 2016.

Addressing on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that he feels proud to be at the inauguration of Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial and it is a tribute to Baba Saheb. He congratulated Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and other departments for completing the memorial in time. He said that now onwards 26, Alipur Road, Delhi has become a landmark not only in Delhi but also in our country. People will visit this memorial to know about the life and ideals of Baba Saheb. This memorial has been given the shape of a book because Baba Saheb was the brain behind the drafting of the Constitution of India. He showed the path of democracy to the largest democratic country of the world. He said that his government declared five sites related to Baba Saheb as Panchtirth, which include Mhow (Madhya Pradesh); Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur (Maharashtra); Dr. Ambedkar Memorial Home in London; Mahaparinirvan Bhoomi in Alipur Road (Delhi; and Chaitya Bhoomi in Mumbai (Maharashtra).

Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, in his address, said that the Government has taken many new initiatives during past four years as a tribute to the Father of the Indian Constitution. 100 research students were sent to London School of Economics, London (UK) and Columbia University (USA) on a study tour, where Dr. Ambedkar had studied. He said that the government is committed to the welfare of the weaker sections.

After resigning from the Union Cabinet on 1st November 1951, Dr. Ambedkar started residing in the house of Maharaja of Sirohi at 26, Alipur Road, Delhi where he breathed his last and attained Mahaparinirvana on 6th December 1956.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will inaugurate tomorrow the “Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial (DANM)” at 26, Alipore Road, Delhi at the place of Mahaparinirvana of Dr. Ambedkar. The memorial is dedicated to the life and contributions of Dr. Ambedkar, the principal architect of the Constitution of India. The Foundation stone of DANM was laid by the Prime Minister on 21st March, 2016.

Bharat Ratna Baba Saheb Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was born on 14th April 1891 at Mhow in Madhya Pradesh and was the First Law Minister of Independent India. After resigning from the Union Cabinet on 1st November 1951, Dr. Ambedkar started residing in the house of Maharaja of Sirohi at 26, Alipur Road, Delhi where he breathed his last and attained Mahaparinirvana on 6th December 1956. In the memory of Dr. Ambedkar, Dr. Ambedkar Mahaparinirvana Sthal, 26, Alipur Road was dedicated to the Nation by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of India on 2nd December, 2003. The followers of Baba Saheb believe 26, Alipur Road as Holy place where he attained Mahaparinirvana. Since this building was to be constructed as a Memorial of Baba Saheb, who was the brain behind the Constitution of India, hence, the building has been given the shape of a book.

The erstwhile website of the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis was not user-friendly. On the advice of the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, the Commission undertook the task of preparing a new website for itself.  The new website is very user-friendly and as per Government of India Guidelines for official websites. It is a comprehensive website giving complete details about the Commission viz. its composition, mandate, manner of filing complaints, details of visits undertaken by its Chairman and Members, etc.  The petitioners can file their grievances/complaints, etc. on-line on the website and thereafter track their grievances/complaints.  Simultaneously, the petitioner can also lodge their grievances/complaints through their android mobile phones by using the Commission’s App which can be downloaded from the Google Play Store free of cost.

Textile Committee doing intensive cleanliness drive at Prabhadevi Beach in Mumbai

The Textile Committee in Mumbai organised a cleanliness drive at Prabhadevi beach in Mumbai and removed ten tonnes of garbage and local residents also participated in this drive in a big way during the recently concluded special Swachhta fortnight from 1st to 15th March 2018. 

Several other activities were also conducted in the Ministry and its attached and subordinate offices across the country. Senior officers of the Ministry visited various offices and 9 Public Sector Undertakings located in different parts of the country to motivate the staff for cleanliness. Swachhta pledge was administered to all officers and staff in the Ministry and short films on Swachh Bharat were shown to all employees. 

Special workshops were conducted on the campuses of National Institute of Fashion Technology Bhopal and New Delhi to sensitize the students and staff regarding recycling and how to convert old and discarded cloth material and other unserviceable items into useful carry bags and hand bags. The NIFT students used to waste to generate wealth and create aesthetic products. The Ministry is also working on replacing plastic bags with reusable jute bags designed by National Institute of Ahmedabad which are being used at SAFAL and Mother Dairy outlets. 

Special debate, essay competitions, lecture by doctor about hygiene and tree plantation drives were organized by the Textiles Ministry during the fortnight.

Addressing the Press Conference Minister of State for Textiles, Ajay Tamta said that apart from this special fortnight the Ministry has been continuously engaged with Swachhta activities throughout the year. The Minister further added that cleanliness can become a reality only if every person decides to neither litter nor let others litter.  He said Swachhta is everyone’s responsibility and it should not be left to sanitation workers alone.

The steps taken include the Amended Technology Up-gradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), launch of India Handloom Brand and integrated scheme for development of silk industry. This information was given by Minister of State of Textiles Shri Ajay Tamta in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today. He said that the Amended Technology Up-gradation Fund Scheme provides for capital investment subsidy to facilitate technology upgradation in the weaving, processing, garmenting and technical textiles sectors for enhancement of quality in the textile manufacture. The India Handloom Brand is aimed at providing quality assurance for handloom products for safeguarding the interests of buyers in the domestic and international markets.

            The MoS Textiles further said that the Integrated Scheme for Development of Silk industry supports production of bivoltine silk, provides automatic reeling machines and also supports R&D to evolve new silk products. The power loom sector under the PowerTex India scheme provides support for upgradation of looms, creation of infrastructure (worksheds), setting up of yarn banks and support for pre-weaving and post-weaving facilities. The Textiles Committee operates 19 testing labs to test textile products for conformance to national and international standards. In the Jute Sector, the jute Industry conforms to specifications approved by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), in the manufacture of jute sacking

                In response to certain reports appearing in the media regarding Adopt a Heritage Scheme, the Ministry of Tourism has clarified that the “Adopt a Heritage: Apni Dharohar, Apni Pehchaan”, is a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and State/UTs  Governments. The Project aims to develop synergy among all partners to effectively promote “responsible tourism”.

It aims to involve public sector companies, private sector companies and corporate citizens/individuals to take up the responsibility for making our heritage and tourism more sustainable through development, operation and maintenance of world-class tourist infrastructure and amenities at ASI/ State heritage sites and other important tourist sites in India. 

They would become ‘Monument Mitras’ through the innovative concept of “Vision Bidding”, where the agency with best vision  for the heritage site will be given an opportunity to associate pride with their CSR activities. They would also get limited visibility in the premises and the Incredible India website. The aim is enhancement of tourist experience and promotion of the incredible heritage sites to bring them on tourism map. 

The project primarily focusses on providing basic amenities that includes cleanliness, public conveniences, drinking water, ease of access for differently abled and senior citizens, standardized signage, illumination and advanced amenities such as surveillance system, night viewing facilities, tourism facilitation center and an enhanced tourism experience that will result in more tourist footfalls, both domestic and foreign.

The priority areas of Programme are listed as under:


	Developing basic tourism infrastructure;
	Promoting cultural and heritage value of the country to generate livelihoods in the identified regions;
	Enhancing the tourist attractiveness in a sustainable manner by developing world-class infrastructure at the heritage monument sites;
	Creating employment through active involvement of local communities;
	Harnessing tourism potential for its effects in employment generation and economic development;
	Developing sustainable tourism infrastructure and ensuring proper Operations and Maintenance therein.


The response to the project has been very encouraging as the agencies who have come forward for adoption includes not only public and private industry/individuals but also schools and law firms. Under the project a total of 31 agencies, (referred as Monument Mitras) have been approved, so far, to adopt a total of 95 Monuments/ tourist sites located across India.

So far, four MoU’s have been signed between Ministry of Tourism, Adventure Tour Operators Association of India (ATOAI) and Govt. of Jammu & Kashmir for Mt. Stok Kangri, Ladakh, J & K and Ministry of Tourism, Adventure Tour Operators Association of India (ATOAI), Uttarakhand Government for Trail to Gaumukh in Uttarakhand, and also between Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture, Archaeological Survey of India and Dalmia Bharat Limited for Red Fort, Delhi and Gandikota fort in Andhra Pradesh.

The Memorandum of Understanding signed for 'Red Fort 'is ‘only’ for the development, operations and maintenance of tourism amenities in and around Red Fort. It envisages limited ‘access’ of non-core areas and ‘no handing over of monument’ is involved.

It is clarified that ‘The Adopt a Heritage’ is essentially a non-revenue generating project. It is part of responsible tourism where the ‘Monument Mitra’ essentially spends his CSR funds for upkeep and maintenance etc., and gets limited visibility. The agency was selected on the basis of unique concept of vision bid and no financial bid is involved.

                Ministry of Tourism, Goverment of India has established a state of the art Indian Culinary Institute (ICI) at A-35, Sector 62, Noida.  Shri K.J.Alphons, Hon'ble Minister of State for Tourism (Independent Charge) and Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India will inaugurate the campus on 27th April 2018 at 4.00 PM.  Dr.Mahesh Sharma, Hon'ble Minister of State for Culture (Independent Charge) and Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India will be the Chief Guest of the function.

The Noida campus is one of the two ICI campuses envisaged, the other being at Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. The Noida campus is in 5-acre land with a total project cost of Rs.98 crore and fully developed with the facility of academic block, commercial area, hostels for boys and girls, guesthouse for visiting faculties and other amenities like water harvesting, STP etc. ICI offers various courses ranging from Diploma, Under Graduate, and Post Graduate to research in Culinary Arts.  The Institute has fully equipped kitchen labs, micro biology lab, Cuisine theatre, Training Restaurants, fully equipped class rooms, library, including a modern hostel with facilities for 400 students.

The main objective of setting up of the Indian Culinary Institute (ICI) is to institutionalize a mechanism to support efforts intended to preserve, document, promote and disseminate Indian Cuisine, meet the sectoral requirement of specialists specific to Indian Cuisine, as also of promoting Cuisine as a Niche Tourism product.

In India, at present, there is a dearth of state-of-the-art training ground to groom top-of-the-line chefs of international standards. To fill this void, the Indian Culinary Institute would provide the appropriate training platform at par with the elite “Chef Schools” functioning in different parts of the developed world.

                The 3rd Award Ceremony of Adopt a Heritage Project was conducted by Ministry of Tourism in collaboration with Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), State/UTs Governments in New Delhi today for awarding the Letters of Intent to the shortlisted agencies under Phase IV of the project. Awarding the Letters of Intent to 9 agencies for 22 monuments of Phase-IV, Union Minister for Tourism (IC) Sh. K. J. Alphons asked the stakeholders to ‘protect, preserve and market’ the heritage of India. The Minister also emphasised on creation of awareness amongst the corporates and citizens to adopt heritage sites under the project for creation, operation and maintenance of basic and advanced amenities at tourist destinations. The event had a discussion session with the stakeholders in which the concerns and suggestions were made to the Minister and Ministry officials.

The scheme “Adopt a Heritage: Apni Dharohar, Apni Pehchaan” was originally launched on 27th September 2017 to preserve the rich cultural and natural heritage and to promote tourism across the length and breadth of our country. The Project began with selected ASI ticketed monuments and the scope has now been expanded to include other natural and cultural sites across the country. It was strongly emphasised that tourist experience is the prime parameter to evaluate our performance in the sector. 

As on date, the project has received very encouraging response with over 195 registrations as per the project website. Various agencies that have come forward for adoption include not only public and private industry, but also schools and individuals. So far, 31 prospective monument mitras have been shortlisted by the Oversight & Vision committee for developing tourist friendly amenities at 95 monuments, heritage and other tourist sites including major heritage sites like Red Fort, Qutub Minar, Hampi, Sun Temple, Ajanta Caves, Char Minar, Kaziranga National Park. Earlier, two MoU’s were been signed between Ministry of Tourism, Govt. of Jammu & Kashmir, Govt. of Uttarakhand and Adventure Tour Operators Association of India(ATOAI) for Mt. Stok Kangri, Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir and for Gangotri Temple Area & Trail to Gaumukh in Uttarakhand. Further, two MoUs were also signed for Red Fort, Delhi and Gandikota fort, Andhra Pradesh between Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture, Archaeological Survey of India and Dalmia Bharat Limited.

Smt. Rashmi Verma, Secretary (Tourism), Shri. Satyajeet Rajan, DG (Tourism), Smt. Meenakshi Sharma (ADG Tourism) and other officials were present for the event. The event also witnessed wide participation by public and private stakeholders from different parts of the country.

                Ministry of Tourism in close collaboration with Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) launched “Adopt a Heritage Project” to provide world class tourist facilities at the various natural/cultural heritage sites, monuments and other tourist sites to make them tourist friendly, enhance their tourist potential and cultural importance in a planned and phased manner across the country.

The project primarily focuses on providing basic amenities that include cleanliness, public convenience, drinking water, ease of access for tourists, signage etc. and advanced amenities like TFC, Souvenir shop, Cafeteria etc.

The project envisages that selected public sector companies, private sector companies and individuals will develop tourist amenities at heritage sites. They would become ‘Monument Mitra’ and adopt the sites essentially under their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activity. They would also look after the operations and maintenance of the adopted site initially for the 5 years subject to review at any time.

The project began with 93 ASI ticketed monuments and has now been expanded to other natural and cultural heritage sites and other tourist sites across India. The project was launched by the Hon’ble President of India on 27th Sept, 2017 on the occasion of World Tourism Day.

The heritage sites/monuments enlisted are categorized as green, blue and orange on the basis of tourist footfall and visibility. As a part of project guidelines, it is mandatory for Monument Mitra, who is opting for a monument from green category to choose at least one site from either orange or blue category.      
 

The most competitive and innovative vision would be considered as the successful bidding entity. The interested parties selecting more numbers of monuments from orange and blue category shall be given higher weight age. The Interested parties may also opt for any other heritage site/monument or tourist site not mentioned in the above list, under the project and the unlisted tourist site will automatically considered under blue category.

The project focuses on active industry participation to ensure a sustainable model formulation. Resources for the capital and recurring cost is proposed through industry participation, through CSR or any other funding option subject to review and approval of Oversight & Vision Committee.

Monument Mitras would associate pride with these activities and will be provided limited visibility in the monument/site premises.

                The Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi launched the Van Dhan Scheme of Ministry of Tribal Affairs and TRIFED on 14th April, 2018 during the celebrations of Ambedkar Jayanti at Bijapur, Chattisgarh.  Emphasizing the important role of value addition in increasing tribal incomes, he stated that Van Dhan, Jan Dhan and Gobar-Dhan Schemes had the potential to change the tribal-rural economic system. All these three schemes in tandem need to be promoted for this purpose by the State Governments. 

The establishment of “Van Dhan Vikas Kendra” is for providing skill upgradation and capacity building training and setting up of primary processing and value addition facility. This first model Van DhanVikas Kendra in Bijapuris being implemented  for training of  300 training beneficiaries with a total outlay of Rs.43.38 lakhs for training, providing equipments & tools for primary level processing and infrastructure & building for housing the Kendra. This Kendra to start with will have processing facility for Tamarind brick making, Mahua flower storage facility and chironjee cleaning and packaging.

Under Van Dhan, 10 Self Help Groups of 30 Tribal gatherers is constituted.  They are then trained and provided with working capital to add value to the products, which they collect from the jungle.  Working under the leadership of Collector these groups can then market their products not only within the States but also outside the States.   Training and technical support is provided by TRIFED.  It is proposed to develop 30,000 such centres in the country.

Value addition assumes critical importance in ensuring remunerative prices to the tribals in this approach. Three stage value addition would be the corner stone for enhancing incomes of the tribals under the scheme. The grass root level procurement is proposed to be undertaken through Self Help Groups associated with implementing agencies. Convergence and Networking with other Govt. departments/scheme shall be undertaken to utilise the services of existing SHGs like Ajeevika, etc.  These SHGs shall be appropriately trained on sustainable harvesting/collection, primary processing & value addition and be formed into clusters so as to aggregate their stock in tradable quantity and linking them with facility of primary processing in a Van DhanVikas Kendra.

The stock after primary processing shall be supplied by these SHGs to the State Implementing Agencies or direct tie up for supply to corporate secondary processor. For creation of secondary level value addition facility at district level and tertiary level value addition facility at State level, Big Corporates shall be involved under PPP model. This PPP model will be based on utilising Private entrepreneur skills in undertaking processing as well as marketing of the produce and Central/ State Govt. support in terms of creating infrastructure and providing enabling environment for undertaking value addition of systematic scientific lines. These will be sophisticated large value addition hubs managed by Private entrepreneur. 

The Van Dhan Vikas Kendras will be important milestone in economic development of tribals involved in collection of MFPs by helping them in optimum utilization of natural resources and provide sustainable MFP-based livelihood in MFP-rich districts.

                The Union Minister of Tribal Affairs Shri Jual Oram briefed media today about the important decision taken by Cabinet today regarding declaration of Scheduled Areas in Rajasthan under Fifth Schedule of the Constitution of India. The Minister informed that the areas comprising of 3 complete districts namely Banswara, Dungarpur, Pratapgarh; 9 complete tehsils, 1 complete block and 46 complete gram panchayats covering 227 villages in district Udaipur, Rajsamand, Chittorgarh, Pali and Sirohi of Rajasthan, would be included in the Scheduled Areas in the State of Rajasthan.

The Minister further informed that the Scheduled Tribe population covered under the Scheduled Area will thus increase from 4188056 to 4551917, while the total population covered under the Scheduled Areas will become 6463353. Also, the total land area under the Scheduled Areas will increase from 19818.86 sq. km. to 23354.96 sq. km. With this an additional ST population of 3.6 lakhs will be covered under scheduled areas.

Shri Jual Oram further stated that this increase will result in several benefits to the people residing in those areas. For direct recruitment in Government Jobs (other than State Services) in the Scheduled Areas of Rajasthan, 45% of seats will be reserved for local ST population. Seats will also be reserved for several vocational graduation/ post-graduation and diploma courses. The area will also be covered by separate service rules/cadre for all Government Services, other than State Service. Posts in the government services will thus remain less vacant in the area, which in turn will help in effective implementation of various schemes and services in the area.

The Minister further added that the Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) will also become applicable in the area, along with the concomitant powers and benefits. Moreover, the proposed additional area will now receive more funds for infrastructure and socio-economic development.

The major ST communities which will benefit from this addition include ‘Bhil’, ‘Bhil Garasia’, ‘Garasia (excluding Rajput Garasia)’, ‘Mina’ etc.

Secretary, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Ms. Lina Nair explained that the Tribal Affairs Ministry held several rounds of discussions and interactions with the State Government to arrive at the final declaration of scheduled areas in Rajasthan.

                The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given approval to the declaration of Scheduled Areas in respect of Rajasthan under Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India by rescinding the Constitution Order (C.O.)114 dated 12th February 1981 and promulgation of a new Constitution Order.

 

The promulgation of new C.O. will ensure that the Scheduled Tribes of Rajasthan will get benefits of protective measures available under the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India.

 

The Rajasthan Government has requested for extension of Scheduled Areas in the State of Rajasthan under Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India.

 

Beneficiaries:

 

The Scheduled Tribes residing in Banswara, Dungarpur, Pratapgarh, and partial areas of Udaipur, Rajsamand, Chittorgarh, Pali and Sirohi districts of Rajasthan will get benefits of protective measures available under the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India.

 

The  areas  comprising  of 3  complete districts  namely,Banswara, Dungarpur, Pratapgarh; 9 complete tehsils, 1 complete block and 46 complete gram panchayats covering 227 villages in district Udaipur, Rajsamand, Chittorgarh, Pali and Sirohi of Rajasthan, would be included in the Scheduled Areas in the State of Rajasthan.

 

No additional funds are required as to be expended onaccount of declaration of Scheduled Areas.   This will be part of Tribal  Sub-Plan  (now renamed as   Tribal Sub-Scheme) within existing schemes of Central and the State Government for more focused attention in Scheduled Areas for effecting speedy development.

Background:

 

As per paragraph 6(1) of the Fifth Schedule {Article 244(1)} to the Constitution of India, the expression 'Scheduled Areas' means ‘such areas as the President may by order declare to be Scheduled Areas'.  In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6(2) of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution, the President may at any time by order increase the area of any Scheduled Area in a State after consultation with the Governor of that State; rescind, in relation to any State or States, any order or orders made under this paragraph, and in consultation with the Governor of the State concerned, make fresh orders redefining the areas which are to be Scheduled Areas.

 

The Scheduled Areas were first notified in the year 1950. Subsequently, Constitution Orders specifying the Scheduled Areas were issued for State of Rajasthan in1981. Due to re­organization/creation of new districts and changes in population of Scheduled Tribes as per 2011 Census, the Government of Rajasthan has requested for extension of Scheduled Areas in the State of Rajasthan.

                Minor Forest Produce (MFP) is a major source of livelihood for tribals living in forest areas.  The importance of MFPs for this section of the society can be gauged from the fact that around 100 million forest dwellers depend on MFPs for food, shelter, medicines and cash income. It provides them critical subsistence during the lean seasons, particularly for primitive tribal groups such as hunter gatherers, and the landless. Tribals derive 20-40% of their annual income from MFP on which they spend major portion of their time. This activity has strong linkage to women’s financial empowerment as most of the MFPs are collected and used/sold by women. MFP sector has the potential to create about 10 million workdays annually in the country.

Ministry of Tribal Affairs has taken a number of initiatives for socio economic development of tribals like introduction Forest rights Act, PESA Act and has been implementing schemes for development of MFP by providing financial support to State TDCCs and TRIFED for market development of MFPs. Recognizing the critical importance which MFP hold for tribals and its potential to create large scale employment opportunity thereby, helping in reducing poverty and increasing empowerment of tribals particularly women and poor people of the poorest and backward districts of the country, Govt. of India has introduced an ambitious scheme of “Mechanism for marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support price (MSP) and development of Value chain for MFP”.

The scheme was started with the objective of providing fair price to MFP gatherers, enhance their income level and ensure sustainable harvesting of MFPs. The MSP scheme seeks to establish a framework to ensure fair prices for the produce collected by them, assurance of buying at a particular price, primary processing, storage, transportation etc while ensuring sustainability of the resource base. It is a holistic scheme for development of MFP trade and covers 24 MFPs.

Value addition assumes critical importance in ensuring remunerative prices to the tribals in this approach. Three stage value addition would be the corner stone for enhancing incomes of the tribals under the scheme. The grass root level procurement is proposed to be undertaken through SHGs associated with Implementing Agencies. Convergence and Networking with other Govt. departments/scheme shall be undertaken to utilise the services of existing SHGs like Ajeevika, etc.  These SHGs shall be appropriately trained on sustainable harvesting/collection, primary processing & value addition and be formed into clusters so as to aggregate their stock in tradable quantity and linking them with facility of primary processing in a Van Dhan Vikas Kendra. The stock after primary processing shall be supplied by these SHGs to the State Implementing Agencies or direct tie up for supply to corporate secondary processor. For creation of secondary level value addition facility at district level and tertiary level value addition facility at State level, Big Corporates shall be involved under PPP model. This PPP model will be based on utilising Private entrepreneur skills in undertaking processing as well as marketing of the produce and Central/ State Govt. support in terms of creating infrastructure and providing enabling environment for undertaking value addition of systematic scientific lines. These will be sophisticated large value addition hubs managed by Private entrepreneurs.

The Ministry of Tribal affairs has approved establishment of the first  multipurpose “Van Dhan Vikas Kendra” on pilot basis for establishment in Bijapur  District of Chhattisgarh State for providing skill upgradation and capacity building training and setting up of primary processing and value addition facility. This first model Van Dhan Vikas Kendra is being implemented  for training of 300 beneficiaries with a total outlay of Rs 43.38 lakhs for training, providing equipments & tools for primary level processing and infrastructure & building for housing the Kendra. This Kendra to start with will have processing facility for Tamarind brick making, Mahua flower storage facility and chironjee cleaning and packaging.

TRIFED has assigned the work for establishment of this pilot Vikas Kendra in Bijapur District of Chattisgarh to CGMFP Federation and Collector, Bijapur would be the coordinating force. The selection of the tribal beneficiaries and formation of the SHGs has been undertaken by TRIFED and the training is scheduled to start from 10th April, 2018. To start with Van Dhan Vikas Kendra is being established in a Panchayat Building so that the primary processing can be commenced by the SHGs. The Kendra will be shifted to its own building once the same is ready.

The Van Dhan Vikas Kendras will be an important milestone in economic development of tribals involved in collection of MFPs by helping them in optimum utilization of natural resources and provide sustainable MFP-based livelihood in MFP-rich districts.

                There are a total of 1545 hostels, sanctioned by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs,  for tribal girls and boys in the country at present. Out of this, the number of hostels for boys is 544 hostels  and 1001 hostels for girls.

A total 380 hostels  for ST girls and boys have been sanctioned under the schemes of Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub Scheme (SCA to TSS) and grants under Art 275(1) of the Constitution from 2014-15 to 2017-18. A total of Rs 565.32cr were also sanctioned under the two schemes for the same period.

Under the scheme of Hostels for ST  Girls and Boys, an amount of Rs 160.29 cr  was released from 2014-15 to 2017-18. 

Under the Scheme of Girls & Boys Hostels for STs, Central assistance is given to States / UTs / Universities for construction of new hostel buildings and / or extension of existing hostels. Under the scheme, State Governments are eligible for 100% central share for construction of all Girls’ hostel and also for construction of Boys’ hostel in naxal affected areas (identified by Ministry of Home Affairs from time to time). The funding pattern for the other Boys’ Hostel to State Governments is on 50:50 basis.  In case of UTs, the Central Government bears the entire cost of construction of both Boys’ and Girls’ hostels. The hostels may be for middle schools, secondary schools, college or university level education. However, as a part of rationalization of schemes of the Ministry, it has been decided to subsume the intervention of the schemes of ‘Hostels for ST Girls and Boys’ under the Schemes of ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution from 2018-19 onwards. Under these schemes, receipt of proposal for construction of hostels is a continuous process. The proposal received from the State Government is appraised and approved by the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) in the Ministry for funding depending upon the availability of funds under the relevant scheme(s).

Monitoring and maintenance of hostels is the responsibility of the concerned States/UTs. However, with a view to improve the facilities in the existing hostels, proposals received from State Governments are considered for funding under the schemes Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSP), Grants under Article 275 (1) of the Constitution and Scheme for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTG) for various interventions including construction of boundary walls, toilets and arrangement of drinking water etc. from time to time as per the demand of State Governments depending upon the availability of funds under the relevant schemes.

Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for ST students at Senior Secondary (classes XI-XII) level has increased from 35.4% in 2013-14 to 43.1% in 2015-16.  During 2015, 64.1 % and 68.9 % ST students have completed Class Xth and XIIth, respectively, through various State and Central Examination Boards including Open Boards. In respect of Scheduled Tribes, Infant Mortality Rate has declined from 62.1 (2005-06) to 44.4 (2015-16), Under Five Mortality Rate has declined from 95.7 (2005-06) to 57.2 (2015-16), and Institutional Delivery has increased from 17.7% in 2005-06 to 68.0 % in 2015-16. As per the estimates of erstwhile Planning Commission, percentage of ST people living below the poverty line in rural areas has declined from 47.4% in 2009-10 to 45.3% in 2011-12. However, there are still gaps in human development indicators between STs and all India population.

                The traditional wisdom is an integral part of tribal cultural heritage. Ministry of Tribal Affairs is committed to preserve, protect and promote the rich tribal heritage including art & artefacts, handicraft, sports, tribal medicines, traditional medicinal practices etc.  Government supports Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs) established in State, to work as a body of knowledge & research more or less as a think tank for tribal development and to work towards preservation and dissemination of distinctiveness / uniqueness of tribal culture and their traditional knowledge. Funds are provided to TRIs under the Scheme ‘Support to TRI’ for various activities including construction of museum, library, language primers, research works, seminar/workshop, publication of books, development of documentaries, organisation of tribal festivals etc.

Funds are also provided to private institutions for carrying out research work on various tribal issues under the Scheme ‘Tribal Festival, Research Information and Mass Education’. National level tribal festival / carnival is organized by the Ministry to showcase glimpses of rich cultural heritage of tribal people across the country through unique forms of folk dances, songs, cuisine, exhibition and demonstration of traditional skill in painting, art and craft, medicinal practices etc. Ministry of Tribal Affairs, in association with Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Ltd.(TRIFED), organized a National Tribal Festival i.e ‘Aadi Mahotsav’ from 16th November, 2017 to 30th November, 2017. Almost 800 Artisans and Artists from 27 States participated in the Mahotsav and sold their products and displayed their crafts and skill. 

The Ministry has developed a central digital tribal repository capturing the diverse socio-cultural charateristics of the entire spectrum of Scheduled Tribes. The repository contains digital photos, videos and literature related to tribal rituals, festivals, cloths, ornaments, music, dance forms, arts and crafts. The repository is available to the people across the world through a digital platform. 

Even though there is no formal proposal to integrate traditional wisdom with educational methods with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, this is being followed in tribal institutions of learning through emphasis on traditional cultural heritage.  Ministry of Tribal Affairs has asked the State Governments to develop bilingual primers containing text both in regional and local tribal languages through Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs), which would help to integrate traditional wisdom with educational methods to empower tribal students.  Further, advisories have been issued to the States for synchronizing school vacations with local tribal festival and harvest seasons.

                Tribal population has their own traditional life styles, remoteness of habitations, dispersed population and displacement. Ministry of Tribal Affairs is seized of the matter that tribal population are inhabiting in far flung remote areas and may not be fully aware of the programmes, policies and development schemes but it has taken several steps to disseminate awareness of the programmes / schemes implemented by the Ministry as mentioned below:

(i)      Guidelines of the Schemes / programmes implemented by the Ministry as well as Annual Reports have been uploaded on the Ministry’s Website.

(v)     While issuing sanction orders under the Scheme Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS), State Governments are advised to ensure that concerned Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) should be duly informed about the projects / programmes relating to Tribal Development to be implemented in the area of jurisdiction. It is also advised to ensure that meetings of Gram Sabha are conducted on regular intervals as per norms in such areas.

(vi)    MoTA also provides focused advertisement in the newspapers / dailies besides press releases from time to time in order to generate awareness among the targeted ST beneficiaries so that they can approach the system for the services due to them.

As tribal habitations are scattered at large distances, States/UTs has to design social audit programmes such that these are undertaken at the level of the ST cluster or habitation. States/UTs shall undertake to develop adequate capacities amongst the inhabitants of the cluster/habitations.

(ix)    In order to consistently improve public service delivery, Ministry of Tribal Affairs continuously reviews various schematic initiatives; the recent ones being rationalization of scholarship schemes, onboarding of scheme on DBT, online portal for NGO Grants etc.

                There are 75 Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) notified as on date in the country.  The criteria followed for determination of PVTGs are as under:

i.        A pre-agriculture level of technology;

ii.       A stagnant or declining population;

iii.      Extremely low literacy; and

iv.      A subsistence level of economy.

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is implementing a scheme namely “Development of PVTGs” which covers the 75 identified PVTGs among Scheduled Tribes in 18 States/ UT of Andaman & Nicobar Islands.  It is a flexible scheme and covers funding for activities like housing, land distribution, land development, agricultural development, animal husbandry, construction of link roads, installation of non-conventional sources of energy for lighting purpose, social security including Janshree Beema Yojana or any other innovative activity meant for the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs.  Priority is also assigned to PVTGs under the schemes of Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Tribal Sub-Scheme(TSS), Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution, Grants-in-aid to Voluntary Organisations working for the welfare of Schedule Tribes and Strengthening of Education among ST Girls in Low Literacy Districts.

This information was given by Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Shri Jaswantsinh Bhabhor in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.

                            The water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on April 26, 2018 was 37.109 BCM which is 23% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs. This percentage was at 24 for the week ending on April 19, 2018. The level of water storage in the week ending on April 26, 2018 was 85% of the storage of corresponding period of last year and 90% of storage of average of last ten years. 

The total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 161.993 BCM which is about 63% of the total storage capacity of 257.812 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. 37 Reservoirs out of these 91 have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW.

                            Union Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Road Transport and Shipping, Shri Nitin Gadkari chaired a review meeting of the ongoing STP Projects in Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal in New Delhi yesterday. Addressing senior officials of National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) and contractors he directed that all the sanctioned projects in these states should be completed at the earliest.

Bihar has 20 sanctioned STP projects in ten towns including 11 in Patna, and one each in Buxar, Barh, Mokama, Naugachia, Sultanganj, Hajipur, Begusaria, Munger and Bhagalpur. The state has a projected sewage generation of 606 MLD by 2035. The existing sewage treatment capacity is 124 MLD. The sanctioned projects will add 538 MLD of  sewage treatment capacity . Projects of 216 MLD capacity are ongoing while projects worth capacity of 322 MLD are at various stages of tendering. 

In Patna, the 11 STP projects worth Rs 3237.69 crore will create total of 350 MLD sewage treatment capacity and lay down 1140.26 km of sewerage lines. The expected sewage load for the city by 2035 is 320 MLD. Once these projects are completed, no sewage water from Patna will flow into river Ganga. These projects will ensure that no untreated water goes into Ganga in Patna and sewer lines reach every household in the town. STP projects will also be taken up in  Danapur, Phulwari Sharif, Sonepur, Chhapra, Fatuah, Bakhtiyarpur, Barauni and Kahelgaon in the current year. 

West Bengal has 13 sanctioned STP projects in Gayespur, Kalyani, Halishahar, Bhatpara, Barrackpore, Budge-Budge, Berhampore, Nabadwip, Kamarhatim, Baranagar, Howrah, Bally and Kolkata. The state has a projected sewage generation of 1638 MLD by 2035. The existing sewage treatment capacity is 548 MLD. The sanctioned projects will add 295 MLD of  sewage treatment capacity .  Projects worth 80 MLD capacity are ongoing and projects worth  215 MLD are at various stages of tendering.

Jharkhand has two sanctioned STP projects at Sahibganj and Rajmahal. The state has a projected sewage generation of 16 MLD by 2035. The ongoing project of Sahibganj has a capacity to treat 12 MLD while the project of Rajmahal with a capacity of 3.5 MLD is under tendering process.   

The progress of 39 Ghats and Crematoria projects on the bank of Ganga were also reviewed and officials have been asked  to finish all projects by October 2018. In addition, the status of 37 polluting industrial units in Bihar and 41 industrial units in West Bengal situated on the banks of Ganga were also reviewed. While 40 industrial units in the two states have complied with the norms, 9 of these  units have been closed.  Closure notice has been issued to 10 units and show cause notice to 19 units. 

            Shri Gadkari, along with Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Dr. Satya Pal Singh, also released the February-March, 2018 issue of monthly magazine ‘Namami Gange’on the occasion and expressed the hope that all the stake holders will put up in their best efforts to realize the dream of our Prime Minister and our Government of making Ganga ‘Aviral and Nirmal.’

                The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) held a Consultation on development of Preventive Strategy on Child Sexual Abuse today. It was chaired by Smt. Stuti Kacker, Chairperson, NCPCR. She expressed her concern about growing incidents of sexual abuse of very young children in the country. Sh. Yashwant Jain, Member, NCPCR and Dr. Rajesh Sagar from AIIMS were also present in this consultation. 

It was strongly recommended in the consultation that a comprehensive and holistic campaign in rural and urban areas should be initiated at national level on Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) and on violation of Child Rights caused by it.

NCPCR had carried out a crowd sourcing of suggestions for preventive measures against Child Sexual Abuse (CSA). 153 suggestions were received of which 70 suggestions were for awareness generation. They were deliberated upon in the meeting with representatives from different NGOs working in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai. There was also a presentation of a Media Campaign which covered various aspects of child sexual abuse and suggested measures that would be taken through their 360° media campaign. 

Child Sexual Abuse is a multidimensional problem having legal, social, medical and psychological implications. Preventive measures include creating awareness among children, general public and making parents more conscious, responsive, friendly and communicative with children and empowering and educating children about these issues. At the same time, we should have stringent implementation of law with zero tolerance approach towards such crimes.

                In a letter addressed to Chief Ministers of all the States/UTs, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Union Minister for Women and Child Development has outlined various steps to be taken by the States/UTs in preventing and curbing the crimes against women and children. Some of the steps mentioned in the letter are:


	All police officers should be re-trained on various aspects of sexual offences particularly those related to collection and preservation of evidence.
	Instructions may be issued to all police officers that utmost priority is to be given to complete the investigation of cases of sexual offences against children strictly as per the timelines of Law.
	State Governments must take strict action against those police officers who are found to be obstructing the investigation or colluding with the perpetrators of such cases.
	A quick and timely professional investigation is the only method in which a potential offender can be deterred but this can be done only by the states as the police department is the state subject. Forming a special cell only for sexual offences or specially for sexual offences on children, would be a significant step in this regard.


The Women and Child Development Minister offered help to State Governments in establishing Forensic Laboratories in states which can be used for forensic analysis of evidence in the investigation of sexual offences.

The WCD Minister has requested the states to generate awareness among the children in using the e-box set up under POCSO with child-help line number 1098. The Minister also highlighted that till date 175 One stop centres for women affected by violence have been set up by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. One Stop Centres are to help those women who have no access to either police or medical facilities or are not able to visit a police station in times of distress.

The letter also stressed that Section 21 of the POCSO Act may be invoked in all cases wherever failure to report or record is noted. Section 21 states that any officer who fails to report or record the commission of an offence under section 19/20 of the Act is liable for punishment.

The WCD Minister called for suggestions from the state Governments on dealing with the crimes against women and children.

                The third meeting of the Integrated Nodal Agency (INA), under the chairpersonship of Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development(MWCD) was held in the Ministry in New Delhi today. Based on the deliberations during the meeting, it was decided that 5 cases pertaining to the NRI Matrimonial Dispute have been found fit for issuance of Look-out-Circular (LOC)  & MWCD will issue those 5 LoCs. The Integrated Nodal Agency has also deliberated on the Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) to streamline the process of dealing with the cases of NRI matrimonial disputes. The SoPs are also defining the responsibility of concerned authorities with specified timelines and would keep the women informed on the progress.

Speaking on the issue,  Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi , Honourable Minister of Women and Child Development has said that the SOP will enable the women facing such disputes to seek redressal in a time bound manner. She also said that any women can now approach MWCD for the purpose of tracing her NRI husband by having a LoC issued.

In criminal matter involving NRI’s, Look-out-Circular (LOC) could be issued by the investigating agency in cognizable offences, when the overseas husband is deliberately evading arrest or not appearing in the trial court despite Non Bailable Warrants and other coercive measures or there is a likelihood that he will leave the country to evade trial or arrest. The LoC will be issued after having the case scrutinised by NCW. 

Government of India has been receiving complaints of frauds, abandonment, domestic violence, extra-marital relationships, ex-parte divorce, being duped of money after promising marriage, forceful/illegal retention of children’s custody, non-payment of maintenance etc. A large number of NRI Matrimonial dispute cases remain pending on account of non-appearance of the perpetrator jeopardising women and children’s future. An Integrated Nodal Agency (INA) was constituted under the chairpersonship of Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) to work on the issues related to NRI Matrimonial Dispute.. Consequently, three meetings of INA have been conducted since January 2018.

                National Council Of Educational Research And Training (NCERT) has published the information regarding Childline (1098) – 24x7 Helpline for children and POCSO E-box on the back side of the front cover of all the course books from class 6th to class 12th.  To equip the children with the information regarding the possible modes of protection / complaints, the Ministry of Women and Child Development had requested Ministry of Human Resource Development and NCERT to publish this information. In a telephonic discussion last year, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi had requested Shri Javadekar to popularize POCSO e-Box and Childline 1098 through NCERT publications, screening of educational films on child sexual abuse in the schools and having strict norms for employing the support staff.

Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Minister of Women and Child Development thanked the HRD Minister and NCERT for implementing her suggestion and stated that the parents, guardians and teachers should remain vigilant about the children as well as their behavior and any suspected situation should be reported immediately on the Childline No.1098 and the POCSO e-Box. 

Through these course books, the information is expected to reach approximately 26 crores school students in 15 lakh schools. NCERT was also advised that there may be chapter in social science regarding the issues mentioned above.  The narrative may continue till class 12th for having a reasonable impact on young minds.  The information will not just reach these children, but is about to stay with them on daily basis. As a result, it is expected that the children will be more aware and they may use the Child Helpline or POCSO E-box, in case of any distress. The easy accessibility of this information in the hand of children themselves may also deter the prospective abusers, at least to a reasonable extent. 

 The information in the form of these books will also be available to 10 lakh teachers teaching through NCERT books along with the family members and to the care givers of these children.  The percolation of such useful information directly up to the last mile, is expected to create an environment of child safety and empowerment in the country.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development has made total payment of Rs. 271.66 crores to beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY). The payment has been made to 11,47,386 beneficiaries across the country. The Ministry is constantly monitoring the implementation of the scheme and taking steps so that the benefits of the scheme can be availed by maximum number of people. 

Number of beneficiaries enrolled under Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) has increased to 22,04,182. So far, Rs. 2048.59 Crores to all 36 States/UTs have been sanctioned under PMMVY out of which Rs. 2048.40 Crores have been released till date.

The Government of India has approved Pan-India implementation of PMMVY in all districts of the country from 01.01.2017 under which the eligible beneficiaries get Rs. 5,000/- under PMMVY and the remaining cash incentive as per approved norms towards Maternity Benefit under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) after institutional delivery so that on an average, a woman gets Rs. 6000/-. 

The Scheme Implementation Guidelines, the software for roll out of the Scheme i.e. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana - Common Application Software (PMMVY- CAS) and its User Manual were launched on 01.09.2017 by the Hon’ble Minister of Women & Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi. PMMVY is being implemented in collaboration with State Governments. 

The maternity benefits under Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) are available to all Pregnant Women & Lactating Mothers (PW&LM) except those in regular employment with the Central Government or State Government or Public Sector Undertaking or those who are in receipt of similar benefits under any law for the time being in force, for first living child of the family as normally, the first pregnancy of a woman exposes her to new kind of challenges and stress factors. The objectives of the scheme are: (i) providing partial compensation for the wage loss in terms of cash incentives so that the woman can take adequate rest before and after delivery of the first living child; and (ii) the cash incentives provided would lead to improved health seeking behaviour amongst the Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing the Swadhar Greh Scheme which targets the women victims of difficult circumstances who are in need of institutional support for rehabilitation so that they could lead their life with dignity. The Scheme envisages providing shelter, food, clothing and health as well as economic and social security for these women.

As per guidelines of the Swadhar Greh Scheme, to seek financial assistance the agency should meet following requirements:


	The agency should be either recognized by State/UT under existing law or should be well known with the experience or working in the field for at least 3 years and its work should be reported satisfactory by the State Govt./UT Administration concerned.
	It should ordinarily have been engaged in the field of women’s welfare/social welfare for a minimum period of two years
	Its financial position should be sound
	It should have facilities, resources, experience and personnel to undertake the management of such project
	It should run Swadhar Greh on a no-profit basis and
	It should have facilities like computers, internet connection etc at Swadhar Greh.


 

The State Governments/UT Administration invite applications from eligible organizations and the proposals which fulfil the norms are placed before a Project Sanctioning Committee (PSC) chaired by Secretary(WCD) of the State/UT concerned and comprising representatives from the Finance and Labour Department of the State/UT in addition to any other representative as the State Government/UT administration may decide. The State Governments/UT Administrations assess the number of new projects required in the State/UT and communicate to the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, along with the justification by 30th September of every year. Subject to availability of resources, the central Government communicates number of projects those can be approved and make necessary provision in the budget of subsequent financial year.

Swadhar Greh is a DBT compliant scheme. Gazette Notification has been issued and the same has been forwarded to the State Governments/UT Administrations with the request to furnish the data of beneficiaries.

                Government of India has approved a new scheme namely Mahila Shakti Kendra for 2017-18 upto 2019-20 to empower rural women through community participation. The scheme is envisaged to work at various levels, and at the National level (domain based knowledge support) and State level (State Resource Centre for Women) technical support to the respective governments on issues related to women is provided.

Community engagement through College Student Volunteers is envisioned in 115 most backward districts as part of the Block Level initiatives. Student volunteers will play an instrumental role in awareness generation regarding various important government schemes/ programmes as well as social issues. District Level Centre for Women (DLCW) has also been envisaged for 640 districts to be covered in phased manner. These centres will serve as a link between village, block and state level in facilitating women centric schemes and also give foothold for Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) scheme at the district level.

Under the Scheme, State Resource Centre for Women is provided for all States/UTs, District Level Centre for Women (DLCW) for 640 districts to be covered in a phased manner (220 districts during 2017-18, 220 more in 2018-19 and remaining 200 districts in 2019-20) and Block Level initiative to be focussed in 115 most backward districts covering 8 blocks in each district (50 districts to be covered during FY 2017-18 and remaining 65 districts to be covered during FY 2018-19).

The Scheme is implemented through the State Government /UT Administration with a cost sharing ratio of 60:40 between centre and states except for NE & Special Category States where the funding ratio is 90:10.

                Under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme (renamed as Anganwadi Services under Umbrella ICDS Scheme), construction of Anganwadi Centre buildings has been taken up in all the States/UTs. Joint guidelines for construction of 4 lakh Anganwadi Centre (AWC) buildings across the country in convergence with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) were issued on 17.02.2016.

Under the revised guidelines, provision for construction of 1 lakh new AWC buildings has been made. Central share for construction of AWC building is Rs. 1 lakh per AWC building for all States/UTs, which is reimbursable on completion of construction work.

The Ministry is partnering with private sector to successfully modernise Anganwadi Centres across the country. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between Ministry of Women and Child Development and M/s Vedanta on 21st September, 2015 (effective for three years) as a part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for construction of the 4000 Anganwadi Centre buildings through its own resources primarily in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.

The modernised Anganwadi Centres also follow the ICDS programme to combat nutritional deficiency by providing all the six services available under the Scheme. The healthy atmosphere and safe place for the children visiting the AWCs definitely contribute to the reduction in the level of malnutrition.

                Supplementary nutrition to adolescent girls is being provided @ Rs. 9.5 per beneficiary per day under the Scheme for Adolescent Girls in all the States/UTs. The said rates are equivalent to the prescribed rates for nutrition for the pregnant and lactating mothers under Anganwadi Services of umbrella ICDS scheme. Earlier the nutrition @ Rs. 5 per beneficiary per day was being provided to Adolescent Girls. The Government issued instructions to provide adolescent girls a diet similar to pregnant and lactating mothers under the Scheme of Adolescent Girls.

These cost norms have been revised under Scheme for Adolescent Girls keeping in view the recent price rise and Annual Cost Indexation and intimated to the State Government/ UT Administration. Government has also approved expansion and universalisation of the Scheme for Adolescent Girls in a phased manner and at present all the districts of the States/UTs are covered under the scheme.

                Anganwadi Services under Umbrella ICDS is universal and a self-selecting scheme. All children below 6 years of age, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers are eligible for the services including Supplementary Nutrition Programme (SNP) provided under the scheme. The services are provided to those who visit AnganwadiCenters and enroll themselves. As on 31 December 2017, 844 lakh beneficiaries have availed the Supplementary Nutrition service at Anganwadi Services (AWCs). 

 

World Health Organization (WHO) prescribed standards for monitoring the growth of children below 5 years, which have been adopted by the Government to measure nutritional status of children, using weight-to-age (underweight) as an indicator under as of Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme.
 

The implementation of ICDS Scheme is continuously monitored through prescribed monthly & annual progress reports, reviews as well as supervision visits etc. Based on the inputs and feedbacks received, State Governments/UT Administrations are advised through letters and review meetings to address the deficiencies and to improve the implementation of the Scheme. 

 

All the AnganwadiCenters are required to maintain the growth monitoring chart for assessing the nutrition status of children set by WHO. These growth charts help in identifying children in various categories like normal Children, moderately underweight Children and severely underweight children. The tracking through these charts help detect growth faltering and facilitate prompt action and referral.

                Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme aims to address the issue of decline in Child Sex Ratio (CSR) through a mass campaign across the country targeted at changing societal mindset and creating awareness about the criticality of the issue, which itself requires long-term attitudinal change. However, scheme has been received well and in the last three years, several local innovative interventions have been demonstrated by the districts with support from Departments of WCD, Health & Education.  There is a strong emphasis on mindset change through training, sensitization, awareness raising and community mobilization on ground. BBBP scheme has no provision for individual cash incentive/cash transfer component by Government of India and thus is not a DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) scheme.  

 

During 2016-17,Rs. 43.0 crore was allocated for the BBBP Scheme, but Rs. 32.69 crore could be released. To keep the efficiency of BBBP for deliverance of its objectives, the funding structure of the Scheme was revised as per guidelines from the Ministry of Finance in August, 2016. As such from the Financial Year 2016-17, under BetiBachaoBetiPadhao campaign, the Ministry has started the disbursement of grant-in-aids directly to the District Collectors/ Commissioners of selected districts for implementation of BBBP Campaign in their District.

 

With the direct release of funds to the districts, there was a requirement for opening a dedicated account for BBBP Scheme by the district collectors. Opening of dedicated bank account and registration under PFMS to enable the district to receive funds was the challenging task. With the continuous follow ups this has been achieved. Due to this reason the release and utilization of fund were comparatively less in the F.Y. 2016-17. However, now expenditure has improved substantially. The Ministry has taken all available means to achieve the financial target such as video conferences with States/District Administration and media campaign with an exhaustive 360-degree approach including Radio, TV campaign, Advertisements disseminated through Cinema Halls, newspaper advertisement, online digital media and community engagement through Song & Drama Division of MoI&B. With the help of mass media and programmes from Song and Drama Division and monitoring visits by Ministry’s officials, the district administrations are being motivated to achieve the target and goal of the BBBP campaign and utilization of funds has been increased.

 

            The details of funds allocated and released under the scheme during last three years and current year are as under:

                Ministry of Women & Child Development is implementing a project on “Capacity Building Programme for Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) of Panchayati Raj”.  The project is being implemented by National Institute of Public Cooperation and Child Development (NIPCCD), an autonomous body functioning under the aegis of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India.

The training of EWRs is being done through a two tier training programme. In the first phase, an intensive training program for EWRs of Panchayati Raj Institutions and Resource persons/Master Trainers was organized on 27th November, 2017. The training in second phase is being imparted through these Master trainers. As of now, 424 Master trainers have been able to impart training to 18,578 EWRs from 406 districts of 14 States/UTs. This programme would go a long way in realizing the Prime Minister’s vision of moving the country from “women development to women-led development”.

The Minister of Women & Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi started this project realizing the fact that role of EWRs remained ineffective, despite their large presence in the directly elected local governance. It is working on developing EWRs as “change agents”, while improving their leadership qualities and management skills for better implementation of various programmes of the Government. General trainings being organized in the country for Elected Representatives do not focus on the gender component in details and also fall short on the needs of these women representatives to address the specific challenges faced by them at the grassroots level. There are more than 14 lakh EWRs across the country.

Ministry of Women & Child Development has also developed training modules regarding laws for protection of women and children, development schemes and programmes (State and Center), Information Communication Technology (ICT) for the EWRs, participatory planning and asset creation, monitoring of Public Works and leadership qualities. This targeted approach to build capacities of these grassroots leaders has been envisaged to yield more desired development outcomes. It will help to empower the women members and heads of panchayats so that they can govern the villages more effectively.

                Minister of State (I/C) Youth Affairs and Sports Col RajyavardhanRathore has said that our sportspersons have amazing capacity to do well in every sport and not just in skill based games. At a function to felicitate the medal winning sportspersons of the recently held Commonwealth Games 2018 here today he said Sportspersons are ambassadors of the country, role models of the youth and every Indian feels proud of them. Terming sports as a soft power, Rathore said “we don’t fund any of the soft powers such as films, cuisine and culture but we fund you”. He further made it clear that there is no dearth of funds for sports but every penny has to be used to its optimum. About 56 sportspersons from 9 sports disciplines including Mary Kom, MirabaiChanu, Neeraj Chopra, SumitMallik, Sushil Kumar, VineshPhogat, Rahul Aware, SainaNehwal, PV Sindhu, KidambiSrikanth, Deepika Pallikal , SouravGhosal, VikasKrishan, Gaurav Solanki, Manu Bhaker, Jitu Rai, TejaswiniSawant, Heena Sidhu, ManikaBatra and others were felicitated with cash awards at the function. Roughly each of the gold medal winner received cash award of Rs 30 lakh whereas the silver winners were given Rs 20 lakh each and bronze winners were awarded Rs 10 lakhs.

Sharing his experience as a sportsman, Col Rathore said there will not be a time when there are no distractions or limitations but we have to learn to concentrate and try to overcome them. The whole journey of sportsmen is in close co-ordination with Sports Authority of India (SAI) and the Ministry of Sports and Sports Ministry team is committed to resolve all the issues, he added. The Minister asked them to justify with logic their demands and act responsible. Advising the winning sportspersons for the future he said the accolades will not last for ever whereas the love for the game will.

                Minister of State (I/C) Youth Affairs and Sports Col Rajyavardhan Rathore has emphasized transparency and good governance in sports bodies and said the government is committed to ensure ‘clean sports’. In a meeting with a delegation of International Olympic Committee (IOC) he said not only is a pool of players being created but also the government is trying to create a Coach Bank to provide proper training facilities to sportspersons. 

 

A delegation of International Olympic Committee (IOC) Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and IOA led by IOC President Dr Thomas Bach here today called on the Minister. During their hour long meeting both sides discussed matters relating to sports promotion and development, good governance and  how to further strengthen the relations  with the international Sports bodies. 

 

Col Rajyvardhan Rathore briefed the visiting delegation about the efforts made by Government of India to involve people at the grassroots level in promoting sports as a movement. In this regard he referred to recently concluded Khelo India School Games to spot the sporting talent at an early age. He said similar competitions would be organized in future at College and University level. Underlining the importance of good governance in Sports Bodies the Minister said government with the help of Indian Olympic Association has prepared a Sports Code to bring transparency in functioning of the National Sports Federations (NSFs), fair selection of players for competitions and accountability for proper utilization of funding to sports bodies by the government. He said government is making all efforts to make Sports Federations accountable for on and off the field performance. He said the government is committed to provide all facilities and funding for development and promotion of sports in the country. He also said ’Make in India’ is a successful program and the government will try to make India into a manufacturing hub for sports. Rathore categorically mentioned that his ministry has zero tolerance for substance abuse or for cheating in sports.

 

IOC President Dr Thomas Bach appreciated the initiatives taken by the Indian Government to bring transparency and good governance in sports. He said IOC is happy that Indian government has categorical views on ‘clean sports’. Dr Bach proposed that a 4 member group consisting of representatives of government, IOC, IOA and OCA be formed which could suggest the roadmap for sports development in India.

 

Shri Narinder Batra President of Indian Olympic Association assured the government of all support in matters of good governance, transparency and in implementing the sports code and said there would be no compromise on good governance matters.

                The Central Government complements/supplements the efforts of the State Governments as well as the National Sports Federations (NSFs) in order to achieve the twin objectives of the National Sports Policy, 2001, viz., “Broad-basing” of sports and “Achieving excellence in sports at the National and International levels” through various sports promotional schemes. Sports is a State subject and, therefore, it is primarily the responsibility of the State Government to develop sports in the country.

                The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) and the Pension fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) have released payroll data. 

India has, for the first time, introduced monthly payroll reporting for the formal sector to facilitate analysis of new and continuing employment.

The payroll data, categorized age-wise, for the months September, 2017 to February, 2018 has been released on 25th April, 2018. 

The numbers from these three organisations are an eye opener and put an end to all speculations and conjectures regarding job creation in the economy. They also strengthen the efforts made by the Government on job creation and formalization of the economy. 

There are other organisations also, such as ICAI, Bar Council, Medical Council and other professional bodies which could have such monthly data for payroll reporting for their professionals.

Data released by EPFO shows that during September, 2017 to February, 2018, 31.10 lakh new additions across all age groups were made in the payroll. Given that the data for recent months is provisional due to continuous updation of employee records, this could be called a conservative estimate. The actual figures may well be more than this.

From the PFRDA, the New Pension Scheme (NPS) data indicates generation of 4.2 lakh new payroll during the given period, that too only from Tier-I account. NPS currently manages the corpus of around 50 lakh employees in State and Central government. For this study the Central and State autonomous bodies have been shown under Central and State governments respectively, while non-government refers to the corporate sector employees.

From the above two organisations itself, 35.3 lakh new payrolls were generated during this six month period.

In addition, the ESIC data also mirrors the payroll growth shown in the other two sets of data from EPFO and PFRDA. Since ESIC data is not Aadhar seeded there is further scope of some modifications.

The payroll data from these three organisations would now be released every month. Given that till now there was no such system in place, this data would provide a more firm basis for various analysis and studies of the economy, job creation, as also aid in policy making. We may as well as bid goodbye to the days of analyses based on random sample surveys. Hopefully this would also end the debateregarding and criticisms about jobless growth in the economy. 

A more constructive phase of focusing on deriving the most out of this data for furthering development should now begin.

                ATLs across the country throw open doors to neighbourhood schools & NGOs

Atal Tinkering Labs, under the Atal Innovation Mission of the NITI Aayog, were envisioned as innovative makerspaces, setup across India, in every school, accessible to every child. Equipped with modern technologies to help navigate and impart crucial skills in the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the ATLs are at the vanguard of the promoting scientific temper and an entrepreneurial spirit in children today. 

The ATL Community Day initiative is an effort to spread awareness as well as engage the local communities in the neighbourhood of an Atal Tinkering Lab, to come and experience the exciting new world of science and future technologies. The Annual Community Day was held across India, over the course of April 13 – 16, with the larger theme of AmbedkarJayanti, which was celebrated on April 14. AIM has selected more than 2400 schools in 2017 for establishing Atal Tinkering Labs.

As the world grapples with evolving technologies, a new set of skills have gained popular acceptance and have come to be in high demand. For India to contribute significantly during this age of raid technological advancement, there is an urgent need to empower our youth with these ‘skills of the future’. 

Computational thinking, Internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, design thinking, advanced robotics – to name a few – are becoming increasingly relevant today. And Atal Tinkering Labs have evolved as epicenters for imparting these ‘skills of the future’ throughpractical applicationsbased onself-learning. Bridging a crucial social divide, Atal Tinkering Labs provide equal opportunity to all children across the spectrum by working at the grassroot level, introducing children to the world of innovation and tinkering.

Further establishing itself as an agent of community-level, inclusive innovation, children from other schools and/or who are not enrolled in the formal education system are also being introduced to the ‘tinkering’ phenomenon through the ATL Community Day initiative. 

AIM is paying tribute to the late Dr. B.R. Ambedkar by hosting its nationwide Atal Community Day Initiative on 14th April,2018. ATLs seek to integrate his philosophy of providing equal opportunity to everyone by opening up the doors of their Atal Tinkering Labs to the neighboring schools and NGOs who support the education of underprivileged children. Up to 30,000 new students were exposed during Community Day celebrations to the Atal Tinkering Labs and its philosophy of creating an environment of creativity and innovation. 

The students undertook sessions in Design Thinking and Hands on Learning activities, which composes of the basic elements of the first Atal Innovation Mission integration module for the Atal Tinkering Labs. The sessions were conducted by trained mentors, teachers and Atal Tinkering Lab students who have completed the Atal Tinkering Lab modules. Innovation for all, by all, peer-to-peer learning mixed with expert guidance and enthusiastic mentors. 

Tinkering is to explore, experiment and step beyond your textbooks. Tinkering is to identify problems and create solutions. Tinkering is to try, and try again. Tinkering is all about learning and sometimes, failing too. Students are free to explore ideas across sectors like aerospace, medical diagnostics, clean energy, clean water, biotechnology and many more in ATLs. Young student teams from ATLs in Puducherry and Kolhapur, Maharashtra have been innovating new ways to generate electricity from sewage water. This is one innovative idea. There are more such innovations, ideas, patents waiting to be realised in young minds. ATLs will create many more such young student innovators across every Indian district, and initiatives like ATL Community Day not only amplify the impact, but have the potential to effect transformational change at the societal level.

                Celebrating the spirit of the programme, PM to visit Bijapur on April 14; to launch Health and Wellness Centre under Ayushman Bharat

          Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will be visiting Bijapur, Chhattisgarh, on April 14, 2018. He will be visiting the Jangala Development Hub, situated in a panchayat that has emerged as a model panchayat, where he would be interacting with people, local ‘Champions of Change’ including officials of the district administration, who despite all odds and being at the epicenter of Left Wing Extremism have performed very well, especially post the launch of Aspirational District programme on January 5, 2018. 

The Prime Minister would also launch Health and Wellness Centre component of the Ayushman Bharat Programe in this panchayat as part of the visit. With this, on April 14, from Bijapur district of Chhattisgarh, the nation will take a historic leap: Creating a strong primary healthcare foundation reaching the very doorsteps of communities, leading the way for a robust health system. 

 

It may be mentioned that the Ayushman Bharat has twin missions. First, creating a network of Health and Wellness Centres to deliver comprehensive primary healthcare close to the community, and second, providing insurance cover to 40 per cent of India’s population, that is most deprived, for secondary and tertiary care including for instance, hospitalization costs.

 

In many ways Bijapur represents a microcosm of aspirations of a youthful nation. Beset with Left Wing Extremism (LWE), the state faces myriad challenges. And yet, in short span of time, it has made spectacular progress in health, nutrition, education and creation of livelihood opportunities. Difficult places require innovative solutions. This District, which has ranked among the top 5 performing districts on the basis of percent change in key indicators, has taken series of innovative measures.  This has been achieved on the back of best practices such as the creation of a well- functioning hospital with doctors recruited on competitive salaries from different parts of the country by utilizing the flexibility provided under the National Health Mission, running of schools for naxal-affected children in portable cabins and various measures to improve livelihood opportunities. These measures amply demonstrate the spirit of cooperative federalism wherein if the Centre, State and District administration work as a team, rapid transformation for creation of a New India by 2022 is an achievable.  

 

The Prime Minister’s visit to Bijapur gives wings to the aspirations of people in the remotest parts of India to become a rightful partner in India’s growth story.     

 

Aspirational Districts: Transforming India, One District at a Time

The Aspirational District programme is an innovation in governance that covers about 15% of India’s population and is reflective of the priority of the Government to provide for the poorest of poor. It is a well-known fact that India is on a high growth trajectory. What was urgently needed however was the enhancement of the Human Development Index and the reduction in the significant inter-state and inter-district variations in development. For this to happen, the Prime Minister felt that the aspirational districts have to be transformed, and launched the ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ programme in January 2018. 

The programme hinges on expeditiously transforming 115 districts that were identified from 28 states, in a transparent manner. There are three core aspects that frame the structure of the programme- Convergence (of Central & State Schemes), Collaboration (of Central, State level ‘Prabhari’ Officers & District Collectors), and Competition among districts. Driven primarily by the States and instituted for the States, this initiative focuses on the strength of each district, and identifies the attainable outcomes for immediate improvement, while measuring progress, and ranking the selected districts. 

Operationally, the officers at the level of Additional Secretary have been nominated to become the ‘Central Prabhari Officers’ of each district, while States have appointed state-nodal and Prabhari officers. An Empowered Committee under the convenorship of the CEO of NITI Aayog, has been instituted to help in the convergence of various government schemes and streamlining of efforts. The districts were considered after consultation with State Officials using a composite index of key data sets. The Prabhari Officers provide feedback and recommendations basis their findings, and the Empowered Committee will then make necessary amendments on an ongoing basis based on the feedback. 

To optimally utilize potential and ensure that the New India 2022 is a part of every individual’s vision especially in the rural areas, this initiative focuses closely on improving people’s ability to participate fully in the rapidly growing economy. After several rounds of consultations, it was decided that the baseline ranking for the 115 aspirational districts is based on 49 indicators across five sectors that includes health and nutrition (30% weightage) through 13 indicators, education (30%) through 8 indicators, agriculture and water resources (20%) through 10 indicators, financial inclusion and skill development (10%) through 10 indicators, and basic infrastructure (10%) through 7 indicators.

The districts were selected through a transparent process, with the capacity of States kept in mind. 50 districts are allocated across 12 Ministries. 35 districts that are in the Left Wing Extremist areas are allocated to the Ministry of Home Affairs, and 30 districts have been allocated to NITI Aayog. 

          There will be a dynamic ranking of performance of districts. Objective & measurable indicators have been identified in focus sectors. These are going to be benchmarked with the best performing districts in India. Since the progress will be captured on a real time basis, a dashboard has been formulated that features a real-time monitoring mechanism. The key tangible outcomes will be as follows:

a) what is measured, is expected to improve rapidly across states

b) a co-operative competition among districts as a vital strategy

c) and eventually, this initiative is expected to help fine-tune Government programmes.  

As of April 1, 2018 districts have started entering data. To help evaluate progress and the success of initiatives introduced by the Central Government in collaboration with the States, a delta ranking of these districts will be displayed every month from May 2018 on the dashboard based on the ""incremental progress"" to be monitored on a real-time basis. 

With this initiative, India would emerge as a hub for experiment as globally, governments have been increasingly incorporating data to inform policies on a large scale. For example, the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare uses data from several agencies to manage welfare benefits and services provided by the government. Similarly, the Japanese government is leveraging data to help prevent and manage natural disasters. Yet, the use of data under India’s Aspirational Districts program is unique because of its scale and scope. No other developing country has undertaken a program that focuses on holistic development of a large share of its population.

This programme is non-partisan and completely unbiased. It is an all-India initiative meant to trigger uniform growth and development in every corner of the country. Simply put, it is a landmark unprecedented achievement for e-monitoring, governance and productive use of real-time data through a participatory method that involves everyone. Something like this has never before been attempted let alone achieved, and this is the first step in ensuring a national inclusive development strategy that is broad-based and ensures that no district is left behind.

Not merely as a name and shame module, this programme is essentially a competitive federalism and synergy-enhancing module that will eventually give every corner of India - rural or urban, a chance to exceed its own aspirations, and a platform to be heard and where required, helped. The initiative is supported by prestigious partners in programme implementation which provide ground level support, like the Tata Trust, Piramal Foundation, ITC, and L&T, as well as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and IDInsight to conduct surveys.  The partners will ably support the programme through leadership development, change management, technology integration and implementing various innovative practices. 

NITI Aayog and all associated Ministries are working closely with the States towards a transparent, inclusive and accountable India. With a dedicated team committed to this project, this is an immersive initiative that will change the landscape of how India progresses through the vision of the Government of India. 

NITI’s focus is to improve India in the Human Development Index ranking, raising the living standards of its citizens and ensuring inclusive growth for all. Unless these districts are brought up to the parameters that each of us expects from our own lives, India will not be able to progress at the rapid pace that would otherwise be achieved from the Governments broad range of initiatives and development strategy. With this initiative much will be achieved towards uniform development. It is unquestionable that the ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ initiative envisioned by the Prime Minister is a giant leap towards transforming India for the New India 2022 vision.

                The first meeting of the newly constituted ‘NITI Forum for North East’ was held in Agartala, Tripura today. The meeting, organized by the NITI Aayog, Ministry of DoNER and the North Eastern Council (NEC), was co-chaired by the Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog, Shri Rajeev Kumar and the Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Dr. Jitendra Singh. Chief Minister of Tripura, Shri Biplab Kumar Deb, Chief Minister of Nagaland, Shri Neiphiu Rio and the Chief Minister of Meghalaya, Shri Conrad Sangma, besides Deputy Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Shri Chowna Mein also participated in the day-long deliberations. Senior Ministers, Chief Secretaries and senior officers of the Central Ministries and State Governments were also present.

 

In his inaugural address, Shri Rajiv Kumar said the focus of development projects in the NER will be based on the concept of “HIRA” (Highways, Inland Waterways, Railways and Airways) as spelled out by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He said emphasis will also be made on Education, Health and Skill Development in the region. He further said that Horticulture, Tourism, Food Processing, use of Bamboo and Made in North-East will be developed through five Mission Mode projects in a time-bound manner.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Jitendra Singh, said the Government has focused on development in a region which more or less remained out of the mainstream for the last seven decades since Independence. He said there has been a significant 21% rise in fund utilization in the North-East during the last three years. Dr. Jitendra Singh said the Central Government has now committed full 100% funding for development projects in the NER, as against 90-10 ratio earlier with the State Governments funding 10% of the total cost. 

 

Nagaland Chief Minister Shri Neiphiu Rio pointed out that Kohima is the only state capital in the North-East which does not have an airport. He said the State Government has acquired land for this purpose and at least one small airstrip at Kohima should be constructed for providing air connectivity to Nagaland under the UDAN scheme.

 

Meghalaya Chief Minister Shri Conrad Sangma said that development is the solution for all socio-economic problems in the region and through Infrastructure and Connectivity,  many development problems can be solved. He said that the National Games-2022 will be held in Meghalaya, which will coincide with the 75th Anniversary of Indian Independence. He further said that economic challenges of the NER can be met by removing the physical and economic barriers. Chief Minister of Tripura, Shri Biplab Kumar Deb thanked the Prime Minister for giving Tripura an opportunity to host this prestigious event. He said that the State bordering with Bangladesh from three sides imports more than Rs.300 crores annually from Bangladesh but exports a meager Rs.4.6 crores. He said certain provisions prohibit export of rubber from Tripura, but the same is routed through West Bengal. Shri Deb said Tripura has immense potential in fisheries as the state has the world’s best climate suitable for aquaculture but this has not been exploited.

 

Representatives of all eight member States of the NER gave their valuable suggestions on Moving towards a prosperous North East Region, the theme for today’s meeting. Secretary, DoNER Shri Naveen Verma and Secretary, NEC, Shri Ram Muivah explained the status of different development projects in the region.

 

The ‘NITI Forum for North East’ was constituted in February 2018 with an aim to ensure sustainable economic growth of the North Eastern Region (NER) of the country and periodically review the development status in NER.

                The Competition Commission of India (‘CCI’) passed Final Order imposing penalty on three leading Indian Zinc-Carbon Dry Cell Battery manufacturers-Eveready Industries India Ltd. (‘Eveready’), Indo National Ltd. (‘Nippo’), Panasonic Energy India Co. Ltd. (‘Panasonic’) and their association AIDCM (Association of Indian Dry Cell Manufacturers) for colluding to fix prices of zinc-carbon dry cell battery in India. CCI invoked the provisions of Section 46 of the Competition Act, 2002 (‘the Act’) read with the Competition Commission of India (Lesser Penalty) Regulations, 2009 (‘Lesser Penalty Regulations’) to reduce the penalty imposed upon Panasonic, Eveready and Nippo by 100 percent, 30 percent and 20 percent respectively .

The case against these battery manufacturers was taken-up by CCIsuo motu under Section 19 of the Act based on the disclosure by Panasonic under Section 46 of the Act read with the Lesser Penalty Regulations. During investigation, DG (Investigation), CCI in exercise of the powers vested with it under Section 41(3) of the Act carried-out simultaneous search and seizure operations at the premises of Eveready, Nippo and Panasonic on 23 August 2016 and seized incriminating material and documents there from. Subsequently, while the investigation was in progress and report from the DG was pending, Eveready and Nippo, approached CCI as lesser penalty applicants. 

From the evidence collected in the case, CCI found that the three battery manufacturers, facilitated by AIDCM, had indulged in anticompetitive conduct of price coordination, limiting production/ supply as well as market allocation in contravention of the provisions of Section 3(3)(a), 3(3)(b) and 3(3)(c) read with Section 3(1) of the Act. It was observed that the conduct was continuing from 2008, which is prior to 20May 2009, the date on which Section 3 of the Act became enforceable, and up till 23 August 2016 i.e. the date of search and seizure operations by the DG.

Considering contravention of provisions of the Act, an amount of Rs.245.07 crore, Rs. 52.82 crore and Rs. 74.68 crore was computed as leviable penalty on three battery manufacturers i.e. Eveready, Nippo and Panasonic, respectively, in terms of proviso to Section 27 (b) of the Act. While computing leviable penalty, CCI took into consideration all relevant factors including duration of cartel, industry conditions, etc. and decided to levy penalty on the three battery manufacturers at the rate of 1.25 times of their profit for each year from 2009-10 to 2016-17. Also, penalty of Rs. 1.85 Lakh was levied on AIDCM at the rate of 10 percent of average of its receipts for preceding three years. Additionally, considering totality of facts and circumstances of the case, penalty leviable on individual officials/ office bearers of the three battery manufacturers and AIDCM was computed at the rate of 10 percent of the average of their income for preceding three years.

 

Keeping in view the stage at which the lesser penalty application was filed, co-operation extended in conjunction with the value addition provided in establishing the existence of cartel, CCI granted Panasonic and its individuals 100 percent reduction in the penalty than was otherwise leviable. Eveready and Nippo, along with their individuals, were granted 30 and 20 percent reduction in penalty respectively. Pursuant to reduction, penalty imposed on Eveready was Rs. 171.55crore (Rupees One Hundred Seventy-One Crores and Fifty-Five Lakhs) and on Nippo was Rs. 42.26 crore (Rupees Forty-Two Crores and Twenty Six Lakhs). No penalty was imposedon Panasonic.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for rightsizing the Competition Commission of India (CCI) from One Chairperson and Six Members (totalling seven) to One Chairperson and Three Members (totalling four) by not filling the existing vacancies of two Members and one more additional vacancy, which is expected in September, 2018 when one of the present incumbents will complete his term.

Benefits:

The proposal is expected to result in reduction of three Posts of Members of the Commission in pursuance of the Governments objective of ""Minimum Government - Maximum Governance"".

As part of the Governments objective of easing the mergers and amalgamation process in the country, the Ministry had revised de minimis levels in 2017, which have been made applicable for all forms of combinations and the methodology for computing assets and turnover of the target involved in such combinations, has been spelt out. This has led to reduction in the notices that enterprises are mandated to submit to the Commission, while entering into combinations, thereby reducing the load on the Commission.

The faster turnaround in hearings is expected to result in speedier approvals, thereby stimulating the business processes of corporates and resulting in greater employment opportunities in the country.

The proposal is expected to result in reduction of three Posts of Members of the Commission in pursuance of the Governments objective of ""Minimum Government - Maximum Governance"".

Background:

   Section 8(1) of the Competition Act, 2002 (the Act) provides that the Commission shall consist of a Chairperson and not less than two and not more than six Members. Presently, the Chairperson and four Members are in position.                  

An initial limit of one Chairperson and not more than ten Members was provided in the Act, keeping in view the requirement of creating a Principal Bench, other Additional Bench or Mergers Bench, comprising at least two Members each, in places as notified by the Central Government. In the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007 (39 of 2007), Section 22 of the Act was amended removing the provision for creation of Benches. In the same Amendment Act, while the Competition Appellate Tribunal comprising one Chairperson and two Members was created, the size of the Commission itself was not commensurately reduced and was kept at one Chairperson and not less than two but not more than six Members.

The Commission has been functioning as a collegium right from its inception. In several major jurisdictions such as in Japan, USA and U.K. Competition Authorities are of a similar size.
