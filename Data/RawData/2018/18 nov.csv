                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the 2nd International Ambedkar Conclave today (November 30, 2018) in New Delhi as part of the commemoration of Constitution Day. The Conclave is being organised by the Forum of SC and ST Legislators and Parliamentarians and the Dr Ambedkar Chamber of Commerce.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Dr Ambedkar’s long struggle for equality, constitutionalism and fraternity established him as a national icon. He received immense affection and respect because he communicated hope, self-confidence and self-esteem among traditionally disadvantaged communities and groups. He devoted his entire life to creating awareness among such sections of society.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the world looks at India differently today. India is seen as an eminent power, expected to play a prominent role in shaping the global paradigm with regards to international security, trade and commerce, and environmental protection. India’s rise in the international order has many dimensions to it. And it draws heavily from the capabilities and valour of our Armed Forces, including our air warriors.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received the first copy of the book “Making of New India: Transformation under Modi Government”, from Shri Arun Jaitley, Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs. Shri Jaitley formally released it at a function held at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (November 27, 2018). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that contemporary governance has played a vital role in giving shape and form to an all-inclusive idea of “New India”. “Inclusiveness” is more than just a slogan. The government has taken this philosophy to the centre of its policy making. Numerous measures have been taken to ensure that socio-economic groups, communities and regions that had so far been left behind in the India growth story are mainstreamed in a holistic manner. This government has begun some foundational programmes and made a determined attempt to decisively defeat poverty and lift the lives of millions who have hitherto not got the facilities and services that they deserved. 

The President said it would, however, be incorrect to say that the development journey has been that of the government alone. The zeal with which ordinary citizens have participated also needs to be acknowledged. It has been heartening to see people voluntarily let go of subsidies and financial benefits so that the deserving and the truly needy can avail and access a life of dignity. It is common to see people selflessly doing shramdaan to change the status quo. It is this enthusiastic contribution by citizens of our country that is enabling rapid transformation. 

The President noted that the book “Making of New India” endeavours at weaving together an assessment of various policies and programmes, and provides its readers a multidimensional view of the national development journey. He expressed confidence that the analysis and papers presented in the book would be helpful reference for both citizens and the government. 

This book, edited by Dr Bibek Debroy, Dr Anirban Ganguly and Shri Kishore Desai, contains 51 essays on themes ranging from economy to diplomacy, education to public health.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the Constitution Day celebrations, organised by the Supreme Court, to mark the anniversary of the adoption of our Constitution on November 26, 1949, today (November 26, 2018) in New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the Constitution is the modern scripture of independent India. It is our suprema lex. However, it is more than just a collection of articles and clauses. For us Indians it is an inspirational and living document, an ideal of the society we are and the even better society we are striving to be.

The President said that Dr B. R. Ambedkar and his colleagues in the Constituent Assembly were remarkably large-hearted and generous in their approach. They allowed for flexibility in amending the Constitution and were accommodative of various streams of thought. Above all, they trusted the wisdom of future generations to expand the frontiers of freedom and liberty, justice and fraternity, fairness and equality. They trusted future generations to not just amend the Constitution’s text, but to constructively re-imagine and re-interpret it for changing times. If we continue to be true to this spirit, the Constitution can serve India for all times to come.

The President said that the people of India are the ultimate custodians of the Constitution. It is in them that sovereignty vests and it is in their name that the Constitution was adopted. The Constitution empowers the citizen, but the citizen too empowers the Constitution – by following it, by adhering to it, by protecting it, and by persevering to make it more meaningful with words and deeds. The Constitution is nobody’s preserve – and it is everybody’s preserve.

The President said that perhaps the most moving word in the Constitution is “justice”. “Justice” is a single word. “Justice” is a complex and liberating expression. And “justice” is both the means and the goal of our constitutional and nation-building process. Justice must also be seen in a wider context – in terms of society’s evolution and its changing beliefs, lifestyles and technologies.

The President said that given the diverse history of our people, and given imbalances and hierarchies that have sometimes marked our past, social justice remains a touchstone of our nation building. At the simplest level, it implies the removal of societal imbalances and the harmonisation of rival claims and needs of different communities and groups. Social justice is about providing equal opportunities. Such a conceptualisation of justice was valid in 1949 and broadly remains relevant today. Even so, the 21st century has brought new challenges. No doubt the concept of justice - political, economic and social – has a resilient core but it needs to be thought of in innovative ways. It requires to be applied afresh to emerging situations – situations that may not have existed or been foreseen when our Constitution framers were at work.

The President said that in India, the idea of social justice too has expanded to encompass modern civic parameters – such as clean air; less polluted cities and towns, rivers and water bodies; sanitary and hygienic living conditions; and green and eco-friendly growth and development. These are all implications of environmental and climate justice, within the framework of social justice. If a child suffers from asthma due to air pollution it would be considered a gap in providing social justice.

The President said that perhaps the most tantalising influence on justice is that of technology. Technology is an enhancer of justice as well as a challenge. It calls for us to think of technology justice as a subset of economic justice. This is very true in the context of access to technology for our poorer and less-privileged fellow citizens.

The President said that innovation has also worked for the benefit of disadvantaged sections of society. A case in point is India’s experience with technology-enabled, Aadhar-linked direct benefit transfers. These have plugged corruption, leakages and exclusion from India’s welfare programmes.

The President said that innovation and technology have brought gains. But they have also brought questions of access and privacy. For example, there is the dilemma of weighing data privacy against the use of data for the greater common good. Within these competing imperatives lie competing notions of justice. And such issues will probably stay with us through the 21st century.

                 The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, reached Melbourne today (November 23, 2018) on the third day of his visit to Australia. He addressed students and members of the academic community at the University of Melbourne. The topic of his address was “Australia and India as Knowledge Partners”.
 
Speaking on the occasion, the President said the India-Australia knowledge partnership rests on two pillars: education cooperation and scientific collaboration. The President said Australia is the second most preferred destination for higher education for Indian students. Today, there are about 85,000 Indian students in various parts of Australia. He noted that “education” has been chosen as the flagship sector for Australia in the “India Economic Strategy” commissioned by the Australian government. He also noted that Australia is among the top five research partner countries for India. The Australia India Strategic Research Fund is Australia’s biggest investment in research collaboration with any single country. Coinciding with the President’s visit, both countries have announced a renewed commitment of Aus$ 10 million each towards the Fund.
 
Earlier the President commenced his engagements in Melbourne with a visit to Government House, where he was received by the Governor of Victoria, Ms Linda Dessau. The Governor hosted a luncheon banquet in honour of the President. Speaking on the occasion, the President praised the government of Victoria’s emphasis on trade and business with India. He appreciated Melbourne and Victoria for being welcoming of the Indian community and the Indian-origin diaspora. He said it was a matter of pride that the Indian diaspora is contributing strongly to the Victorian economy.
 
Subsequently the Leader of the Opposition in Australia, and the leader of the Labor Party, Mr Bill Shorten, called on President Kovind. The President thanked Mr Shorten for the bipartisan support in Australia for good relations with India, and Mr Shorten responded by calling India a priority for Australia. The two leaders also discussed the advance of India’s renewable energy programme and India’s initiative in setting up the International Solar Alliance.   
 
There was a proposal that the President visit the Melbourne Cricket Ground and meet the Indian and Australian cricket teams playing the T20 match there, as well as watch a few minutes of play. This engagement was called off due to inclement weather conditions. 
 
Tomorrow (November 24, 2018) morning, the President will fly out of Australia and begin his journey home.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has sent his greetings to fellow citizens on the eve of birthday of Guru Nanak Dev.

In a message, the President has said, “Remembering the life and teachings of Guru Nanak Dev, I offer my greetings and good wishes on this sacred occasion to all my fellow citizens, including members of the Sikh community.

The life of Guru Nanak Dev teaches us love and harmony. He gave us the mantra of ‘Ek Omkar Satnam’, which means that there is only One God.

While emphasising values of love, peace and compassion, Guru Nanak Dev equated service to humanity with service to God. His preachings such as “Vand Chako – sharing with others, Kirat Karo – making an honest living and, Naam Japo- Remembering God at all times” capture the essence of his message.

Let us resolve to follow the path shown by Guru Nanak Dev and work for the welfare of the society”.

	I am happy to be here to speak at the Australian Financial Review India Business Summit. I thank the organisers for the invitation to address Australia’s leading businesspersons and thought leaders. This is my first visit to your country in my capacity as the President of India and I am thankful too for the wonderful reception accorded by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister and the government and people of Australia. Coming to this beautiful city and savouring its scenic harbour, it has been easy to understand why people are so quickly charmed by Sydney – and by Australia. 


 


	I must acknowledge the presence of Prime Minister Scott Morrison. We met this morning and had a meaningful conversation. I appreciate his leadership of Australia and commitment to the relationship with India, as well as his encouraging words on the recently released “India Economic Strategy”. About a week ago, in Singapore, he met our Prime Minister, Mr Narendra Modi, and my visit takes forward our dialogue, discussion and cooperation. I gather that Prime Minister Morrison has a taste for Indian food and in fact cooks a mean curry. I am sure he can help us come up with a recipe for even better Australia-India relations.


 


	Australia and India are united by a history of shared sacrifice on the beaches of Gallipoli; a shared vision for the peace and prosperity of a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific Region; a shared instinct for entrepreneurship; a shared hope for a prosperous and yet eco-friendly and environmentally sustainable planet; and a shared passion for cricket. For many Indian cricket fans, Australia is their favourite team – except when you are playing India but especially when you are competing for the Ashes. There are other attributes we share as well – the values of democracy, pluralism and human dignity, the English language – and the belief that at the simplest, most basic level, business, trade and technology must change lives of those sections of society who need change the most. 


 


	Our countries have been among the beneficiaries of globalisation. Australia’s economy has expanded strongly in the past quarter-century. In this period, India’s economic integration with the global business system too has strengthened. In the ultimate analysis, a process such as globalisation is most meaningful when it helps the range of global stakeholders – from international corporations to local communities, whether in Australia or India. In recent years, India has renewed its commitment to a liberal, transparent and globalised economy. In terms of openness to foreign capital and international investors, India is in the top league. Business sector after business sector, from aviation to mining to defence production, has had doors thrown open to global players and investors.


 


	Such steps have been complemented by other initiatives at home. India is in the midst of an infrastructure push of unusual urgency. A determined accretion in highway construction; a nationwide urban and rural broadband rollout; creating new railway and freight corridors; an ambitious programme of modernising ports; high-speed train networks in major urban centres; expanding air connectivity using upgraded as well as greenfield airports; industrial corridors that are gathering momentum – the buzz of construction is everywhere. Large cranes and armies of workers in hard hats dot the Indian landscape. India is in business. 


 


	India’s growth is different from that of many others. We are the first major country that is seeking to make that leap into industrialisation while also combating climate change, and while reducing the intensity of dependence on fossil fuels. I will not bore you with statistics – in the context of India, they are always large and impressive – but there is one number I want to share with you. India has set itself a target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022, of which 100 gigawatts will comprise solar energy. We are on course to not just achieving that target but exceeding it.


 


	Fiscal and regulatory processes have also been significantly revamped. A little over a year ago India inaugurated the Goods and Services Tax regime. This has brought the 29 states of our country on a common tax platform. It is already making for a cleaner and more structured business system. In parallel, on the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index India has moved up from a rank of 142 in 2014 to 77 in 2018. This 65 step jump is the biggest for any single country.


 


	All of these measures – fiscal and regulatory, infrastructure promotion and investment policy – are aimed at making India even more of a hub for new, exciting and global businesses. These could be in manufacturing and services, in agricultural industries as well as emerging technologies. Our Make in India programme is gathering pace. It aims to promote India as a design, fabrication and manufacture location – not in isolation, for that is neither possible nor desirable, but as part of global and Indo-Pacific value chains. I am happy to note that mass-transit rail coaches made in India have recently been exported to Australia. From textiles to automobiles there are so many other made-in-India products in which we could interest you. 


 


	The international business community has responded to India’s achievements with appreciable investment. In financial year 2017-18, India drew about US$ 62 billion. This was an acknowledgement of India’s honest and reformist efforts – and of its high GDP growth. In the previous quarter, for instance, our economy grew by 8.2 per cent.


 


	An underlying theme of economic and social transformation in India is the role of technology and innovation. India’s traditional strength in IT is well-known. There are many Indian IT companies that have invested in Australia itself, adding value to companies and clients here and employing young Australians. In India, technology is acquiring a wider base as well as climbing up the chain. A start-up culture that is the world’s third largest has made entrepreneurs of young students and led to businesses being incubated on campuses, in small homes, and even little farms, where the farmer is using her excess produce to negotiate a better price in a larger market. Inevitably, India’s digital economy, its e-commerce companies, its technology start-ups and its fin-tech innovators are attracting FDI.  


 


	Frankly the big country and big friend that we are not seeing as much of, in the India investment story, is Australia. This is a gap we need to address. Australia and India have too much at stake in each other to not up their game. We can collaborate and benefit from each other’s expertise in fin-tech and logistics, in industrial design and biotech, in the capital markets and in farm-to-fork management of the food chain – even in space tech and satellite launch services, where India’s long-standing space programme will be happy to support the new Australian Space Agency. It’s not that Australian companies are not present in India – it’s just that there is still enormous room for us to work together. 


 


	The Indian market offers Australian companies and investors a huge consumer base and the prospect of considerable returns. Australian super-funds or pension funds have a reputation for careful, calibrated investment decisions. They will find the Indian infrastructure space worth their while – with long-term investments, steady to high returns, confidence in growing consumption, and security in contractual adherence. Let us put our heads together and create investment products that work for Australian super-funds and Indian infrastructure and that work for Australian pensioners and Indian consumers – and that lead to a win-win situation.


 

Ladies and Gentleman,


	Along with investment, bilateral trade numbers have grown but remain below potential. India-Australia trade was valued at about US$ 21 billion in 2017.  Our trade basket must grow. I am confident that we will make progress on the Australia-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. In the recent Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership meeting held in Singapore, India and Australia, along with the other negotiating partners, made significant progress. India is positively and constructively engaging in the negotiations and will contribute to the conclusion of RCEP by 2019. India looks forward to a balanced outcome that results in a modern, comprehensive and mutually beneficial economic Partnership. 


 


	In many senses, society is already ahead of governments. The Indian community in Australia is adding value to the economy. The Indian diaspora has a reputation for contributing to local business ecosystems as well as opening job and innovation avenues for its host country. Silicon Valley is a case in point. I have been told that here in Australia, India-born migrants are the second-highest tax-paying diaspora after United Kingdom born migrants. That must please the Prime Minister. And in India too, Australians are a growing part of the workforce in fields as far apart as software and entertainment. The Indian Premier League, perhaps the hottest cricket start-up of all time, recruits many high-performing and highly-paid cricket professionals from Australia – players, coaches and support staff. In their own way, the Indians in Australia and the Australians in India are showing us the future.


Ladies and Gentlemen,


	They say cricket is a metaphor for life. I believe it is also a metaphor for business. Australian businesspersons and investors looking to India should borrow from the methods of cricketers. The most successful Australian batsmen in India have been those who have shown patience, read the conditions carefully, settled down for a long innings, nurtured dependable partnerships – and not fallen for spin.


Come to India. The pitch is ready! 

Thank you Mr Prime Minister and thank you everybody. Have a nice evening.

	I thank you, Your Excellency, for your gracious words of welcome and warm hospitality. 
	I am delighted to be paying the first Presidential visit from India to Australia. Our two countries enjoy warm and friendly relations underpinned by shared values and strong people-to-people ties. Commonwealth, curry and cricket once defined our shared culture, but we have moved beyond. We have expanded our ties in defence and security; trade and investment; technology and knowledge; and environment and energy fields.  
	Our strategic partnership and our common geopolitical understanding have imparted a new salience to our bilateral engagement. It has made our agenda and action that much deeper and meaningful. 
	Our togetherness goes back deep into history. When the new settlers arrived here in the 18th Century, the first supplies to support, nourish and house them were sent from India. The India connect only grew over time. Out of the first five Governors of this province, four had spent a substantial part of their careers in India. We cherish our historical connect, as much as we celebrate our contemporary partnership. 
	Over the years, our ties have grown from strength to strength. Our economic collaboration has expanded several-fold and we both remain eager to investment more, trade more and transact more. Our knowledge, education and technology partnerships are challenging new frontiers. And together, we are bringing prosperity and growth for one and many.  
	Excellency, in the past we have fought together, in trenches and in faraway lands, for freedom and liberty.  And today we are harnessing energies to make the planet sustainable and secure.  We are, indeed, proud of our partnership. Let us work to make India-Australia relations grow higher and stronger. 


Thank you!

	I am delighted to be visiting Paramatta. It is an honor for me to unveil the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, our Father of the Nation in these beautiful surroundings. I thank you for honouring him in your country. And I thank Prime Minister Morrison for his august presence here.
	This initiative has a very special meaning. To help spread his legacy and timeless message across the world, the Government of India had, just a month ago, launched a two-year long series of events on the occasion of his 150th birth anniversary year. I warmly invite all of you to join us in these celebrations. 
	Mahatma Gandhi belongs not just to India, but to the entire world. His universal teachings have a special resonance in all corners. In these times of strife, his powerful message of nonviolence and peaceful coexistence stands all the more relevant. His favourite bhajan or song “Vaishnava Jan To Tene Kahiye” the essence of which is compassion, kindness and goodness for others, for once and  for always, without letting  pride enter one’s mind. This captures the inner voice of the Mahatma. I thank your melodious singer Heather Lee for giving her voice to the song as a tribute to our Father of the Nation. Many others, across the five continents, have also paid a similar tribute to his thought and legacy.


Ladies and Gentlemen,


	 Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas and values resonate, deeply and powerfully, in this land. There is a special connect between Gandhian thought and the Australian way of life. Mahatma Gandhi always championed the cause of environment and nature. His idea of compassion and kindness extended beyond the human pale around him. He had deep respect for forests, rivers and our habitat. These are values that you passionately own, share and keep close to your hearts in your daily lives. 
	On another note, Gandhiji and the Australian society strike a common cord. He, as you do, had the deepest regard and respect for multicultural ethos. He said and I quote – “I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed.  I want the cultures of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible.” –unquote. As a country which is home to people from every part of the world, Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy could not be more relevant to its values and ethos. 
	The statue to be unveiled today on the initiative of Paramatta City Council also symbolizes the historic bond that ties our nations together.  As the world’s largest democracy and as a country that celebrates its diversity and openness, we take immense pride in our relations with Australia. The vibrant link at the people-to-people level adds vigor and vitality to this relationship.  
	Going forward, I am optimistic that our two countries, which share so much in common, can achieve so much more together. On this special occasion, I am especially gratified by the presence of a large number of Indian diaspora members. They serve as a living bridge between their new home and the land of their ancestors. Gandhiji himself was a “pravasi” or an expatriate. He lived in South Africa for 21 years before he returned to India and went on to change the course of our history. 
	I am happy to note the tremendous contribution made by hundreds of thousands of qualified, hardworking, diligent and enterprising Indian Diaspora members in the nation making of this beautiful country. I convey to them and to all Australians good wishes and love from the people of India.
	May we all resolve today to draw inspiration from the life and teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and work for the lasting benefit of humanity? I once again thank the Lord Mayor for making this event a success and all those who have contributed to this wonderful initiative.


Thank you!

	I am happy to address this annual Australia-India Business Council event. The Council has been a key player in driving Australia-India business and investment connect. I applaud your initiatives and efforts. We commend your economic outreach, and as much, your strategy to get Australia-India stakeholders from diverse areas together. These have, obviously, paid rich dividends.
	India and Australia are close and natural friends. There is a special comfort and bond between our two countries. Our shared values and commonalities, not the least our passion for cricket and cinema, have helped us establish a vibrant partnership.
	In recent years, we have stepped up our Strategic Partnership deepening our engagement in defence, security, technology and people-to-people ties. There is matching energy and heightened policy focus on our trade and investment relations as well. In this context, I am happy that the Australian side has come up with the “India Economic Strategy” report. We welcome it. It has promising ideas and prospects. We also welcome Australian government response to the report. Prime Minister Morrison’s articulation on this few hours back has been most encouraging. The AIBC, I am sure, will take lead in supporting the recommendations. 


Ladies and Gentlemen,


	India and Australia share strong economic complementarities. Australia’s steady and stable growth, over several decades, has made it a shinning story; and India’s economic rise today is a global talking point.  Built on this shared prosperity, our bilateral trade in goods and services has jumped over 75 per cent in the last five years and stood at US$ 21.5 billion in 2017. Our service sector engagement based on education, professional services and tourism flows has also seen a significant jump. We can, no doubt, do much better with a forward looking mobility partnership. India remains committed to take the proposed Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement forward to further boost our trading ties.
	Our investment relations, however, comparative to our respective economy size and prospects, are yet to take-off. The two-way cumulative investment stands at just under 30 billion Australian dollars. I am certain this would change fast and soon.
	Australian pension funds, high-end technologies and innovative products are a natural fit for Indian growth and development. We can do lot more together be it on trade, investment, technology, skills or education. Prospects and possibilities are not just manifold but limitless. We should collaborate with each other on cyberspace, artificial intelligence, block chain development and next-generation technologies to shape and guide the Fourth Industrial Revolution. And we should harness the potential of blue economy and green growth for the benefit of future generations and a climate-smart world.  
	The prospect to collaborate and transact gets even more magnified, if you set it, in the backdrop of the transformational economic changes happening in India. India has been the fastest growing large economy in the world for quite some time. Last quarter, we grew 8.2 per cent. With a current GDP of US$ 2.6 trillion, we are on course to become a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2025. During the same period, India is set to become the third largest consumer market in the world.
	Our path-breaking economic reforms have led to a jump of 65 notches on the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index in the last four years. And the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax has made India, a country of 1.3 billion people, into One Nation, One Tax, One Market for the first time in its history. India has been ranked as the 58th most competitive economy in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competiveness Index for 2018. India’s rank rose by five places as compared to 2017, the largest gain among the G-20 countries. Global investor confidence in the country is at all-time high. We received FDI worth over US$ 200 billion in the last four years. 
	Indian infrastructure sector is booming. We have built 10,000 kilometers of expressways last year alone. We are at work to build 100 Smart Cities, 7 high speed train corridors and 10 greenfield airports. For Australian super funds with considerable investible surplus and its resource sector, our infrastructure projects present an exciting opportunity. Similar business opportunities exist in the Indian agriculture and food processing sectors as well. We seek your collaboration in putting up logistic chains and water and energy efficient agri-techniques to boost our food security options.
	In the energy field, we are adding new capacity in nuclear, renewable and conventional segments. We have a target to achieve 175 gigawatts of renewable energy, including 100 gigawatts of solar energy by 2022. Over US$ 250 billion worth of investment are projected to flow into the sector over the next few years.
	We are keen to leverage Australian technology, business practices and expertise to enhance our Make in India, Digital India, Clean India and Skill India programmes. Thanks to our sustained efforts, India has emerged as key manufacturing hub of the world in several areas including passenger cars, two-wheelers, consumer electronics and mobile handsets. Our IT, start-up, fin-tech, nanotech and biotech capacities also provide immense opportunities for Australian market to learn and earn from.


Ladies and Gentlemen,


	There is a world of opportunities waiting for you in India.   They are enticing you to run, to leap and to hop-skip-and-jump. I like your cultural expression - “mate” and “mateship”. I hope to see more mates and mateship between the business communities of Australia and India. I take this opportunity to thank the Government of Australia for welcoming Indian businesses in this country. I am confident of their continued support. Let us work together for stronger Australia-India engagement.


Thank you!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, had a packed schedule in Sydney today (November 22, 2018) on the second day of his visit to Australia. The President held talks with Governor-General Peter Cosgrove and Prime Minister Scott Morrison; was accorded a ceremonial reception and hosted at a luncheon banquet by the Governor-General at Admiralty House; and unveiled, along with the Australian Prime Minister, a statue of Mahatma Gandhi at the Jubilee Park in Parramatta, near Sydney. The President also delivered two major addresses – at the Australian Financial Review India Business Summit; and at the Australia-India Business Council dinner event hosted in his honour.

As part of President Kovind’s visit, five agreements have been concluded between India and Australia. These are:


	An agreement between the Government of India and the Government of Australia for cooperation in the area of disability and to deliver services to the differently-abled
	An agreement between Invest India and Austrade to facilitate bilateral investment
	An agreement between the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute, based in Ranchi, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organisation, based in Canberra, to foster scientific collaboration and innovation
	An agreement between the Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University, Guntur, and the University of Western Australia, Perth, for cooperation in agricultural research and education
	A Joint PhD agreement between the Indraprashta Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, and the Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane


President Kovind and Prime Minister Morrison were together on three separate occasions today, including during their morning round of talks. Several issues came up in their wide-ranging discussions, including trade and investment, the need to expand the trade basket from simply a few commodities, and the strong connections forged by the Indian diaspora. 

In the afternoon, speaking at the Australian Financial Review India Business Summit, at which Prime Minister Morrison was also present, President Kovind said that in recent years India has renewed its commitment to a liberal, transparent and globalised economy. In terms of openness to foreign capital and international investors, India is in the top league. Business sector after business sector, from aviation to mining to defence production, has had doors thrown open to global players and investors. Several measures – fiscal and regulatory, infrastructure promotion and investment policy – have been taken to make India even more of a hub for new, exciting and global businesses.

The President said that the international business community has responded to India’s achievements with appreciable investment. In financial year 2017-18, India drew almost US$ 62 billion in FDI. This was an acknowledgement of India’s honest and reformist efforts – and of its high GDP growth.

The President noted that the big country and big friend that we not seeing as much of in the India investment story is Australia. This is a gap we need to address. Australia and India have too much at stake in each other to not up their game. We can collaborate and benefit from each other’s expertise in fintech and logistics, in industrial design and biotech, in the capital markets and in farm-to-fork management of the food chain – even in space tech and satellite launch services. India’s longstanding space programme, the President said, will be happy to support the new Australian Space Agency.

The President said that Australian super-funds or pension funds have a reputation for careful, calibrated investment decisions. They will find the Indian infrastructure space worth their while – with long-term investments, steady to high returns, confidence in growing consumption, and security in contractual adherence.

Ending his speech on a lighter note, the President urged Australian businesspersons and investors looking to India to borrow from the methods of their cricketers. The most successful Australian batsmen in India, he said, have been those who have shown patience, read the conditions carefully, settled down for the long innings, nurtured dependable partnerships – and not fallen for spin!

In his final engagement of the day, at the Australia-India Business Council event, the President praised the Council as a key driver of Australia-India business and investment. He expressed confidence that the Council’s members would further bilateral trade and engagement.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, reached Sydney, Australia, today (November 21, 2018) for the final leg of his two-nation state visit to Vietnam and Australia. This is the first state visit to Australia by a President of India.

 Later in the day, the President attended an Indian community reception hosted by Dr Ajay M Gondane, High Commissioner of India to Australia. Addressing the gathering, the President said it is a matter of pride that the Indian community is held in high regard and contributes to society and the economy in Australia. Today, Indian professionals are much sought after, whether in Australia or elsewhere in the world. As entrepreneurs, doctors, teachers, bankers and technology specialists, members of the Indian community are adding value to Australia.

The President said that Australia is also home to a large number of Indian students. They are excelling on campuses in academics and research, in fostering innovation and even on the sports field. Their hard work and talent is a symbol of the Australia-India Knowledge Partnership.

 Earlier President Kovind formally began his visit by paying respects at the ANZAC War Memorial in Sydney. The Memorial was originally built as a tribute to Australian soldiers who did service in World War I. In his subsequent engagement with the Indian community, the President made special mention of Indian soldiers who fought alongside their Australian comrades in World War I, including on the beaches of Gallipoli. The centenary of the conclusion of World War I was commemorated earlier this month.

	This is my first State Visit to Australia. I am delighted to meet you. I thank you for welcoming me with such warmth and affection. The beautiful Bharatnatyam performance by the Nartana Dance School and its accompanying melody, for a moment, made me feel, as if I was in some corner of India, and not in a faraway continent.   


 


	In my visits abroad, I always, and as a matter of priority, meet with our community. In fact, my interaction with the Indian Diaspora is invariably the first element in my program. And I must say, it is indeed a special and warm feeling to meet our people, our friends abroad, and to share with them thoughts and greetings from families back home.  


 


	I began my programme today with a visit to ANZAC war memorial. It is a monument dedicated to those who gave their lives to protect the freedom of others. It also celebrates the bravery and courage of Indian soldiers who fought in World Wars alongside their Australian brothers in Gallipoli and other theatres of war.  


 


	Tomorrow, I will have yet another occasion to celebrate the sacrifice and freedom for humanity. Along with Prime Minister Scott Morrison I will jointly unveil a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Parramatta. This year we have launched our worldwide celebrations of his 150th birth anniversary and the statue will be a perfect tribute to his life and legacy. I do hope you will join us there. I will also hold official talks with the Governor General and Prime Minister and discuss how to enhance bilateral ties, which     already have moved to a new strategic high, much beyond our mutual passion for cricket and our shared Commonwealth connect.      


 


	We have a large and diverse Indian community in this country speaking different languages and practising multiple faiths. This has been a month of festivals. We celebrated Diwali recently. Today is Milad-un-Nabi, the Prophet’s birthday, and I greet all our Muslim brothers and sisters on the occasion. Day after tomorrow, on 23 November, we will be celebrating Guru Purab. I convey my wishes in advance for the day to our Sikh brother and sisters here. I understand that people from all parts of Australia - from Perth, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and several other cities have come to meet and greet me. It speaks of the strong connect you have with India, your country or the land of your ancestors.


 

Ladies and Gentlemen, 


	 Indian community in Australia has a long history. The first batch of Indians came here over hundred years ago.  In the early 20th century, Indians arrived in Australia to work in banana plantations and in goldmining.  A number of them were our Sikh brothers, who first settled in Woolgoolga and then moved elsewhere. They worked hard and withstood the rigours of time.  Even in their daily struggle, they did their best to preserve their cultural moorings and way of life.  


 


	It is remarkable that the community continues to remain committed to preserving and nurturing its culture and tradition. We just enjoyed a spectacle of that dedication.  And not just that, you have also embraced the local Australians in warmth and affection. I am happy to learn that you celebrate your festivals and fairs with much enthusiasm and pride. On Baisakhi, Holi, Diwali, Eid and Christmas, you not only greet each other but also your Australian friends and neighbours. This is worthy of praise and emulation. And in the true spirit of our inclusive Indian way of living, you have also taught the joys of Halloween to your young ones.  


 


	It is a matter of pride for us that the Indian community in Australia is highly respected. Today, Indian skills and professionals are much sought after here and elsewhere in the world. Australia is also home to a large number of Indian students. They are excelling on campus in studies, research, innovation and sports. Their hard work and talent are showing in the strength of Australia - India Knowledge Partnership. I would be speaking on this theme at the Melbourne University day after tomorrow. 


 


	For many of you, Australia is your new home, for still others it is your karmabhoomi. I am happy that you have been welcomed with open arms in your adopted country and in your professional spaces. India and Australia are multicultural societies. This shared uniqueness about the two would have been comforting to you as you settled down here, making friends, families and associations. You have made significant contribution to the well-being of this country. As entrepreneurs, doctors, teachers, bankers and technology experts you are adding immense value to the Australian society and economy. We are, indeed, proud of your achievements and your success.


 

Ladies and gentlemen,   


	 I know you keep yourself updated with developments in India. Many of you visit India regularly. But those who travel after a gap of a few years will find a new India, a new experience awaiting you! 


 


	Our growth and development mirrors a new confidence in the country. India is the fastest growing major economy in the world, with a growth of 8.2 per cent last quarter.  Our path-breaking introduction of the Goods and services Tax has made India into One Nation, One Tax, One Market for the first time in its history. This and other seminal reforms have helped us jump 65 places in the last four years on the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index. Global Investor confidence in the country is at a new high. We have received over US$ 200 billion as Foreign Direct Investment in the last four years. Our work on building next - generation infrastructure including 100 Smart cities, 7 high speed train corridors, 10 greenfield airports, countrywide digital connectivity and thousands of kilometres of expressways continues apace. And we are working overtime not just for growth, but also to empower women, the differently-abled and those at the bottom of the pyramid. 


 


	Riding on high growth and transformative socio-economic changes, the youth in the country are brimming with ideas and energy. Their enterprise and innovation has made India into the third largest Start-up ecosystem in the world.  


 


	India today is full of opportunities for business, for social enterprises and for cultural connections. I invite each one of you to join us in our transformational journey. You can contribute with your ideas, your business models and your investment profiles. We count Australia as a key partner in our national flagship programmes - Make In India, Skill India, Clean India and Digital India. We are keen to leverage Australian technology, knowhow and investment for growth and development in India. You can play an important part in pushing this engagement.   


 

     Ladies and gentlemen, 


	In the last few years, you would have seen a sea-change in the way our Government is engaging and reaching out to our Diaspora. There is today a stronger connect between India and the Indian community abroad. We have started schemes such as the “Know India Programme” to better connect with our people abroad.  Our OCI scheme has been made flexible so that more and more people can benefit from it. We have mandated our Embassies to be available round the clock to our people in need. And we are extending humanitarian assistance as and where required. In the last four years, we have rescued over 90,000 Indians including people from 50 other countries caught in natural disasters or strife. 


 


	We count our Diaspora as an important partner in strengthening our international outreach. You have a role to play in spreading the message of India.  Yes, we do have our High Commissioner here, but we see each one of you as our cultural ambassador. We count on you to enhance our relations with Australia, as you have remarkably done all these years.  Next year, we would be celebrating the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas from 21st to 23rd January in Varanasi. I invite you to join us in this festivity.  


 

Ladies and gentlemen, 


	 It has been a pleasure sharing my thoughts with you. Australia is a country defined by passion and love for sports. Today, we have a T-20 India-Australia game in Brisbane. This format has changed the game of cricket in many ways. My wishes to both teams. I possibly cannot imagine my State Visit complete without meeting our Australian friends in a sporting arena. I must drop by at the MCG on November 23 to wish both the Indian and Australian cricket teams. You may be on the blue side or yellow. That does not matter. We must celebrate sports, for the sake of it and for our togetherness. I also invite you to visit Rashtrapati Bhavan when you are in India next. Yes, it is my official residence, but it belongs to all Indians and you must come-by to soak its pride and history.    


Thank you!

	It is an honour for me to be addressing the National Assembly and through it the people of Vietnam. I would like to thank the members of this Assembly, who represent all regions of your country, and particularly Madam Chairperson for extending the invitation. And I would like to thank President Nguyen Phu Trong and the government and people of Vietnam for the warm hospitality accorded to my delegation and me over the past two days.


 


	For India, all diplomatic engagements are important but some relationships are special. Our friendship with Vietnam is certainly special. Vietnam is the first ASEAN and Southeast Asian country I am visiting in my capacity as President of India. In fact, this is my first state visit to any nation to the east of India. Vietnam is always on our minds, and always in our hearts. It is pivotal to India’s “Act East” policy.


 


	The strength of engagement between two countries is represented by their bilateral calendar. Four years ago, my predecessor, President Pranab Mukherjee, came to Vietnam. Two years later, in 2016, our Prime Minister, Mr Narendra Modi, arrived for a landmark visit that upgraded our linkages to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The year 2018 has been even more intense. In January, I had the opportunity to welcome Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan to our Republic Day celebrations, at which he was Chief Guest, along with leaders of other ASEAN countries. In March, we were privileged to host the late President Tran Dai Quang. His sudden passing was a shock for all of us. He was a great patriot and an ardent advocate of India-Vietnam relations. I offer condolences on behalf of the Government and people of India, and on my own part as well. 


 


	I would take this opportunity to congratulate General Secretary and President Nguyen Phu Trong for the overwhelming confidence reposed in him by the Party and the National Assembly and for assuming the responsibility of President of Vietnam. I am confident that India-Vietnam relations will prosper with his support, guidance and leadership.


 


	India’s association with Vietnam has many aspects. We have robust business, political and people-to-people bonds. We exchange parliamentary visits, as members of this Assembly are no doubt familiar. We are both ancient maritime nations and are stakeholders in the commerce, security and stability of the Indo-Pacific Region.  Above all, we share the same values. Our founding fathers taught us to dream the same dreams – dreams for ourselves, dreams for each other, dreams for post-colonial nations everywhere, and dreams for the future and for our children.


 


	I would like to point out that 2019 is of great significance. In India, it marks the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and in Vietnam it is being commemorated as the 50th anniversary of the passing of the great Ho Chi Minh. These revolutionary figures inspired our respective countries to attain political freedom. They remain inspirations for not just Vietnam and India but for the entire Asian continent and the global community. The coming year once again links these two remarkable personalities, and unites our countries.


 


	The values of liberty, freedom and integrity that Gandhiji and President Ho Chi Minh espoused are rooted in our shared history – a history of scholarship and mutual learning, and of abiding Buddhist and Hindu spiritual connections. The enlightened path of the Buddha has brought our countries closer. Buddhism’s journey as a world religion began from India, and in Vietnam it acquired a unique identity, embedded in local culture. Buddhist monks and nuns travelled far and wide, carrying with them the cargo of compassion – and also showing the way to traders and businesspersons. Buddhism created an early form of globalisation and of connectedness across our ocean.


 


	Yesterday, in Da Nang, I saw glimpses of Vietnam’s rich heritage when I visited the Museum of Cham Culture and the My Son temple complex, where, I was happy to note, the Archaeological Survey of India is contributing to the restoration of your cultural marvels. Almost 2,000 years ago, the Cham kingdom symbolised one of history’s great civilisations. From Vietnam, it traded across the ocean – its ships carrying goods as far west as India and West Asia. It is believed that ancient Vietnam had flourishing maritime and trade links with southern India’s Pallava and Chola kingdoms.


 


	Those pioneering travellers and pilgrims promoted fraternal relations between cultures and countries – but within a framework of restraint and self-discipline, sustainability and accommodation. These are important lessons from Lord Buddha that are relevant for us even today


 

Members of the National Assembly,


	The historical values and lessons I referred to have also shaped India’s approach to socio-economic development. We believe in development that is people-centric, that adds value to rather than adds a burden to local communities; that respects and conserves nature and the environment and is not extractive; and that challenges and disincentivises corruption and related practices. In India we are deeply appreciative of the rapid progress made by Vietnam in recent years. Poverty levels here were at over 70 per cent in the 1990s but are below 10 per cent today. India too is on course to eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.


 


	Our economy and society are going through a massive change. Technology is transforming the way we live and work, and empowering local communities. Digital India and the humble mobile phone are bridging physical gaps – whether enhancing communication or providing virtual bank accounts to those in remote locations. A start-up ecosystem, one of the largest in the world, is leveraging technology and relatively frugal capital to promote entrepreneurship among young people, among self-driven men and women, and even among farmers looking for a wider market for their produce. Our space programme is launching satellites for several friendly countries as well as providing invaluable data on weather and soil patterns for those of our citizens engaged in agriculture. We are preparing to send an Indian into space. India will be happy to share its developmental experiences with Vietnam as per your country’s priorities.


 


	Such ideals shape India’s international cooperation. Take the challenge of climate change. It poses a danger to all humankind, but coastal nations such as India and Vietnam feel the pressure that much more. While many steps are needed, a push towards renewable energy is essential. It is with this in mind that India hosted the founding conference of the International Solar Alliance earlier this year. The ISA is an international body headquartered in India, but with implications for our entire planet. I invite Vietnam to become an active part of the ISA family. 


 


	Climate change is not the only question mark looming before the Indo-Pacific Region. This ocean system is a resource for Vietnam and India and for so many other countries and communities. Vietnam and India share a vision for the Indo-Pacific Region, of which the South China Sea is a critical component. We share a vision of a rules-based order that respects sovereignty and territorial integrity, ensures freedom of navigation and over-flight, as well as unimpeded commerce. Our shared vision seeks peaceful resolution of disputes, with full respect for legal and diplomatic processes in accordance with principles of international law, including those reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.


 


	In this context, India looks forward to enhanced bilateral cooperation in the maritime domain – for instance, through our first Bilateral Maritime Security Dialogue to be hosted by Vietnam in early 2019. Maritime security, piracy, and drug trafficking using the oceans are issues of common concern.  I am confident that the programme of regular and friendly visits to each other’s ports by naval and coast guard ships from our countries will upgrade cooperation. 


 


	Such confidence is only enhanced by the knowledge that Vietnam will be taking over the ASEAN Chair in 2020. India has consistently supported ASEAN’s unity and centrality and ASEAN-led mechanisms for regional security and economic architecture – to promote peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific Region. India offers a cooperation model that does not require its friends to make choices but rather expands choices and expands opportunities for all; that opens not one but many roads.


 


	Beyond our region, India and Vietnam remain committed to cooperation in areas of emerging risk such as cyber-security, and in multilateral organisations. Hard-won gains of international governance and of globalisation must be nurtured. The world community must respond collectively to worldwide challenges. India is thankful to Vietnam for its support in building consensus for an early adoption of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism at the United Nations.


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	At the root of India’s and Vietnam’s national endeavours are the aspirations and the prosperity of our people. Enhancing business relations and physical connectivity between our countries is vital for this. We are both dynamic economies. Vietnam has had an impressive, export-driven growth, and India is today the world’s fastest growing large economy. Bilateral trade touched US$ 12.8 billion in the past year and India is one of Vietnam’s top 10 trading partners. For India too Vietnam and ASEAN are crucial to its trade basket. A high-level business delegation is accompanying me, and yesterday I addressed the Vietnam-India Business Forum. I am certain that enterprising businesspersons from our countries will help us reach new trade benchmarks.


 


	There is scope for cooperation and complementarities in textiles and agriculture and agricultural technologies, in biotech and IT, in energy and pharmaceuticals, and in infrastructure and minerals. Indian investors, Indian manufacturers and Indian services providers look to Vietnam with much excitement.


 


	And so do, I must say, the rest of the people of India. Back home, Vietnamese food is becoming more and more popular – and a society of tea drinkers has acquired a taste for Vietnamese coffee. I am keen that tourism between Vietnam and India expands and direct flights in the period ahead help more and more of our citizens to visit each other’s countries. In the ultimate analysis, the people-to-people network between Vietnam and India – an inheritor of one of the oldest people-to-people networks in Asia and the Indo-Pacific – is the foundation and the edifice of our partnership.


 


	With those words, and with a renewed thank you to Madam Chairperson and the members of this Assembly for having hosted me, I conclude my address. May the wisdom of Lord Buddha and may his message of embracing compassion and cooperation continue to guide our people, our countries and our shared oceanic region.


Thank you!

	This is my first visit to South-East Asia and to the ASEAN region as the President of India. I also come 60 years after the 11-day historic State Visit of President   Ho Chi Minh to India in 1958. 
	I am glad that my first visit in the ASEAN region has been to Vietnam, a strategic pillar of India’s Act East Policy, and our key interlocutor in ASEAN.
	As Comprehensive Strategic Partners, India and Vietnam have a strong bilateral relationship based on mutual trust, understanding, convergence of views on regional and international issues and strong cooperation in regional and multilateral fora. 
	I began my official engagement in this historic city with my address to the National Assembly. I am truly and deeply honoured by this special gesture shown to me, my people and my country. 
	My talks with President Phu Trong were extensive and productive. Our discussions covered the full range of bilateral and multilateral cooperation. We reiterated the importance of building a peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region on the basis of respect for national sovereignty and international law. 
	We have agreed to further strengthen our bilateral cooperation in defence, peaceful uses of atomic energy and outer space, science and technology, oil and gas, infrastructure development, agriculture and innovation-based sectors.  We have signed three MOUs, namely in the fields of communications, education and trade and investment to take our bilateral agenda forward.   
	We committed to further deepen our defence and security cooperation. I reiterated India’s commitment to provide training support for Vietnam Armed Forces. We also reviewed the implementation of the Line of Credit of US$ 100 million for building high-speed patrol vessels for Vietnamese Border Guards. 
	We condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestation and agreed to strengthen global fight against this menace. We expressed satisfaction that the two countries would soon begin dialogue on strengthening maritime security cooperation.  
	We agreed to encourage our industry to tap into the growing economic opportunities in our own countries and in the region. India-Vietnam economic relations are on an upswing. Our bilateral trade last year stood at US$ 12.8 billion. I am confident that our efforts in facilitating our business interactions, such as the Vietnam-India Business Forum that I attended yesterday in Hanoi, will enable us to achieve our bilateral trade target of US$ 15 billion by 2020.  
	 Our cultural similarities are a strong binding element of our friendship. As a tribute to our shared heritage, I began my State Visit from Da Nang, where I visited the Cham temples. It is a matter of great pride for us that the Archaeological Survey of India is undertaking the restoration of three temple groups at the UNESCO World Heritage Site of My Son.   
	India and Vietnam have been linked together over the centuries through trade and the message of compassion and kindness of Lord Buddha. 
	The affection shown by the friendly Vietnamese people has touched my heart. I will always cherish my visit to your beautiful country.  


 

Thank you!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed the National Assembly of Vietnam today (November 20, 2018) in Hanoi, on the final day of his visit to Vietnam. He also held bilateral meetings with the President of Vietnam as well as led delegation-level talks. On the occasion, the two countries signed and exchanged four agreements:


	An agreement between the Ministry of Information and Communications of Vietnam and the Ministry of Communications of India
	An agreement of cooperation between the Department of Foreign Affairs of Provinces, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vietnam, and the Indian Business Chamber in Vietnam
	An academic agreement between the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics, Hanoi, and the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi
	An agreement between the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry


Addressing members of the National Assembly this morning, President Kovind noted that Vietnam is the first ASEAN and Southeast Asian country he is visiting in his capacity as President of India. Vietnam is always on our minds, he said, and always in our hearts. It is pivotal to India’s “Act East” policy. The President emphasised that India’s association with Vietnam has many aspects. We have robust business, political and people-to-people bonds. We are both stakeholders in the commerce, security and stability of the Indo-Pacific Region.

The President said that India offers a cooperation model that does not require its friends to make choices but rather expands choices and expands opportunities for all; that opens not one but many roads. India has consistently supported ASEAN’s unity and centrality and ASEAN-led mechanisms for regional security and economic architecture – to promote peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific Region.

 

The President said that the ocean system is a resource for Vietnam and India and for many other countries and communities. Vietnam and India share a vision for the Indo-Pacific Region, of which the South China Sea is a critical component. We share a vision of a rules-based order that respects sovereignty and territorial integrity, ensures freedom of navigation and over-flight, as well as unimpeded, lawful commerce.

 

The President said that India looks forward to enhanced bilateral cooperation in the maritime domain – for instance, through our first Bilateral Maritime Security Dialogue to be hosted by Vietnam in early 2019. Maritime security, piracy, and drug trafficking using the oceans are issues of common concern. “I am confident,” President Kovind said, “that the programme of regular and friendly visits to each other’s ports by naval and coast guard ships from our countries will upgrade cooperation.”

 

In a separate engagement this morning, the President paid his respects at the monument of National Heroes and Martyrs as well as at the Mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh.  Later, he visited the Presidential Palace, where he was received by President Nguyen Phu Trong and accorded a ceremonial welcome.

 

During the subsequent discussions with President Nguyen Phu Trong, the President thanked him for his gracious hospitality. The President said that he had a memorable visit to Da Nang yesterday. The Cham temples are a fascinating aspect of our shared heritage. Subsequently, the President led the Indian side in delegation-level talks. He said Indian investors are keen to strengthen their presence in Vietnam. India seeks Vietnam’s support in facilitating Indian investments in sectors like renewable energy, infrastructure, agriculture, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and oil and gas. India also looks forward to cooperation with Vietnam in improving agricultural productivity. 

 

The President issued a media statement on his visit to Vietnam. 

 

Later this afternoon, the President will have a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Mr Nguyen Xuan Phuc. This will be followed soon after by a banquet hosted in honour of the President of India by the President of Vietnam, Mr Nguyen Phu Trong.  Thereafter, President Kovind will emplane for Sydney, Australia – on the final leg of his two-nation visit to Vietnam and Australia.

	I am delighted to meet you. I am honoured to be paying a State Visit to Vietnam. I thank you for your warm and affectionate welcome. I wish to convey my deep appreciation and respect for the monks and nuns of the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha who have welcomed me with their traditional drum ceremony. 
	India-Vietnam friendship is civilizational. Our relations have been exceptionally warm and cordial. Our people have stood by each other during most difficult times. Our founding fathers - Mahatma Gandhi and President Ho Chi Minh have guided us on a shared path. I have come here to deepen those enduring ties. I look forward to my official engagements with President Phu Trong tomorrow.  I will also have the honour to address the Vietnamese National Assembly. I am thankful to the government of Vietnam for according me this very special gesture.  
	The Buddhist Sangha is an important institution promoting friendship between our two countries. Through them we have nurtured our ties with compassion, kindness and blessings of Lord Buddha. The Buddhist monks were as active in promoting our relations in ancient times as they are today. Monks and merchants brought Indian culture, philosophy and religion to the shores of Vietnam. Buddhism, Hinduism, Brahmi script and Sanskrit language soon, thereafter, took roots in this country. I had the privilege to visit the world famous Cham temples yesterday and to see the deep imprint of these exchanges on this ancient land and its proud people. As a tribute to our age-old   ties, I planted a banyan tree there, a symbol of our shared spiritual journey. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	As a friend and partner, we take immense pride in Vietnam’s spectacular achievements. Over the years, this country has made huge socio-economic advances. Sustained high levels of economic growth, combined with vision and foresight of its leadership, has seen rapid progress and prosperity. Per capita GDP in this country has gone up from less than US$ 100 in 1990 to over US$ 2500 today making a huge difference in the lives of ordinary citizens. Agricultural growth has been a key driver of this remarkable feat. As a development partner, we feel privileged to have contributed to Vietnam’s agricultural revolution and food security.  Today, Vietnam is a star among the emerging markets and is highly integrated with the global economy. Like India, it is a young demography, and like us, making every effort to meet the aspirations of its young people.


Ladies and Gentlemen,


	India and Vietnam have been together in a cultural journey for ages. And now both of us are on a similar transformational    economic path.  India is today the fastest growing major economy in the world, with a growth rate of 8.2% last quarter. Our knowledge and innovation driven industry has made a mark for itself the world over.  We are making steady progress towards becoming a 5 trillion economy and the 3rd largest consumer market in the world by 2025. Vietnam’s rise and growth is equally impressive.
	We have undertaken path breaking economic reforms including the introduction of Goods and Services Tax that has realized our long-held dream of making India into “One Nation, One Tax, One Market”.  Our policy measures have seen us jump 65 places in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business in the last four years. And while we are pursuing economic growth, we are also equally conscious of our social equity goals. Women empowerment has been at the centre of all our socio-economic programmes, be it MUDRA - our micro-credit lending scheme or Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao that is Save Girl Child - Educate Girl Child Scheme.  
	During the visit of our Prime Minister to Vietnam in September 2016, we had decided to elevate our bilateral ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Cooperation in defence industry, hydrocarbons, energy, agriculture, pharmaceuticals and healthcare were identified to enhance collaboration. Our intent has translated into concrete results. I am happy to learn that today, India is one of Vietnam’s top trading partners and we have seen a major jump in our bilateral trade and investment relations. 


Ladies and gentlemen, 


	The Indian community in Vietnam is small in number. But it plays an important part in promoting bilateral ties and creating opportunities for the local economy and society. The Indian community in Vietnam has many accomplishments to itself. Through hard work and dedication, you have earned a name for yourself and pride for us. Our IT professionals and technology entrepreneurs are helping build digital pathways in this country. Our ancient links and modern ties with this country place very high expectations on you from your Vietnamese friends.  But I must say, you have most respectfully lived up to those - bringing the best of India to Vietnam be it art, culture or our familial ethos.  I am told Yoga is immensely popular in Vietnam and is a strong binding element between our two societies. Our common sensibilities have also made Indian television serials and films have a wider and appreciative audience here. 
	India is on a transformative journey. In our quest for peace, prosperity and development, Indian citizens abroad and the overseas Indian community serve us as equal partners.  There are new opportunities and possibilities opening up for you to connect, collaborate and grow with India. I encourage you to join us in this journey, as knowledge partners, as investors and as cultural ambassadors. 


Ladies and gentlemen, 


	Our Government has made it a priority to reach out to our overseas community.  There is new and vibrant connect between us and our Diaspora today. To serve them better, we have strengthened our Embassies to provide round the clock service, so that no one in need is left unattended. We are utilizing social media platforms and digital programmes such as MADAD to deliver efficient public services. We have reached out to those in dire need, from Yemen to Venezuela, caught in violence, crisis or natural disasters.  And not just to Indians alone, but to people of over 50 other countries. 
	Next year, we are celebrating the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas in Varanasi from 21st to 23rd January.  I invite you to join us in this special festivity of our Diaspora. We have begun the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi this year. I do hope you will come forward and help us illuminate his life and legacy in this country. 
	I also invite you to visit Rashtrapati Bhavan whenever you are in India. It may be my official residence but it is a place of pride for all Indians, and as such belongs to me as much to you. 


Ladies and gentlemen, 


	I convey my appreciation for the efforts of the Vietnam-India Friendship Association, the Vietnam Union of Friendship Association and the India Studies Department of Universities here in promoting a greater understanding of India in this country. I also thank the Indian Business Chamber in Vietnam for playing an active role in engaging the Indian community.  More importantly, I thank our Vietnamese friends for extending a welcome hand to all Indians living in this country.


Ladies and gentlemen, 


	India and Vietnam share similar opportunities and challenges. We must come together with pride and purpose and help each other grow and prosper. Let the age-old thought and wisdom of the Mekong and the Ganga guide us on this path.   


 

Thank you.

	I am delighted to address the Vietnam-India Business Forum.   I am honoured to be paying a State Visit to Vietnam, a country with which we have historic and special ties. I thank the Government of Vietnam for their warmth and excellent hospitality. 
	 I extend my warm wishes to the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Indian business chambers – the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry - who have worked hard, and worked together as a team, to organize this event.  I am happy that you have had a fruitful day of discussions on how to take forward our trade, technology and investment relations.


Ladies and Gentlemen,


	India and Vietnam are old civilizations. We have ancient cultural and spiritual connections. But the story of our engagement is much broader. Traders and merchants from India brought goods and commodities to the shores of Vietnam long before the arrival of cultural thought and expression. There was a flourishing maritime connect in the days gone by. And, to our desire, trade continues to be a driving force in our contemporary partnership.  In the last 8 years, we have seen almost four fold increase in bilateral trade, from US$ 3.7 billion in 2010 to US$ 12.8 last year.  With both Vietnam and India on a strong growth path, we can expect this trend to continue apace.  
	Vietnam and India are not just special friends; we also have a similar economic vision and approach. Vietnam has seen spectacular economic growth in the last two decades. This has allowed reduction of the poverty rate from over 70% in the 1990s to less than 10% now. The increase in per capita GDP of Vietnam from less than US$ 100 in 1990 to over US$ 2500 today is a remarkable achievement with very few parallels in the developing world. I congratulate the people and government of Vietnam on this stupendous success. 
	Like Vietnam, India too has been focused on reforming its economy, increasing its growth rate, and realizing the full potential of its young citizens. In April-July quarter of this year, the GDP growth of Indian economy was 8.2%, highest among the large economies. By 2025, India’s GDP is expected to double to US$ 5 trillion from the current US$ 2.5 trillion. With country wide sweep of digital connectivity, transformative economic reforms, favorable demographics and a vibrant start-up ecosystem, India is also expected to be the third largest consumer market by 2025. We have started work to build next-generation infrastructure including 100 Smart cities, 7 high-speed train corridors and nationwide broadband connectivity.  Last year alone, we built 10,000 kilometers of national highways – that is an average of 27 kilometers daily!
	Transformative reforms such as the introduction of Goods and Services Tax has made India, a country of 1.3 billion people, into One Nation, One Tax, One Market for the first time in her history. On the success of this and other reforms, India has jumped 65 places- from 142 in 2014 to 77 in 2018 - in the World Bank Doing Ease of Business Index.  Our macro-economic indicators are robust: inflation well under control at 3.3%; foreign exchange reserves at a healthy US$ 400 billion and our Foreign Direct Investment flows at over US$ 200 billion in the last 4 years. 
	We have also been conscious to combine growth with equity. Our financial inclusion programme Jan Dhan Yojana has seen 330 million bank accounts opened for the poor and needy. Our micro-credit scheme MUDRA has disbursed 128 million loans worth US$ 90 billion, 74% of these beneficiaries being women! These initiatives have unleashed a new energy for the growth of microenterprises, entrepreneurship and selfe-mployment.    


Ladies and gentlemen, 


	Vietnam and India business partnership speaks for itself. With matching growth and lucrative business prospects on both sides, there is little convincing to be done. All of you are sitting in the middle of manifold possibilities. Indian growth presents opportunities for two-way engagement in financial services, IT, digital economy, hydrocarbons, defence, renewable energy, mining, healthcare, tourism and civil aviation sectors.  We want Vietnam to collaborate with us in our flagship programmes - Make In India, Clean India, Start-up India and Digital India. We are also keen to learn from it in the tourism and urban infrastructure sectors. 
	On the trade front, we are doing well. We are on track to achieve our target of US$ 15 billion bilateral trade by the year 2020. Vietnam is a very important trading partner of India in ASEAN and India is now among the top 10 trading partners of Vietnam. 
	Agriculture has been a key sector of our cooperation involving trade, investment and training. We feel privileged to have supported the Vietnamese agricultural revolution through the establishment of Cuu Long Rice Research Institute. Vietnam is a huge agricultural economy with agro-marine-forestry exports surpassing US$ 35 billion last year.   Agricultural products already occupy over 45% of our bilateral trade. Agro-processing, agro-chemicals, farm machinery, biotechnology and high-tech farming hold immense potential for bilateral cooperation. Indian industry can also learn from Vietnam’s success in crops such as coffee, pepper, cashew, fruits and vegetables. 
	The Indian pharmaceuticals industry, globally speaking, is the third largest in terms of volume and the world’s largest provider of generic drugs. They can partner Vietnam in providing quality healthcare, medicines and medical devices for the public health system at an affordable cost. Indian pharmaceutical companies are also looking at domestic production opportunities in Vietnam. There are huge prospects for promoting medical and wellness tourism both ways as well. 
	Both India and Vietnam are leading players in the textile industry.  We must cooperate further to facilitate integration of value chains. Likewise, there are significant opportunities in the oil and gas, power, infrastructure and renewable energy sectors.  In India, we have set a target to reach solar and wind energy generation capacity of 175 Gigawatt by 2022. With their global and cutting edge-expertise and experience, Indian renewable majors are ready to partner Vietnam. 
	Indian IT services including digital economy and fin-tech sector have much to offer to Vietnamese growth.  We must encourage our start-up sectors and innovation based industry to leverage each other.  The Indian start-up ecosystem ranks third globally. This year has been particularly successful for us, with over 1200 tech-startups taking wings. We must also learn from each other on how to improve productivity; how to approach the Fourth Industrial Revolution; how to promote innovation and entrepreneurship; and not the least, how to leverage technology for governance.


Ladies and gentlemen, 


	Vietnam-India economic relations are on a steady path. We have made significant achievement no doubt, but a lot more is waiting to happen. The energy and enthusiasm in this room, in this city and in this country are an indication of the opportunities before us. I invite Indian and Vietnamese businesses to partner in each other for trade, technology and investment collaboration. I once again thank the Government of Vietnam and all Industry stakeholders for making today’s business forum a success.


Thank you.

He appreciated the efforts of the Vietnam-India Friendship Association, the Vietnam Union of Friendship Association and the India Studies Departments of Vietnamese universities in working towards a greater understanding of India.

                The President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, graced and addressed the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the partnership between the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India and the Wellcome Trust today (November 12, 2018) in New Delhi. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President that as the partnership between the Department of Biotechnology and the Wellcome Trust completes its first decade, this is an opportune moment for the India Alliance to draft its priorities for the next phase. Today, through science and technology, humans wield unimaginable power over the future of our planet. We therefore have a responsibility like never before. And scientists, particularly bio-scientists, are our soldiers and generals in the battle to safeguard our planet, our species and our future.

The President suggested four frontlines in this battle. He said that the first is the environment. Our air, water and soil must be cleaned. While we do so, we must mitigate the consequences on human and livestock health. The second frontline is that of lifestyle diseases. Diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases are on the rise. In the quarter-century since 1990, the number of Indians living with diabetes grew from 26 million to 65 million. In the same period, the incidence of all cancers increased by almost 30 per cent. The third frontline is infectious disease. While we take on known infectious diseases, lesser-known ones threaten to expand. Disease, like science, knows no boundaries. Pandemic influenza viruses don’t need passports and visas to spread. On the other hand, the shrinking of animal habitats is creating room for zoonotic diseases and diseases that jump species. The final frontline is diseases of the brain. Factors that include urban stress and a significant elderly population have left India facing a mental health epidemic. Preventive measures, relevant to our genetics and our lifestyle, are in the realm of theory, waiting to be discovered. We must discover these if our people are to age well, with full mental capacities.

The President urged defining the future of the India Alliance on these four frontlines. He said that we are at the edge of an era of great hope as well as of great uncertainty. Personalised and precision medicine; genomic medicine; lab-generated organs; rationalising data privacy with data use for clinical research and the larger public good – issues such as these offer scope for our well-being but could also pose bioethical dilemmas as well as legal questions. Separately, but perhaps relatedly, there is the subject of regulation and policy framing. In India, in various fields, we have sometimes found a gap between those who are practitioners and those who are regulators. As the biosciences grow and evolve, more practitioners should come into regulatory roles as well.

	I am happy to be here for the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the partnership between the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Wellcome Trust. This partnership, the India Alliance as it is known, was set up in 2008 as the first co-funded association of a government science organisation and an international charity. Phase I of the Alliance has focused on biomedical research that covers basic, clinical and public health science.


 


	As we have just been told, the Alliance has lived up to the vision of those who gave it shape. In the past 10 years, it has awarded 320 fellowships to researchers in 93 institutions across 34Indian cities. It has laid special emphasis on younger researchers, at the start of their careers, when support is most crucial. The Alliance, I am glad to learn, has designed flexible support programmes for women researchers who are coming back to the lab after a break for family or maternity reasons.


 


	This attempt to widen the social, regional and gender diversity of science in our country is deserving of praise. Much of our scientific talent is lost because enough opportunities are not available in smaller centres, outside big cities – or because our system cannot sufficiently accommodate deserving women candidates who are striving to balance a rewarding career with domestic demands. As I have said on earlier occasions, this is a situation that urgently needs to be addressed– whether in academic institutions, R&D facilities, industry or government.


 


	Life sciences today offer a frontier that is still largely unexplored. It is worth noting that while textbooks of the foundations of physics change little from year to year, textbooks of biology and medicine are a work in progress even at fundamental levels. The sciences of genetics, of evolution and of human development have yielded enormous knowledge in recent years, but we are only at the beginnings of a new age of exploration. 


 


	It is sobering to remember that the human genome was sequenced only about 15 years ago. In relative terms, the collaboration of Information Technology and Big Data with the biological sciences is still in its infancy. There is so much that lies ahead. If I could use a historical analogy, we have built the steam engine but the bio-scientific equivalent of the Industrial Revolution lies before us. Partnerships such as the one between DBT and the Wellcome Trust will power this new revolution. And I am confident you will have the full support of the Indian scientific community, ably led by the Principal Scientific Adviser, Dr K. VijayRaghavan.


 


	As it completes its first decade, this is an opportune moment for the India Alliance to draft its priorities for the next phase – to look ahead with even greater courage and go forth even more boldly. Just as the Alliance was started by not doing simply more of the same, you must now open a new path. What could that new path be? Today, through science and technology, humans wield unimaginable power over the future of our planet. We therefore have a responsibility like never before. And scientists, particularly bio-scientists, are our soldiers and generals in the battle to safeguard our planet, our species and our future. 


 


	To my mind, there are four frontlines in this battle. The first is the environment. Our air, water and soil must be cleaned. While we do so, we must mitigate the consequences on human and livestock health. An enhanced thrust on studying human and animal health in real environments and finding solutions to problems such as asthma, respiratory disorders and cancers is needed.


 


	The second frontline is that of lifestyle diseases. Diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases are on the rise. In the quarter-century since 1990, the number of Indians living with diabetes grew from 26 million to 65 million. In the same period, the incidence of all cancers increased by almost 30 per cent. Diet and lifestyle are key factors, as also maternal, foetal and neonatal health. Both prevention and treatment are vital. 


 


	The third frontline is infectious disease. While we take on known infectious diseases, lesser-known ones threaten to expand. Here too we must study the disease in the context of its environment and all its hosts. For example, how does Nipah virus reside in bats? How may its infection spread? How do we test candidate vaccines for humans? These are global challenges. Your Alliance must address these issues and partner globally. Disease, like science, knows no boundaries. Pandemic influenza virusesdon’t need passports and visas to spread. On the other hand, the shrinking of animal habitats is creating room for zoonotic diseases and diseases that jump species.


 


	The final frontline is diseases of the brain. Factors that include urban stress and a significant elderly population have left India facing a mental health epidemic. Preventive measures, relevant to our genetics and our lifestyle, are in the realm of theory, waiting to be discovered. We must discover these if our people are to age well, with full mental capacities. If this is not researched by us in our population, ailments such as dementiawill be a major problem – and solutions from elsewhere will not fit here.


 


	Let these four frontlines define the future of the India Alliance.To win this battle, it is critical to democratise the adventure of biotechnology in India, and to research and find answers to pressing and neglected diseases that have long troubled our people and our country. I am certain that our extremely capable Minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan, a medical doctor himself, will help take forward this process.


 

Ladies and Gentlemen

 


	We are at the edge of an era of great hope as well as of great uncertainty. Personalised and precision medicine; genomic medicine; lab-generated organs; rationalising data privacy with data use for clinical research and the larger public good – issues such as these offer scope for our well-being but could also pose bioethical dilemmas as well as legal questions.


 


	Separately, but perhaps relatedly, there is the subject of regulation and policy framing. In India, in various fields, we have sometimes found a gap between those who are practitioners and those who are regulators. As the biosciences grow and evolve, I would like more practitionersto come into regulatory roles as well. This too is an objective for all of us to consider and to work towards. Of course this objective would only be a subpart of the greater objective of ensuring a healthy life for every Indian and indeed every citizen of our shared planet.


 


	With those words, I once again congratulate DBT and the Wellcome Trust for completing 10 years of the India Alliance. May the Alliance continue to thrive and prosper in the years ahead!


 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                It gives me immense pleasure to welcome all of you to Rashtrapati Bhavan. I am sure that the 58th Course of the NDC has been both fruitful and enriching for all of you. It is a unique Course indeed as it brings together officers from our Armed Forces and Civil Services. I am certain that you would have learnt as much from each other as from your faculty. I also note that there are 25 participating officers from 22 partner countries as well. I hope that you got ample opportunity to gain from your course as well as from your experience of India. I also welcome the spouses of all participants, faculty members and staff officers who are present here today. 

The global environment in which we live is challenging and dynamic. There was a time when security and defence were synonymous with the need to maintain a nation’s territorial integrity. That is no longer the case today.

Today, the idea of security incorporates economic and energy security, as well as concerns about cyber-security, health, food, emerging technologies and the environment. In an increasingly connected world, political, social and economic upheavals beyond our national borders impact our security more strongly than ever before.

A country’s ability to successfully master and negotiate the concerns in each of the above areas defines its national power. No doubt, each of these areas requires specialisation and analysis. However, they are also interlinked, calling for an integrated approach from those responsible for our security, as well as a process of constant learning and knowledge updating.

It is quite a complex task to bring different disciplines together to work in an integrated manner. In a democratic system like India’s, this requires different agencies and departments of the state – or frankly even the private sector – to work in coordination. And to understand the strengths and limits of each other’s functioning.

This means that the political executive and officers of the civil services must be conversant with the capabilities and thinking of the defence forces. Similarly, military officers need to be sensitised to the constitutional and administrative framework within which the executive operates. All of these are elements in the creation of a national security approach.

The success of any nation state in this regard depends on how effective it is in developing its concerned human resources. It is in this context that the NDC course is so important. All of you – civil and military officers – come together for a period of almost 11 months. This, I am sure, provides you ample opportunities to share your specialised expertise and related perspectives with your Coursemates. The Course must have enriched your understanding of each other’s strengths and constraints and the possible opportunities for collaboration. Ultimately, these 11 months are an investment for building a corpus of uniquely skilled set of officers who can understand, design and implement a holistic security approach. This course meets not just the individual country needs – but paves the way for an enlightened understanding of our shared security concerns.

I am told that six components or studies comprise the curriculum of the NDC course. The Socio-Political Study helps in comprehending the main features of Indian society and polity. The Economy Security Study introduces you to principles and practices that shape economic trends and their impact on comprehensive security.

 

The next three studies are on:


	International Security Environment
	Global Issues, including technology and the environment
	India’s Strategic Neighbourhood 


 

All of these focus on factors that shape the international security environment – and affect India’s foreign policy.  

The final study is on Strategies and Structures for National Security. It is the synthesis of everything you have learnt and experienced during the year. 

I am confident that this course and this exposure would have left you better informed and enhanced your abilities to contribute to your country’s security perspectives.

India and its neighbourhood – and the broader Asian continent – is faced with multiple security threats and risks that have assumed global significance. Terrorism and violent extremism are common challenges that are both state-based and asymmetrical. Also, as Asia emerges as the hotspot and the growth centre of the global economic order, security concerns will increasingly focus on securing our economic interests and growth objectives. Threats will come in all domains – from the maritime space to cyberspace. We have to be prepared.

We need to develop a ‘Strategic Culture’ with respect to security both in India and your respective countries. As graduates and alumni of the NDC, you are now part of the same family. And along with the faculty members of the NDC, I am sure you will contribute to strengthening our understanding of the multidimensional approach to security in the years to come.

I wish the NDC and all the participants in this course the very best. To our international participants, I hope this has also been a time to discover India and to make friends. Wherever you go, you will carry a bit of India with you.

 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the first convocation of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh, in Uttarakhand today (November 3, 2018).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that in India, AIIMS is a symbol of excellence in the field of medical care and research. Establishment of an AIIMS in hitherto underserved areas makes quality medical facilities accessible and affordable. It also reduces pressure on hospitals in metros.

The President said AIIMS Rishikesh should envisage itself as an effective research centre, apart from providing good health services. He expressed hope that AIIMS Rishikesh will develop many super-specialty faculties so that people from other areas too come here for treatment. He urged doctors to research health-related issues specific to the Uttarakhand region.

Earlier in the day, the President inaugurated Gyan Kumbh – a national conference on quality enhancement in higher education - in Haridwar. The conference is being organised by the government of Uttarakhand and the University of Patanjali, Haridwar.

Addressing the gathering, the President said that as per constitutional provisions, responsibility for higher education lies with both Union and state governments. This conference is an example of coordination among various stakeholders. He expressed hope that outcomes of the conference will enhance opportunities for higher education not only in Uttarakhand but in the entire country.

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for putting in place a National Suicide Prevention Strategy to curb the tendency of youngsters and others to end their lives due to depression and frustration. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the 19th Annual Conference of Indian Association of Private Psychiatry (IAPP), in Hyderabad today.

 

Expressing concern over the prevalence of suicides in the country, the Vice President said that he was disturbed by news reports of suicide by youngsters, farmers and women. He called for a national campaign and added that there was a need for collective efforts from all stakeholders including the immediate family members, public health planners, policymakers and NGOs to prevent suicides. Timely counseling and family support can prevent people suffering from depression from taking any extreme step, he added.

 

The Vice President said that Yoga, meditation and spiritualism will provide mental equilibrium and solace at times of depression. Modern day fast paced lifestyle and stress were also leading to depression among youngsters, he said. There is every need to strengthen our age old family system, which can provide support for people suffering from dispersion, he added.

 

The Vice President said that modern medicines and proper treatment would enable people suffering from psychiatric disorders to lead normal productive lives even if they had faced the problem for a long-term. He said that it was unfortunate they often faced ill-treatment and discrimination, sometimes at the hands of close relatives and family members.

 

Shri Naidu said that nobody has any right to ill-treat patients with mental illness adding that such kind of behavior would further aggravate the severity of illness.

 

The Vice President said that both the developing and the developed nations were beset with different types of health issues, mental illness was one of the leading non-communicable diseases ailing the world and has become a major public health problem. According to WHO, depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease, he said. Globally, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression, he added.

 

The Vice President said that more women were affected by depression than men. He further said that at least 13.7 per cent of India's general population has been projected to be suffering from a variety of mental illnesses and 10.6 per cent of this requires immediate intervention. In all, nearly 150 million Indians are in a need of active medical intervention, according to the National Mental Health Survey 2015-2016 submitted by NIMHANS to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, he added.

 

Pointing out India that was placed in a uniquely advantageous position because 65 per cent of the population is below the age of 35 years, the Vice President stressed the need to hugely step up our efforts to help youth who are prone to bouts of depression to get rid of the problem. Apart from strengthening public health care system, he called for including Psychiatric disorders in Medical Insurance.

 

The President of IAPP, Dr. M.S. Reddy, the Vice President of IAPP, Dr. G. Prasada Rao, the Secretary General of IAPP, Dr. Pramod Kumar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""Health is pivotal in growth and development of a society. A healthy and productive society is important for economic progress of a nation. WHO defines health as “state of complete physical, mental, and social well being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” 

Although, the developing and the developed nations are beset with different types of health issues, mental illness is one of the leading non-communicable diseases ailing the world and has become a major public health problem.

Mental disorders contribute to a significant load of morbidity and disability. As per Global Burden of Disease report 2015, mental disorders account for 13 per cent of total DALY (disability adjusted life years) and loss for years lived with disability (YLD). Among these Depression is the leading cause.

According to WHO, depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. Globally, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression.

More women are affected by depression than men. At least 13.7 per cent of India's general population has been projected to be suffering from a variety of mental illnesses and 10.6 per cent of this requires immediate intervention. In all, nearly 150 million Indians are in a need of active medical intervention, according to the National Mental Health Survey 2015-2016 submitted by NIMHANS to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Suicide

Dear sisters and brothers,

Another major area of concern is the prevalence of suicide. Time and again, we read news reports of suicide by youngsters, farmers and women. It is a very disturbing trend and collective efforts are needed from all stakeholders— the immediate family members, public health planners, policymakers and NGOs to prevent suicides. I feel that there is a need to launch a national campaign and a national suicide prevention strategy. Timely counseling and family support can prevent people suffering from depression from taking any extreme step. Experts in the field feel that one of the reasons for the suicides is the lack of appropriate healthcare services to identify and manage people at risk.

India is placed in a uniquely advantageous position because 65 per cent of the population is below the age of 35 years. Yet, it is just this group (especially people aged 15-29 years) who are at the highest risk of suicidal death. This is a major public health concern and we need to need to hugely step up our efforts to help youth who are prone to bouts of depression to get rid of the problem.

Stigma and Awareness

One of the major challenges is the social stigma associated with mental illness. It is unfortunate that people suffering from mental illness often face ill-treatment and discrimination, sometimes at the hands of close relatives and family members. This is simply unacceptable even it is due to lack of understanding or misunderstanding. Nobody has any right to ill-treat patients with mental illness and such kind of behavior will further  aggravate the severity of illness. 

I would like bodies like yours to take up countrywide campaigns in creating awareness among people on this aspect. It is all more necessary in the present times because modern medicines and proper treatment will enable people suffering from psychiatric disorders to lead normal productive lives even if they had faced the problem for a long-term.

I am told that more than 50 per cent with schizophrenia can be free of relapse at the end of one year’s treatment with antipsychotic drugs and family intervention. Similarly, up to 90 per cent of those suffering from depression can recover with a proper combination of antidepressant drugs and psychotherapy. There has to be greater awareness on both social stigma and affordable treatment.

Distribution of mental healthcare service

Another major handicap we are facing in providing effective mental healthcare is the lack of adequate number of psychiatrists, psychologists and trained nurses in the field. This shortage has to be filled on a war footing for providing quality treatment to patients.

Mental Healthcare Act, 2017

While the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 is a patient-friendly act and aims to protect the rights of people with mental illnesses, it also takes into account the caregivers’ concerns and encourages their involvement.

Economic burden on care givers

Mental health still continues to get less attention from governments in allocating budgets and there is a need for the policy makers to rectify this situation. Most developed nations spend above 4% of their budgets on mental health care and research, according to a 2011 World Health Organization report.

Major psychiatric disorders have a chronic course and require prolonged treatment. While the direct costs relate to consultation fees, medication, therapy costs, travelling costs and the loss of pay from work for both caregivers and patients, the indirect cost is the time involved in the care giving for patients. 

In many low and middle income countries (LAMIC), costs for formal mental health services are paid by the patients or their care givers’ out of the pocket, this mode of approach will limit the utilization of mental health services according to the ability to pay and resulting in inequitable access to mental health care. Continued high out-of-pocket expenses for mental health treatment may impede access to the treatment especially for those who need greater treatment. 

The best solution for this problem would be to strengthen public health care system, but till then medical insurance which incorporates mental health is beneficial. Medical Insurance to cover all Psychiatric disorders is the need of the hour.

Policy and legislation

Dear sisters and brothers, 

India has many advantages compared to other countries. We have cheaper medication and a well distributed public health system across the country. Gaps in the public health system can be potentially addressed through tele-psychiatry (tele-medicine) as done by SCARF foundation in Tamil Nadu. Tele-psychiatry can be tried in other places, especially rural areas with broadband and mobile phones connectivity. Video consultation can be just a ring away! Less human resource usage and availability of quality care can be beneficially utilized.

Medical tourism 

India has certain advantages for tapping the potential of medical tourism in this area. With the availability of quality treatment, cheaper medication and lesser costs, there is indeed scope for providing proper mental healthcare services to patients from other countries.

Providing employment opportunities for the mentally disabled, who do all the tasks properly after treatment, is another area where policy and planning can make a major impact. With the advent of modern medical treatment of psychiatric conditions, many people have the possibility of becoming financially independent and such people should have provision for employment.

I am sure that all the experts gathered here would deliberate upon the whole gamut of issues relating to mental healthcare and come out with recommendations for improving the services.

Thank You

JAI HIND!""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu called upon innovators to use technology for bringing about a transformation and positive change in the lives of people. He was addressing the INK 2018 Conference, in Hyderabad today.

The Vice President said that the quest for excellence, for a better tomorrow, for a happy, harmonious world has been the driving force behind human progress over the centuries

The Vice President said that technology and knowledge have to be used to make people’s lives prosperous, harmonious and comfortable.

Shri Naidu said that Science, Research and Technology should aim to make “tomorrow better than today” and bring in fine balance between the technical capabilities and the wellbeing of our planet. He urged the young innovators and tech geniuses to play the role of catalysts in harnessing the power of technology to transform human lives. 

Observing that government of India has been focusing on fostering a culture of innovation under Atal Innovation Mission, the Vice President said that leading global companies and other organizations are partnering with the government to take forward this mission for creation of an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship.

The Vice President said that the India with its knowledge and youth potential is poised to make waves and this is the moment to celebrate the power of human ingenuity.  At the same time, he called for ensuring environmental sustainability and keeping the planet green. 

Shri Naidu congratulated the INK for creating a gathering to tell inspiring stories of innovators and then connecting them to one another for a collective acceleration of the journeys of change. The Vice President said that India needs more makers, shakers and movers in an era of creative disruptions and out of the box thinking to focus on equitable development and inclusive growth.

Saying that despite significant improvements in growth rate of our country, issues such as poverty, unemployment, economic and social inequalities continue to challenge India, Shri Naidu told innovators to use the technological prowess to accelerate the country’s progress towards sustainable and inclusive growth.

The Vice President also suggested a rethink on existing education system to promote innovative thinking right from school age. We must promote the joy of discovery and experiential learning, he said.  He advocated that children must spend 50 per cent of their school time in class-rooms and the remaining time must be earmarked for sports and co-curricular activities.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to be amidst some of the brightest and best minds and young INK Fellows.

I am happy to learn that INK was born with a novel mission to bring some of the inspiring stories to light.

These kinds of conferences are essential to challenge the status quo and come out with innovative ideas.

Dialogue and debate, introspection and reflection, reading and assimilation are essential elements of a knowledge society.

Our generation grew up with limited resources and limited connectivity but we kept our eyes and ears open.  We collected  and collated information, we analyzed and synthesized data. That’s the way we made progress.

However, the advancement in science and technology, in the fields of communication and media, the all pervasive internet has increased the speed of communication exponentially.

The world has shrunk as the knowledge has expanded.

The impact of technology has been extraordinary.

We must leverage this vast power for improving the quality of life.

We in India have a vast, educated youth population whose creative energies and innovative thinking have to be fully tapped by promoting the culture of innovation and creating an ecosystem that fosters it.

When the world was worried about the Y2K problem, our engineering talent stepped in to assist industries across the globe. Our computer scientists have been at the forefront of the knowledge revolution and are occupying key positions across the globe.

Dear sisters and brothers,

Despite significant improvements in growth rate of our country, issues such as poverty, unemployment, economic and social inequalities are continuing to challenge us.

I want to focus on what is important for India in the coming years – our people. What are we doing to let them reach their best potential? It is estimated that India’s youth population will be a third (34.33%) of world youth population by 2020.


	is extremely important for us to find ways to inspire our youth, listen to their ideas and provide ways to accelerate their journey of innovation. And to do that, we need to provide proper support from high school to college to careers beyond.


We need to rethink education. We have to bring back the sense of wonder, the joy of discovery. This is the foundation for innovation.

We need to bring back experiential learning. I have been also advocating that children must spend 50 per cent of their school time in class-rooms and the remaining time must be earmarked for sports and co-curricular activities.

I am glad to note that the government has been focusing on fostering a culture of innovation under Atal Innovation Mission.  You will be happy to know that Atal Tinkering Labs are being set up in schools and Atal Incubation Centres in colleges across the country. I am also happy that many leading global companies and other organizations are partnering with the government to take forward this mission for creation of an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship.

The government has also launched schemes like ‘Make In India’, which seek to transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub. Obsolete frameworks of the past are being replaced with a transparent system that is helping drive investment, foster innovation, protect Intellectual Property (IP) and build best-in-class manufacturing infrastructure.

The ‘Skill India’ campaign aims to train over 400 million people in India in different skills by 2022, while Startup India has been instrumental in increasing patent applications by Indian startups from 61 to 909 during just one year - 2016 to 2017.

Sisters and Brothers,

Each of you here has a distinct talent, different point of view and all of you are choosing to be here with a single purpose. That purpose is getting new ideas and sharing your vision of a world you want to unravel. 

This quest for excellence, for a better tomorrow, for a happy, harmonious world has been the driving force behind human progress over the centuries.  What is new today is the fascinatingly large number of unprecedented opportunities as compared to earlier years.  We are in an era of creative disruptions and out of the box thinking.

The central question that innovators like you are asking is “How can tomorrow be better than today”?

In this world, we need to not to just keep up with technologies but invent new technologies. Big data, Internet of Things, Robotics, Artificial intelligence, bit coins and block chains – terms that were not in our lexicon just four to five years ago, roll off our tongue easily today.

Of course, this is giving rise to other issues we may have to deal with – like cyber security, privacy and ethics. And for technology to be truly meaningful, we need to balance the technical capabilities with humanity and the wellbeing of our planet.

I am happy that today’s conference brings together outstanding young women and men.

Be it someone like Mr. Sunny Singh, who is returning to India after making his wealth elsewhere with a mission of wellbeing that embraces ancient practices with modern technology, or Ms. Anjali Gopalan or Sister Jesme, who are torch bearers for an inclusive India, or Mr. Ravi Reddy and Paresh Ghelani who are dedicated to address the water problem with grass-roots support as well as cutting edge technology, or Mr. Sanjay Podder who is championing Tech for Good, or the 22 INK Fellows who are out-of-the-box thinkers.

You are all essential catalysts driving innovations to harness the power of technology to transform human lives.  

As Ms. Lakshmi Pratury, the curator of this gathering said, you are all “billionaires of moments” – pursuing magical moments that will change the planet for the better.

We have a unique opportunity to leap frog and move into the modern world with new unheard of technologies. This is the time for us to make waves while ensuring environmental sustainability and keeping the planet green. This is the moment that celebrates the power of human ingenuity.

I congratulate INK for creating a gathering like this to tell inspiring stories of innovators and then connecting them to one another for a collective acceleration of the journeys of change.

I am sure that Ms. Lathika Pai (Microsoft Ventures), Mr. Hari Menon (Big Basket) and Mr. Girish Matribhootam (Fresh Desk) will discuss their entrepreneurial journeys in modern India. I am also glad that INK is implementing programs like INK Makers, urging students to be part of the maker culture.

We need more makers, shakers and movers in our world.  The bottom-line of the balance sheet of development is human well being and inclusive growth.

This is what, from time immemorial, India believed in. The concept of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” as well as an attitude of welcoming noble thoughts from all over the world has made us receptive and inclusive.

The explosion in technological prowess offers us great opportunities to accelerate our progress towards sustainable and inclusive growth. To tap into these opportunities, we need competence and capabilities but we also need the heart to respond to emerging global challenges.

No matter what your country of origin or choice of discipline may be, there is only one thing that is needed to be here – your passion and commitment to make a difference.

I urge each one of you to continue your passionate journey towards excellence and innovation, towards transformation of our country and the world as well as the lives of all people.

Have a wonderful conference.

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India traditionally enjoyed a robust joint family system and the fast changing socio-economic conditions ware leading to its disintegration. He was addressing the gathering at the 18th National Conference of Senior Citizens organized by the All India Senior Citizens Confederation (AISCCON), at Hyderabad today.

The Vice President said that there was an inherent social security in our joint family system as it took great care of the elderly.

The Vice President said that with the emergence of nuclear families, the elderly were increasingly getting neglected and their dignity was also adversely affected. Whenever the family system fails in its duty to protect the elderly, the community, civil society and the government have to step in to fill the vacuum, he added.

The Vice President also expressed his concern over the instances of children abandoning their parents and said the neglect and abuse of the elderly was “abhorrent and completely unacceptable”.

Shri Naidu said that in spite of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior citizens Act 2007, the number of cases of children abandoning their elderly parents was on the rise. Apart from abandonment, the elderly also faced neglect, abuse, physical, verbal and emotional and other forms of violence, he added.

The Vice President said that currently, there were an estimated 10.5 crore elderly in India and by 2050 the figure would reach 32.4 crore. Worldwide, by 2050 every fifth person will be an elder person and there will be 64 countries including India where 30% of the population will be 60 plus, he added.

Pointing out that more than 70% of our elders reside in rural areas, the Vice President said the rise in rural population of senior citizens was due to large scale migration of younger generation to urban areas. The elderly in rural areas were facing deprivation, discrimination, dispossession, loneliness and abuse, he added.

Shri Naidu said that out of the total population of the elders, 70% – that is around eight crore people – are below the poverty line. He further said that the pension they receive from the government was inadequate. Even though the situation has improved with the recent Direct Benefit Transfer, we still have a long way to go, he added.

The Vice President said that social security should be made mandatory once the Indian economy improves. “I am more in favour of social security than giving freebies”, he added.

Asserting that it was of paramount importance to provide the much-needed physical, financial and social security and dignity to our elderly, the Vice President said the National Policy on Older Persons must be implemented by all State Governments in letter and spirit.

Observing that the implementation of various welfare measures for Senior Citizens cannot wait, the Vice President said “we must focus on affordable health care, insurance, personal security, prevention of abuse, establishment of multi-purpose day care centres, setting up of homes for the elderly, geriatric wards in hospitals and construction of shelters for the abandoned”. 

Stressing the need for expanding geriatric healthcare facilities in our hospitals, he said. Our cities and the facilities within them should be accessible to the elderly. Senior Citizens have the right to barrier- free public places, he added.

The Vice President also urged the companies to expand their CSR activities by including elders’ issues.

Pointing out that our civilization has always been proud of the way we treated our elderly, he said it was the duty of the youngsters to take care of the elderly.

AISCCON is the largest body of senior citizens with a membership of around 20 lakhs and works towards improving the welfare of senior citizens.

In this 18th Conference held in Hyderabad, the Vice President felicitated centenarians, Shri V. Tirupati Rao, founder member of Association of Sr. Citizens of Hyderabad and Smt. Rukinamma. He also presented life time achievement awards to Dr. Prathap C. Reddy, founder Chairman of Apollo Hospitals, Shri. R.N. Mital, former President of AISCCON and Dr. S.P. Kinjwadekar, founder member AISCCON.

Shri Justice Subhashan Reddy, Former Chief Justice, Tamil Nadu, Kerala High Court and Shri Vijayarama Rao, Ex-Director of CBI were also present. Senior citizens from SAARC countries, including a large number from Nepal are attending the two day conference.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It is my great pleasure and privilege to be among the distinguished senior citizens of our country.

 Let me at the outset thank you for your immense contributions towards building this country and taking it to its present stature.

You are truly valuable and important to India and its future. Your wealth of experience will continue giving us wisdom and direction.

I am happy to know that All India Senior Citizen’s Confederation, with a membership of approximately 20 lakhs in various States and Union Territories in the country, is the largest national level organization of senior citizens in India.

I am told that it devotes itself to networking, advocacy and research on the issues concerning welfare and development of senior citizens and works with governments and civil society organizations engaged in similar activities. It is noteworthy that the Association also provides service activities including healthcare.

It is heartening to know that both the AISCCON and its State-level Federations work with the state governments in the country to take up measures for the welfare of senior citizens.

We always talk about the tremendous opportunity that lies in our demography. We usually focus on youth but not enough attention is paid to the elder age group.

Currently, there are an estimated 10.5 Crore elderly in India and by 2050 it would reach 32.4 Crore. Out of 10.5 Crore elders, 80 Lakhs are the eldest, that is 80 plus. Their number is increasing at the fastest rate and they are the most vulnerable.

Worldwide, by 2050 every fifth person you see will be an elder person. There will be 64 countries including India where 30% of the population will be 60 plus.

Though India, traditionally, enjoyed a robust joint family system which took great care of the elderly, the fast changing socio-economic conditions has led to its complete disintegration.

There was an inherent social security in our joint family system. The children of the family developed deep ties with their grandparents and often turned to them for guidance and solace in troubled times. The elderly, in turn, knew no dearth of love and companionship. There was a kind of symbiosis that held joint families together in comfort and security.

With the emergence of nuclear families where the husband and the wife work and where there are frequent, pressing financial crises, the elderly are getting increasingly neglected, adversely affecting their care and dignity.

Wherever family system fails in its duty to protect the Elderly; the community, civil society and the government have to step in to fill the vacuum. 

In spite of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior citizens Act 2007, the number of cases of children abandoning their elderly parents is on the rise. Apart from abandonment, the elderly also face neglect, abuse, physical, verbal and emotional and other forms of violence.

This is an abhorrent and completely unacceptable trend. When we, as a society, fail to meet the needs of our seniors’ community, we are only creating a dreadful preface to our own inevitable destiny.

More than 70% of our elders reside in rural areas. The rising rural population of senior citizens due to large scale migration of younger generation to urban areas or other countries in search of jobs, has aggravated the problems faced by the rural elderly. They are facing deprivation, discrimination, dispossession, loneliness and abuse.

Out of the total population of the Elders, 70% – that is around 8 Crore people – are below the poverty line. The pension they receive from the government is highly inadequate. Even though with the recent Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) the situation has improved greatly, we still have a long way to go.

Our country spends just 0.032% of GDP on the welfare of the elderly while most of the other countries, even smaller and with weaker economies, spend 3 to 8 times more on their elders. Moving towards a reasonable universal pension for all is an inevitable step.

It is of paramount importance that we provide the much needed physical, financial and social security and dignity to our elderly. The National Policy on Older Persons which was announced in 1999, seeks to assure elder persons that their concerns are national concerns and that they will not live unprotected, ignored or marginalized lives.

The goal of the National Policy is the well being of elder persons. This policy has to be implemented by all State Governments in letter and spirit. 

Dear sisters and brothers,

Implementation of various welfare measures for Senior Citizens cannot wait. 

We must focus on affordable health care, insurance, personal security, prevention of abuse, establishment of multi-purpose day care centres, setting up of homes for the elderly, geriatric wards in hospitals and construction of shelters for the abandoned. 

Article 41of the Directive Principle of State Policy, says that the State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective provision for social security for the elderly the right to public assistance in case of old age. We must give meaning to this policy intent.

Senior citizens are easy targets for criminals, cheaters and looters. Our law enforcement agencies and the justice system must be sensitized to the plight of the elderly so that they can take prompt, effective action.

There is a need to implement the Maintenance & Welfare of Parents & Senior Citizens Act 2007 more effectively. The act was enacted a decade ago and it needs to be reviewed to reflect the present day social realities.

There is also a need to expand geriatric healthcare facilities in our hospitals

Our cities and the facilities within them should be accessible to the elderly. Senior Citizens have the right to barrier- free public places. They have the right to safe and quiet spaces for   peer group and intergenerational dialogue. They deserve to participate actively in Senior Citizens’ Associations and Residents’ Welfare Associations.

To mitigate the problems of senior citizens, one should not look up to the government alone. Senior Citizens associations, federations like AISCCON, NGOs, all retirement-related agencies like retirement communities, elder care homes, Self Help Groups and lastly, corporate houses should join to support seniors’ cause.

If sufficient awareness is created among the companies to expand their CSR activity towards elders’ issues, quite a lot can be achieved in a short time.

To keep seniors active and engaged, sufficient opportunities to work beyond retirement and to volunteer must be made available. That is a sure way of ensuring productive or active ageing among seniors.

Dear sisters and brothers

The Government of India has launched several welfare schemes for providing comprehensive healthcare and economic independence to the senior citizens.

A healthcare scheme namely National Programme for the Health Care of the Elderly, NPHCE to address the various health related problems.

Two National Centers of Ageing are also being set up at Chennai and New Delhi. In addition, Regional Geriatric Centres are also being established.

""Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana"" a pension scheme for the elderly, is being implemented by L.I.C. of India since 2017. Under this Scheme, an assured income of 8 per cent per annum is given to the senior citizens for ten years, alongwith Life Insurance Cover.

A Senior Citizens' Welfare Fund has been established in the year 2016 by pooling together the unclaimed amounts remaining in the inoperative accounts under the Post Offices, Savings Banks, Provident Funds, Insurance Companies, etc. The interest accrued on such unclaimed deposits would be utilized for Schemes promoting the welfare of senior citizens.

The Department of Social Justice and Empowerment has launched a scheme namely ""Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana"" since 2017, for free distribution of physical aids and assisted living devices to senior citizens belonging to the BPL category. So far more than 53,000 senior citizens have been benefitted under this Yojana.

Recently, I also had the privilege of presenting the ""Vayoshreshtha Sammans'' to Senior Citizens  for their outstanding achievements in their respective fields relevant to Senior Citizens and to the society as a whole.

Dear sisters and brothers

We are a civilization that has always been proud of the way we treated our elderly. We have always given the most esteemed and respectful positions in the society to our elders.

Manu Smriti, one of our ancient texts has this statement: “If one serves the elderly with devotion, he or she is blessed with long life, sound education, fame and strength”.

We should take inspiration from these ennobling thoughts from the past and shape the present day care facilities for the elderly. 

I wish the AISCCON all the very best in their efforts to serve the elderly.  I wish all the senior citizens a healthy, happy and meaningful retired life, full of purpose and energy.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for United Nations and other Multilateral Organisations to chalk out strategy to extradite economic fugitives. He was addressing the CITI Global Textiles Conclave 2018, organised to commemorate CITI Diamond Jubilee celebrations, here today. The Union Minister for Textiles, Smt. Smriti Irani and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that world leaders he had met during his visits to Europe, Latin America and Africa appreciated India’s development story and said that it was marching forward with remarkable growth. There was a tremendous interest in India’s growth story in the world community, he added.

Shri Naidu said that UN and the world community must take lead and see that an agreement is made to exchange information on bank accounts.

The Vice President said that Accountability and Transparency, Ethics in Business and Standards in Products must be maintained to sustain in the global competitive scenario. He said that India definitely has a competitive advantage in terms of abundant availability of raw material, skilled manpower, manufacturing competitiveness, huge spinning, weaving, processing and garment manufacturing facilities. 

Shri Naidu stressed the need to give major thrust to skill development, up gradation and use of Digital technology and adoption of lean manufacturing systems to remain globally competitive.

The Vice President said that India has the unique advantage of combining traditional workmanship with modern methods. We not only have to showcase the wide range to the world but become a global leader in textiles manufacturing and exports, he added.

The Vice President called for modernization of textile industry by proving requited skill, investment and market to recapture India’s past glory in the textiles sector.  He said that being the second largest employer after agriculture accounts for 21 per cent employment.

With the world moving towards 4th industrial revolution based on cyber physical systems, Shri Naidu said that the Indian textile industry must take lead in industry 4.0 in view of the distinct advantage enjoyed by us in the IT sector. He called up on the textile industry to fully tap the potential of IoT cloud, artificial intelligence and big data and analytics. He said that it was high time for the industry to establish textile industry 4.0 learning factory in all the major clusters adopting Hub and Spokes Model with Hub focusing on advance training and spokes focusing on basic training.

The Vice President presented the Lifetime Achievement Award to the CMD, Kotak Commodities, Shri Suresh Kotak and five Pioneer Awards to other eminent personalities form Textile Sector for excellence. 

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am extremely pleased to inaugurate CITI Diamond Jubilee Celebrations and CITI Global Textiles Conclave 2018. The theme of the conclave ‘Disruptions and innovations for sustainable growth’ is quite appropriate.

The need of the hour for the textile industry is to adopt new and innovative technologies in tune with the demands of the 4th Industrial Revolution.

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

India today meets 14 per cent of world’s textile production and is the second largest exporter with 5.2 per cent global share and 25 per cent in cotton yarn export.

We are also the second largest producer and exporter of cotton; largest producer of jute and silk.

India also accounts for 63 per cent of looms and 37 per cent world area under cotton cultivation. India is the only country which has presence in the whole value chain and manufacturing of textile products from all fibers.

I am told that the textile industry contributes four per cent to the GDP and fetches over US $ 37 billion in forex earnings.

India has a huge potential to increase its presence in the textiles sector globally and capture newer markets.

The need of the hour is to modernize the textile industry, which is the second largest employer after agriculture and accounts for 21 per cent employment (around110 million people).

India should recapture India’s past glory in the textiles sector. When we look at the history and evolution of the textile industry in the country, we find references to weaving and spinning in Vedic texts.

We also know that India was an exporter of finest cotton, silk and muslin materials to other countries before colonization by the British.

The exported Indian materials were also famous for their workmanship and finesse. All that was virtually destroyed during the British rule and In 1817 Fergusson & Company was established with 20,000 spindles and 100 looms at an investment of  2 lakh pounds (£ 2,00,000) at Calcutta.

At the time of independence, India had 409 textile mills and today there are over 3500 textile mills and several thousands of textile units in different segments.

Successive governments since Independence have extended various concessions and taken many initiatives to spur the growth of the textile industry.

I am aware that flagship schemes such as Technology Mission on Cotton, Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme and Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks have fuelled the growth of the textile industry in India.

Allocating Rs.17,822 crores for Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS), Rs. 6,006 cores for boosting garment exports, extending the scheme for integrated Textile Parks, facilitating coastal movement of cotton and launching Powertex India for the benefit of the powerloom sector were among the measures taken by the Government of India in recent years.

According to projections, the Indian textiles and clothing industry has the potential to grow at CAGR of 14 per cent and reach US $ 300 billion by 2025 from US $ 150 billion achieved in the year 2017. The exports textiles and apparels are expected to reach US $ 82 billion by 2021.

Taking advantage of the Digital India programme, the Indian fashion retailers online market is poised to grow to US $ 30 billion by 2020 from the current level of around US $ 7 to 9 billion.

With huge investments being made under the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme and policy support from both the Government of India and various States, the industry no doubt is poised for growth. The exports are expected to receive a boost in the wake of Free Trade with ASEAN and the proposed agreement with China.Coming back to the theme of the conference, it should be remembered that the textile industry played a pioneering role in the industrial revolution by introducing first mechanical weaving machine in 1784.

The industry has constantly adopted technological advancements during the second and third industrial revolutions.

With the world moving towards 4th industrial revolution based on cyber physical systems, the Indian textile industry must take lead in industry 4.0 in view of the distinct advantage enjoyed by us in the IT sector.

The textile industry needs to fully tap the potential of IoT cloud, artificial intelligence and big data and analytics.

It is high time for the industry to establish textile industry 4.0 learning factory in all the major clusters adopting Hub and Spokes Model with Hub focusing on advance training and spokes focusing on basic training.

Several leading companies in India are already equipped with these technologies and India must press home the advantage.

I am told that the policies relating to Hank Yarn Obligation, Handloom Reservation Act have become obsolete and causing lot of hardship for the spinning and weaving sectors. The government would examine the matter and take appropriate decision.

I am sure that government would also be looking to expedite the conclusion of FTA with EU and other countries.

Rising incomes, increase in population, growth in building, construction, health sectors and online retail trade will drive the demand exponentially in the domestic market.

India definitely has a competitive advantage in terms of abundant availability of raw material, skilled manpower, manufacturing competitiveness, huge spinning, weaving, processing and garment manufacturing facilities.

Finally, before concluding, I would like to advice the industry to focus on backward and forward integration, value addition and diversifying products.

It should also consolidate MSME sector by establishing Hub and Spoke model of cluster development facilities, give major thrust to skill development, upgrade technology and adopt Industry 4.0. 

The Industry also needs to adopt lean manufacturing systems to remain globally competitive.

Unlike any other nation, India has the unique advantage of combining traditional workmanship with modern methods. We not only have to showcase the wide range to the world but become a global leader in textiles manufacturing and exports.

 

JAI HIND!""

                Marking a new beginning in India-Pakistan relations and heralding the possibility of reducing the tensions between the two countries, the Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has laid the foundation stone for construction of Dera Baba Nanak - Kartapur Sahib corridor on the Indian side that will provide a passage to Sikh pilgrims to visit the holy site of Gurudwara Darbar Sahib at Kartarpur in Pakistan.

The event also marked the commemoration of 550th birth anniversary year of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji.

Describing today as a “historic day”, the Vice President while laying the foundation stone, said that it has been our long-pending demand that Indian Sikh sisters and brothers should be able to visit Kartapur site with ease.

Pointing out that the demand for setting up the corridor has been discussed for two decades now, he observed that the dream which was pending for many years was getting fulfilled today. It is a day like no other day. It is a truly path-breaking, potentially transformative moment, he affirmed.

Expressing his happiness that Pakistan has accepted the demand of India to develop a corridor with facilities on their side, Shri Naidu said that this is a corridor that connects to the Guru we revere, to the sacred space where he spent the last 18 years of his life. Paying rich tributes to Guru Nanak Dev Ji, he described him as a saint, scholar, poet, guide and a revolutionary, who gave illumination to humanity for the last five and half centuries.

Terming the corridor as a bridge between the people of the two countries who have so much in common, the Vice President said the corridor opens new doors and new possibilities and promotes a new resolve to connect the people of our two countries through love, empathy and invisible threads of common spiritual  heritage. This is a corridor to the shrine of peace, harmony and humanism, to the universal vision of a world as one family, to the sublime ideal of service to humanity, he added.

Shri Naidu observed that from time immemorial India has believed that the whole world was one large family and asserted that today’s event was the reaffirmation of that conviction.

Lauding the Government of India for taking a number of initiatives to commemorate 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji, the Vice President said his vision was timeless and more relevant today than ever before. He expressed his happiness that the Centre and the State Government were working together to construct the Kartarpur corridor in a true ‘Team India’ spirit.

Referring to the growing menace of terrorism, the Vice President said that it is truly a global challenge that requires a global response and we must collectively work towards a just and responsive world order and an early conclusion of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the United Nations. We cannot allow the darkness to deter us any longer, he added.

The Vice President stressed that India wants peace with all nations, including its neighbours. He said the killing of innocents in terror attacks needs to be condemned.

The Vice President said that the region was beset with challenges like poverty, illiteracy and gender discrimination, which needed to be addressed on a war footing. The people in the region want peace and development and everyone should work in that direction, he added.

The Governor of Punjab, Shri V.P. Singh Badnore, the Chief Minister of Punjab, Capt. Amrinder Singh, the Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri Nitin Gadkari, the Union Minister for Food Processing Industries, Smt. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs (I/C), Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, the Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Vijay Sampla and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am very happy to be with all of you today

It is a historic day today.

It is a day when we are laying the foundation for a project we have been dreaming of for a long time.

It is a day that promises to bring us closer to the Guru we all revere.

A Guru who gave illumination to humanity for the last five and a half centuries. A saint, scholar, poet, guide and a revolutionary who believed in gender equality, who decried caste barriers and wanted the world to be filled with a spirit of social equality, religious freedom and universal fraternity.

A Guru who saw godliness in every human being and the one who addressed the Creator of this universe ecstaticallyas follows, 

""You, yourself created the Universe, You, yourself are the bumblebee, flower, fruit and the tree. You, yourself are the water, desert, ocean and the pond. You, yourself are the big fish, tortoise and the Cause of causes”. (Raag-AASA by Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Ang- 463)

He was a Guru who emphasized service and said, “If we serve humanity in this world, then we would be welcomed in the court of God”. (Raag- Siri by Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Ang-26 )

His vision is timeless and is relevant more than ever today.

The following words from the Guru Granth Sahib reflect India’s universal world view that strikes a rare resonance in our hearts.

 

“No man shall coerce another;

No man shall exploit another.

Every one, each individual, has 

An inalienable birth-right to seek

And pursue happiness and self-fulfilment

Love and persuasion is the only law

Of Social coherence and harmony”

(Baba Farid. Ang-1384.)

 

Gurudwara Darbar Sahib at Kartarpur, like other places associated with this extraordinary Guru, has been a source of inspiration for centuries. 

It has been our long pending demand that Indian Sikh sisters and brothers should be able to visit Kartarpur site with ease. 

Unfortunately, even though the great Guru’s message transcends time and space, we have been bound by territorial limits and national boundaries. 

The demand for setting up a corridor has been raised and discussed for nearly two decades now. This dream, which was pending for many years, is getting fulfilled today. 

It is a day like no other day. It is a truly path breaking, potentially transformative moment. 

This momentous, historic occasion has been made possible by the Government of India’s decision to build this corridor from Dera Baba Nanak to the International Corridor on our side.

Of course, we have the blessings of the Guru whose birth anniversary was celebrated a few days backand whose 550th Birth Anniversary is proposed to be celebrated throughout the world next year. 

We urged the Government of Pakistan to recognise the sentiments of the Sikh community in India and develop a corridor with facilities on their side as well so that our pilgrims from India can visit the holy Gurudwara at Kartarpur Sahib throughout the year.

We are happy that Pakistan had accepted our long pending demand.

Now, you would not have to take a long and arduous route through Attari border. Now you would be able to visit the holy Kartarpur site directly.

This is a corridor that connects us to the Guru we revere, to the sacred space where he spent the last 18 years of his life.

Not only that, it is a bridge between the people of the two countries who have so much in common. 

This is a corridor to the shrine of peace, harmony and humanism, to the universal vision of a world as one family, to the sublime ideal of service to humanity.

This is a corridor that opens new doors. It is a path that opens up new possibilities.

It is a unifier, building bridges across old chasms. It promotes deeper understanding and a new resolve to connect the people of our two countries through love, empathy and invisible threads of common spiritual heritage.

My dear sisters and brothers,

From time immemorial, India has believed that the whole world is one large family. Today’s event is the reaffirmation of this conviction. 

It promises to be, in many ways, the beginning of a new chapter in our efforts to bring two family members even closer. I am hopeful that the following words of Guru Granth Sahib will be a balm and having soothing influence:

“I have forgotten to speak ill or think ill of any one,

Ever since I learnt to live in the company of good and holy saints,

No one is my enemy nor any one stranger to me,

I get on well with one and all.”

(Raag- Kaanra by Guru Arjan Dev Ji Fifth guru. Ang 1299)

India believes that peace is an inexorable pre-requisite for progress and this can be achieved only if we have mutual respect and a stronger focus on the five Ps that underpin the global agenda for sustainable development- People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership. 

As Guru Granth Sahib says, “We treat everybody as our friend, and all are our associates,”and hope that others will also reciprocate with similar approach.(Raag Dhanasri by Guru Arjan Dev ji fifth Guru. Ang-671)

It is this message of goodwill and a willingness to work together that this event today sends out. In fact, Guru Nanak Devji’s vision and voice, like the one propounded by many saints and philosophers of India and the world, has a great relevance for creating conditions for lasting peace. 

I am happy that the Government has taken a number of initiatives to commemorate the 550th birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji and spread his message and teaching far and wide. 

The historic town of Sultanpur Lodhi, associated with the life of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, is proposed to be developed as a ‘Heritage town’. It will be developed on the smart city principles, including energy efficiency, to highlight Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji’s emphasis on sustainability and reverence for nature. A heritage complex by the name “Pind Babe Nanak da” will be established to depict life in the times of Shri Guru Nanak ji.  

Railway station at Sultanpur Lodhi will be developed with all modern amenities and the Ministry of Railways will run a train passing through the various holy places associated with Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, for pilgrims and tourists.

I am glad that the Government of India is planning to establish a Centre for interfaith studies at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar as well as Chairs on Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji in one University each in the UK and Canada.

In order to disseminate the wisdom of the Gurus and connect their thoughts with the contemporary realities, publication of the holy text in different world languages and seminars are being planned.

In a world that is increasingly torn with narrow tunnel vision, bigotry and dogmatism, a world that is being fragmented and divided, a world that is witnessing needless violence and endless conflicts, we need all the strength to dispel the darkness that constantly threatens to envelop individuals, communities and nations. 

A manifestation of this darkness is the growing menace of terrorism across the world. It is truly a global challenge that requires a global response. We must collectively work towards a just and responsive world order and an early conclusion of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the United Nations. We cannot allow the darkness to deter us any longer. 

The word “Guru” means “one who dispels darkness”. He or she is the one who provides a moral compass and makes us tread a path that is good for all of us. 

Guru Nanakji, as well as other illustrious Gurus who have made our country a spiritual lighthouse, have shown us the path. 

But it is up to us to walk on the path and further embellish it with our own actions.

As the Guru Nanak Ji had exhorted, let us, on this auspicious day, “make the heart the pen, the intellect the writer and write that which has no end or limit”.

(Raag Malaar by Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji Ang- 1291)

That is the history we have to create together, a history that will make our two countries and the entire world a more peaceful place for our children and grandchildren to live and grow together.

I hope this corridor will pave the way for peace and greater progress of all our people.

Let me conclude with a Vedic prayer written more than twenty centuries ago. 

“May we hear good voices with our ears
May we see pleasant things with our eyes
May we have the devotion, dedication and steadfast resolve to serve humanity with our our hearts, minds and bodies “

I am hopeful that the small but significant step we are taking today will lead us all towards that goal of a harmonious, peaceful, fulfilling life. 

 

Jai Hind!”

                ‘Recognizing one’s merit is part of Indian culture’. The Vice President of India Shri. M Venkaiah Naidu said today. He was addressing the gathering at the ‘Jashn-E-Youngistan’ event organized by the News 24 Channel here in New Delhi today. Jashn-E-Youngistan honored those promising young stars who have made their mark in their respective fields of achievement. 

The Vice President expressed hope that such awards would inspire other youngsters to excel. Shri. Naidu spoke of the great demographic dividend at the cusp of which India stands today and added that we must do our best to empower the youth of our country. 

Shri. Naidu said that India was once known as the ‘Vishwa Guru’, the teacher to the world. He added that India has also always been known for its liberal attitude. ‘We believe in the philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’. Share and care is core of Indian philosophy’ he said. 

Applauding the novelty of the idea of Jashn-E-Youngistan, Shri. Naidu reasoned that the enrichment of the softer aspects of our society through arts and other cultural pursuits would only add to India’s growth and prosperity. He added that we must therefore encourage and promote human endeavor in these fields. 

The Vice President said that our civilization is the oldest and has survived for so long because of our firm belief in the power of love and peace and because of the values of empathy and kindness that is inherent in our cultural tradition.

Expressing concern about the rising violence in the world, Shri. Naidu hoped that India’s neighbors would stand by us in our quest for peace and prosperity. He also said that we have to transform the nation for the betterment of all people. 

The Vice President called on youth to participate actively in the momentous task of nation building. ‘There is enormous interest in India’s growth story around the world. India is the fastest growing economy’ he added. 

The Vice President said that awards such as these would encourage people to take inspiration from the remarkable stories of the youth icons who have excelled in art, science, music, cinema and other fields. 

Shri. Naidu spoke about the need for government programs and schemes such as Swachch Bharat, Beti Bachao, Clean India which are meant for the welfare of all people to become mass movements to realize their actual goals. 

Denouncing discrimination in all forms, Shri. Naidu said that we must strive to put an end to such abhorrent practices. He added that it is atrocious to think about caste at this day and age. 

He opined that the media should follow some standards and said that News and views should not be mixed. ‘Allow people to decide what is good and what is bad’, he added.

                The Vice President of India Shri. M. Venkaiah Naidu today denounced attempts to create social friction in the name of caste and called for putting an end to social and gender discrimination in the country. He said that he was pained to hear some adverse comments on caste made by people in public life and added that that there was no sanction to caste in religious texts. ‘Caste is a curse on society’, he added. Shri. Naidu was addressing the gathering at the presentation ceremony of Dr Nagendra Singh International Peace Award. 

Shri. Naidu also cautioned against the dangers of politics and caste coming together. He said that people should elect public representatives who have Character, Calibre, Capacity and good Conduct, but unfortunately four other C's Cast, Cash Criminality and Community are getting preference at times. 

 

Expressing his thoughts on world peace, the Vice President said that we should work towards creating a more just and responsive world order, one that is based on multi-lateralism. He added that a climate of mutual respect should be fostered and conflicts should be resolved through dialogue. 

Conveying his respect and appreciation for Justice Nagendra Singh who served in the International court of Justice at the Hague for more than 11 years, Shri. Naidu said that Justice Singh was not only a distinguished civil servant but also a great jurist whose knowledge of international law was both profound and deep. He congratulated the international Goodwill Society of India (IGSI)for recognizing individuals and institutions who are promoting peace and goodwill in the world through their philosophy and their actions. 

 

The Vice President observed that world peace has been humanity’s long standing dream. He expressed his disappointment at the fact that even in the 21st century, world peace continued to elude us and remained an unfulfilled quest. Recalling the horrifying days of the World Wars, the holocaust and the tragic times of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Vice President remarked that humanity could take heart from the fact that it has travelled a long way on the path to peace since then. He spoke of the world nations’ yearning for peace which led to the formation of the League of Nations. 

The Vice President said that India has been a beacon light of harmony and peaceful co-existence. ‘For us, the whole world is one large family and the maxim of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ is firmly ingrained in our consciousness’, he added. 

Shri. Naidu congratulated the Chinmaya Mission, the winner of the prestigious Dr Nagendra Singh international Peace Award. He lauded the Mission’s yeoman service in the fields of education, empowerment of youth, healthcare, rural development, environment and culture. ‘The Chinmaya Mission is a great ambassador of Indian ethos and values. It is a true embodiment of the virtuousness and the spirit of peace and humanism that Hinduism stands for’ he said.

The Vice President urged one and all to transform their mindsets, to think and act differently, keeping the ultimate objective of improving the quality of life on this planet and world peace in mind.  He proposed that Indian philosophy had the ideals of Sharing and caring at its core and stressed upon the need to internalize this spirit in whatever we do. 

Dwelling upon the various ways in which violence manifested itself, Shri. Naidu lamented that very often, the mass media, the internet and our popular culture portrayed violence rather recklessly and sometimes even glorified it. He cautioned that there is a need to exercise restraint and responsibility in the portrayal of violence. 

Shri. Naidu said that terrorism has become a major challenge to world peace. He added that there are a number of factors like isolationism, indoctrination, fundamentalism and violent extremism that are fuelling conflict and terror across the globe. ‘We must combat violence in all its forms and manifestations. We need a multi-pronged approach to bring in peace’, he said.

He explained that peace is an essential pre-requisite for progress and reemphasized the fact that we cannot give adequate attention to development if there is tension. ‘We must build an inclusive, harmonious world’. He said.

Shri. Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation and Parliamentary Affairs and other dignitaries were present at the occasion.

The following is the full text of the speech:

I am extremely happy to be present today on the auspicious occasion of the presentation of the Dr Nagendra Singh international Peace Award to the Chinmaya mission. 

Justice Nagendra Singh was the only Indian who secured full tenure at the International Court of Justice in the Hague. Early in 1973 he became a Judge of the International Court of Justice, thereafter its Vice President, and subsequently he was elected the President of the International Court in 1985. 

He served in the ICJ for more than 11 years and brought laurels to our nation. He was not only a distinguished civil servant but also a great jurist whose knowledge of international law was both profound and deep.

I am told that the international Goodwill Society of India (IGSI), a non-political, social and scholastic association, which is presenting this prestigious Peace Award, was founded by Justice Nagendra Singh in 1982. 

The objective behind its formation was the mobilization of the society to oppose challenges of human rights violation, hatred, violence, arms race and exploitation. 

This, he felt, was possible only by consciously promoting a feeling of brotherhood amongst men and creating goodwill through the practice of right conduct and the nurturing of a positive attitude.

The Society has earlier conferred these Peace awards on Justice Dalveer Bhandari of the international Court of Justice and on Shri. Ravi Shankar of the Art of Living fame. This year it is being given to the Chinmaya Mission. 

I must compliment the Society and its members for choosing individuals and institutions who are promoting peace and goodwill through both their philosophy and their actions. 

World peace has been humanity’s long standing dream. Since time immemorial, poets have sung about it, philosophers have tried to comprehend its complexities and rulers and governments have tried to find ways to achieve it. 

Yet, even at the threshold of the 21st century, world peace continues to elude us, it remains an unfulfilled quest, an unreachable destination. 

The achievement of world peace is undoubtedly a slow and painful process. 

We can take heart from the fact that we have travelled a long way since the barbaric days of the World War, the holocaust and the tragic times of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

 

In 1945, after the world was forced to bear witness to the unimaginable horrors of the Second World War, humanity came together and promised themselves that there wouldn’t be a Third World War to lament over. The historic 51 member League of Nations was thus born and later, transformed into the 192 member United Nations Organization. 

The countries of the world came to a consensus that the only way to achieve peace was to work together and help each other. 

Nelson Mandela once said, ""If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner."" 

India has been a beacon light of harmony and peaceful co-existence. For us, the whole world is one large family and the maxim of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ is firmly ingrained in our consciousness. 

I am happy to learn that the Chinmaya Mission, the winner of today’s prestigious award was established in India in the early fifties by the devotees of the renowned Vedanta teacher and proponent of Adwaita, Swami Chinmayananda Saraswati. 

Let me express my appreciation for the motto of the Mission which is ‘to give maximum happiness to the maximum number of people for the maximum time’.  Its message is that of peace enabled by a deeper understanding of the self. 

The Mission aims to bring about inner transformation of individuals through knowledge of Vedanta, spiritual practices and service to the society, thus creating a happy world around them.  

It has been doing yeoman service in the fields of education, empowerment of youth, healthcare, rural development, environment and culture. The Chinmaya Mission is working to spread the message of spirituality, peace and service to all parts of the world. The mission is a great ambassador of Indian ethos and values. 

It is a true embodiment of the virtuousness and the spirit of peace and humanism that Hinduism stands for.

The work done by Chinmaya Mission addresses the issues that lie at the heart of unrest and violence, the issues of deprivation, of injustice, of discontent. By educating the youth, it opens up a whole new world of opportunities to them. By focusing on  conserving the environment, it paves the way for sustainable development. 

Ultimately, if we want world peace, we must transform individuals.

If each of us can think  and act differently by keeping the ultimate objective of improving the quality of life on this planet, the world will get transformed. Which is why, Gandhiji also had said, “Be the change you want to see in the world.”

Share and care has been the core of Indian philosophy. We need to internalize this spirit in whatever we do. Learning to live together is the essential element of Indian ethos. 

This aspect of learning needs constant nurturing in our educational institutions.

I am glad that Chinmaya Mission is propagating these timeless ideas among the younger generation. 

Violence has several facets, from physical to psychological, and from emotional to cultural. We must combat violence in all its forms and manifestations. We need a multi-pronged approach to bring in peace. 

Unfortunately, very often, the mass media, our movies, our video games, our books, our television programs, the internet, portray violence and sometimes even glorify it.  There is a need to exercise restraint in the portrayal of violence. 

There are a number of other factors like isolationism, indoctrination, fundamentalism and violent extremism that are fuelling conflict and terror across the globe. 

In fact, terrorism has become a major challenge to world peace today. The number of terror related incidents has been on the rise from around 650 in 1970 to nearly 13,000 in 2016. The fatalities in these incidents have risen from nearly 170 in 1970 to nearly 34000 in 2016. 

We should aim at a more just and responsive world order and one that is based on multi-lateralism. We should foster a climate of mutual respect and resolve conflicts through dialogue.  

Peace is a pre-requisite for progress. We cannot have adequate attention to development if there is tension. We must build an inclusive, harmonious world. 

India’s message in this regard, taken from the Yajurveda, can prove to be highly inspirational. 

“May there be Peace in Heaven and in the Sky,
May there be Peace on the Earth, in the Water and in the Plants,

May there be Peace in All, 

May there be Peace within, giving me the Peace which Grows within Me.”

 

 

I once again congratulate the Chinmaya Mission for being awarded the Dr Nagendra Singh International Peace Award. 

 

I hope it will continue to propagate the best thoughts from the ancient Indian texts that can pave the way for world peace.

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that youth must aim high and strive hard, be rooted in the Indian ethos but be willing to learn from the best in the world. He said that a combination of courage and competence is required to set benchmarks in life. 

 

He presented the Sri Sathya Sai Award for Human Excellence that recognizes individuals, who are doing tremendous work to uplift the society in various parts of the world, at a gathering at World Youth Meet in Bangalore, today. 

 

Shri Naidu said they left a legacy of love, compassion, devotion and service to humanity. India is truly blessed to have Shri. Sathya Sai Baba’s divine presence in the countless individuals and institutions who continue to selflessly serve fellow human beings. He expressed his appreciation for Sri Sathya Sai LokaSeva Group for being one among such institutions.

 

The Vice President said that India has a great spiritual heritage that has shown humanity the path of devotion and service. He said that people like Sri Sathya Sai Baba and Guru Nanak inspire millions through their lives and their teachings that are relevant for all times to come.‘Love and Service was the message of Baba. His message is universal and timeless and his life is an inspiration to people across the globe’, he added.

 

‘We must dispel this darkness and illuminate our pathways through knowledge, wisdom, understanding and love. This is the path that has been shown by Indian sages from Vedic times. This is the path that holy saints like Guru Nanak and Sathya Sai Baba also have shown us’, he said. 

 

The Vice President said that we must follow the path shown by Shri Sathya Sai Baba andnot let material comforts of modern life dictate our lives. He added that we must imbibe the qualities of service, caring and sharing. Shri. Naidu reasoned that the younger generations must be enlightened about the rich spiritual heritage of India. ‘Everyone must work towards building India that is free from discrimination, poverty, hunger. People including politicians must work towards achieving such objectives’, he said.

 

The Vice President said that education system must lay a strong foundation based on Indian values and ethos and added that organizations like Sathya Sai Trust must contribute in realizing the demographic advantage by equipping the youth with the required skills, right attitude, knowledge and wisdom. 

 

India with nearly 65% of our population being less than 35 years of age, has a great opportunity to excel. ‘Youth represent the energy that will drive India of the future. Their knowledge and imagination, competence and confidence, their risk-taking ability and multi-tasking ability, their agility and adaptability will change the course of India’s development’, he said.

 

Shri Naidu said that India is moving forward rapidly on the path of progress and is emerging as a strong economic force. ‘We are a truly aspirational India that is at the cusp of a major transformation in the way we govern ourselves and the way we respond to the challenges of an uncertain but constantly changing world’ he said. 

 

Vice President said that the Government’s initiatives, effective policies and programs require the active participation of the civil society, the private sector, and the academic and charitable organizations like PrashantiBalamandira Trust to transform India. 

 

The Governor of Karnataka Shri. VajubhaiVala and other dignitaries bore witness to the ceremony.

The following is the full text of the Vice President’s address:

 

“I am indeed delighted to be with all of you at the World Youth Meet and address this congregation of youth from India and several countries.

I am also happy that seven outstanding persons are being awarded Sri Sathya Sai Award for Human Excellence. 

Today is a Holy day – Karthika Purnima – a day when we light lamps to dispel darkness.  It is also a very important day as it is the birth anniversary of two leading lights of Indian spiritual heritage who have shown humanity the path of devotion and service.  We humbly pay our respects to Sri Sathya Sai Baba and Guru Nanak on this most auspicious day.  Their lives and their message has a great relevance for our times and possibly for a long time to come. 

In India, we have always prayed that we should have the strength to light up many lamps to dispel darkness, as we say, “TamasomaJyotirgamaya”. 

There are always many forces that cloud our vision. There are dark human instincts that prevent us from realizing our strength and making us reach the heights of excellence. There are numerous pitfalls and whirlpools of conflict and irrational hatred. 

We must dispel this darkness and illuminate our pathways through knowledge, wisdom, understanding and love.  

This is the path that has been shown by Indian sages from Vedic times.  

This is the path that holy saints like Guru Nanak and Sathya Sai Baba also have shown us. 

As we celebrate Baba’s birth anniversary today, let us remind ourselves of the great legacy he has left behind.  It is a legacy of love, compassion, devotion and service to humanity.  We are truly blessed to have his divine presence in the countless individuals and institutions who continue to selflessly serve fellow human beings.  I am happy that Sri Sathya Sai LokaSeva Group is among such institutions. 

I am pleased that inspired by Sri Sathya Sai Baba’s immortal message, your organization has taken up several welfare projects in the fields of education, healthcare and nutrition. 

Baba had transformed Puttaparthy, a small village into an international centre of excellence in education, healthcare and rural development.  

He took up drinking water and irrigation projects.  

This incredible transformation was possible because of his selfless spirit of service, his unbounded love for humanity and his universal vision.  

This is quintessentially the attitude of a true Guru.  He provides direction, handholds when required and leads all of us to a better life.  His spiritual leadership is based on a strong humanistic foundation.  This is what Swami means to all of us.  

Excellent education, excellent healthcare, excellent social services being made available to common citizens.  

Excellence was his watchword and it is that spirit of excellence that we are celebrating today in the award ceremony as well as in the University you have established. 

 

I am happy that, under your stewardship, as many as 29 educational institutions are providing free education in 14 districts of Karnataka and one district of Telangana, apart from a free university, serving over 3500 children. In the health sector, two paediatric cardiac hospitals are providing free treatment and over 6,000 children have operated upon, while over 50,000 ailing children from all states of the country were treated.

I am also glad that over 1.2 lakh children are being provided nutritious breakfast in 15 States and two union territories. In addition, several and several human development and spiritual centres are running across the globe.

I am given to understand that four more educational institutions will come up in four more districts of Karnataka in a few months, while a paediatric cardiac hospital is due to open in Navi Mumbai later this month. I am happy to note that the nutrition program will be expanded to cover 5 lakh children and one lakh pregnant women by March 2019.

I would like to personally congratulate and convey my deepest appreciation to the selfless devotees of Baba, who are working day and night in these trusts to carry on the humanitarian projects. My deepest appreciation to Sri B N Narasimha Murthy, Chief Mentor of Sri Sathya Sai LokaSeva Group of educational institutions and others.

The Sri Sathya Sai Award for Human Excellence is a very noble initiative to recognize individuals, who are doing tremendous work to uplift the society in various parts of the world. I congratulate the awardees for their outstanding contribution to society.

Our country is moving rapidly on the path of progress and is emerging as a strong economic force.  

We are a truly aspirational India that is at cusp of a major transformation in the way we govern ourselves and the way we respond to the challenges of an uncertain but constantly changing world. 

We are a young India with nearly 65% of our population being less than 35 years of age. I am happy to see many young people at the world youth meet today.  

 

Youth represents the energy that will drive India of the future. 

Their knowledge and imagination, competence and confidence, their risk-taking ability and multi-tasking ability, their agility and adaptability will change the course of India’s development. 

The demographic advantage we have today will yield complete dividends only if youth are equipped with the required skills and attitude, with the knowledge and wisdom.  

I earnestly hope that our educational system, to which organizations like your Trust are contributing, will provide a good foundation for the youth.

I also hope that the youth will also continue to aim high and strive hard, be rooted in the Indian ethos but be willing to learn from the best in the world.  

Setting high benchmarks requires courage. Achieving them requires competence.  I do hope you will have both. 

While the Government is devising effective policies and programs, the massive effort required for this transformation will be possible only with the active participation of the civil society, the private sector, the academic and charitable organizations like your PrashantiBalamandira Trust.

I do hope you will continue your good work and keep lighting many lamps in the homes and hearts of many more people. 

I would like to once again extend my deepest appreciation for the good work that is being done all of you. May Sathya Sai Baba’s blessings be with all of us and inspire us to do greater deeds in the years to come

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that states must focus on long term economic model for the betterment of the people and must not settle for short-term populist measures.

Addressing the gathering after presenting India Today State of State Awards 2018, here today, he said that the relationship between the states and the centre must be built on trust, transparency and mutual respect. 

Shri Naidu said both parties should practice openness and should not be limited by narrow political divisiveness. He further said that there is an agenda greater than politics before all of us, the agenda of taking development to the last man, the goal of ensuring Antyodaya. Federals should not end at door steps of State capitals, they must reach to villages, he added. 

The Vice President said that political differences must end with the elections and there after the ruling party must not be bogged down by dilatory tactics and the opposition parties must be given the space to offer constructive criticism in the legislature. He further said that a measure of accommodative openness must be practiced by both the centre and the states if we were to build a strong team India where every voice has its own space.

Saying that federalism, cultural & ethnic pluralism gave country's political system the much needed agility, the Vice President said that continuation of the same requires not simply federalism, but cooperative and constructive federalism. He further said that cooperative federalism has been India’s mantra for centre-state unity, cohesion and harmony and there was every need to continue what the unifier of India, Sardar Patel had said. The spirit of cooperative federalism inspired Sardar Vallabhai Patel's intelligent and proactive political manoeuvring by which he successfully persuaded the 492 princely states to join the Indian Union, all the while successfully maintaining the unity and integrity of the nation, he added.

Shri Naidu said that only decentralization of decision making and devolution of resources to states and local self governments would pave the way to fulfil the development needs of India. He said that it was heartening to note that the government recognized the need to empower states and created the NITI Aayog by a resolution of the Union Cabinet on 1st January 2015 to provide the quintessential platform of the Government of India to bring States to act together in national interest, and thereby fosters Cooperative Federalism. As a think tank it has been providing developmental strategies, frameworks, innovations and new ideas to states so that they can set their own priorities and goals and chart their own paths to achieve these goals, he added. 

The Vice President said that development is a collective process and several factors determine the pace of it. Development also does not always make noise and often does not find space in front pages and prime times, he said.

He stressed the importance of building a ‘Team India’, a resurgent India, a strong India where the states work seamlessly, in harmony, complementing and compensating each other, even while competing with each other. Constructive consensus is the need of the and not disruptive confrontation, he added.

The Vice President has released a special edition of India Today on ‘India's Best States’ on this occasion. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Shri Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the Chief Minister of Puducherry, Shri V. Narayanasamy, the Chief Minister of Assam, Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Vijay Rupani, several Ministers from different States and other dignitaries were among the Awardees.  

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am indeed delighted to be with such a group of distinguished persons who have an enduring interest in the unravelling growth story of the States of our country. I offer my heartiest congratulations to all the ‘State of the states’ award winners. The summation of your collective commitment to growth and development is what is driving India forward. India’s growth story is an anthology of the growth stories of its states. 

I congratulate India Today Group for doing this survey year after year, promoting a healthy competition among our states. This is not only an acknowledgement but also celebration of the social and economic development across the country. The Media often hold the politicians and bureaucrats accountable for the things that go wrong. Let us take this time to appreciate the countless things that they do right and their contributions towards development and public welfare.

India is progressing at a very fast pace and at the centre of this growth story are the states. It has almost become a cliché to say that the real drivers of growth in India are the states. In all the states which have emerged winners tonight, the agenda of development has formed the fulcrum of political and administrative philosophy. 

The Chief Ministers of the states, their able colleagues and faceless bureaucrats who have worked as catalysts in channelizing the efforts of all stakeholders towards achieving inclusive and sustainable development deserve to be applauded. 

Sixteen years ago, when India Today recognized the increasing role of states in India’s transformation and started this ambitious task of measuring the pace of their growth, the emphasis was still on a centralized planning for the entire country. The states were provided with a road map that they had to follow. 

Today, the states can determine their own destiny. The Centre-state relationship has moved from that of a donor and receiver. Competitive federalism and cooperative federalism have become integral parts of our political lexicon. 

According to Granville Austin, the Constitution of India was perhaps the first constituent body to embrace, from the start what was called cooperative federalism. Chief Justice Beg called the Constitution 'amphibian', in the sense that it can move either on the federal or on the unitary plane, according to the needs of the situation and circumstances of a case. Federalism and cultural and ethnic pluralism have given the country's political system the much needed agility. However, continuation of the same requires not simply federalism, but cooperative and constructive federalism. 

The spirit of cooperative federalism inspired Sardar Vallabhai Patel's intelligent and proactive political manoeuvring by which he successfully persuaded the 492 princely states to join the Indian Union, all the while successfully maintaining the unity and integrity of the nation. Since then, cooperative federalism has been India’s mantra for centre-state unity, cohesion and harmony. 

Friends, I believe that we live in the times of pragmatic federalism. Our country is a complex one. Its vast size, the variability in its geographical features, thousands of languages, the overwhelming variety and diversity that exists in culture, traditions and ways of life make Indian a great developmental challenge. 

This is the reason why ‘Delhi dictated’ dole outs fail to work after a point in time. Decentralization of decision making and devolution of resources to states and local self governments is the only way out to fulfil the development needs of India. The same logic inspired the formalization of the Panchayati Raj system in 1992.

It is heartening to note that the government too has recognized the need to empower our states. The disbanding of the Planning Commission and the creation of the NITI Aayog by a resolution of the Union Cabinet on 1st January 2015 was a right step in this direction. NITI Aayog acts as the quintessential platform of the Government of India to bring States to act together in national interest, and thereby fosters Cooperative Federalism. 

It performs the role of a ‘friend, philosopher and guide’ to the states in their quest for growth and development. It serves as a think tank and toils to provide developmental strategies, frameworks, innovations and new ideas to states so that they can set their own priorities and goals and chart their own paths to achieve these goals. 

Development is a collective process and several factors determine the pace of it. Development also does not always make noise and often does not find space in front pages and prime times.

Take organic agriculture, for instance. India has around 30 per cent of the world’s organic farmers—the highest in the world. Yet, we fail to tell the story of these farmers. If we must debate and find solutions to bring an end to farmers’ distress farmers, we must popularize such success stories which has the potential to inspire millions of farmers across the country. 

Recently, Sikkim just beat entries from more than 50 countries, including agricultural innovation hubs such as Denmark, to win a major United Nations award for its status as an organic food-only destination. The national media must tell this incredible story of Sikkim’s success to the rest of the country so that many more such stories are written in every corner of India.

India’s development story has some worrying trends too, specially the socio-economic disparity among the states. Five states in India—Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka—account for more than 45 per cent of the country’s GDP. In 1960, the top three states were 1.7 times richer than the bottom three. By 2014, this gap had almost doubled, with the top three States being three times richer than the bottom three. 

In the past couple of decades, the main drivers of growth have also been the west and south. Of course the national Capital is an exception. According to 1911 Census, eight of India’s 20 largest cities—Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur, Agra, Allahabad, Patna, Bareilly and Meerut—were from India’s northern region. And Bangalore was a small town then. Today, Indian cities account for nearly 65 per cent of the country’s GDP but most of the major growth canters are in the west or south leaving a gap in the northern half of the country and Bangalore is one of India’s top five cities. 

The prosperous south and west have a relatively high per capita GDP and lower population growth, while the north and east have low per capita GDP and higher population growth. The northern region, despite political will and resurgent human capital, also gets trapped in the vicious cycle of poor infrastructure, which results in low investment generation. Without big investment, large traditional employment-creating industries such as manufacturing plants, organized services, and IT and IT-enabled services are not possible. Absence of these industries slows down infrastructure development, which eventually keeps the cycle going. The challenge to the political leadership is to break free from this cycle. 

One of the major policy initiatives in recent times, which have given a big boost to state’s economic liberty, is the new revenue sharing model between the Centre and the states. The government accepted the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission to raise the share of states in central taxes to 42 per cent from 32 per cent. This is helping the states to break free.

The states, which were relatively more dependent on Central government grants, were expected to face the heat but a World Bank report published in July 2016 estimated that overall effect of this new revenue sharing model on state finances in 2015-16 had been positive, as the reduction in grants was smaller than expected.

Economically stronger states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu had small gains while gains were higher in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. States such as Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana spent over 50 per cent of their additional resources on health, education, and infrastructure. All the states together spent 30 per more than the Central government in 2015-16. State expenditure grew faster than central expenditure between 2012 and 2017. 

The need now is to bring an end to the disparity in the tax net. Ten Indian states—Haryana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan accounted for 88 percent of the total direct tax collection in FY18. These are the states, which will have to function as the employment generation centres for the country as well. 

With a rapidly rising working age population, India would need about 100 million jobs till 2026, a recent study has revealed. Of these, around 80 per cent or 78 million jobs will have to be generated in just 10 states—Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar and Assam— that account for 62 per cent of our population. 

Uttar Pradesh has always played a key role in India’s political destiny, but here is the time that the state’s leadership can transform India’s economic fortune too. Take this example from the study—if Uttar Pradesh’s economy remains “business as usual”, it will create about 6 million jobs till 2026. It needs to create a little over 24 million jobs. That’s where the challenge lies for one of India’s most politically significant states. 

As I was examining the winners in both “best performing” and “most improved” category, I found that the traditionally laggard states in “best performing” category are the ones showing fastest growth. The top seven most improved states—Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar—are at the bottom of the other table. 

In fact, if we look at the growth rates of the states, BIMARU states such as Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are clocking nearly 10 per cent growth rate, often higher than economic behemoth such as Maharashtra and Punjab. A tiny state like Puducherry has been consistently growing at over 10 per cent. 

In the story of economic development, as in various other aspects of life, the higher you climb the steeper is the climb, which eventually slows down the pace. For the traditional table toppers, it becomes difficult to maintain the same rate of growth of the new risers. It’s therefore encouraging to see as many as 27 out of the 31 states and UTs examined for the India Today State of the States survey have been awarded across multiple categories. That explains the intensity of competition among the states.

Our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Bhai Modi said that, “Federalism is no longer the fault line of Centre-State relations but the definition of a new partnership of Team India. Citizens now have the ease of trust, not the burden of proof and process. Businesses find an environment that is open and easy to work in”. 

We have a tremendous responsibility placed upon us, the task of building a ‘Team India’, a resurgent India, a strong India where the states work seamlessly, in harmony, complementing and compensating each other, even while competing with each other. Constructive consensus is the need of the and not disruptive confrontation.  

States must focus on long term economic model for the betterment of the people and not settle for short-term populist measures. The relationship between the states and the centre must be built on Trust, Transparency and mutual respect. Both parties should practice openness and should not be limited by narrow political divisiveness. There is an agenda greater than politics before all of us, the agenda of taking development to the last man, the goal of ensuring Antyodaya. 

Political differences should end with the elections, after which the ruling party should not be bogged down by dilatory tactics and the opposition parties must be given the space to offer constructive criticism in the legislature. A measure of accommodative openness must be practiced by both the centre and the states if we are to build a strong team India where every voice has its own space. 

Once again, congratulations to all the winners and best of luck for next year to all who could not make it to the top this time.

 

Jai Hind!

                Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu said that the nation must leverage the talents and skills of the young and educated by realizing the demographic advantage of having 65 per cent of the population below the age of 35 years.

This is the most appropriate time for India to leverage the opportunity and leap frog in development parameters by overcoming challenges such as poverty, hidden hunger and economic inequalities, he said, while addressing the gathering after presenting the National Academy of Sciences, India (NASI) and Elsevier awards 2018 aimed at promoting scientific excellence among youngsters, at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi, today.

Shri Naidu said that the Indian Science fraternity must play a pivotal role and make India one of the top nations in Science & Technology to improve people’s lives.

‘Advancement of Science and Technology and an inclusive approach to development is crucial in addressing challenges such as poverty, illiteracy, gender discrimination and others’, he said and added that a nation cannot become developed unless these issues are addressed.

Vice President called upon the young scientists to find solutions to the present and emerging challenges faced by the world such as climate change, global warming, sustainable development, clean energy and water and diseases.

‘Only science can throw up solutions for the present and emerging problems in the years to come. The onus lies on the shoulders of the young scientific community to look for a way out for such pressing tribulations’, he said.

Vice President appealed to various corporate bodies and industries to promote scientific research in the country in a big way by creating an exclusive corpus for encouraging innovative R & D projects and disruptive technologies that could provide long-lasting answers to problems faced by the people.

At the same time, he also called for enhanced investments in Science & Technology to support innovations which would address issues relating to agriculture, environment, health, housing, clean drinking water and security, among others.

Saying that the children and youth must develop scientific attitude, starting from school days, the Vice President stressed the need to create the right eco-system in universities and scientific institutions for research to thrive. He added that there was every need to kindle interest in science among school children by adopting innovative teaching methods.

Shri Naidu opined that as a growing nation, India cannot afford to ignore the importance of rankings of educational institutions. ‘While we have seen significant growth in research activities across India, our universities are still not able to feature in top 100 due to a variety of reasons’, he added.

He said that one must understand that there is a direct correlation between competitiveness and excellence, at the same time we need to focus on the societal impact of the scientific activities as well.

The Scopus Young Scientist Awards are part of an Elsevier’s global initiative to support early career researchers in their quest to advance the frontiers of science across a broad range of disciplines. In 2009, India officially adopted the program within its scientific community through Elsevier's collaboration with the National Academy of Sciences, India.

These awards are given in five categories - Women in Science, agriculture, Plant Sciences and Rural Development, Environmentally Sound Sustainable Development, Biomedical Research and Healthcare and Innovation in Engineering and Physical Sciences.

Shri. Saurabh Sharma, Vice President, APAC, Elsevier, Shri. Gino Ussi, Executive Vice President, Elsevier BV and other dignitaries bore witness to the ceremony.

                The Vice-President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today cautioned against upsetting the delicate balance of powers between the executive, judiciary and legislature saying that encroachment by one organ into the domain of another would set bad precedents and weaken the institutions. 

He was addressing the gathering at a function to commemorate the 104th birth anniversary of Justice V R Krishna Iyer organized by Capital Foundation here. On the occasion, he also presented Life-Time Achievement Award to former Union Minister, Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi, Justice Kuldip Singh Award to former Supreme Court Judge, Vikramjit Sen and National Award Dr. Gunna Rajender Reddy, a well-known Gandhian and Chairman of AP & Telangana Gandhi Global Family. The awards were instituted by Capital Foundation.

He said: “ While much can be said for and against judicial activism, I feel that the delicate balance of powers between different wings should not be disturbed”.

Observing that the founding fathers of our Constitution had clearly demarcated the roles and responsibilities of the executive, judiciary and the legislature for the smooth functioning of our democracy, he pointed out that over the years our institutions have stood the test of the time. “There has been no major conflict or friction among the three organs and this mutual respect for each other’s powers, roles and responsibilities has acted as a fulcrum in strengthening our democracy”, the Vice President asserted.

Expressing confidence that the same healthy trend would continue in future, Shri Naidu stated that any confrontation, interference or overstepping by any organ would be detrimental to the growth and progress of our country.

To buttress his viewpoint, the Vice President also quoted Justice Krishna Iyer, who in 2007 had stated: “There is a case today for amity among the trinity of state instrumentalities and better coordination among them in civilizing the justice process. More coordination among the troika in civilizing the justice process is welcome.”

Shri Naidu said “It should be our concern and collective endeavor to strengthen judiciary, legislature and the executive, not weaken them. We should ensure that the public confidence is not eroded in these institutions”, he added.

Declaring that the institutional structures established over the years were intended to translate the vision of our Constitution-makers into tangible reality, the Vice President observed that they needed to be constantly nourished through a far-sighted, liberal leadership.   

Stating that we are at the cusp of India’s transformation into a major economic power, he affirmed that the judiciary can play a critical role in accelerating India’s transformation and in ensuring that justice is delivered speedily, transparently and dispassionately.

While referring to ‘overburdened’ judiciary with cases at all levels, the Vice President pointed out that the huge number of vacancies was one of the main reasons for it. 

Calling for stepping up the pace of reforming the legal system, Shri Naidu suggested that the judiciary and the legislature must get together to ensure “ there is a hastened, transparent process of filling up all the vacancies by recruiting persons with the right credentials”.

Expressing his great appreciation for Justice Krishna Iyer, the Vice President said that Justice Iyer’s eminence and scholarship in jurisprudence is unquestionably second to none. He added that Justice Krishna Iyer’s illustrious career was so diverse that he faced challenges and at the same time had opportunities to reform the society.  

Shri. Naidu said that Justice Krishna Iyer wrote many judgments that had positive effects on social order and added that his life as an MLA, Minister, Lawyer, Jurist and Human Rights Crusader has been inspirational to all of us.

Eminent jurist Fali S Nariman presided over the event, which was attended by legal luminaries and others.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Mahatma Gandhi is one of the greatest revolutionaries the world has ever seen, only his revolutions were bloodless and peaceful. He was addressing the Commemorative Event of 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, organized by FICCI – Aditya Birla CSR Centre for Excellence, here today. 

The Vice President said that six decades had passed since Mahatma Gandhi left his earthly abode, yet, his teachings remain fresh in the memory of his countrymen. He congratulated FICCI and Indian Industry for organizing such an event to celebrate the life and times of the Mahatma. He expressed hope that many more such events would happen so that the Mahatma’s great vision for the world is recalled, relived and taken to the generation after generation. 

Shri Naidu observed that Gandhiji’s principles of liberty, dignity and equality were not limited by space and time, they have universal applicability and timeless value. He preached peace, non- violence, tolerance and harmony, and in the process, miraculously inspired India’s great struggle for freedom and gave new impetus to civil rights movements all over the world, he added.

The Vice President opined that the designing and implementing programs and policies for development should be done by keeping the vision articulated by Mahatma Gandhi for an India free from poverty, discrimination and social evils in mind. He said that Gandhi Ji was an ardent believer in the principle of self-reliance and added that he constantly spoke about “Swadeshi”. He yearned to build self-sufficient ‘Adarsh Villages’ and he said that the soul of India rested in its villages. It is time we honor his wishes & go back to our villages, Shri. Naidu added. 

The Vice President recalled that Gandhi ji firmly believed that Cleanliness was next to Godliness. He felt that sanitation was more important than political freedom and today, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a mass movement of such scale and energy that it would have made the Mahatma himself very proud, he added. 

Shri Naidu said that Gandhiji believed in equality & relentlessly spoke of women empowerment. He reminisced that Gandhiji himself was influenced by iconic women like Annie Besant & Sarojini Naidu. He urged the policy makers of India to place gender equality and women’s empowerment at the centre of our development agenda.

The Vice President remarked that Antyodaya or the uplifting of the poorest, most deprived groups of people, was a mission close to the Mahatma’s heart. “Gandhiji's idea of development was of Sarvodaya, the development of all through Antyodaya. His philosophy of Antyodaya influenced leaders like Shri. Deen Dayal Upadhyay”, he added. 

The Vice President urged one and all to strive together to realise Gandhiji’s dreams and usher in a ‘Ram Rajya’ where all are equal and there is no discrimination of any kind. He quoted the Mahatma who said that “Ramrajya of my dream ensures equal rights alike of prince and pauper”. 

The Chairperson, FICCI, Smt. Rajeshree Birla, the Chairman, KVIC, Dr. Vinai Kumar Saxena, the Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation, Shri Parameshwaran Iyer and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am happy to be here today on this momentous occasion as we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of our nation. Six decades have passed since this pious soul left his earthly abode. Yet, his principles, his sacrifices and his teachings remain fresh in the memory of his countrymen.

For decades, Gandhiji has directed India’s collective conscience and served as our moral compass. I firmly believe that the wisdom he imparted will help India navigate its way through the complexities of the modern world for centuries more to come.

Let me congratulate the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for organizing such an event to celebrate the life and times of the Mahatma. Many more such events should happen so that the Mahatma’s great vision for the world is recalled, relived and taken to the next generation. 

Gandhiji’s principles of liberty, dignity and equality are not limited by space and time. They have universal applicability and timeless value. He preached peace, non- violence, tolerance and harmony, and in the process, miraculously inspired India’s great struggle for freedom and gave new impetus to civil rights movements all over the world.

“All my actions have their rise in my inalienable love of mankind….  I have known no distinction between relatives and strangers, countrymen and foreigners, white and coloured, Hindus and Indians of other faiths …. I have ceased to hate anybody”. This, in brief, sums up Gandhi’s philosophy of life.

Mahatma Gandhi is one of the greatest revolutionaries the world has ever seen, only his revolutions were bloodless and peaceful. He struggled against injustice by practicing justice, he struggled against violence non-violently, he opposed discrimination by embracing one and all. 

He firmly believed that ‘an eye for an eye would end up making the whole world blind’. His resoluteness and steadfastness when it came to standing by his principles of truth and non violence inspired great world leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela among many others. 

He often said that “non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. it is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man”.

Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights hero of the United States of America, who adopted non-violence as the weapon of choice to help millions of African Americans fight for their rights once remarked, “Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactic”. He viewed Gandhi’s philosophy of non-violence and peaceful resistance as the only logical and moral approach in the struggle for justice and progress.

Nelson Mandela often cited Gandji ji as one of his great teachers and acknowledged that Gandhi’s ideas had played a vital role in South Africa’s transformation, aiding in the overthrow of apartheid.

Friends, Gandhiji envisioned a self-reliant India, a country that occupies a place of pride and dignity in the world order. Over time, it has been the endeavor of various governments to fulfil the dreams of our forefathers of a strong, vibrant and inclusive India. 

It is commendable that the current government has launched an array of ambitious nation building initiatives with a view to fulfill the Mahatma’s vision. 

While designing and implementing programs and policies for development, it will serve us well to keep the vision articulated by Mahatma Gandhi for an India free from poverty, discrimination and social evils in mind. 

Gandhi Ji was an ardent believer in the principle of self-reliance. He constantly spoke about “swadeshi”.  He yearned to build self- sufficient and harmonious ‘Adarsh Villages’. He believed that the soul of India rested in its villages. To him, Khadi was not just a political icon or a symbol of national pride, it was also a way to empower the rural economy. 

Today we see a disturbing trend of distress migration from rural to urban areas. Our rural economy is weak and fails to provide enough opportunities for livelihood. It is time India honors the Mahatma’s wishes and goes back to its villages. Real growth will happen in India when we are able to empower rural India, especially our farmers, our weavers and our craftsmen.

Gandhi ji firmly believed that Cleanliness was next to Godliness. His statement that sanitation was more important than political independence clearly reflected the huge importance he attached to cleanliness. He also stated that a lavatory should be as clean as a drawing room.

He always lead by example and practiced cleanliness himself first before preaching it. During the last few years, the whole of our country united for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a mass movement of such scale and energy that it would have made the Mahatma himself very proud.

We have together built close to 9 crore toilets in the last 4 years! Cleanliness and good sanitation are essential prerequisites for development. At this juncture, I applaud the contributions made by the private sector companies and organizations like FICCI towards the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. 

All through his life, Gandhi ji insisted on acquiring better and higher skills. He said, “If I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.” He himself practiced the pursuit of skill in whatever he did. Today, when we talk about the gap between what industry demands and what our education system provides, the necessity for skills training becomes evident.

We sit on a huge demographic opportunity today. 65% of our population is less than 35 years old. In order to reap this demographic dividend, we have to undertake massive skilling drives to make our people, especially the youth more employable and more productive. We also need to teach our young people the dignity of labor, that every job is important, has its own relevance and is dignified. 

Gandhiji was an ardent believer in equality and relentlessly spoke of women empowerment. Gandhiji himself was influenced by iconic women. His mother Pultibai, his wife Kasturba and others like Annie Besant and Sarojini Naidu influenced him greatly.

Gandhi ji said that ‘Women is the companion of man, gifted with equal mental capacity’. Even while Indian women continue to lead in different walks of life ranging from sports to space, manufacturing to entrepreneurship and arts to innovation, we are yet to fully instill a sense of gender equality in the nation.

I urge all the planners and policy makes of our country to place gender equality and women’s empowerment at the center of every single social and economic development plan.

Gandhiji also stood for principles of inclusion, diversity and equity. Gandhi ji lived his life to empower his countrymen to fight social and economic exclusion. Bapu always asked us to think of the last person in the queue, the poorest person, and serve the underprivileged.

His famous Talisman comes to mind now. He said ""I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man /woman whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him /her?” This quote expresses his deep concern for the oppressed, suppressed people of India who do not have access to the basic necessities of life. 

Antyodaya or the uplifting of the poorest, most deprived groups of people, was also a mission close to the Mahatma’s heart. Gandhiji's idea of development was of Sarvodaya, the development of all through Antyodaya. His philosophy of Antyodayagreatly influenced leaders like Shri. Deen Dayal Upadhyay. Antyodaya was at the core of Shri Upadhyay's philosophy of Integral Humanism. The philosophy of Antyodaya is still one of the guiding principles of India’s socio- economic development policies.

उन्होंने स्वराज को भी भारतीय दृष्टिकोण से परिभाषित किया। उन्होंने कहा था"" मेरे सपनों का स्वराज गरीबों का स्वराज है""। और आगे कहा कि "" मुझे किंचित भी संदेह नहीं कि वो स्वराज पूर्ण स्वराज नहीं है जब तक उसके अधीन आपको ये सुविधाएं सुनिश्चित नहीं की जाए।

आज के दिन हम महात्मा के शांति, सत्य के प्रति निष्ठा, अहिंसा, ट्रस्टीशिप, अपने परिवेश, शरीर, विचारों की शुचिता, समानता और सामाजिक न्याय जैसे आदर्शों के प्रति अक्षरशः मन , कर्म, वचन से संकल्पबद्ध हो कर उन्हें श्रद्धांजलि अर्पित करें। आइए, हम उन शाश्वत गांधीवादी मूल्यों जिनके केंद्र में ट्रस्टीशिप हो,को अपने जीवन और कार्यों में उतारने का साझा संकल्प लें।

Let us all strive together to realise Gandhiji’s dreams and usher in a ‘Ram Rajya’ where all are equal and there is no discrimination of any kind. 

“Ramrajya of my dream ensures equal rights alike of prince and pauper”, observed the Mahatma. 

I congratulate FICCI for this is timely initiative to undertake a series of initiatives to blaze forth the message of Mahatma. It was at your 4th AGM in 1931 that Gandhi ji said “The Industry should regard themselves as trustees and servants of the poor”.

I must also applaud the efforts of Aditya Birla group for espousing the trusteeship concept in the core values of your organization. Smt Rajashree Birla, the noble initiatives being held under your guidance are extremely appreciable. I am confident that today’s donation by your group for distribution of Charkhas will surely make a difference and impact the livelihoods at grass root level. I pray that India be blessed with the wisdom of Gandhi today, tomorrow and for generations to come.

Jai Hind!”

                “You have been lucky enough to gain education from this great university. But on this day, spare a thought to those young people who did not get such an opportunity in spite of deserving it. It is upto us to take the benefits of education and the opportunities it opens up to the last mile” the Vice President of India Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu told the graduating students of the University of Delhi. He was addressing the 95th Annual Convocation the University of Delhi, here today. 

 

The Vice President congratulated the University and said that that the vision and mission of the University truly reflected its long term commitment to nation building and an unflinching adherence to universal human values. He added that the motto of the University, ‘Nishtha Dhriti Satyam’, Dedication, Steadfastness and Truth justly reflected its ideals. Congratulating all the graduating students and prize winners, especially the young women, the Vice President appreciated the University’s focus on women’s education.  

 

Shri Naidu observed that India had undertaken a long and arduous, yet rewarding journey in the field of education, from the “Guru –Shishya parampara” of learning under the shadow of a tree in the ancient times, to becoming the third largest in the world in the field of higher education.

 

The Vice President tasked the Universities of India with the responsibility of moulding young people into productive, enlightened citizens. Reminding everyone that India’s aim is inclusive and sustainable development, the Vice President said that the path to reach this goal had to be paved by the enterprising, intelligent and resourceful youth of the country.

 

The Vice President expressed his deep concern that the rise in the number of educational institutions in India had not led to corresponding improvement in the quality of education granted in the country. He opined that there was a need to re-engineer our entire education system. He warned that the ‘One size fits all’ approach followed by us so far will not take us anywhere and said that young people should be given the space to think freely. We cannot keep forcing the same syllabus on a student who excels in Science and a student who is a savant in music, he added. He also said that only half the time of a student should be spent in classrooms the rest should be spent in the community, in the playground, in nature and in open air to ensure balanced education.

 

Shri Naidu urged the students to not let their degrees and mark lists limit themselves. He said that those were just foundations and added that what they built from there, what they chose to be and do in life was totally upto them. 

 

The Vice President said that there was a need to restore India’s ancient glory as a prime destination of quality higher education. India was once known as ‘Vishwaguru’ and ours universities were international centers of excellence, he added. He urged the private sector to play a more active role in meeting the demands of higher education and find ways to cross subsidise the education for the poor and the needy.

 

The Vice President said that India today stood at the cusp of an incredible demographic dividend, 65% of its population is below 35 years of age. He went on to add that this prospective demographic dividend could rapidly mutate into a demographic challenge if we fail to educate and skill our vast youth population appropriately, if we are unable to exploit their immense potential efficiently.

 

The Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Shri Satyapal Singh, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof. Yogesh Tyagi, students, faculty and staff of Delhi University and parents were present at the ceremony.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“Dr. Satya Pal Singh, Minister of State, Human Resource Development, Government of India, Professor Yogesh Tyagi, Vice Chancellor, Prof. J.P. Khurana, Pro - Vice Chancellor, Prof. Tarun Kumar Das, Registrar, eminent guests, distinguished members of the University faculty, Dear students, Sisters and Brothers. I am happy to be with you on this auspicious occasion, the 95th Annual Convocation of the University of Delhi.

 

It is my pleasure to be amongst some of the brightest young minds of India, who, with dreams in their eyes, are preparing to carve out a bright future for themselves and for this great country. 

 

It is heartening to note that the University of Delhi, established in 1922 is today a premier educational body of our country with the privilege of a venerable legacy. It is also a proud achievement that it has been ranked No. 1 by US News Global Top University Ranking at the national level.

 

From a modest beginning with just three colleges, two faculty members and 750 students, the University since has grown greatly in status and eminence.  It is now recognized as a premier imparter of higher education catering to the needs of more than 6 lakh students under various streams within the overarching framework of equity, justice and social inclusion. 

 

The well-structured education programmes of the University are widely acknowledged both within India and globally for their innovative teaching-learning pedagogies and modern infrastructural support.

 

It is truly noteworthy that the vision and mission of the University foster its long term commitment to national building and an unflinching adherence to universal human values. The values of the University are truly reflected in its motto: ‘Nishtha Dhriti Satyam’ (Dedication, Steadfastness and Truth).

 

On this 95th Convocation, I congratulate the University of Delhi when it celebrates one more year of success in delivering meaningful and quality education.

 

Dear students,

 

Convocation is always an important event for any academic institution and a significant milestone in your academic growth. 

 

It is a moment of pride and joy for the degree holders and the medal and prize winners present here today. The degrees, medals and prizes earned by all of you are the recognition for your relentless hard work and immense dedication. 

 

It is surely a moment of great pride for your teachers and parents as well. Learning is a never ending process and the firm foundation provided to you by your alma mater will empower you to explore new horizons in your life.

 

This is also a great day for this institution which was your home for the last few years. It has nurtured and nourished you well. It is time that you take flight from its safe and protected premises to find your own place in the world. I hope that the University will add many more names to its glorious list of alumni in the years to come. 

 

Friends, India has undertaken a long and arduous, yet rewarding journey in the field of education, from the “Guru –Shishya parampara” of learning under the shadow of a tree in the ancient times, to becoming the third largest in the world in the field of higher education, next to the United States and China. 

 

India now boasts of having more than 33,000 colleges and 659 universities. The world has realized that the economic success of any nation is directly determined by their education systems. Education is a Nation’s power.

 

India today stands at the cusp of an incredible demographic dividend. 65% of its population is below 35 years of age. But this prospective demographic dividend can rapidly mutate into a demographic challenge if we do not educate and skill this vast youth population appropriately, if we are unable to exploit their immense potential efficiently.

 

The responsibility to mould these young people into productive, enlightened citizens lies with Universities such as this one. India’s aim is inclusive and sustainable development. 

 

The path to reach this goal has to be paved by the enterprising, intelligent and resourceful youth of the country who are well educated and capable of leading the country forward.

 

Education is the main instrument for socio-economic transformation of the nation and lays the foundation for building a knowledge society. “Education is an investment, an educated individual will indeed serve the society”, said Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya.

 

Education means the process by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, and intellect is sharpened, as a result of which one can stand on one’s own feet. True education equips the youth to contribute to the material progress of the country as well as to maintain India’s cultural and spiritual heritage.

 

Friends, it is a matter of grave concern to us that the rise in the number of educational institutions has not lead to corresponding improvement in the quality of education granted in this country. We do produce a large number of graduates and other degree holders but how many of them are well rounded, employable individuals capable of critical, rational thinking? How many of them are equipped enough to deal with the kind of fast paced changes that are happening in the world around?

 

There is a need to re-imagine and re-engineer our entire education system, top down and bottom-up. There has to be a change in the curriculum, teaching methodology, examination system, technology tools used and research. 

 

Our current system of education fails to recognize the innate potential that exists within each student and fails to nurture and develop these unique qualities and capabilities.

 

This ‘One size fits all’ approach got us so far, but will not take us any further. We have to encourage our young people to be curious, to ask questions and to think independently. We cannot keep forcing the same syllabus on a student who excels in Science and a student who is a savant in music.

 

I would urge my young friends here to not let your degrees and mark lists limit you. This is just your foundation. What you build from here, what you choose to be and do in life is totally upto you. Let nothing limit your dreams or restrict your thirst for excellence.

 

You have been lucky enough to gain education from this great university. But on this day, spare a thought to those young people who did not get such an opportunity in spite of deserving it. There an urgent need concretize equity in higher education in India.

 

It is upto us to take the benefits of education and the opportunities it opens up to the last mile, to the last person. We should also take special care when it comes to providing barrier free access to education to our differently abled youngsters. 

 

We need to restore India’s ancient glory as a prime destination of quality higher education. India was once known as ‘Vishwaguru’ and ours universities were international centers of excellence. 

For the country to recapture the past glory, the private sector too will have to play a vital role in meeting the demands of higher education. The private sector must also find ways to cross subsidise the education for the poor and the needy.

 

It is also a cause for concern that there is very little original research coming out of India. For a country as vast and as diverse as India, facing problems ranging from poverty to environmental degradation, innovation is not a luxury but an urgent necessity. 

 

A strong Research eco-system based on a multi-disciplinary approach is necessary for the development of any university. It is good to learn that the research profile of the University of Delhi has seen an upward shift in the last years through quality research driven by the eminent faculty.

 

I am also happy to learn that women comprise a good percentage of the student population in University of Delhi. It is important that young women particularly those belonging to marginal sections gain increase access to the portals of colleges and universities. Women’s empowerment through education will have a positive impact on the society and on our future generation. 

 

The institutions of higher learning play a very important role in inculcating the sense of responsibility, honesty, conscience, justice and above all human values in students. 

 

Dear students:

 

Today as you leave the portals of this institution, I am confident that you will use the intellectual, social and technical skills that you have acquired from the teachers and members of the faculty for the betterment of the nation.

 

As you venture into a new phase in your life and career, I wish you all a rewarding and professionally satisfying career, good health and success in all your endeavors. I also wish University of Delhi and its faculty members all the best in the years ahead. I am sure that the University will set higher and higher standards of excellence in the future.  

 

Thank you!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Innovation is for the betterment of mankind and India is encouraging the spirit of innovation among the educated enterprising youth. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the International Conference ‘Asian Patent Attorneys Association’, here today. The Minister for Law & Justice, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, the Minister for Commerce and Industry, Shri Suresh Prabhu, more than 1350 participants from over 65 countries and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President stressed the need to put in efforts to give meaningful effect to the socio-economic and technological development needs of the poorest of the poor. He further said that knowledge and intellect are the most critical ingredients in development. It was essential to adopt innovative and creative balancing mechanisms, he added. 

The Vice President said that Intellectual Property Rights hold special importance in the knowledge economy. He said that the new regime of intellectual Property Rights bring a paradigm shift in social exchanges and cultural ethos in communities especially at a time when the world had moved away from viewing knowledge as a mere community asset started treating it as intellectual property.

Talking about the changing factors in all economies, the Vice President said that the emphasis on tangible hard assets is being shifted to intangible soft assets and intellectual properties. India fully recognizes that an effective and robust intellectual property protection regime is essential to attract technology, investment, incentivise innovation and creation of IP assets, he added.

The Vice President said that as the communities’ transit to new phase of Intellectual Property based economy, no conversation on intellectual property rights can be complete without considering the balance of the rights and obligations of IP holders and define what constitutes a genuine, path-breaking intellectual property?

Shri Naidu said that Indian patent system contains some built-in safeguards to bring about a balance between rights and obligations – these measures are consistent with TRIPS Agreement. As a member of WTO, India made laws that are compliant with the global regime. National IPR Policy has been approved and published by the government in May 2016, he added.

The Vice President said that India is encouraging the spirit of innovation among the educated enterprising youth by skilling them and supporting through the schemes like Start-Up and MUDRA. He further said that a number of initiatives have been taken by the governments to create an ecosystem that fosters manufacturing and have identified key areas such as auto industry, information technology, aviation, biotechnology, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, electronics and entertainment for innovation and manufacturing, as There is immense scope of technology and investment in these areas.

Saying that Government aims to make India a major hub for end-to-end indigenous drug manufacturing in the next few years, the Vice President said that the IP sensitive, Indian pharmaceuticals industry is expected to expand at a compounded annual growth rate of over 15 per cent to 55 billion US dollars in the next three years.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to be amongst such distinguished assembly of law professionals. I am pleased to learn that more than 1350 participants from over 65 countries are attending this annual conference.

Being a lawyer myself, and given my background in legislature and public policy, it is a pleasure to share my views with this gathering of intellectual property experts.

The issue of intellectual property rights assumes a great significance for us as India in the last few years has emerged as the fastest growing economy in the world. With an expected growth in the range of 7.5% during next few years, as projected by the IMF and the World Bank, we are one of the most preferred destinations for investments in today’s world.

Intellectual Property is one of the most hotly debated topics among policy makers, Governments, legal fraternity, NGOs, academia and research institutions.

In Indian scriptures it is said:

न चोर हार्यम् न च राज हार्यम्।

न भ्रातृभाज्यम् न च भारकारी।।

व्यये कृते वर्धतै नित्यं।

विद्या धनं सर्व धनप्रधानम्।।

“Knowledge is a treasure that cannot be stolen, neither can it be confiscated by the State, nor can it be divided among siblings. It is not burdensome to carry. It increases when we share it with others sharing. Knowledge is a treasure that is better than other riches.”

Like India, in most of the cultures sharing the knowledge was considered sacrosanct. The society took acquisition of knowledge for granted. It was an inherent right of an individual. It was sacrosanct and free.

However, now the world market has begun to realise the value of knowledge and intellect, the most critical ingredients in development. 

We have moved from land-based agricultural economy marked by feudal ownership of land resources to machine based industrialisation. We have witnessed global movements of finance and capital further leading to professionally managed multinational corporations to information and data networks to knowledge economy based on intellectual property.

But like every phase of evolution, the new regime of intellectual Property Rights too brings paradigm shift in social exchanges and cultural ethos in communities. We have moved away from viewing knowledge as a mere community asset.  Knowledge has become an intellectual property.

The key success factors in all economies have changed. Instead of only the tangible hard assets, the emphasis has shifted to intangible soft assets and intellectual properties. Nurturing of intellectual property has emerged as a key determinant of success in the 21st century.

We in India fully recognize that an effective and robust intellectual property protection regime is essential to attract technology, investment, incentivise innovation and creation of IP assets.

Dear sisters and brothers,

We have the desire and capability to absorb new technologies in manufacturing. In our country, ‘Make in India’ is one of the key programmes launched by the government to boost the economy and the aim is to transform India into a global manufacturing hub. The target is to increase this to 25 per cent of the GDP by 2025. 

We have about 65 per cent of the population below 35 years of age, who are looking for the creative avenues for their talent and education. We are encouraging the spirit of innovation among our educated enterprising youth by skilling them and supporting through the schemes like Start-Up and MUDRA.

We have taken a number of initiatives to create an ecosystem that fosters manufacturing and have identified key areas such as auto industry, information technology, aviation, biotechnology, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, electronics and entertainment for innovation and manufacturing. There is immense scope of technology and investment in these areas.

For example, With 900 million mobile telephony subscribers and almost 500 million internet users, Indian market is expected to grow to 400 million US $ market by 2020. There are around 100 mobile and accessories manufacturing units in the country. The policy to digitize economy had led to 300 $ increase in digital transactions over the past few years. 

The IP sensitive, Indian pharmaceuticals industry is expected to expand at a compounded annual growth rate of over 15 per cent to 55 billion US dollars in the next three years.

The Government aims to make India a major hub for  end-to-end indigenous drug manufacturing in the next few years. MedTech industry which has been recognised as a sunrise sector is expected to touch 9.5 billion US dollars by 2022.

To mitigate climate change and global warming, we are focussing on green growth strategies to encourage sustainable development. India is attempting to make a gradual switch to electric vehicles with the government planning to mandate that every car sold in India from the year 2030 to be an electric car.

The transition to a “green economy” is also an attractive and lucrative business opportunity.

Along with rapid industrial development, there have been a number of initiatives and reforms like GST and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,  as a result of which  India’s rankings in the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business” have improved from 130 in 2016 to 77 in 2018.

As the communities transit to new phase of Intellectual property based economy, I am aware that no conversation on intellectual property rights can be complete without a reference to the question: how to balance the rights and obligations of IP holders? What constitutes a genuine, path-breaking intellectual property? One can do a costing of a finished farm/factory product but how to put a realistic price to a research product and for how long? 

The TRIPS Agreement envisages a “mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.” The TRIP Agreement permits its members to adopt appropriate measures “necessary to protect public health and nutrition and to promote the public interest in sectors of vital importance to their socio-economic and technological development”.

Efforts must be made to give meaningful effect to the socio-economic and technological development needs of the poorest of the poor by adopting innovative and creative balancing mechanisms.

Indian patent system contains some built-in safeguards to bring about a balance between rights and obligations – these measures are consistent with TRIPS Agreement. As a member of WTO, we have laws which are compliant with the global regime. National IPR Policy has been approved and published by the government in May 2016.

Friends,

The Indian government’s “Act East” policy seeks to deepen existing relationships with our neighbours in Asia-Pacific region. India enjoys strong economic and cultural relationships with most countries within this region.

I wish you to continue with your good work of promoting and enhancing intellectual property rights worldwide with objectives of serving the interests of owners and users of IP.

I also congratulate APAA (Indian Group) for hosting this meeting in India and providing a platform for intellectual property professionals and practitioners worldwide to exchange ideas and information. I wish you all a great conference and a wonderful stay in our country.

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu stressed on the need to re-imagine and reconstruct the higher education system in tune with the requirements 21st century. While launching Krea University, here today, he underscored those institutes of eminence must aim to ensure all round development of an individual apart from imparting quality education.

The Vice President said that institutions like the Krea University with sights set firmly on the achievement of brilliance and distinction at the global platform must serve us in good stead in our quest for fast track progress and all round development. He called for an impactful coordination of Public-Private Sector in providing such education system. Government should play the role of a strong facilitator and others supplement government’s efforts, he added.

Shri Naidu said that not having enough high quality researchers, and the declining number of students doing PhDs and entering research posts was a concern. A country as populous as India and facing innumerable challenges from poverty to environmental degradation simply cannot do without innovation, he said. Saying that universities should become hubs for innovation, the Vice President said that they must not become breeding grounds for resentment, frustration or discrimination. A university should be a place of enlightenment, a sanctuary of positive thoughts and safe haven of wisdom and knowledge, he added.

Expressing concern that the higher education system in India still lags behind the standards of the world’s best universities, Shri Naidu said that in 2018 too, no Indian university was able to secure a place in the top 100 best universities in the QS World University Ranking. American and European universities still rule the list, he said.

The Vice President said that Indian Universities face a number of problems starting from shortage of funds to inadequate number of teachers to falling enrollment numbers. The profusion more rewarding career choices, lack of adequate facilities for post graduate education and the retirement of the current generation of professors and teachers has created a staff crunch in our centers of higher education, he added. 

Shri Naidu said that the demand for skilled manpower in India predicted to be 700 million by 2022 and India must equip the young and students with employable skills. Such steps would not only allow us to realize the demographic dividend but also help India become the ‘skill capital' of the world, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am extremely happy to be here today with all of you at the Krea University launch ceremony. It is heartening to know that at the core of this university’s philosophy lies a pioneering paradigm of Interwoven Learning, weaving together thought with action, technology with humanities, arts with sciences, and ultimately, learnings of the past with preparedness for the future. 

As I have said on numerous occasions before, India is at a juncture in its history when it simply cannot afford to be mediocre. Excellence should be our goal, our Mantra. We owe it to the billion dreams that propel our country forward to strive and reach the zenith of human potential.

Institutions like the Krea University with sights set firmly on the achievement of brilliance and distinction at the global platform will doubtlessly serve us in good stead in our quest for fast track progress and all round development.

We stand at an inflexion point in human history. We are witnessing technological advancements unfold at a breakneck pace. Machine intelligence is getting better by the day. Genetic engineering now allows us to experiment with the basic building blocks of our biology. At the same time, rapid economic development has taken a toll on our environment. Our cities struggle to provide basic amenities such as clean air and potable water to residents.

Amidst such flux, institutions like Krea University must emerge as fountainheads of innovation, laying the pathway to a secure and prosperous future for humanity.

India is uniquely poised to be at the epicenter of these developments. We are endowed with a demographic dividend unmatched by any other country in the world today, 65% of our population is below 35 years of age. If we are to tap the full potential of our young and continually expanding labor force, we must fundamentally re-imagine our approach to higher education.

The regulatory environment in India today is conducive to the establishment of great universities. Universities enjoy greater autonomy based on their accreditation score or performance in international rankings. These universities are given the freedom to start new academic programmes, courses, off-campus centers and research parks. The universities may hire the best faculty and admit students from anywhere in the world, and enter into international agreements and partnerships.

In such an environment, new institutions of excellence such as Krea University may be established and encouraged to set global benchmarks of excellence and innovation. 

Krea University is one such groundbreaking initiative, which is the the brainchild of some of the finest academic and industrial minds in our country today. I am pleased to learn that at Krea, all students would undergo an inter-disciplinary core curriculum in the first year so that the students of Science would learn some literature, and those of arts would develop comfort with data and the scientific method.

I was told that Krea places special focus on inclusivity by providing scholarships to meritorious students who do not have the means to pay fees. I congratulate Krea for its commitment to promoting equity in education. Excellent infrastructure, a sprawling campus, faculty members who have been trained at some of the best universities of the world and a professional governing body composed of prominent leaders of the corporate world make Krea the University of the future.

It is truly noteworthy that Krea University, in partnership with the Dalai Lama Center for Ethics, aims to instill in its graduates a sense of purpose and a moral compass that keeps them steadfast as they navigate the complexities of the 21st century.

The education system in India has been facing a number of challenges for a long time now. India is set to become one of the youngest nations in the world by 2030 with close to a 140 million people set to enter the college-age group. Under such circumstances, India has to empower its institutions of higher education to live up to its aims of delivering world-class scholarship and education.

Strong ambitions notwithstanding, the higher education system in India still lags behind the standards of the world’s best universities. In 2018 too, no Indian university was able to secure a place in the top 100 best universities in the QS World University Ranking. American and European universities still rule the list.

Indian Universities face a number of problems starting from shortage funds to inadequate number of teachers to falling enrollment numbers.

The profusion more rewarding career choices, lack of adequate facilities for post graduate education and the retirement of the current generation of professors and teachers has created a staff crunch in our centers of higher education. 

India has always been a nation of great teachers. The best of our practitioners, the most intelligent of our scientists and the most versatile of our philosophers and thinkers often turned to teaching. Institutions like Krea University serve to make the profession of teaching a rewarding one, so that the best of our minds are engaged in the critical task of molding our youth and casting our lustrous future. 

The gross enrolment rate of college-aged people in tertiary education is also a cause for grave concern. The country’s Gross Enrolment Ratio or GER in higher education was 25.2% in 2016-17 while China stands at 43.39% and USA’s at 85.8%.

The indulgent system which regulates higher educational institutions in India has also lead to the mushrooming of hundreds of privately set-up colleges offering a poor quality education in India in order to turn a profit.

It has been noticed that students graduating from a number of universities and colleges are struggling to find work since they are not employable. But one can take heart from the fact that employability is rising, albeit slowly. Universities should try to create associations with industries and companies, understand the need of the industries and update curriculum accordingly to boost employability.  

The demand for skilled manpower in India predicted to be 700 million by 2022. Disruptive new technologies, like artificial intelligence, robotics and machine learning will certainly alter business prototypes. Firms will have two choices, either to develop an astute technology orientation or perish.  

Accordingly, our skilling ecosystem should also undergo a pattern shift to cater to the ‘skills of future' as well as to ensure that enough jobs are created. India has every opportunity to be the future ‘skill capital' of the world.  Krea University’s curriculum is designed in conjunction with industry, specifically to prepare students for the jobs and lives of the future.

It is also important that we promote student exchanges and host international students from around the world. The revenue this brings is only of secondary importance to us. What is primary is that international students help in creating a much more robust and comprehensive learning environment. They bring in diverse views and experiences and encourage their counterparts to nurture perspectives which are diametrically opposite to the ones that they are familiar with.

The collaborative learning environment created under such circumstances help in making our students much more adaptable and cosmopolitan. It will also be a great boost to India’s soft power in the world.

Hopefully with schemes such as ‘Study in India’ we will soon attract many more foreign students to India’s universities. 

Future relationships and strong friendships between nations would be created and cemented and world peace and brotherhood would be forged right here in our universities.

It is crucial that we re-imagine and reconstruct our higher education system. The autonomy of universities cannot be compromised under any circumstance. The government should play the role of a strong facilitator when it comes to universities. They should be allowed to develop their own curricula and their won system of examinations. A strong, accomplished and professional management body for universities coupled with adequate funding is the need of the hour.

It is also a cause for concern that India does not have enough high quality researchers, and that the number of students doing PhDs and entering research posts is on the decline. A country as populous as India and facing innumerable challenges from poverty to environmental degradation simply cannot do without innovation.

The objective of a university should not just be restricted to imparting quality education, but to ensure all round development of an individual.

Universities should be hubs for innovation, a safe space for future visionaries and entrepreneurs to sharpen their skills. They should not be breeding grounds for resentment, frustration or discrimination.

A university should be a place of enlightenment, a sanctuary of positive thoughts and safe haven of wisdom and knowledge.

It should be a melting pot of cultures and traditions, an oasis of youthful energy and vitality and an asylum for vibrant dreams.

Krea University promises to be all this and more.  I wish Krea University all success, and hope that it will inspire many such universities to invigorate our thinking and lay the building blocks of a new paradigm that sets us on the path to becoming a world leader in higher learning, the celebrated ‘Vishwaguru’ yet again.

 

Thank you, Jaihind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that world nations, led by the UN, should arrive at a consensus in refusing shelter to economic fugitives and create a framework for Extradition Treaties and exchange of information on black money. He was delivering keynote address after presenting Economic Times Awards 2018 for Corporate Excellence, in Mumbai today. The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley, the Union Minister for Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

The Vice President called upon Corporate India and Banks to collectively work to ensure that every rupee is put to the most productive use. Congratulating the award winners, the Vice President said that these awards were indicators of the crucial role played by India inc. in the country’s onward journey towards becoming an economic superpower.

 

Expressing great optimism in India’s dream of becoming a $ 10 trillion economy soon, the Vice President highlighted several indicators of policy success such as the rise in the Direct Tax collection from Rs.6.38 lakh crore in 2013-14, to Rs.10.02 lakh crore in 2017-18, an increase of 57 per cent in four years.

 

Stressing that there is no place for ‘loot and scoot’ approach, the Vice President sought for constant vigilance, effective supervision and timely action to bring economic offenders and financial fugitives to justice so that the financial system can be restored to good health. He added that bad loans had crippled many banks in the country and expressed hope that this situation would be resolved quickly.

 

The Vice President said that while our economy is poised for unprecedented growth, there are two important dimensions that we should not lose sight of—one is ‘equity’ and the second is ‘ethics’. Highlighting corporate India’s role in national development, Shri Naidu said that real growth would be achieved only through a strong partnership between government and private enterprises.

 

Shri Naidu said that demonetization and Goods and Service Tax have spurred opportunities and growth and have ushered in digitalization, formalization and integration of the economy despite facing some teething troubles in the beginning. 

 

The Vice President said that economic growth must create avenues for more and more people to realize their potential. Calling for democratization of such economic opportunity, instructed industrial groups and various companies to adopt an inclusive approach so that the right ecosystem is created in the new India for everybody to realize his or her potential. 

 

The Vice President explained that a level playing field, a facilitative institutional structure and a sound regulatory framework were essential ingredients for success. He added that innovation, efficiency and technological progress were the key tools to build a new India. 

 

The Vice President asked the India Inc. to be at the forefront of the transformation where ethics and economics go hand-in-hand. He also asked corporate India to focus on revitalizing agriculture as more than 60 per cent of our population depended upon agriculture for livelihood. 

 

Recalling the widespread appreciation for India’s growth story he experienced during his visit to Africa and Latin America, the Vice President said that world was looking towards India with great confidence for investment, technology and innovations. He further said that India should shun the politics of populism and move towards politics of pragmatism which will benefit society in the long term. ‘Freebies are not a solution’, he warned.

 

The Vice President also urged private companies and business houses to increase their CSR activities and earmark funds beyond what has been stipulated by the government for social good. 

 

The Vice President gave away the Business Leader of the year Award to the Managing Director, Bajaj Finserv, Shri Sanjiv Bajaj, the Company of the year Award to HDFC Bank, the Emerging Company of the year Award to Page Industries, the Entrepreneur of the year Award to the noted entrepreneur in the Indian renewable energy sector, Shri Sumant Sinha, the Global Indian of the year Award to the Indian American business executive, and the CEO of Adobe Systems, Shri Shantanu Narayen, the Lifetime Achievement Award to the Chairman of the Godrej Group, Shri Adi Godrej, the Business Reformer of the year Award to the Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri K. Chandrashekar Rao, the Policy Change Agent of the year Award to National Payments Corporation of India and the Corporate Citizen of the year Award to Hindustan Unilever.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that every citizen must become change agents in building a more empathetic, caring and harmonious society. He was addressing the gathering after presenting the Jamnalal Bajaj Awards - 2018, in Mumbai today. The Governor of Maharashtra, Shri C. Vidyasagar Rao, the Minister for Higher and Technical Education of Maharashtra, Shri Vinod Tawde and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that Jamnalal Ji’s life and works inspire the younger generation in bringing about reforms and changes in the mindset of people. He appreciated the organizers for felicitating four eminent citizens who have made a difference to the lives of people through their work on environment, disaster mitigation, women and children’s welfare and promotion of peace and non-violence.

Shri Naidu also lauded the contributions of Shri Jamnalal Bajaj and said that he exemplified India’s core philosophy of share and care and strove for women’s empowerment, elimination of untouchability, uplift of the downtrodden and promotion of khadi.

The Vice President said that every citizen of the country must draw inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi and become change agents in building a more empathetic, caring and harmonious society. Gandhiji's thoughts are guiding principles for all of us, he added.

The Vice President said that the new generation must be taught about India's great culture and heritage. There is every need to preserve and protect the culture and traditions of our nation that believes in the core philosophy of Care and Share, he added.

The Vice President said that it is important for every individual to discharge his or her responsibility towards society and the country at large.  He also stressed the need to imbibe the qualities of social responsibility among the citizenry, especially the young.

Shri Naidu said that he was disturbed to learn about the instances of neglect and abuse of the elderly, growing atrocities on women and lack of tolerance to a contrarian viewpoint in the society. He said that such serious social malaises must be tackled in a concerted manner by all the stakeholders - families, communities, NGOs and the government.

The Vice President called for revamp of school curriculum and make it mandatory for children to take part in social service activities. He opined that involvement in social service right from school days would help in inculcating an attitude of sensitivity and empathy among children.

She Naidu also asked private and public sector companies to earmark one day every three months for employees to participate in such activities.

The Vice President presented Jamnalal Bajaj Awards to Gandhian and Social Activist, Shri Dhoom Singh Negi under the 'Constructive Work' category, Ms. Rupal Desai and Mr. Rajendra Desai under the 'Application of Science and Technology for Rural Development' category, Ms. Prasanna Bhandari under 'Development and Welfare of Women and Children' category and Dr. Clayborne Carson from Stanford University for promoting Gandhian values outside India.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""विगत 40 वर्षों से विभिन्न क्षेत्रों में कार्यरत सुविख्यात नागरिकों को उनकी प्रतिष्ठित उपलब्धियों के लिये जमनालाल बजाज पुरस्कारों से सम्मानित किया जा रहा है। राष्ट्र की रचनात्मक मेधा को सम्मानित, प्रोत्साहित करने में इन प्रतिष्ठित पुरस्कारों की महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका रही है। आपके विद्‌वत् निर्णयों के लिये, मैं पुरस्कारों के निर्णायक मंडल का अभिनंदन करता हूँ।

जमनालाल बजाज जी जीवनपर्यन्त गांधीवादी रहे। गांधीजी उन्हें अपना पांचवां पुत्र मानते थे। जमनालाल बजाज जी और उनके परिवार ने गांधी जी के आदर्शों को अपने निजी जीवन और परिवारिक संस्कारों में अपनाया। जमनालाल बजाज जी गांधीजी के आदर्शों का अनुकरण करते हुये अंग्रेजों के विरूद्ध संघर्ष करते रहे साथ ही समाज उत्थान के कार्यों में भी लगे रहे। उनकी पत्नी जानकी देवी जी गोसेवा के प्रति समर्पित रहीं। उन्होंने विनोबा जी के भूदान आंदोलन में भी सक्रिय भूमिका निभाई।

जमनालाल जी के दोनों सुपुत्रों ने परिवार के गांधीवादी संस्कारों का निष्ठापूर्वक निर्वहन किया। आजादी के बाद, कमल नयन जी ने भारत के औद्यौगिकीकरण में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाई। वे रचनात्मक राजनीति में भी सक्रिय रहे और लोकसभा में वर्धा का प्रतिनिधित्व किया। दूसरे पुत्र रामकृष्णजी ने व्यापार और व्यवसाय को सामाजिक सरोकारों से जोड़ा। उनके प्रयासों के फलस्वरूप ही Council for Fair Buisness Practices का गठन हुआ जिससे नैतिक और समाज-निष्ठ व्यावसायिक नीतियों और रीतियों को प्रोत्साहन मिला। ये रामकृष्ण जी के ही प्रयास थे कि जमनालाल बजाज फाउंडेशन की स्थापना हो सकी जिसके तत्वाधान में आज ये पुरस्कार प्रदान किये जा रहे हैं।

यह सचमुच प्रशंसनीय है कि स्वर्गीय जमनालाल बजाज जी की राष्ट्रवादी परंपरा को, आज श्री राहुल बजाज जी के प्रेरक नेतृत्व में उनके परिवार की तीसरी पीढ़ी निष्ठापूर्वक निभा रही है।

Jamnalal Ji was a multifaceted man—a freedom fighter, businessman, social reformer and philanthropist. He exemplified India’s core philosophy of share and care and strove for women’s empowerment, elimination of untouchability, uplift of the downtrodden and promotion of khadi. He returned the title of ‘Rai Bahadur’ conferred on him by the British during the Non-Cooperation Movement.

We need to draw inspiration from socially-conscientious leaders like Jamnalal Bajaj ji in bringing about reforms and changes in the mindset of people. Although caring and sharing is Indian culture’s core philosophy, increasing materialism, receding spiritualism, selfishness, fast-paced lifestyles and the growing trend of nuclear families are making people to adopt an indifferent attitude towards the problems of needy and vulnerable sections of the society.

Instances of neglect and abuse of the elderly, growing atrocities on women and lack of tolerance to a contrarian viewpoint are serious social malaises which need to tackled in a concerted manner by all the stakeholders—families, communities, NGOs and the government.

I am of the opinion that involvement in social service right from school days will help in inculcating an attitude of sensitivity and empathy among children. Perhaps, school curriculum should be revamped to make it mandatory for children to take part in social service activities.

 Similarly, private and public sector companies must earmark one day every three months for employees to participate in such activities.

Be the change you want to see in the world, said Mahatma Gandhi. We all need to become change agents in building a more empathetic, caring and harmonious society.

Everyone might not be inclined or interested to get involved in social service activities. However, it is important for every individual to discharge his or her responsibility towards society and the country at large by observing, for instance, basic environmental protective measures like not using plastic bags or materials.

Only a collective effort by every individual will help save the planet from further environmental degradation and preserve its pristine glory for posterity.    

My heartiest felicitations and congratulations to today’s four distinguished awardees, who have made a difference to the lives of people through their work on environment, disaster mitigation, women and children’s welfare and promotion of peace and non-violence. Also when I take a look at the galaxy of past recipients, it evokes admiration as these men and women have become icons of service and selflessness. Braving scorching heat, shivering cold and pouring rain, they have been tirelessly engaged in the reconstruction of rural India in consonance with Gandhiji’s philosophy and most interestingly stayed away from the glare of media and fame.

मित्रों,

आज, टेहरी गढ़वाल, उत्तराखंड के गांधीवादी सामाजिक कार्यकर्त्ता श्री धूमसिंह नेगी जी को उनके रचनात्मक सामाजिक कार्यों के लिये इस पुरस्कार के लिये चुना गया है। सुश्री रूपल देसाई तथा श्री राजेन्द्र देसाई को ग्रामीण विकास में विज्ञान और तकनीक के प्रयोग के लिये पुरस्कृत किया जा रहा है। सुश्री प्रसन्ना भंडारी और श्री कर्णी नगर विकास समिति, कोटा को महिला एवं बाल कल्याण के क्षेत्र में उनके प्रयासों के लिये पुरस्कृत किया जा रहा है। अमेरिका के मार्टिन लूथर किंग (जूनियर) शोध एवं शिक्षा संस्थान के संस्थापक डा. क्लेबोर्न कार्सन, भारत के बाहर गांधीवादी विचारों के प्रचार प्रसार में महत्वपूर्ण योगदान के लिये गठित अंतराष्ट्रीय पुरस्कार प्राप्त करेंगे।

मैं अपने वक्तव्य के अंत में गांधी जी की प्रसिद्ध उक्ति को उद्‌धृत करना चाहूँगा, गांधीजी ने कहा था ‘स्वयं को खोजने का सर्वश्रेष्ठ मार्ग है कि दूसरों की सेवा में स्वयं को समर्पित कर दो।’

 

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called for a revamp of laws governing cooperative sector in the context of changed techno-economic so that it becomes viable and vibrant enterprise. He was delivering the Laxmanrao Inamdar Memorial Lecture on Cooperatives, organized by Sahakar Bharati, in Mumbai, today. The Governor of Maharashtra, Shri Ch. Vidya Sagar Rao, the Minister for Higher and Technical Education of Maharashtra, Shri. Vinod Tawde and other dignitaries were present on the occasion

The Vice President said that lack of awareness, vagaries of monsoon, lack of access to market and storage facilities is making agriculture un-viable there by forcing people to migrate from rural areas to urban areas. 

The Vice President called up on the cooperative sector to play key role in strengthening rural economy and also help the farmers raise their income. To achieve this, he asked Research institutions and government agencies to support Cooperatives in their efforts to educate farmers and encourage them diversify into allied vocations like horticulture, fishery, bee-keeping, rural logistics and transportation, food processing etc to generate additional income.

The Vice President also asked for an increased focus and attention of authorities, politicians, media, and scientists to make united efforts to improve the lives of people dependent of farming and Agriculture.

Shri Naidu said that Cooperatives can help in reducing the cost of production by sensitizing farmers about judicious use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, by encouraging and training farmers in the use of organic manure and efficient use of water and by collective procurement of capital-intensive equipments and inputs.

The Vice President said that even though India became self-sufficient in food grain production, agriculture sector suffers from structural constraints. He called up on Cooperative societies to become important conduit between Government and the farmers to deliver the benefits of government schemes, such Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna, Krishi Sinchayi Yojna, Jan Dhan, e-NAM, MUDRA Yojna, Minimum Support Price and others to farmers.

The Vice President sought for coordinated efforts of Cooperatives, Agriculture Research Institutions, Kisan Vikas Kendras and farmers’ groups in line with government’s resolve to double the farmer’s income by 2022. 

The Vice President said that Indian cooperative movement has a great history and has made tremendous progress in several sectors of the Indian economy and said that with a network of over 8.50 lakh cooperatives with membership of well over 25 crores have operations across the spectrum made it the biggest in the world. He, however, added that the cooperative sector was facing structural challenges in recent past and stressed the need to address challenges faced by the sector such as politicization of cooperatives and bureaucratic control, low level of participation by women and youth.

Shri Naidu said that Cooperative sector has proven to be a successful model world over and countries like Singapore, Denmark, Scandinavian countries, Japan and Switzerland have seen success.  He has also stressed the need to learn from best practices and see if we can adopt some best practices in fields such as healthcare, retail, Food Production and others.  

Quoting the reach of the sector in different countries, the Vice President said that 55 per cent of the retail market in Singapore and 36 per cent in Denmark were being held by cooperatives. He further said that Consumer cooperatives have prominent presence in Scandinavian countries, Japan and Switzerland and countries like Japan, Germany, France and Netherlands, provide affordable health care to common people based on cooperative model. We must learn from them and try to emulate such models here in India for the betterment of common man, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s Lecture:

“लक्ष्मण राव जी ईनामदार की जन्म शताब्दी के उपलक्ष्य में सहकार भारती द्वारा आयोजित इस व्याख्यान के माध्यम से इस गंभीर विषय पर आपसे अपने विचार साझा कर सकूंगा। आपके सप्रेम निमंत्रण के लिए आपका आभारी हूं।           

वकील साहब का जन्म महाराष्ट्र के ही सतारा जिले में,21 सितंबर, 1917 को ऋषि पंचमी के दिन हुआ था। वे आजन्म ऋषि रूप में ही समाज सेवा करते रहे। सहकार और सौहार्द की पहली शिक्षा उन्हें अपने संयुक्त परिवार में ही मिली। परिवार के संस्कारों और संघ के प्रचारक के रूप में उनकेअनुभवों ने उन्हें सहकारिता की आवश्यकता को लेकर आश्वस्त किया। कालान्तर में उन्होंने सहकार भारती जैसा रचनात्मक सहकारिता आंदोलन खड़ा किया जो आज देश के लगभग 450 जिलों में फैला है तथा विभिन्न क्षेत्रों की लगभग 20,000 सहकारी समितियाँ सहकार भारती से संबंद्ध हैं।

उनके जन्म शताब्दी वर्ष में सहकार भारती द्वारा आयोजित व्याख्यानमाला का शुभारंभ गतवर्ष प्रधानमंत्री श्री नरेन्द्र मोदी द्वारा ही किया गया। गुजरात में संघ प्रचारक के रूप में उन्होंने ही युवा नरेन्द्र मोदी की क्षमताओं को पहचाना और उन्हें विकसित किया। सामाजिक और राजनैतिक सरोकारों में प्रासंगिक बनाया।           

मित्रों,

सहकार प्रकृति का नियम है, सहकार हमारा पारिवारिक, सामुदायिक संस्कार है। इसीलिए सहकारिता पर आधारित अर्थतंत्र अधिक न्यायपूर्ण, सात्विक, स्थाई और पर्यावरणीय दृष्टि से अधिक नैतिक होगा। जैसा कि दीनदयाल उपाध्याय जी ने कहा कि यदि हम अपनी प्रकृति, अपने संस्कारों को अपने सामाजिक सरोकारों और उत्तरदायित्वों से जोड़ दे तो यही ‘संस्कृति’ है और यदि हम अपनी प्रकृति को सामाजिक द्वंद्व या स्पर्धा की तरफ मोड़ दें तो वह ‘विकृति’ है। Share and Care की हमारी भारतीय संस्कृति परंपरा में सहकार की भावना अंतर्निहित है।

मित्रों,

यद्यपि अर्थशास्त्र में बाजार की अर्थव्यवस्था में Competition (स्पर्धा) पर बल दिया जाता है, तथापि एक स्तर के बाद, स्पर्धा उस उद्योग और अर्थव्यवस्था को हानि पहुचाने लगती है। इसीलिए अर्थव्यवस्था में पूर्ण स्पर्धा की अवधारणा, एक मरीचिका मात्र है। अत: अर्थव्यवस्था में Competition का scope तो सीमित है - सहकार के अवसर असीमित हैं।


India’s cooperative movement is the biggest movement in the world and has made tremendous progress in several sectors of the Indian economy. I am told that 75 percent of rural households have been covered through a network of over 8.50 lakh cooperatives with membership of well over 25 crores. 

Thecooperatives command significant share in cotton, fertilizer and sugar processing and production in the country. 


The iconic success of Amul has inspired the White Revolution in India with the country becoming the top milk producer in the world today.


Friends,

In recent years, however, the cooperative sector has faced structural challenges like dormant membership, lack of active participation of members in the management of cooperatives, politicization of cooperatives and bureaucratic control. Similarly, low level of participation by women and youth is a challenge and needs to be addressed.

Mounting dues in cooperative credit institutions, inadequate mobilization of own resources, over dependence on Governmental and institutional support, lack of professional management have proved harmful to their growth. There have been instances of mismanagement and absence of monitoring.

Probably the time has come to bring the requisite changes in the relevant laws governing cooperative sector in the context of changed techno-economic and business scenario to make the cooperatives viable and vibrant enterprises.


Friends,

Today we are self-sufficient in foodgrain production. Rather, we are faced with the crisis of abundance. Yet, our agriculture sector suffers from structural constraints. At present 85% agricultural land holdings are small, measuring less than 2 hectares. Only 5.2% agricultural families own tractors. Drip irrigation is available to only 1.6% agriculture households. 

The Government has resolved to double the farmer’s income by 2022. For which a number of interventions are necessary. 

The Government has raised the Minimum Support Price for most of the crops. Cooperatives can help small and marginal farmers in realizing the benefit of higher MSP. 

The Cooperatives can help in reducing the cost of production by sensitizing farmers about judicious use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, by encouraging and training farmers in the use of organic manure and efficient use of water and by collective procurement of capital-intensive equipments and inputs.

Friends,

The Government has launched several progressive programmes like Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna, Krishi Sinchayi Yojna, Jan Dhan and MUDRA Yojna.  The benefits of these schemes must reach farmers. Cooperative societies should become important conduit between Government and the farmers to deliver the benefits of these schemes.

This year, the Government has allocated Rs 2000 crores for upgrading and building new rural markets/mandis. Your active cooperation in this scheme is essential.


The Government of India has given a substantial budgetary support to computerize more than 63000 Primary Agriculture Cooperatives (PACs). Strengthening the PACs through application of appropriate technology is the need of the hour. Cooperative should train farmers to use e-marketing platform E-NAM, to access a wider market for their produce.  


In our country the rural economy is still largely dependent upon agriculture.  Cooperatives, with the assistance from research institutions and government agencies, can educate and train farmers to diversify into allied vocations like horticulture, fishery, Bee-keeping, rural logistics and transportation, food processing etc.  which is essential to raise the income of farmers. 


Friends, 

The Cooperative sector remains a vibrant and viable business model in the world. Worldwide, the Cooperative sector has about one billion members in over 100 countries. There are some 52,000 Cooperative Banks and Credit Unions, serving 177 million members in 100 Countries. It is estimated that cooperatives account for more than 100 million jobs around the world. We must learn from the new experiments taking place around the world in the cooperative sector.

Even in the service sector, the Cooperative model has been successfully adopted.55 per cent of the retail market in Singapore and 36 per cent in Denmark is held by cooperatives. Consumer cooperatives have prominent presence in Scandinavian countries, Japan and Switzerland. 

Countries like Japan, Germany, France and Netherlands, provide affordable health care to common people based on cooperative model. 

Similarly, in countries like US and Bangladesh, Electricity Cooperatives have been successful in making rural electrificationa viable enterprise. We must learn from their experiences and see if we can adopt some best practices in our own national context.    

In India, the Government is promoting innovation and entrepreneurship in every field. There is immense scope of innovation in cooperative sector especially in rural and agro-economy cooperatives.You can bring about the long-awaited disruptive innovation with the help of research and linkage with professional institutions. 

मित्रों,



सहकारिता केक्षेत्र में सबसे बड़ी चुनौती प्रबंधन की रही है। आवश्यक है कि सहकार भारती जैसी संस्थाऐं सहकारिता समितियों में प्रबंधन प्रशिक्षण पर भी ध्यान दें। सहकारिता को सर्वस्वीकार्य जनआंदोलन बनाने में सहकार भारती जैसी संस्थाओं की महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका होगी। आपके भावी प्रयास सफल हों - मेरी शुभकामना है।


मैं अपने वक्तव्य का अंत तैतरीय उपनिषद के शांति मंत्र से करूंगा:

 

“सह नाववतु, सहनौ भुनक्तु

सहवीर्यम करवावहै, तेजस्वी नावधीमस्तु

मा विद्विषावहै”

ऊँ शांति: शांति: शांति:

 

‘हम सभी संरक्षित रहें, हम सभी को आहार प्राप्त हो, हम सभी ऊर्जा के साथ अपने कर्म करें, हम सभी को ज्ञान प्राप्त हो - हमारे बीच कोई द्वेष न हो।’      

धन्यवाद, जय हिंद।

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asked the Civil Service Officers to be flexible, adaptable, open & dynamic and strive to reform outdated government practices. He was interacting with the Civil Service Officers of 93rd Foundation Course at the Dr. Marri Channa Reddy Human Resource Development Institute, in Hyderabad today.   

The Vice President said that civil service officers have the most important role of translating “Swarajya” to “Surajya”. Each citizen and each person in this country must feel that there is a perceptible improvement in the quality of life, he added. 

Shri Naidu said that hopes and aspirations of the country rest upon the able shoulders of civil servants. He asked officers not to remain static and let complacency set in. He said that civil servants cannot be bogged down by the tendency to adhere to status quo.

The Vice President said that they should be flexible, adaptable, open and dynamic and must be agile and proactive. They should forever remain connected to the pulse of the common man who you are expected to serve, he added.

The Vice President stressed up on the need to adopt corruption free, citizen-centric and business friendly governance so that the fruits of development reach the last man in the line.

Remembering the Iron Man of India, Sardar Patel, the Vice President said that it was he who brainchild the idea of an All India Service. He believed that the idea of united India would not be complete without a competent higher civil service that is independent.

Talking about the first Prime Minister of Independent India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Vice President said that leaders like him have left a lasting legacy for all of us. Their vision was of attaining true freedom for each citizen, he said.

Pandit Nehru and the iconic leaders who fought for our freedom envisaged a resurgent India. They saw India as Bharat Mata and true nationalism as the collective well being of entire population, he said.

Saying that All India as well as the central services has a crucial role in national integration and national development, Vice President said that they have the unique responsibility of harmonizing the social, cultural, linguistic, religious and economic differences in the country.

Shri Naidu called up on all the civil services officers to work together in unison, complementing and supporting each other with their specific domain experiences and expertise so that India’s growth story gets the much required momentum and direction.

The Vice President asked the officers to learn from the best practices within and outside India, from both the private as well as the public sector. Strive to reform outdated government practices. Often, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel, you would just need to adopt, adapt and scale up best practices, he added. 

Saying that enlightened citizenry of today does not want to remain merely recipients of welfare dole outs, Shri Naidu tasked the officers to make citizens have a say in matters that decide their own fate by including the common man in decision making and in setting development agendas.

Asking them to adopt ‘empathy’, efficiency’, ‘impartiality’ and ‘incorruptibility’ as guiding principles to emerge as effective, responsive administrators, Vice President Naidu called on civil service officers to act as ambassadors of progressive thought processes.

He said that the administration has to adopt a more empathetic, responsive and inclusive approach so that the intended benefits of the policies and programmes of our government reach the people on time.  We should aim at greater ‘efficiency’ and ‘effectiveness’, he said.

The Home Minister of Telangana, Shri Naini Narasimha Reddy, the Director General of the Dr. Marri Channa Reddy Human Resource Development Institute, Shri B.P. Acharya, faculty and more than 316 officer trainees representing different states were present at the venue.

                The Vice President of India, Shri. M. Venkaiah Naidu represented India on the occasion of the centenary of the conclusion of the protracted First World War in Paris, France. The event commemorated the sacrifices of thousands of brave Indian soldiers who had fought gallantly in the world war.

About 14 lakh Indian soldiers fought with valor and distinction during the World War I on numerous battle fields: In France and Belgium, Aden, Arabia, East and West Africa, Galli Poli in Turkey, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Palestine, Persia, Russia, China and Salonika in Greece. About 74,000 Indians were killed in this war. About 1.40 lakh Indian soldiers took part in the battle theater in France and Belgium where 9300 brave Indian soldiers gave up their lives in this battle field alone fighting on the side of righteousness that India has always stood for.

The Vice President unveiled the Indian War Memorial in Villers-Guislain, a town about 200 kms from Paris, commemorating the difficult battles fought by Indian soldiers of whom over 40,000 died during the battle of Cambrai. Indian Cavalry comprising of the Deccan Horse, Hadson’s Horse, Puna Horse, Central India Horse and 18 Cavalry had charged at German positions during this battle in territories and harsh hostile climate. The initiative taken by the French government to organize various events including a 3 day global peace forum served as a painful reminder of the battles of the last century and the current threats to peace and harmony in the current world.

The Vice President expressed hope that these events would serve as occasions to draw appropriate lessons from the context and the consequences of the World War I and would remind the world leaders of the need to collectively address the challenges confronting humanity today. He added that the present day’s inescapable reality is that we are living in an increasingly interdependent world. Shri Naidu observed that geographical boundaries were becoming less and less relevant as the destinies of the citizens across the world are increasingly getting inter linked. He opined that multilateralism has emerged as the most effective modality for decision-making and conflict resolution. 

The Paris Peace Forum meet provided an opportunity for about 70 global leaders to look at the challenges to the multilateralism and work in unison to prevent any disaster hitting mankind in the form of growing protectionism. 

The Vice President participated in a high level panel discussion titled ‘Dialogue of Continents on Global Governance’ focusing on issues of multilateralism, international institutions and global governance challenges and the means to craft sustainable peace. He reminded fellow leaders that thousands of brave Indian soldiers had sacrificed their lives 100 years ago fighting for the cause of righteousness and in the interest of peace, human liberty and freedom.

Citing that India has always believed in the principle of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ which means the World is one family, the Vice President asserted that there was a certain need to guide the world on the path of collective endeavor for collective benefit. He asserted that there is a certain need for the world to ensure effective multilateralism that brings all the nations on a common platform to explore common solutions for challenges faced by humanity. “We need united efforts of the world to deal with global development priorities such as eradication of poverty, providing education, health care, employment and gender parity”, he said.

The Mayor of Villers Guislain, Mr. Gerard Allart, the Ambassador of India to France, Mr Vinay Kwatra, Members of the Indian Community and others were present at the venue.

This is the first such memorial built by the government of India in France and the historic occasion was witnessed by the representatives of Indian French armed forces and locals amidst severe rain. 

Later the Vice President addressed the gathering at Mayor’s office and said that the Indian memorial in Villers-Guislain would stand tall as a towering manifestation of our continuous efforts to express solidarity with France in remembering the martyrs of the First World War.

The Mayor of Villers Guislain, Mr. Gerard Allart, Ambassador of India to France, Mr Vinay Kwatra, Members of the Indian Community and others were present at the venue to witness the moment meant to recognise and recollect the extra ordinary bravery of Indian soldiers.

The Vice President said that said that the memorial in Villers-Guislain would stand tall as a towering manifestation of India's continuous efforts to express solidarity with France in remembering the martyrs of the First World War.

He termed it as a testimony to the valour of the Indian soldiers and the duty they stood for, leaving behind their kith and kin, even though it was not a war that India was involved with directly, they fought for human liberty and freedom. Their contributions can never be forgotten.

Shri Naidu said that the valour of the Indian soldiers and the duty they stood for, leaving behind their kith and kin, is a memory that can never be erased. They fought for human liberty and freedom, even though it was not a war that India was involved with directly. 

The sons and daughters of India have always stood on the side of righteousness even when confronting the toughest adversities and have fought gallantly and laid down their lives to uphold and promote these cherished ideals, in the far-flung corners of the world. 

Nearly 1.3 Million Indian soldiers fought with valour and distinction during World War I. A designated Indian Expeditionary Force ‘A’, the Indian Corps that served in France and Belgium from Sep 1914 consisted of two Infantry and two Cavalry Divisions. Nearly 1,40,000 Indian Soldiers took part in World War 1 in France and Belgium. 9300 of them made supreme sacrifice and are buried in 168 cemeteries in France and Belgium. 

The Battle of Cambrai was fought on this very piece of land that you are standing upon today from the morning of November 20, 1917 till December 4, 1917. Over 40,000 soldiers had died during that battle, including many Indians.

Saying that peace is the only pre-requisite for progress, the Vice President said that in an inter-dependent world, progress can be achieved only through dialogue and understanding.

The Vice President lauded the contributions of the Diaspora in the fields of science and technology, industry, agriculture, art, culture, governance or politics, their strong contributions and successes are as much a matter of pride for France, the country of their settlement, as they are for India, the country of their origin.

Saying that India is proud of the achievements of Indian Diaspora, the Vice President said that interacting with Indian Diaspora was like conversing within a growing but close-knit family. Persons of Indian origin and Indians abroad have excelled in many areas of French public life, with many as members in the French Parliament as well as in the European Parliament, he added.

Reminding the gathering about long and mutually enriching association with the French, the Vice President said that Rabindranath Tagore’s intellectual influence was known to have touched several French thinkers. Indian luminaries like Madame Bhikaji Cama and JRD Tata, who were significant figures in India’s pre-independence history, too had strong links with France, he added. 

Saying that bold reforms agenda of the Government is transforming the academic landscape of our country, the Vice President said that the story of India is an unfolding and a promising one. This is at a time when the rest of the world, including parts of this region, is experiencing a slowdown, he said.

He said that the introduction of Goods and Service Tax was a major step to have seamless and efficient national market and added that it would make it easier for businesses to establish and grow in India.

Shri Naidu invited the members of Indian Diaspora to take active participation in the creation of New India. He asked them to make use of the time and suitable opportunities for investment and innovation in India. It is also an important time to connect actively with your roots, he added.

The Vice President also talked about the joint efforts of India and France to promote the use of clean energy by way of International Solar Alliance. He further said that India-France development partnership brought mutual rewards to both of our economies, especially in the field of smart urbanization and transportation. 

Earlier the Vice President interacted with Director General of UNESCO Ms. Audrey Azoulay and apprised her about India’s efforts to achieve the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development, especially in all the fields including education. They also discussed matters such as usage of information and communication technologies to improve access to education, enhancing the quality of teaching-learning process and teacher development programmes, strengthening educational planning and management, and improving monitoring systems.

The Vice President is in Paris, France to attend the centenary year of end of First World War.  He will also be participating at a global event at Arc d’ Trionphe in which he will pay homage to the martyrs of World War I. 

He will also inaugurate the Indian Armed Forces Memorial at Villers Guislain as a tribute to several thousands of Indian soldiers whose gallantry and dedication have earned worldwide recognition.

Shri Naidu’s visit France assumes significance as India and France are celebrating two decades of strategic partnership this year.

The Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar, the High Commissioner of India to Malawi. Shri Suresh Kumar Menon and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President is scheduled to meet the President of Malawi, Prof. Arther Peter Mutharika and other dignitaries of the Malawian government on November 5, 2018.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I bring you the warmest greetings from India.

I thank all of you for welcoming me and my delegation with such warmth and affection. I am accompanied by Hon’ble Minister Sri Kishan Pal Gurjar, Members of Lower House (Lok Sabha) Sri K Suresh and Members of Parliament Upper House (Rajya Sabha) Sri Members of Lower House (Lok Sabha) V Muraleedharan.

I am extremely delighted to visit this beautiful city of Lilongwe, in the Warm Heart of Africa. I am thankful to the Government of Malawi for the warm hospitality extended to me and my delegation. I am also looking forward to a fruitful interaction with President Prof. Arther Peter Mutharika tomorrow.

 

Sisters and Brothers,

I am aware that the Malawians of Indian origin or the Pravasi Bhartiyas have been in Malawi for the last 150 years. I am glad to know that Malawi has accepted all of you with great warmth and affection, due to which you all have settled down well in this country. The Malawian brothers and sisters have accepted all of you as a part of their larger Malawian family since your arrival.

I am happy to note that despite being less than 1% of the total population, you have made significant contribution to find a place of leadership, in the economic activities of the country. Some of you have attained positions of excellence, in your respective professions. I am extremely happy to note that you are providing leadership in various sectors

I am particularly impressed to learn that Malawi had an Indian Association set up way back in 1914, popularly called as Indian Sports Club in the City of Blantyre. Then came the Indian Country Club in 1940s in Lilongwe. Both these clubs continue to function to this day.

I convey my sincere appreciation to the determination of your leadership, in keeping these Associations alive for more than 100+ years in this distant country.

I also have come to know that the Indian cultural heritage has been kept alive through the Hindu Sewa Samaj both in Blantyre and Lilongwe which also is over five decades old. Various Indian festivals are celebrated with full religious fervour and with the participation of the entire community.

By these initiatives of yours, the younger generations of Malawi Indians are able to keep in touch with our Indian cultural, customs and practices in this distant land. Your strong and wider involvement in the economic activities of Malawi is also noteworthy. I am happy that the Indian community enjoys a reputation of being peace-loving community and has been able to assimilate well with the locals.

 

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

India, one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, with a current growth rate of 8.2%, is on course to become a 5 trillion economy by 2025. The India story, as it is unfolding today, is a promising one.

India is moving fast forward to transform itself into a modern 21st century inclusive economy. Towards this end, our Government has taken a number of measures.

An ambitious plan to build next-generation infrastructure including 100 Smart Cities, 10 green-field airports, 7 high-speed train corridors, 5 major ports, highways and nation-wide broadband connectivity linking our villages and urban areas is underway.

Nearly 10 thousand kilometres of national highways were built during the last one year. That is an average of 27 kilometres per day. 111 rivers have been identified as National Waterways and we are modernizing our railways. New metros in the urban centres and dedicated freight corridors are being built. We have set a target to produce 175 Gigawatt of clean, renewable energy by 2022.

To boost the manufacturing sector, India has embarked on the “Make in India programme”. A host of path breaking reforms have been initiated, including the transformational tax reform.

The introduction of Goods and Service Tax is a major step to have seamless and efficient national market. This will make it easier for businesses to establish and grow in India.

 

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

I would urge you to look at the transformation that India is undergoing. The results from the World Bank’s ‘Doing Business 2019’ report published a couple of days ago which said, “India, which is a top improver for a second consecutive year, implemented six reforms in the past year and advanced to 77th place in the global ranking.  India is now the region’s top-ranked economy…. Starting a business was made easier through consolidation of multiple application forms and introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST).”

India is changing rapidly.  The business environment is changing for the better.  The archaic regulations are being dismantled.  Seamless processes are being introduced.

 

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

You are already aware of the various steps that Government of India is taking towards enhancing our relationship with Malawi. Tomorrow, when I meet Hon’ble President of Malawi, we will be signing some important and landmark announcements. One of them will be for setting up of Mahatma Gandhi International Convention Centre in Blantyre. It is a US$ 10 mn grant from the Government of India. Another important development is the setting up of a Business Incubation Centre that has come up at the Mponela Technical College in Dowa District. The incubation centre will give the much needed fillip to upgrading the skills of Malawi youth in several sectors.

Malawi is rich in natural resources and India is more than happy to assist in value addition of their rich resources, so that the Malawian economy becomes self-reliant and Malawi is able to finance all their domestic requirements in the years ahead.

Before, I conclude, I would like to share with all of you, about the forthcoming Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas of 2019, which is very significant. In reverence to the sentiments of the large Diaspora community to participate in Kumbh Snan and to witness the Republic Day Parade, the 15th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas will be held from January 21-23, 2019 in Varanasi, U.P. You all are cordially invited to attend the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.

In concluding, I would like to thank each one of you, who have come here and the larger Indian community spread all over Malawi. Please keep building bridges of understanding and empathy as you have been doing, for so many decades.

Share your prosperity with your Malawi brothers and sisters and make them partners in progress. You are all well placed to do make a diffrence. I am sure you will all rise up to the occasion and assist all those who are involved in moving Malawi from a LDC country to a middle income country by the next decade.

I wish each one of you all success in your professional and personnel endevours.  I hope you will continue to cherish your Indian roots and the rich cultural tradition you have inherited and nourish the socio-economic and cultural life of Malawi.

You are India’s cultural ambassadors and the world sees you as the representatives of Indian values and way of life. 

I am happy that many of you have done India proud. 

Please continue the mission of carrying India’s message to the world in your interactions with other country men and women. Also bring back the best from other countries to India so that our country can advance much more rapidly.

 

Thank you.

 

Jai Hind!""

He was addressing the Indian Community Reception, organized by the Ambassador of India to Zimbabwe, Shri M. Masakui, in Harare, Zimbabwe yesterday. The Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that the Indian Community in Zimbabwe, though small in number, is making significant contribution to the progress of this country in diverse areas and as entrepreneurs. They also serve as a living bridge between the two countries, he added.

The Vice President said that because of our innate nature of being very hard working, peace loving and spirit to integrate with the larger community that they have flourished in this country and have earned deep respect for yourselves and for India.

Saying India has very warm and friendly relations with Zimbabwe, he said that both our countries have inherited a rich cultural heritage, which has gained vibrancy over the years.

The Vice President urged the Indian Community in Zimbabwe to look at the transformation that India is undergoing. India is changing rapidly and the business environment is changing for better. The archaic regulations are being dismantled and seamless processes are being introduced, he added.

The Vice President said that the 21st century is being called century of Asia and Africa and and India will have an important role in it. Wherever you may be living, you will feel the impact of this role, you will feel the impact of rising India. We want you to join our journey towards growth and prosperity, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I thank you for welcoming me with such warmth and affection. I am delighted to meet you. Your presence here speaks of your love and affection for your country and for the land of your forefathers. 

­­I am pleased to learn that the Indian Community in Zimbabwe, though small in number, is making significant contribution to the progress of this country. As professionals in diverse areas and as entrepreneurs, you also serve as a living bridge between the two countries.

I strongly believe, because of our innate nature of being very hard working, peace loving and the spirit to integrate with the larger community that you have flourished in this country and have earned deep respect for yourselves and for India. We are, indeed, proud of your success. 

Zimbabwe is not just a beautiful country, but a country with a large heart that receives India and Indians with open arms. India has very warm and friendly relations with Zimbabwe. 

Our ties go back to several centuries when traders from India and Zimbabwe were trading in minerals, metals and textiles. 

I am also told that the son of Munhumotapa Kingdom Prince Miguls came to India in 17th century and settle down in Goa. That makes India and Zimbabwe natural longtime friends. 

Both our countries have inherited a rich cultural heritage, which has gained vibrancy over the years. 

We are keen to strengthen and diversify our relations with Zimbabwe. Tomorrow, I will have discussions with President E.D. Mnangagwa and Vice President Dr. Chiwenga on taking forward our bilateral relations, particularly, our economic ties. 

There are numerous opportunities for businesses to grow both ways – be it trade, technology or investment. 

I am accompanied on this visit by a strong business delegation. I do hope you will take out time to meet and guide them on local opportunities and prospects.

Brothers and Sisters, 

The dynamism our country and our economic growth has made India a bright star in the international arena. India is the fastest growing major economy in the world, with a current growth rate of 8.2%. We have undertaken ambitious plans to build next-generation infrastructure, including smart cities, airports, high-speed train corridors, highways and cyber connectivity.

I would urge you to look at the transformation that India is undergoing.  The results from the World Bank’s ‘Doing Business 2019’ report published yesterday have a powerful message that all Indians should feel very happy about. The report said, “India, which is a top improver for a second consecutive year, implemented six reforms in the past year and advanced to 77th place in the global ranking.  India is now the region’s top-ranked economy…. Starting a business was made easier through consolidation of multiple application forms and introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST).” I am happy to inform you that in the month of October 2018 alone the collections have crossed 1 lakh crores.

India is changing rapidly.  The business environment is changing for the better.  The archaic regulations are being dismantled.  Seamless processes are being introduced.

You have ventured out into the global arena and made a mark.  I would suggest that you should also look at how you can contribute to the exciting growth story unfolding in India today. 

We have a whole new set of opportunities that are opening up.  There can’t be a better time than now to invest in India.  

India has taken a major leap towards financial inclusion by encouraging 330 million persons to open bank accounts. Tax base has widened by 26% in the last one year with nearly 68 million tax payers paying taxes. We have an ambitious agenda to make India a $ 5 trillion economy by 2025. 

Zimbabwe has just concluded its general elections and has, under the leadership of President E.D Mnagagwa, set the country’s vision of becoming a middle income country by 2030. This vision has complementarily with our Make in India, Digital India, Start-up India and other national programmes. We seek your support in this endeavour. Your professional experience, convening power, and entrepreneurial spirit can make this partnership blossom. 

Brothers and sisters,

We consider every Indian abroad as our cultural ambassador. Wherever you go, you must share the beauty of your rich cultural heritage and knowledge with the local people. 

This year on 2nd October, we began our worldwide celebrations of the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. We expect you to do your best to support our efforts. 

There is a new vigour in our Diaspora outreach today. We have made our OCI scheme flexible so that more and more people can avail them. We want to connect and collaborate with every Indian abroad, and provide them a helping hand when in need. 

We have deployed social media and digital platforms to render efficient consular services. Our Embassies abroad are available round the clock for servicing those in need. 

As a result of our commitment and action, every Indian abroad today feels assured and is confident that the government is there to protect and help them when in need. 

We will be celebrating the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas in Varanasi from 21st to 23rd January next year. I do hope you will join us. 

We are determined to move forward to make India a truly developed country and to see that India earns its rightful place in the world order. I hope that the Indian community in the Zimbabwe will do its utmost, to strengthen the cultural and economic ties between the two countries. 

We want you to join our journey towards growth and prosperity. The 21st century is being called the century of Asia and Africa. And India will certainly have an important role in it. Wherever you may be living, you will feel the impact of this role, you will feel the impact of rising India. 

Brothers and Sisters,

I once again express my deep appreciation for your accomplishments and your presence here this evening. And if you have not visited India in the recent times, I invite you to do so and witness the fast positive changes taking place in India.  

Thank you!

The Vice President asked the Indians living abroad to continue the mission of carrying India’s message to the world and bring back the best from other countries to India so that our country can advance much more rapidly.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I feel privileged to be with you in Botswana, a land of god-gifted serenity and natural beauty.

I am delighted to see your enthusiasm and thank you all for coming here.

My dear friends,

I know that many of you have been living here for several decades and have made Botswana your second home. I understand and appreciate the aspiration and desires of the Indian community which exudes vibrancy and dynamism. 

The Indian diaspora in Botswana has not only well-integrated into its pluralistic, free and democratic society, but, also have immensely contributed to the economy of Botswana.

I know that most of you are engaged in education, medicine, accounting, retail and manufacturing sectors and have been actively contributing to create local employment.

By sheer perseverance, determination and adaptation, you have carved a niche and respect for yourselves and have endeared both to Botswana and India alike.

Your support to Government of Botswana’s socio-economic welfare and charity programme as well as active and enthusiastic involvement in the events of national importance has been greatly acknowledged and appreciated both by people of Botswana and India.

I have been informed that Indian community has been organising and participating in socio-cultural programmes and fulfilling their corporate social responsibility in the form of charitable donations to the society.

I appreciate their feelings for fellow-Indians and highly admire these compassion which led them to collect and donate a sum of Rs. 50 lakh for the victims of Kerala floods.

We Indians take pride in being enterprising, inclusive and law abiding community. In whichever part of the world they live, Indians have excelled.

As your presence here in Botswana itself is a testimony to the fact that our relationship with Botswana have been historic and friendly. Both the countries have common commitment to democratic values for improving our people’s quality of life.

In fostering our relationship, Indian community has been playing a big role by virtue of their entrepreneurship, economic activities and people to people contacts. I have been told that our bilateral trade has been steadily improving over the last few years and only in 2017-18 has registered a significant growth of 26% bringing it to US$ 1.75 billion.

We are taking earnest efforts to elevate this relationship to a new height by making Indian investments in the areas of agriculture and dairy, MSME particular in leather and food processing, mining, diamond beneficiation, education and health and, thus, to tap the great potential Botswana offers.

Friends,

Yesterday, I was given the honor to inaugurate the 13th Global Expo Botswana- 2018 with Hon’ble Vice President of Botswana. I am delighted to see a large contingent of Indian businessmen and industry houses who are willing to avail this opportunity and become a part of Botswana’s development.

I am very happy to know that Hon’ble President of Botswana, Mr. Masisi has special appreciation for Indian diaspora and has been participating in Indian cultural and religious programmes like Vaishakhi, etc.

It gives me great satisfaction that his government has affirmed its continued protection and cooperation to the Indian community.

Government of India attaches great importance to its fellow countrymen who are living abroad.

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

I am glad that you have contributed hugely to the successful story of Botswana’s economic growth.

I would urge you to look at the transformation that India is undergoing.  The results from the World Bank’s ‘Doing Business 2019’ report published yesterday have a powerful message that all Indians should feel very happy about. The report said, “India, which is a top improver for a second consecutive year, implemented six reforms in the past year and advanced to 77th place in the global ranking.  India is now the region’s top-ranked economy…. Starting a business was made easier through consolidation of multiple application forms and introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST).”

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

India is changing rapidly.  The business environment is changing for the better.  The archaic regulations are being dismantled.  Seamless processes are being introduced.

We are now an aspirational India that is being driven by the dreams of more than 600 million young women and men below the age of 35 years.

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

You have ventured out into the global arena and made a mark.  I would suggest that you should also look at how you can contribute to the exciting growth story unfolding in India today.

We have a whole new set of opportunities that are opening up.  There can’t be a better time than now to invest in India. 

You are aware that Government of India has launched several flagship schemes for making India a skilled and knowledge society and manufacturing hub. In addition, several progressive measures like the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) have been taken to make it a transparent and integrated market with greater ease of doing business.

India has taken a major leap towards financial inclusion by encouraging 330 million persons to open bank accounts. Tax base has widened by 26% in the last one year with nearly 68 million tax payers paying taxes. We have an ambitious agenda to make India a $ 5 trillion economy by 2025.

India is at an inflection point and is poised for greater growth in the coming years. 

If the talented enterprising Indian diaspora can lend its active support, the pace and quality of transformation can be considerably enhanced.

I wish each one of you all success in your professional and personnel endevours.  I hope you will continue to cherish your Indian roots and the rich cultural tradition you have inherited and nourish the socio-economic and cultural life of Botswana and other countries with which you may be connected.

You are India’s cultural ambassadors and the world sees you as the representatives of Indian values and way of life. 

I am happy that many of you have done India proud. 

Please continue the mission of carrying India’s message to the world in your interactions with other country men and women. Also bring back the best from other countries to India so that our country can advance much more rapidly.

Thank you

 

Jai Hind!""

	Strong and active cooperation across G-20 countries to deal comprehensively and efficiently with the menace fugitive economic offenders.
	Cooperation in the legal processes such as effective freezing of the proceeds of crime; early return of the offenders and efficient repatriation of the proceeds of crime should be enhanced and streamlined.
	Joint effort by G-20 countries to form a mechanism that denies entry and safe havens to all fugitive economic offenders.
	Principles of United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNOTC), especially related to ""International Cooperation” should be fully and effectively implemented.
	FATF should be called upon to assign priority and focus to establishing international co-operation that leads to timely and comprehensive exchange of information between the competent authorities and FIUs.
	FATF should be tasked to formulate a standard definition of fugitive economic offenders.
	FATF should also develop a set of commonly agreed and standardized procedures related to identification, extradition and judicial proceedings for dealing with fugitive economic offenders to provide guidance and assistance to G-20 countries, subject to their domestic law.
	Common platform should be set up for sharing experiences and best practices including successful cases of extradition, gaps in existing systems of extradition and legal assistance, etc.
	G-20 Forum should consider initiating work on locating properties of economic offenders who have a tax debt in the country of their residence for its recovery.

	We, the Heads of State and Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Russian Federation, the Republic of India, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa, met on 30 November 2018 for the annual Informal BRICS Leaders’ Meeting on the margins of the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We congratulated and supported the Argentine Presidency for G20 in 2018 and expressed our gratitude at the hospitality provided.
	We exchanged views on international political, security and global economic-financial issues, as well as challenges facing sustainable development. We recommit ourselves to a world of peace and stability, the central role of the United Nations, the purposes and principles enshrined in the UN Charter, and respect for international law, the promotion of democracy and the rule of law. We reiterate our commitment to working together to strengthen multilateralism and promote a fair, just, equitable, democratic and representative international order.
	We deplore continued terrorist attacks, including against some BRICS countries. We condemn terrorism in all forms and manifestations, wherever committed and by whom so ever. We urge concerted efforts to counter terrorism under the UN auspices on a firm international legal basis. We call upon all nations to adopt a comprehensive approach in combating terrorism, including all the elements identified in the Johannesburg Declaration.
	We reaffirm our full support for the rules-based multilateral trading system, as embodied in the WTO, to ensure transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive international trade. We express our common readiness to engage in frank and result-oriented discussions with other WTO members with a view to improving the functioning of the WTO.
	The spirit and rules of the WTO run counter to unilateral and protectionist measures. We call on all members to oppose such WTO inconsistent measures, stand by their commitments undertaken in the WTO and rollback such measures of a discriminatory and restrictive nature.
	We support work towards improvement of the WTO with the view to enhance its relevance and effectiveness to address current and future challenges. In this work the core value and fundamental principles of the WTO should be preserved and interests of all WTO members should be reflected, in particular those of the developing members.
	The dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO is essential for its proper functioning. Its effective functioning will give members the required confidence to engage in future negotiating in the WTO. We therefore urge that the Appellate Body selection process be initiated immediately, as an essential prerequisite for the stable and effective functioning of the WTO dispute settlement system.
	We reaffirm our commitment to enhance our communication and cooperation and work jointly and collaboratively with other members to enable the WTO to keep up with the changing times, promote inclusive growth and participation of all countries in international trade and play a meaningful role in global economic governance.
	We welcome the G20 Argentine Presidency’s theme of Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development and its focus on the Future of Work, Infrastructure for Development and Food Security for Sustainable Future.
	We recognize the importance of infrastructure for development and commit to contribute to bridging the global infrastructure gap, also by mobilizing resources for sustainable and disaster resilient infrastructure through national and collective initiatives, including the New Development Bank.
	We advocate for a strong Global Financial Safety Net with an adequately resourced, quota-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) at its centre. To this effect, we reaffirm our commitment to the conclusion of the IMF's 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula so as to ensure the increased voice of the dynamic emerging and developing economies to reflect their relative contributions to the world economy while protecting the voices of the least developed counties, by the 2019 Spring Meetings and no later than the 2019 Annual Meetings.
	We reinforce our commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals that would provide equitable, inclusive, open, all-round innovation-driven and sustainable development, in its three dimensions – economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner, towards the ultimate goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. We urge developed countries to honour their ODA commitments fully, in time and to provide additional development resources to developing countries in accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
	The global economic expansion continues, however, it has been less balanced and downside risks have risen. We are concerned that the negative spill-overs by policy normalization from major advanced economies has been an important source of volatility of some emerging market economies witnessed recently. We call on all economies to strengthen their policy dialogue and coordination in the spirit of partnership at the G20 and other fora to prevent potential risks from spreading.
	Regarding Climate Change, we recommit ourselves to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted under the principles of the UNFCCC including the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and urge developed countries to provide financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries to enhance their capability in mitigation and adaptation. We call upon all countries to reach a balanced outcome under the Paris Agreement Work Programme during COP-24 that enables operationalization and implementation of the Paris Agreement. We stress the importance and urgency of conducting a successful and ambitious first replenishment process of the Green Climate Fund.
	We reiterate our warm appreciation to South Africa for the success of the 10th BRICS Summit, Johannesburg, 25-27 July 2018 and recommit ourselves to enhancing further our strategic partnership for the benefit of our peoples. We express satisfaction with the achievements of BRICS cooperation in the areas of economy, peace and security and people-to-people exchanges under South Africa’s Chairship, including the establishment of the BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution (PartNIR), the BRICS Vaccine Research and Development Centre, the BRICS Energy Research Cooperation Platform and the Americas Regional Office of the New Development Bank in São Paulo. We reaffirm our commitment to fully implement the outcomes of the Johannesburg Summit and previous Summits.
	We look forward to the 11th BRICS Summit to be hosted by Brazil in 2019 and extend our full support to Brazil as the incoming BRICS Chair.

                Your Excellency President Cyril Ramaphosa,
Your Excellency President Michel Temer,
Your Excellency President Vladimir Putin,
Your Excellency President Xi Jinping,

I congratulate President Ramaphosa on the success of BRICS Summit in Johannesburg in July and hosting this meeting.

In BRICS we represent 42% of the world's population. Since last few years BRICS has been the engine of Global Growth. However, there are still many possibilities of increasing our share in world GDP (23%) and trade (16%). They are not in line with our population.

Excellencies,

Globalization has brought millions of people out of poverty. However, we have challenges of equal distribution of benefits of globalization before us. There has been a streak of continuous difficulties in the path of multilateralism and rule-based world order and protectionism is increasing. Currency devaluation and sharp increase in oil prices are challenging the profits earned over the past few years.

BRICS countries have been contributing to global sustainability and development. We have played an important role in shaping the economic and political structure of the world.

We have made significant contributions in making the architecture of global economic governance more representative and democratic and we will continue to work further in this direction.

We must speak unanimously about providing more representation to the developing countries in United Nations, its Security Council and other multilateral institutions. This is the purpose for which we have come together in the BRICS.

To ensure a rule-based world order we have to work together with multilateral institutions like UN, WTO, UNFCC, World Bank, so as to maintain their relevance and they also reflect the realities of current time. In this regard, I have suggested 'Reformed Multilateralism' in my meeting in Johannesburg.

Inclusion of topics like the New Industrial Revolution, future of work, etc. in the G20 agenda has enriched the discussion of global development. We, BRICS countries, are eager to cooperate in the new Industrial Revolution.

In this context, the topics of globalization and migration must be addressed through better multilateral coordination and cooperation. Managing labor issues in the Global Supply Chain will be necessary to ensure excellent work in the entire value chain. Portability of social security schemes of workers and smooth movement of laborers worldwide is very important.

Social-economic issues like women's empowerment and sustainable food future will be raised in the G20 Summit. On sustainable development and infrastructure, earlier I had suggested the need for disaster resilient infrastructure. We have to work together to take it forward.

Excellencies,

India values and appreciates the progress made in enhancing BRICS political exchanges. In this regard, meetings between our Foreign Ministers, NSAs and special messengers from Middle East have made important contributions.

We all agree that terrorism and radicalization are the biggest threats that the whole world is facing today. It is not only a threat to the peace and security, it is also a threat to economic development.

We have urged all countries for the implementation of FATF standards. BRICS and G20 countries have to work together to strengthen the UN Counter Terrorism Framework to stop terrorist networks, their financing and their movement.

We need to work together against economic offenders and fugitives. This problem can be a serious threat to the world's economic stability.

Excellencies,

Our support base in the G20 has started to become strong. Our BRICS Sherpas have been consulting and cooperating in G20 areas.

G20 Summit is being headed by a developing country. It is a good opportunity that the focus of the G20 agenda and its results should be brought to the priorities of the developing countries.

In the end, once again I thank President Ramaphosa for the successful hosting of the Johannesburg Summit and for organizing this meeting.

I also confirm full support and cooperation of India to Brazil and its leadership for the forthcoming BRICS Chairmanship. I am confident that BRICS cooperation will scale new heights under the Chairmanship of Brazil.

Excellencies,

I also thank President of Brazil that we have been getting your guidance and an opportunity to work with you since the last six times and as you said, this is our last meeting with you.

My best wishes,
Thanks a lot

                अर्जेंटीना के समर्पित योग-साधक,
भारत और भारतीय संस्कृति के प्रति अबाध प्रेम रखने वाले अर्जेंटीना के वासियों,
अर्जेंटीना में रहने वाले भारतीय बहनों और भाइयों,
आर्ट ऑफ़ लिविंग के कार्यकर्त्ता और सदस्यों,

नमस्कार!

बुएनास तार्दॆर्स। बुएनोस आइरेस में सुबह, दिन और शाम बुएनोस, यानि सुहाने स्वाभाविक ही हैं।महर्षि पतंजलि की परंपरा से जुड़े आप सभी जनों को सवा सौ करोड़ भारतीयों की तरफ से मेरा बहुत-बहुत अभिवादन।मैं Art of Living के सदस्यों को और आप सब को इस शानदार आयोजन के लिए ह्रदय पूर्वक बहुत बहुत बधाई देता हूं। 

साथियों, 

मैं २४ घंटे से भी अधिक में १५ हज़ार किलोमीटर से भी अधिक का सफ़र तय कर कुछ देर पहले ही बुएनोस आइरेस पहुंचा हूँ। पर आप लोगों के उत्साह और प्रेम से मुझे बिलकुल नहीं लगा कि मैं कहीं भारत से बाहर हूं। यहां पर बहुत सारे लोग, बड़ी कुशलता और आदर से सूर्य नमस्कार कर रहे थे। अर्जेंटीना के इस रुपहले संध्या काल में आप की योग साधना ने मुझे तारो ताजा कर दिया और उत्साह से भर दिया।

साथियों, 

आज के कार्यक्रम का नाम है ""Yoga For Peace""। योग के किसी कार्यक्रम का इससे बेहतर नाम ढूंढ पाना मुश्किल है। योग से हमें तन और मन दोनों का स्वास्थ्य मिलता है। योग हमारे शरीर को शक्ति देता है और मन को शांति। जब व्यक्ति के मन में शांति होगी, तभी परिवार में, समाज में, देश में और विश्व में भी शांति होगी।हेल्थ, वेलनेस और पीस के लिए दुनिया को योग भारत का उपहार है। 21 जून को अंतर्राष्ट्रीय योग दिवस इन मूल्यों के प्रति अर्जेंटीना समेत पूरी दुनिया की प्रतिबद्धता को दिखाता है। सर्वे संतु सुखिन: और वसुधैव कुटुंबकम इस भारतीय दर्शन की यह व्यावहारिक अभिव्यक्ति है। मुझे यह जानकर खुशी है कि इस वर्ष बुएनोस आइरेस में भी योग दिवस पर 10 हज़ार लोगों ने हिस्सा लिया।

साथियों, 

योग का अर्थ ही है जोड़ना। यह हमें wellness से जोड़ता है। Happiness से जोड़ता है। और आज, भारत और अर्जेंटीना के बीच हजारों किलोमीटर की दूरी को योग पाट रहा है और हमारे दोनों देशों को, हमारे लोगों को जोड़ रहा है। हमें एक आत्मीय संबंध से बाँध रहा है। भारत और अर्जन्टीना के बीच 15 हजार किलोमीटर की दूरी है। हम दोनों देशों के बीच दो विशाल महासागर और महाद्वीप हैं। दोनों देशों के समय में 8 घंटे और तीस मिनट का अंतर है। यानि अभी आपकी शाम है. लेकिन भारत में लोग ब्रह्म मुहूर्त की साधना शुरू करने वाले हैं।

लेकिन आपके योगाभ्यास ने दिखा दिया है कि भारत और अर्जेंटीना में एक-दूसरे की संस्कृतियों के प्रति आदर भाव के सामने हजारों किलोमीटर की दूरी सिर्फ एक आंकड़ा मात्र है। अर्जन्टीना को भारत के दर्शन, कला, संगीत और नृत्य में रुचि है, तो भारत में अर्जंटीना के फुटबाल स्टार्स के लाखों Fans हैं। माराडोना का नाम तो हमारे देश की बोलचाल और कहावतों तक में आ गया है।

अभी भारत के एक राज्य ओडिशा में hockey world cup चल रहा है जिसके कारण भारत में काफी उत्साह है । आज ही अर्जेंटीना ने hockey world cup में अपना पहला मैच जीता । मैंने सुना मुक़ाबला काफी रोमांचक था ।मैं अर्जेंटीना की hockey team को आने वाले मैचों के लिए शुभकामनाएं देता हूँ ।

भारत और अर्जेंटीना के लोगों के सपने और अपेक्षाएं समान हैं। दोनों देशों के संबंध सौहार्द्रपूर्ण और मैत्रीपूर्ण हैं। हम दोनों विकासशील और लोकतान्त्रिक देश हैं और हमारे साझा मूल्य हैं। दोनों को विश्व में एक दूसरे की भूमिका और प्रभाव से मदद मिलती है।

आज जब भारत का मित्र देश अर्जेंटीना G २० समिट की मेजबानी कर रहा है तो यह हमारे लिए भी ख़ुशी और गर्व की बात है। इस समिट में जिन मुद्दों पर बात होगी, जैसे global economy, sustainable development, climate change, आर्थिक भगोड़े अपराधी, उनसे सिर्फ भारत या अर्जेंटीना का ही नहीं, सारे विश्व का हित जुडा है।

हमारे दोनों देशों के बीच आपसी सहयोग की अपार संभावनाए हैं। व्यापार, pharma, oil & गैस, IT और space, कई ऐसे क्षेत्र है जहाँ हम एक दूसरे की क्षमताओं का आपसी फायदा उठा सकते हैं।

भारत और अर्जेंटीना का सहयोग जल, थल और नभ हर जगह एक नए साझा और सुनहरे भविष्य की सृष्टि कर सकता है। इन संबंधों को नयी ऊँचाइयों पर ले जाने के लिए आप सब की भूमिका महत्वपूर्ण है। आप सब भारत के राष्ट्रदूत हैं। आप का योगदान वो पुल है जो हमारे दोनों देशों को जोड़ता है। आज योग हमे साथ लाया है। मैं चाहूँगा कि हम कई और ऐसे अवसर पैदा करें जिससे हमारे बीच संपर्क, संवाद और सहयोग बढ़े। और भारत और अर्जेंटीना के खुशनुमा टैंगो में विकास की और गति आये। आत्मीयता की और मिठास घुले।

साथियों, 

अर्जेंटीना में भारतियों और भारत के दोस्तों को मैं भारत को और विस्तार से जानने का आमंत्रण देता हूं। अर्जेंटीना में रहने वाले आप सभी भारतीय, जनवरी में काशी में होने वाले प्रवासी भारतीय दिवस में ज़रूर आएं और अर्जेटीना के अपने दोस्तों को भी साथ ले कर के आएं ।

इस दौरान प्रयागराज में अर्द्धकुंभ भी चल रहा होगा। उस अद्भुत अवसर का, भारत की सांस्कृतिक समृद्धि का, बदलते भारत का, न्यू इंडिया का दर्शन भी आप sab कर पाएंगे। मैं आपका आभारी हूं कि आपने मुझे भारत की, योग की बात साझा करने का अवसर दिया। मैं Art of Living को उनके प्रयासों के लिए साधुवाद देता हूं। 

सुश्री पात्रिसिया सोसा का भी आभार कि उन्होंने योग की इस सुरम्य संध्या को और भी सुरमय बना दिया।आप योग से यूँ ही जुड़ते रहे। योग दुनिया को यूं ही जोड़ता रहे।खुश रहिए, शांत रहिए, सुखी रहिए।

मूचास ग्रासियास.
धन्यवाद।

Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi's departure statement prior to attending the G-20 Summit.

“I will be visiting Buenos Aires from 29 November -01 December 2018 to attend the 13th G-20 Summit hosted by Argentina.

The G-20 seeks to promote multi-faceted cooperation among the twenty largest economies of the world. Through the ten years of its existence, G-20 has strived to promote stable and sustainable global growth. This objective is of particular significance for developing countries and emerging economies such as India, which is today the fastest growing large economy in the world.

India's contribution to global economic growth and prosperity underlines our commitment to “Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development”, which is the theme of the Summit.

I look forward to meeting leaders from other G-20 countries to review the work of G-20 in the last ten years of its existence and chart the ways and means to meet the new and upcoming challenges of the coming decade. We will deliberate on the situation of global economy and trade, international financial and tax systems, the future of work, women empowerment, infrastructure and sustainable development.

Emerging economies, which played a major role in revitalizing the growth in the global economy pursuant to the financial crisis are today facing unprecedented economic and technological challenges. I will highlight the need for reformed multilateralism which reflects the contemporary realities and can effectively strengthen collective action for global good. There is also a serious need to strengthen international cooperation and enhance coordinated action against fugitive economic offenders and financing of terrorism.

As in the past, I look forward to the opportunity to meet leaders on the sidelines of the Summit to exchange views on bilateral matters of mutual interest”.

                My dear countrymen, Namaskar. On the 3rd of October, 2014, the pious occasion of Vijayadashmi, we embarked upon a journey together through the medium of ‘Mann Ki Baat’. This journey has reached its 50th episode today. Thus, this Golden Jubilee Episode is indeed gilt-edged in every sense of the term. Your letters and phone calls this time pertain mostly to these 50 episodes. Anshu Kumar & Amar Kumar from Delhi on Mygov, Vikas Yadav from Patna; on similar lines Monica Jain from Delhi, Prosenjit Sarkar from Bardhaman, West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri from Nagpur converge in asking a shared question. They are of the view that broadly speaking, their Prime Minister being associated with the latest in technology, Social Media and Mobile Apps; WHY did he choose radio as a medium to connect with his countrymen? Your curiosity is but natural; in this age when Radio was fading into oblivion, why did Modi opt for the airwaves? Let me quote an incident. The year was 1998. I was then a party worker with the Bharatiya Janata Party organization in Himachal. It was the month of May; and I was travelling to a certain place. Evenings tend to get cold in the hilly terrain of Himachal Pradesh, and I stopped by at a wayside tea stall and placed an order for tea. It was a tiny joint; there was only one person who would make & serve tea. He was not even adequately clad; it was a standalone kiosk on the edge of the road. He first picked up a Laddoo from a glass container, offered the sweetmeat to me & said, “Sir, eat this before the tea get ready”. I was taken aback and asked him “What is the matter? Is it in celebration of an occasion like a wedding?” He replied, “No brother, nothing like that! Don’t you know? It’s a momentous, joyous occasion”. On seeing his rather jubilant exuberance, I asked him, “But what exactly happened?” And he replied, “India has exploded the bomb today!” I exclaimed, “India has exploded the bomb! I don’t get it!” Said he “Sir, just listen to the radio”. Indeed, that exactly was the topic of discussion on the radio. It was then that he elaborated on how on the day of the nuclear test, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had announced to the Media and how he broke into a dance on listening to it on the radio. It was matter of great intrigue to me to see a lone tea seller in a remote, snow - clad hilly place,who possibly kept listening to the radio the entire day… watching that particular effect of the news on radio led me to realize & internalise that this was a medium that was truly connected with the masses… and that it was a mighty means of getting across.

In terms of the reach & depth of communication, radio has been incomparable. I have been nursing that feeling ever since, acknowledging its power & strength. Hence when I became the Prime Minister, it was natural for me to turn towards a strong, effective medium. And in 2014, when I took charge as the Pradhan Sevak, Principal Servant, it was my wish to reach out to the masses with the glorious saga of our country’s unity, her grand history, her valour, India’s diversity, our cultural diversity, virtues embedded in our society such as Purusharth, Tapasya, Passion & sacrifice; in a nutshell, the great story of India. From remote villages to Metro cities, from farmers to young professionals … the array just prompted me to embark upon this journey of ‘Mann Ki Baat’. 

Every month, we would read letters to the tune of lakhs, listen to phone calls, watch comments on the App & Mygov. Weaving a common thread comprising them all into a fabric of informal conversation, we have been able to travel together, over this rather long distance of 50 episodes. Recently, All India Radio got a survey done on ‘Mann Ki Baat’. I came across some feedback that is very interesting. Out of the designated sample in the survey, 70% of respondents on an average happen to be listeners who regularly tune in to ‘’Mann Ki Baat’. Most people believe that the greatest contribution of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has been the enhancement of a feeling of positivity in our society. The medium of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has promoted many a mass revolution. #indiapositive has been the subject of quite an extensive discussion. This is an exemplary glimpse of the feeling of positivity, innate to our countrymen. People have shared their experiences, conveying the rise of selfless volunteerism as a consequence of ‘Mann Ki Baat’. It is a change where people are increasingly willing to contribute for the sake of service to society. I am overjoyed on account of the fact that through ‘Mann Ki Baat’, radio is rising as a popular medium, more than ever before. But it’s not about just radio… people are connecting with this programme and ensuring their participation through T.V., FM Radio, Mobile, Internet, Facebook Live; along with periscope, through the NarendraModiApp too. I express my gratitude to the entire family of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ for being a part of it & trusting it wholeheartedly.

Thank you very much for your phone call. Your apprehension is not misplaced. The fact is, if a leader gets hold of a microphone with assured listeners to the tune of millions, what else does he need? Significantly, some young friends have attempted a study on the myriad subjects touched upon, over the many episodes of ‘Mann Ki Baat’. They did a lexical analysis of all the episodes to calculate the frequency of occurrence of particular words; whether there were some words that were oft-repeated! One of their findings was that, this programme has remained apolitical. When ‘Mann Ki Baat’ commenced, I had firmly decided that it would carry nothing political, or any praise for the Government, nor Modi for that matter anywhere. The greatest bulwark in ensuring adherence to my resolve; in fact my highest inspiration, have been you. As a run up to each episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, the expectations & aspirations of listeners through their letters, online comments & phone calls are crystal clear. Modi may come and go, but this country will never let go of its UNITY & permanence, our culture will always be immortal. These minute stories encompassing a 130 crore countrymen will always stay alive. This new inspiration & zest will keep taking her to greater heights. At times, when I look back, I am taken aback. Sometimes people who write in from different corners of the country say, “We should not haggle beyond limits with marginal shopkeepers, auto drivers, vegetable sellers et al”. I read a letter & then try to weave it with the essence of a similar letter. I would like to share a couple of personal experiences with you … who knows how soon these will reach our families; who knows when social media will circulate them to usher in a revolution!. The stories that you’ve sent across in the context of cleanliness, myriad examples of common folk… you never know where a tiny brand ambassador of cleanliness comes into being in various homes; someone who reprimands elders at home; or even admonishingly orders the Prime Minister through a phone call!  

Who would have imagined that a small campaign “selfie with daughter”starting from a small village in Haryana would spread not only throughout the country but also across other countries as well. Every section of the society including celebrities joined in to ignite a process of transformation in a new modern language of change that the  present generation understands and follows. At times Mann Ki Baat is also sneered at but 130 crore countrymen ever occupy a special pleace in my heart. Their heartsand my heart beat to the same rhythm. Mann Ki Baat is not about the Government it is about the society. Mann Ki Baat addresses an aspirational India, an ambitious India. Politics or Political Power are not intrinsic to the Indian ethos; on the contrary social values and society are. In fact, Politics is one of the numerous other aspects of social life. Making politics an all pervasive, powerful factor is not an effective way for a healthy society. At times, political developments and political people assume such overriding prominence that other talents and courageous deeds get overshadowed. For ensuring a bright future for a country such as India, it isour collective responsibility to acknowledge and honour the common man’s talent and deeds and Mann Ki Baat is a humble and modest effort in this direction.

          Manythanks for your phone call. In a way your question were the a personal,amiable touch. I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50 episodes of Mann Ki Baat is that one feels like talking to a close acquaintance and not to the Prime Minister, and this is true democracy. If I reply to the question asked by you straightaway then I will say that I do not make any preparation. Actually, Mann Ki Baat is a very simpletask for me. Every time before Mann Ki Baat, letters are received from people; people share their ideas and view points on Mygov and Narendra Modi Mobile App and there is also a toll free number – 1800117800;and by calling on this number, people record messages in their own voice. My effort is that I read the maximum number of these letters and comments myself before Mann Ki Baat. I listen to many phone calls too. Andas the episode of Mann Ki Baat draws closer, I read ideas and inputs sent by you very minutely while travelling. 

          My countrymen stay in my heart every moment and that is how the writer’s situation and ideas expressed in the letter become part of my thought process. That letter does not remain a mere a piece of paper for me.As it is I have spent close to 40 to 45 years as a travelling mendicant and have been to most of the districts in our country including the remotest once where I spent a lot of time.That is why I am able to relate myself to the place and context of the letter. Then, I note down facts like the name of the village and of the person. Honestly speaking, Mann Ki Baat carries my voice but the examples, emotions and spirit represent my countrymen, I thank every person contributing to Mann Ki Baat. There are lakhs of persons whose names I have not been able to include in Mann Ki Baat but without any disappointment,they continue to sendin their letters and comments. I firmly believe that your ideas and your views will continue reaching me in even greater numbers and will help make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, effective and useful. An effort is also made that the concerned department should pay attention to such letters and comments which, somehow, could not be included in Mann Ki Baat. I also thank my colleagues from All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV Channels and the Social Media. It is due to their hard work that Mann Ki Baat reaches maximum number of people. The team from All India Radio prepares each episode for broadcast in a number of regional languages. Some of them very aptly narrate in a voice and style resembling that of Modi’s.In this way for those 30 minutes they become Narendra Modi. I congratulate and thank those persons for their talent and skills. I would request all of you also to kindly listen to this programme in your regional language as well. I sincerely thank from the core of my heart my friends in the media who regularly telecast Mann Ki Baat on their channels. No political person is ever happy with the media, he feels that he is getting a very little coverage or the coverage given to him is negative.But many issues raised in Mann Ki Baat have been adopted by the media. Issues such as cleanliness, Road safety, drugs free India, selfie with daughter have been taken up by the media and turn into campaigns. TV channels made it the most watched radio programme – I sincerely thank and congratulate the media. Without your contribution and cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.

 

 

PHONE CALL- 3 (NIDHI BAHUGUNA)

 

 

          Nidhi ji, many thanks for your phone call! To tell you the truth, I have no such secret. What I am doing must be happening in families as well. In simple words, I may say that I try to cast myself into the mould of that young man, and put myself under his conditions and try to adjust and match the wave length accordingly. There are old baggage’s of our own lives and when they do not come in the way, it becomes easier to understand others. Sometimes our inhibitions or prejudices become a big hurdle in communication. I prefer to understand the other man’s point of view rather than going through the process of acceptance, rejection and reaction. My experience has been that by adopting this approach, the other side also tries to come to our wave length rather than arguing or creating pressure in order to convince thereby removing the communication gap and both sides become co-travelers in our journey of idea-sharing. None of the two even realizes that how and when one other’s has abandoned its idea and accepted and owned the idea of the other side. 

          Today’s youths have this special quality that they won’t do anything which they do not believe themselves and whenever they believe in something, they follow that leaving everything else. People generally talk of a communication gap between the elders and teenagers in the family. In fact, the scope of discussion with teenagers is quite limited in most of the families. Most of the time these talks remain limited to studies, habits or life style and the “do’s” and “don’ts”. An open discussion without any expectations is gradually on the decline and this too is a matter of concern. 

          Communication will be more effective if we “accept” instead of “expect” and “discuss” instead of “dismiss”. My effort is to have a continuous dialogue with the youth in various programmes or through social media. I try to learn from whatever they are doing or whatever they are thinking. They are storehouse of ideas. They are extremely energetic, innovative and focused. I try to share the efforts and achievements of the youth as much as possible through “Mann Ki Baat”. There is a general complaint that the younger generation asks too many questions. I say it is good that the youth ask questions. 

          It is good as it shows that they want to analyse everything from its very root. Some people say that the youth do not have patience but my belief is that the youth do not have any time to waste- this is the point which helps the present day youth become more innovative because they want to accomplish things quickly. We feel that the youths are very ambitious today and they plan big. I feel it is good, dream big and achieve bigger successes; after all, this is “the New India”. Some people say that the younger generation wants to accomplish a many things at a time. I say what is wrong in it. They do so because they are adept in multitasking. If we just look around, we find that it is the youth who are bringing in transformation of society in a big way, may it be social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports or any other field. Those youth who have dared to ask questions and have had the courage to dream big. If we put these ideas of our youthinto practice and provide them conducive environment to express themselves, they surely will bring about a constructive and a positive change in the country- they are already doing so. 

          My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gurugram- has posted on MyGov that in Mann Ki Baat I should talk about the “Constitution Day” which falls on the26th November. She says that this day is special because we are going to enter into the 70th year of our Constitution adoption. Thank you very much for your suggestion Vineeta ji.

          Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day. A day to remember those great personalities who drafted our Constitution. Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949. The Constituent Assembly took 2 years 11 months and 17 days to accomplish this stupendous task of drafting the Constitution. Just imagine, these luminaries gave us such a comprehensive and detailed Constitution within a period of just less than 3 years. The extraordinary pace at which they drafted the Constitution is an example of Time Management and productivity to emulate even today. This also inspires us to accomplish our responsibilities within a record time. The Constituent Assembly was an amalgamation of the great talents of the country, each one of them was committed to provide a Constitution to the country which empowers the people of India and enriches even the poorest of the poor. 

          The unique point in our Constitution is that the rights and duties have been very comprehensively detailed. A balance between these two in the lives of our citizens will take our nation forward. If we respect the rights of others, our rights will automatically get protected and similarly if we fulfill our duties, then also our rights will get automatically protected. I still remember that in 2010 when 60 years of the adoption of the Constitution were being celebrated, we had taken out a procession by placing our Constitution atop an elephant. This has been a memorable incident to increase awareness about our Constitution among the youth and to connect them to the various aspects of the Constitution. In the year 2020, we shall complete 70 years as a Republic and in 2022, we shall enter 75th year of our Independence. 

          Let us all take forward the values enshrined in our Constitution and ensure Peace, Progress and Prosperity in our country. 

          My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contribution of that great man cannot be forgotten who played a pivotal role in the Constituent Assembly. This great man was none other than our revered Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar. His death anniversary or mahaparirvan divas falls on 6th December. I, on behalf of all countrymen, pay my homage to Baba Saheb who gave the right to live with dignity to crores of Indians. Democracy was embedded deep in Baba Saheb’s nature and he used to say that India’s democratic values have not been imported from outside. What is a republic and what is a parliamentary system- are nothing new to India. He had made a very moving appeal in the Constituent Assembly that we have to safeguard our hard fought democracy till the last drop of our blood. He also used to say that we, Indians may be from different background but, yes, we shall have to keep the national interest above all the other things. “India First” was the basic doctrine of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Once again my  humble tribute to revered Baba Saheb. 

          My dear countrymen, two days back on 23rd November, we all celebrated Shri Guru Nanak Dev Jayanti and next year in 2019 we shall be celebrating his 550th Prakash Parv. Guru Nanak Dev Ji always envisaged the welfare of entire humanity. He always showed the path of truth, work, service, kindness and amity to the society. The country will observe Guru Nahak Dev Ji’s 550th birth anniversary in a grand way, its soothing colours will not only spread in India alone but will get sprinkled the world over. All states and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate the occasion in a grand manner. Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in a similar manner in all the countries of the world as well. Besides, a train will be run on a route joining all the holy places connected with Guru Nanak Dev ji. Recently, while holding a meeting in this regard I  remembered about of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara. This Gurudwara suffered severe damage due to the devastating earth quake of 2001 in Gujarat. But, the manner in which the local people joined hands with the state Government in renovating it, is an example even today. 

          The Government of India has taken a significant decision of building Kartarpur corridor so that our countrymen could easily visit Kartarpur in Pakistan to pay homage to Guru Nanak Dev Ji at that holy sight. 

          My dear countrymen, we shall meet once again in the next episode after this 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat and I am sure that in this episode of Mann Ki Baat today I got an opportunity for the first time to talk to you about the spirit behind this programme because of your questions. But our journey shall continue. The more you connect with us, our journey will gain greater depth, providing, satisfaction to one and all. At times a question arises in the minds of people’s as to what I achieved through Mann Ki Baat. I would like to say today that of the feedback of this programme, one of the points that touches my heart most- is when people tell me that when we sit with all our family members to listen to Mann Ki Baat, we feel that the head of our family is sitting with us and sharing his ideas with us. When I heard this comment in a larger circle, I felt satisfied to know that I am yours, I am one amongst you, I am with you, you elevated me and in a way, and in this way I will continue to remain connected with you as a family member through Man Ki Baat. Your joys and sorrows are my joys and sorrows too; your expectations are my expectations also; your ambitions are my ambitions.

Come on, let us take this journey further. 

Many many thanks.

                My best wishes to you all for Guru Purab. Probably it's because of the blessings of Guru Nanak Dev ji and the great Guru Parampara that an ordinary person like me has got the opportunity to do some good and pious work. So, whatever good work is being done today is just because of the blessings of the elders and saintly men. We are of little significance. Therefore, I don't deserve this respect. These great personalities and the elders, who have, for centuries, created this nation and saved this nation with their sacrifices and penance, deserve all the respect.

When the devastating earthquake of Gujarat took place, the Lakhpat region of Kutch was also affected where the Gurdwara associated with Guru Nanak Dev ji existed. His wooden footwear is still there. The Gurdwara was ruined due to the earthquake. After I was elected as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the first task at hand was to undertake reconstruction work for the Kutch earthquake victims. I also visited the  badly damaged Gurdwara . With the blessings of the parampara, it dawned on to me that I would have to do something about it and I decided to rebuild it. However, there was one concern. We had to look for the right kind of people and the same material that was used to build it; exactly in the same way it used to be. Today that place is among the world heritage sites. 

After we started the UDAN scheme as a mode for cheap air travel, Nanded Sahib was one of the first two places that came under its ambit. I just hope that the blessings of Nanded Sahib remain with me. I was fortunate to have worked in Punjab for several years and consequently I could know and understand a lot of things by living in Punjab with you all, being close to Badal ji's family, which would not have been possible had I stayed in Gujarat. I always believed that there is a special relationship between Gujarat and Punjab because one of the 'Punj-Pyaare' belonged to Gujarat's Dwarika. Therefore, we have built a hospital after the name of Guru Govind Singh ji, in the Jamnagar district where Dwarika falls. The great personalities in every corner of our country had provided all the mantras of unity for our country and the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev ji have the essence of our country's cultural traditions. We can feel it in the Gurbani. We can feel oneness. Each word explains everything in a lucid way and guides us. It has addressed all the social evils and issues prevalent at that time like class differences very lucidly. It attempted to end the class and caste differences, to promote unity and to ensure that everything is done with devotion to God. May such great traditions keep inspiring everyone! Nothing can be greater than Gurbani, Guru Nanak ji's directions and message of unity and integrity. We have such a strong message for the country's unity and integrity.

I believe that whatever may have happened to Kartarpur in 1947 has happened. Certain things happen between the governments and the militaries; let it be so. When there will be a way out only time will tell that. However, people to people contact is a great strength. Who could have thought that the Berlin Wall would fall? Who knows, probably, with the blessings of Guru Nanak ji the Kartarpur corridor will not just be a corridor but could prove to be a reason for connecting people. Every word of Gurbani can provide us with strength. We are the people who have been brought up with the ideology of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'   i.e., ‘the world is one family'. We are those who never wish anything wrong for others. Just imagine, about 550 years ago when there were no proper means of transportation, Guru Nanak Dev ji had travelled the entire country from Assam to Kutch on foot. He had assimilated the entire India within himself through Padyatra. Such was his meditation and penance! Today, let this Gurpurab bring to all of us a new zeal, enthusiasm and inspiration that will give us all the strength for maintaining the country's unity and integrity. There is strength in togetherness. The great tradition of Langar is not just a system of serving food but is a value and our heritage. There is no discrimination. Such a great contribution has been made in such a simple way. On this holy occasion today, in the presence of the Guru Granth Sahib, bowing down to this great tradition, saluting the great sacrifices of the Gurus and their penance, the respect that you have given me, is not mine. This honour belongs to this great tradition. No matter how much we contribute, it's not enough. May we get all the strength to do better work! Once again I express my gratitude to you all.

                On stage, my cabinet colleagues Dharmendra Pradhan ji, Dr.Harsh Vardhan ji, all the dignitaries who are connected to us from different parts of the country with the help of technology, the industrialists who are present here today for the bidding process and all the dignitaries present here today.

Brothers and sisters,

We have been witness to the fact today how major tasks are being accomplished these days with determination for the future India. This day marks a significant step towards developing a next generation infrastructure in India. With the 9th bidding round, the work of establishing City Gas Distribution network in 129 districts of the country will start. Besides, the 10th bidding process has also started.

These beginnings are crucial because after the work gets completed, the outcome will be substantial! When the work that begins after the 10th bidding are on the verge of completion, then more than 400 districts of the country will come under the ambit of City Gas Distribution network. And I have been told that about 70% of the country's population will benefit out of it. This is a great achievement related to the country's development and for making the lives of the people better.

Friends,

Up to 2014, only 66 districts of the country were covered under the Gas Distribution network; that was the extent. Today, the work on city gas is underway in 174 districts of the country. In the next 2-3 years, it will reach more than 400 districts.

These are not insignificant statistics. This is a grand picture of how our cities have taken strong steps towards Gas based economy in the last four years. In 2014 about 25 lakh households had Piped Gas Connection. This number has increased almost two times in four years. After the commencement of work in these cities today, this number is expected to cross two crore. Similarly, in 2014 there were 947 CNG stations in the country. Let's not forget, about 25 years ago, CNG stations came up in three cities of the country - Delhi, Mumbai and Surat. The number of CNG stations reached up to 947 till 2014 since then. So on an average, about 40 stations came up per year. Now the number of these stations has increased to more than 1470. According to an estimate, by the end of the coming decade the number of CNG stations will cross 10 thousand.

Brothers and sisters,

After the four years of tireless work of the central government, the development of the City Gas Distribution network in the country will progress at a faster rate compared to before. We have made an effort to resolve every issue one after another such as the problems faced by the distributors and issues of silos and other problems of this sector.

The mantra of 'Reform, Perform and Transform' that I talk of, this sector is a perfect example of that. All the steps taken and the reforms brought by the government in the last four years have improved the performance of this sector and we are about to enter an era of transformation.

Friends,

Our country will complete 75 years of independence by the year 2022. The 130 crore Indians are making concerted efforts to create a great India, a New India; an India that is associated with modern technology and free of outdated systems. The energy sector of the country is being rejuvenated with this vision.

It is essential because the rising levels of economic activities in the country have increased the energy demand extensively. We need to keep in mind our commitment for clean energy along with fulfilling the rising demand for energy. We also need to show the world that development can take place without causing much harm to the environment. In such a scenario, more and more use of natural gas is essential for our country's energy needs.

We are striving to increase natural gas consumption by more than 2.5 times in the country by the end of next decade.

Therefore, the government is paying attention to all the dimensions of the Gas Based Economy. In order to strengthen the gas based infrastructure, we are working to increase the number of LNG terminals, and work is underway for Nationwide Gas Grid and City Gas Distribution. To enhance the import capacity of Liquid natural gas, old terminals are being modernized and new LNG Terminals are also being constructed.

The work on the new LNG terminals of Ennore in Tamil Nadu and Dhamra in Odisha at a cost of Rs.10 thousand crores has reached the final phase. Similarly, an ecosystem of National Gas Grid is being developed to deliver natural gas to the maximum number of districts in the country.

Under this, the work is underway on Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra pipeline projects. Also, this project is being extended from Barauni to Guwahati for connecting the other areas of the Northeast with the gas grid. Approximately Rs.13000 crores will be spent on these projects.

These projects will provide a new lease of life to the three fertilizer plants of Gorakhpur, Barauni and Sindri. A joint venture named Indradhanush gas grid at a cost of more than Rs.9200 crores has been created to connect every Northeastern state including Sikkim with this Gas Grid.

Friends,

The interests of those investing in this sector are also being protected. The prices of the domestic gas market have already been linked to that of the global gas market. The companies have been provided marketing and pricing freedom to increase the production of gas domestically. 

An independent transport system operator has been created for keeping track of the gas prices and for operating the gas grid. At the same time, the government is also working on developing the gas trading exchange to create an environment of free gas market in the country and to maintain transparency in this sector.

Brothers and sisters,

With these technical aspects and statistics, it is essential for all of us that these work and projects have a positive impact on the country. These projects will bring a sea change in the country at the social level, the economic level and the environmental level.

Friends,

When a new system is in place in any area, it also creates an ancillary eco system for the surrounding areas. For example, if a hospital is built in an area, then medical stores, dhaba, restaurants, tea stalls, dharamshalas, small hotels will come up around the hospital. Even auto stands and taxi stands will come up. Even though they work independently but their existence is based upon the hospital.

Similarly, when gas reaches a city, it creates an ecosystem. In such cities, the number of gas-based big and small units increases manifold. Direct gas pipelines to the houses of the people make their ease of living better. Thousands and lakhs of youngsters will get employment in the area of establishing the network of CNG or PNG pipelines. All the autos, taxis and cars running in that city get a modern alternative fuel. All the schemes related to the gas infrastructure that have been implemented in the country will provide job opportunities to lakhs of people.

The work that has started under the 9th bidding itself will provide jobs to at least 3 lakh youngsters directly. Besides, after the other facilities develop, it will open up new opportunities of employment for lakhs of people. The Eastern and the Northeastern states will particularly benefit. In short, the gas-based systems will not only change the industries but also the lifestyles of the people of the concerned districts.

You all will be witness to the change in the coming years and will be a part of the change. We are fortunate in this case that we are witnessing the change in our lifetime. Otherwise, I also remember the time when the common man had to stand in long queues to get the letter of recommendation from Parliamentarians in order to get a gas connection in his house. The country has come a long way since then.

It won't be wrong if I say that in 2014, the people not only changed the government but also the government's work culture and the ways of implementing schemes. Today on this occasion, I would like to give you another example of this very sector. We talk of gas-based economy; but we must not forget that LPG connection was being provided since 1955. Since then up to 2014, 13 crore LPG connections were given i.e. 13 crore in 60 years. All the resources, the people, the files, the offices and the working style of the bureaucrats are the same, yet in 4 years, about 12 crore connections have been given.

13 crore connections have been provided in 60 years, whereas 12 crores in just four years. If the work progressed at that pace, the benefits wouldn't have reached the families even after two generations later. The level of domestic gas coverage prior to 2014 was 55 per cent. Now it has increased to 90 per cent. Certainly the Ujjwala Yojana has played a crucial role in it. Since its inception on 1 May 2016, almost 6 crore women have been given free gas connections under the scheme till date. This scheme has transformed the way of living of the people in villages.

 

Amidst the bidding process and the foundation stone laying programme, we must give a thought to the women who had to breathe in the smoke of the fuel wood. She was feeding the entire family by putting her life at stake. Even though those women might not understand the meaning of a gas-based economy, but the country's steps towards gas-based economy has definitely transformed their lives.

Brothers and sisters,

I talked about the environment a short while ago. The gas-based economy, towards which we are moving, will have a great and positive impact on the environment. When the country will have thousands of new CNG stations, the industries will get constant supply of gas, most of the districts in the country will have sufficient CNG for taxis, autos and cars.  It will reduce pollution considerably. It will also strengthen the India's commitment to COP21. It will strengthen India's contribution to the protection of the world environment. It will enhance India's glimmer on global platform in leading the world. 

Friends,

The government's efforts towards clean energy are immense and wide. The government has also started a scheme to convert the agricultural waste and biomass into compressed biogas. Under this scheme, 5000 compressed biogas plants will be set up in the country in the next five years. 

These plants will not only solve the problems of stubble burning and agri-waste but will also help the farmers to increase their incomes. Besides, work is underway to establish 12 modern bio refineries at a cost of Rs.10 thousand crores to convert biomass into biofuel. All the policy reforms related to ethanol blending brought about by the government has led to a record increase in ethanol blending.

In 2014, about 40 crore litres of ethanol used to be blended. Now it has increased by four times. The government's aim is to increase the ethanol blending to 10%. Next year, ethanol blending will be 8 times more than what it used to be in 2014.

The government which is moving towards clean environment from clean energy has decided to directly shift to BS-6 fuel from BS-4. In the Telecom sector, we shifted from 2G to 4G and from 4G to 5G but here we moved directly from BS-4 to BS-6. Besides, reduction in the prices of LED bulbs and distribution of about 32 crore LED bulbs have reduced the carbon dioxide emissions by more than 3 crore tonnes.

 

The government is working to achieve the goal of generating 175GW of renewable energy by 2022. Under this, at least 100GW energy will be produced by solar energy. In the next 4 years, the mission of distributing more than 28 lakh solar pumps to the farmers has been going on. With the development of gas-based infrastructure these efforts will help India to fulfil the global commitments.

For one thing, India will reduce its emission intensity up to 33-35% by 2030. Secondly, it will fulfil 40% of its energy requirements by non-conventional energy sources.

Brothers and sisters,

India is committed to achieve the goals related to gas-based economy or clean energy and we will achieve them. These resolutions are not only for us, but also for the humanity and the future generations and fulfilling the resolutions is the responsibility of all of us.

Once again my best wishes to all of you, to the people of the cities where the work of City Gas Distribution network has begun and the representatives associated with the 10th bidding. With that, I conclude my speech.

 

Thanks a lot!

                The Finance Minister Mr. Arun Jaitley ji, Commerce and Industry Minister Shri Suresh Prabhu ji, Vice President of the World Bank, Mr. Schafer, Anand Mahindra ji, Rashesh Shah ji, Soumitra Bhattacharya ji, B.K Goenka ji, Ramesh Bharti Mittal Ji,  representatives from the world of business and the other dignitaries present here. I welcome all of you at Lok Kalyan Marg. One of the reasons for inviting you all here today is to not only offer my best wishes for Diwali but also to congratulate and express my gratitude to you all for you have pulled out the country from a difficult and undesirable situation to a respectable one. You have carried the nation to new heights in terms of Ease of Doing Business. I would like to thank everyone including the ones who are not present here today. 

The innumerable government officials, employees, officials in different positions in Municipal Corporation, officials who are supposed to give clearances at the Port and the airport and the people from the business world too have played a significant role in this. I remember that four and a half years ago when I had said for the first time that we would be in the top 50 in the coming years, many people dismissed it believing it to be outlandish. It was difficult for the people to believe that India could find her place even in top 100 considering the instability and policy paralysis that were prevalent prior to 2014. So, I believe it was not the fault of such people. It was quite natural for the people not to believe what I had said back then, as  all they could read and hear in news was about corruption, scams, unstable economy, uncontrolled fiscal deficit and the world saying that India would skid and drown the other countries as well. But you can see the 180 degree change that swept the nation in just four years.

In terms of Ease of Doing Business, we have jumped from 142nd rank to 77th rank. We have crossed almost half of it.

 

Friends,

This is a jump of 65 points in just four years. This is an unprecedented record for any country. Today, India is ranked one in South Asia in terms of Ease of Doing Business while we were ranked 6, four years ago. For the second consecutive year, India has joined the list of top 10 countries in terms of such improvement levels. In the last 7-8 years, no other country has made an improvement of 53 ranks within two years.

Friends, 

We could accomplish something that no one around the world could have imagined ever.

We are just a few steps away from our goal of reaching the top 50. As per the World Bank report, India has improved its performance in 8 out of 10 parameters. In two parameters, we have made a jump of more than 100 ranks.

We are continuously working with the State Governments on the goals of improving the rank, to bring an atmosphere of change in the country. Our state governments have enthusiastically participated to strengthen cooperative competitive federalism further. Now we are moving towards the implementation of the reforms related to Ease of Doing Business at district level. We are continuously in touch with the stakeholders and the state governments to decide upon the roadmap for the same. Efforts are being made to create a single ranking system at district level in the states. We are trying to provide rankings to the districts so that there is a competition amongst the districts with an enthusiasm to move ahead. 

Friends,

Business, trade and entrepreneurship are needed for our country's growth, infrastructure development, increase in employment opportunities and per capita income. This will be possible only when investment takes place and the business and trade moves in the right direction and the common man benefits out of it. Therefore, we are emphasizing on policy driven governance and predictable transparent policies. We are trying to reduce discretion. Many of you must have realized that the rankings assigned by the World Bank often do not take into consideration several parameters or things that we are working on. The rankings are calculated on the basis of only few parameters while our strategy of Reform, Perform and Transform is extensive. In fact, the aim of our strategy for bringing about reforms goes beyond the World Bank rankings. We are working towards making the lives of the common man, the small businessmen easier and to improve their ease of living. As the Ease of Doing Business is improving in our country today, it is helping the small businessmen to carry out their businesses smoothly; they can comfortably transport their goods to other cities; people are getting electricity connection easily and receiving government approvals and important permits fast. These are the efforts that tend to inspire the aspirations of the people of India and the needs and expectations of the country have been taken into consideration.

Friends,

Several other important decisions have been taken to make the country's business environment transparent. Our government has transformed not only the mindset but also the approach. The GST, demonetization, law related to Benami property, insolvency code or laws related to fugitive economic criminals are all examples of this commitment. Due to these efforts of the government, the country's corrupt are now fearful and the honest people are getting due prestige.  Now more and more people have started paying taxes. They have started believing that their money paid in tax is being utilized in a correct way.

Friends,

You are also aware of the fact that these decisions and reforms were not easy. The techniques had to be modified; the laws and the software had to be changed. Sometimes, changing the software is easy but changing the habit is more challenging. It was not an easy task to prepare the system for these reforms. But we were successful in accomplishing this task within a very short span of time. Today we are moving in the direction of making the various levels of the entangled system business and citizen friendly. In the last four years, more than 1400 archaic laws in the country have been done away with. Earlier it used to take 1500 days on an average to resolve a commercial dispute -1500 days which means 4 years. After a lot of effort, the time period has been reduced to 400 days. We are striving to reduce it further. Before 2014, the time taken for clearance of imported products was on an average 280 hours which has now been reduced to less than 144 hours. We will shorten this time as well. Earlier the environmental clearances used to take years and months but now it takes only a few weeks. Recently, environmental clearances for the construction work and other menial work have been decentralized and entrusted to the local bodies. GST has strengthened the country's logistics sector. The turn-around time has now decreased by almost 15 per cent compared to previous regime. It has saved time and money of the companies. Earlier the businessmen had to fill up 50-60 different registers to follow labour laws. Our government has reduced the number of these registers to just 5. That is, the same work that required 50-60 registers is being easily done by 5 registers. The old system has been changed forever. Similarly, earlier it used to take 3-4 weeks for getting passports, while now people get their passports in less than a week. Earlier people had to wait for 8-10 months for receiving their income tax refunds but the same thing is being done in a few weeks now. You might remember that about 4-5 years back news such as - railway reservation website getting crashed due to heavy traffic, used to make headlines. We have upgraded and updated the website to handle heavy traffic and it has helped crores of railway passengers. Initiatives like the cleanliness campaign being run from the streets to the railway platforms are all for improving the quality of life of the common man. The government has made modifications in the laws to ensure that women don't face any difficulty working in night shifts. Laws have also been modified to ensure that the small shopkeepers and businessmen can keep their shops open till late at night.

Friends,

Recently we have made a major effort for the MSME sector. Now the businessmen associated with GST will get loans of up to Rs.1 crore in just 59 minutes. Besides, decisions have been taken to increase the production, to increase the scope of the market and to avoid the hassles associated with licensing and investigation. The institutions or companies which are creating new job opportunities are also being given financial assistance under the Pradhan Mantri Rozgar Protsahan Yojana. Under this scheme, the government is making 8.3 percent of the EPF contribution for three years on creating new job opportunities. The government has also changed the Apprenticeship Act and is implementing a new apprenticeship incentive scheme. Under the scheme, when the employer keeps apprentice, the government pays one fourth amount of the stipend to them. Many industries are joining this system.

Friends,

I am a person who believes in Minimum Government and Maximum Governance. Consequently, India's present image is being enhanced by the fact that it's moving on the trajectory of improvement. Reforms are underway to make the lives of the people easier. India's position has either improved or is in the process of improvement in the rankings of IMF, Moody's, World Economic Forum or UNCTAD. More importantly, these institutions are fully confident and optimistic about the future of India, given the progress and speed of our reforms.

Friends,

These relentless efforts will soon place India into the 5 trillion dollar club. In order to accomplish this goal, we need to improve every sector of the economy. We also need to keep in mind that the definitions of the different sectors are changing. Now manufacturing and services are becoming complementary to each other. There is a value addition in the Manufacturing Sector from the Services Sector and some of the factors of Manufacturing Sector improve the Services Sector. New technologies, Artificial Intelligence and Information Technology have now become an essential part of manufacturing ecosystem. We must keep this change in mind.

Friends,

The government is working on the Industrial Policy for better implementation of basic changes and incorporating realities into development; a policy that can understand the industry in new ways and explain the new dimensions to the industry. These industrial policies will be in line with the new vision of the entrepreneurs of New India. The importance of Ease of Doing Business will remain intact in this industrial policy.

Friends,

We now have to make concerted efforts to get into the top 50 in the rankings of the Ease of Doing Business. In the coming days, I am going to organize review meetings with different departments related to this topic. The decisions that will be implemented by December this year will impact the rankings next year. All your efforts in every sector such as clean energy sector, digital world, health sector, mobility will take the nation forward and make it self-reliant. In today's system, human intervention needs to be minimized in all the processes. For this to fructify, there is a dire need for maximizing the use of modern digital technology in every area of life. We must develop a work culture in which people will not have to visit a government office or agency office to submit forms, documents and fees. Such a work culture will strengthen policy driven governance. We need your suggestions to deliver the benefits of Ease of Doing Business and Ease of Living to every citizen of the country.

Friends,

The self-confidence and faith that you possess right now is my greatest strength. I welcome every advice and suggestion from you. Mahendra ji was saying that even the corporate sector doesn't set targets the way Modi ji is setting. The people of Gujarat are taught in their childhood or may be every child is taught the same - 'Nishan chook Maaf, Nahi Maaf Nichu Nishan'. This means that one can forgive a target missed but not if the target is set lower. This has been my mantra that the goal set should be within our reach but not in the grip. It should appear that we will be able to catch it if we jump. One should believe that it is close. With this psychology I am in a habit of setting the targets. I believe that this concept has emerged in our country and has been producing results.

 

And once again, I end my speech by congratulating you all.

Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched the Ease of Doing Business Grand Challenge at an event in Lok Kalyan Marg in New Delhi.

The objective of this challenge is to invite innovative ideas based on Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, Blockchain and other cutting edge technology to reform Government processes. The platform for the Grand Challenge is the Startup India Portal. 

Addressing the gathering on this occasion, the Prime Minister complimented industry representatives and all others present, for their efforts in improving India’s ranking in “Ease of Doing Business (EoDB).”

He recalled that when he had first articulated his vision for India to break into the Top 50 in EoDB rankings in the years to come, it was greeted with skepticism. He added, however, that a great improvement is now visible in just four years. He said the EoDB rank has improved by 65 spots in this period. He said India now ranks first in South Asia, and is just some steps away from the Top 50 target. He said that the Union and State Governments have both worked together towards improving EoDB, in the spirit of cooperative, competitive federalism. 

The Prime Minister said that the Union Government has laid stress on Policy Driven Governance and Predictable Transparent Policies. He said that the reforms being undertaken by the Union Government are also aimed at improving ease of living for the common people. He said, today small entrepreneurs can do business more easily, and simple things like getting an electricity connection have got easier. He said that in the last four years, more than 1400 archaic laws have been repealed. He said dramatic reductions have been achieved in areas such as time taken for resolution of commercial disputes, and time taken for clearing imported goods. He listed a number of other areas, where great improvements have been made. He mentioned the efforts made for the MSME sector, such as approval for loans upto Rs 1 crore in 59 minutes. 

The Prime Minister said that organizations such as IMF and Moody’s, today appear confident and optimistic about India’s future. The Prime Minister said that the aim is to make India a 5 trillion dollar economy in the shortest possible time. He said that for this, improvement is necessary in every sector of the economy. He said that the Union Government is also working towards an industrial policy which will be more reflective of current realities, and will be in accordance with the new vision of the entrepreneurs of New India. He exhorted the gathering to work towards achieving the target of a Top 50 position in EoDB rankings. 

The Prime Minister said that it is necessary to reduce human intervention in processes, and increase the use of modern and digital technologies. He said that a work culture based on this, will further promote policy driven governance.

                Governor of Haryana Mr. Satyadev Narayan Arya Ji, the popular Chief Minister of Haryana Mr. Manohar Lal Ji Khattar, my cabinet colleagues Chaudhary Virendra Singh ji and Rao Inderjit Singh ji; all the ministers of the state government, some are sitting here and some are sitting there; and my dear brothers and sisters of Haryana who are present here in large numbers.

Just now, the Chief Minister of Haryana was telling that I had got the opportunity to be present amongst you several times; and now I have come once again just within a short span of time. The last time when I had come here, I had got the opportunity to inaugurate the huge statue of Chaudhary Chhotu Ram ji. This statue is the symbol of Haryana's pride. Today, once again, I am in Haryana.  The state has received more than Rs.3300 crores. Today Haryana has taken another robust step towards all-round development.

Friends,

There is not only light of knowledge but also stories of courage on the land of Haryana. Yesterday marked 56th anniversary of Ladakh's Rezangla Pass war that took place at a height of 18000 feet. The sons of Haryana under the leadership of Param Vir Chakra awardee Major Shaitan Singh had fought valiantly in the battle. Many of the martyrs belonged to this region of Haryana. They had shown everyone that Haryana stands for courage, patience and intelligence. I pay tribute to the brave soldiers of the country who died on the Rezang La Post, and I salute them.

Friends,

This day is extremely significant for Haryana. I have got the opportunity to dedicate the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway to the nation. The first phase was completed two years ago. The second phase, 83km long stretch from Kundli to Manesar has been launched today. With this, the 135km long expressway is now ready. At the same time, the Ballabhgarh-Mujesar metro line built at a cost of Rs.500 crores has also been started. These two projects will bring a revolution in connectivity in this region and at the same time the youth of this region will get a boost through Shri Vishvakarma Kaushal University.

Brothers and sisters,

Today's event calls for comparing two scenarios. One is that of the present which says that when we do something with a resolution, it gets fulfilled. This scenario represents the work culture and modus operandi of the governments of Bharatiya Janata Party. The second scenario depicts the work culture of the previous government and constantly reminds us of that. You should have got the expressway 8-9 years ago. However, that was not the case. The work culture of the previous government stretched the work of expressway for 12 years.

Friends,

This expressway was supposed to be ready during the Commonwealth Games. But whatever has happened to the Commonwealth Games, the same is the fate of this expressway. I clearly remember that when I started reviewing the project in the PRAGATI meetings, several lapses were detected. The continuous follow-up by the central government and the acceleration in the work after the BJP government came to power in Haryana resulted in this day. It ended the age-old wait.

Brothers and sisters,

Just imagine, halting and suspending the work had caused a great loss to the people of Haryana and the entire Delhi NCR. The way the previous government worked is a case study that depicts how the public money is wasted and how injustice is inflicted upon the public. At the inception of this project, the estimated cost was Rs.1200 crores. After all these years, the cost has escalated by more than three times. If this work of peripheral expressway was completed on time, the traffic scenario in Delhi would have been different. With this expressway, the compulsion of the heavy vehicles coming from other states to pass through Delhi will end. The traffic will pass through the outskirts without entering Delhi or affecting its traffic. With this expressway, the number of vehicles entering Delhi will considerably fall.

Friends,

This expressway will play an important role to reduce the pollution in Delhi and nearby locations. In a way, this expressway will boost the idea of ease of living and ease of travelling along with the economy and environment. I congratulate the people of Haryana and Delhi NCR for this expressway. A network of the expressway with a length of 270km has been completed around Delhi.

Brothers and sisters,

Today Mujesar has been connected to Ballabhgarh through metro rail. Now Ballabhgarh too is on the metro map. This will not only help the people here to travel to Delhi but also save their time and money.

Friends,

Our government considers connectivity to be not only a need but also a medium of country's development, security and empowerment. We are making efforts to build such an infrastructure of road connectivity, rail connectivity, water connectivity, highway connectivity and I-way connectivity that meets the needs of the 21st century and supports each other. Right now, work is underway at an unprecedented rate across the country on several railway corridors and highway corridors. In several cities of the country, work is underway for an Integrated Traffic Management System at a rapid pace. We are working towards ensuring less travel time for the people, reducing traffic jams and access to alternative modern and cheap modes of transport for the industries. Along with all these efforts, we also try to ensure preservation of the environment. For this, such modes of transport are being promoted that will help in reducing pollution. The extension of electric rail lines and developing resources for electric cars are taking us towards this direction.

Friends,

We have focused upon speed for the new generation infrastructure in the country. In the last four years, the government has constructed highways with a total length of more than 33000km at a cost of Rs.3 lakh crores. We have constructed more highways in just four years compared to the highways constructed by the previous government in 7.5 years. 

Friends,

The people, the workers, the offices and the files are the same but when we are willing and determined, then any goal can be accomplished. This is the reason why prior to 2014, the highway was constructed at a rate of 12km per day. Today it is 27km per day. At this pace, under the Bharatmala project, the work for constructing 35000km of highways is going on at a rapid pace. The work is underway at a rapid pace not only in case of the highways but also for the railway connectivity. A network of railway is being established in the areas that didn't even have railway lines; railways lines are being extended in the areas wherever required.

Friends,

Our government has always taken into consideration the requirements of the country and the hopes and aspirations of the people. Accordingly, the speed of the trains is being increased; the trains and the stations are being modernized. You must have seen that even the modern train without an engine is now all set to run on the tracks in India. This train is enhancing the sheen of Make in India.

Brothers and sisters,

The government is also emphasizing on optimum utilization of the country's human resource and water resources. More than 100 waterways are being constructed in the country. Just a few days ago, the country's first cargo container reached Varanasi through riverine route. Now goods are being transported on ships sailing on the Banares-Haldia waterway. UP is now linked to the Northeastern states through Mother Ganga. Simultaneously, the UDAN scheme is in operation for making air travel cheaper in the country. An airport has been constructed here in Hisar so that it gets connected with the UDAN scheme. Brothers and sisters, because of government’s policies, the common man now can travel by flights.

Friends,

Under Digital India Mission, the work of connecting the Panchayats with Broadband is progressing at a rapid pace. Please keep in mind that the previous government connected only 59 Panchayats with Optical Fibre Network in four years, whereas our government linked more than 1 lakh Panchayats with Optical Fibre Network in four years. Only fifty-nine on the one hand, and 1 lakh on the other! 

Friends,

Growing connectivity also brings several new employment opportunities. The benefits of this entire ecosystem like construction of highways, metro or rail or development of waterways help in transport, construction, manufacturing and services sectors. I am glad that the government of Haryana is not only providing new employment opportunities to the youth but also emphasizing upon preparing them for the changing ways of employment. Laying the foundation stone of the Shri Vishvakarma Kaushal University is a major step in this direction. This University will provide skill training to the youth of Haryana as per the changing nature of jobs. This University will provide the education and empowerment to the youngsters to start their own business. I sincerely hope that with the blessings of Lord Vishwakarma, the god of skill, the path of the future will be easier for the students of this University.

Brothers and sisters,

Today, Haryana is one of the leading states in terms of exports. Of these, more than 22000 small scale industries and the MSMEs have made a significant contribution. This Kaushal University will strengthen the MSME sector of this region. The students passed out of this University will produce goods with the principle of Zero Defect Zero Effect and will enhance the sheen of Make in India.

Friends,

You must be aware of the fact that recently 12 major decisions have been taken to promote the MSME sector. Now my small businessmen of Haryana associated with the GST will easily get loans of up to Rs.1 crore in just 59 minutes. Besides, many decisions have been taken to increase the production, to increase the scope of the market and for its easy operation.

Brothers and sisters,

This government wants to empower the country's entrepreneurs and is pushing the youngsters towards industry through innovation. It is taking care of the fact that their concept shall not fail to get the support of capital. Stand-up India and Start-up India have been implemented keeping this idea in mind. Just because of this idea, the youngsters of the country have been given loans of Rs. 6 lakh 70 thousand crores without bank guarantee under the MUDRA Yojana. Most importantly, more than 70% of the loan raisers through the MUDRA Yojana are women. This scheme, in a way, has become a major medium of women’s self-employment and certainly my daughters and sisters of Haryana are also getting the benefits of this scheme.

Friends,

Our government is relentlessly working to make the lives of the women easier. Be it the Swacch Bharat Mission that built 9 crore toilets; or the Ujjwala Yojana that provided approximately 6 crore gas connections, both have made the lives of the women easier. Haryana too has fully cooperated with the central government to promote its vision. The success of ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' campaign and Khelo India is the greatest example of this. The largest numbers of medals are being grabbed by the sons and the daughters of this state. Be it the Commonwealth Games or the Asiad, the victorious bugle of the daughters and youngsters of Haryana can be heard across the world.

Brothers and sisters,

The BJP governments, of the centre and the states; of Haryana or Rajasthan, MP or Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh or northeastern India, is working with the mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. The outcome is quiet discernible today at a great level. I am glad that the people of Haryana are actively collaborating in all these efforts. Once again I congratulate you all for the foundation stone laying ceremony and dedication to the nation of the Western Peripheral Expressway, Metro and Skill University. Thank you very much!

We in India strongly desire to see a democratic, prosperous and peaceful Republic of Maldives. 

I will convey to the new Maldivian Government of Mr. Solih the desire of my Government to work closely for realisation of their developmental priorities, especially in areas of infrastructure, health care, connectivity and human resource development. 

I am confident that my visit will herald a new era of even closer exchanges and cooperation between our two countries”.

                Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam, a voice of influence in the world of finance,Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of Monetary Authority of Singapore, a leading institution in fintech,Tens of thousands of participants from over one hundred countries, 

Namaskar! 

It is a great honour to be the first Head of Government to deliver the keynote address at Singapore Fintech Festival.

This is a tribute to the youth of India with its eyes firmly fixed to the future.

It is an acknowledgement of the financial revolution sweeping through India and transforming the lives of 1.3 billion people.

This is an event of finance and technology and, it is also a festival. 

This is the season of the Indian Festival of Lights – Deepawali. It is celebrated all over the world as a victory of virtue, hope, knowledge and prosperity. The Diwali lights are still on in Singapore.

The Fintech Festival is also a celebration of belief. 

Belief in the spirit of innovation and the power of imagination. 

Belief in the energy of youth and their passion for change. 

Belief in making the world a better place. 

And, it is no surprise that in just its third year, this Festival is already the world’s largest.

Singapore has been a global hub for finance and, it is now taking a leap into the digital future of finance.

It was here, in June this year, that I launched India’s RuPay card and the first international remittance mobile app using India’s world class Unified Payment Interface or UPI.

Today, I will have the honour to launch a global platform to connect fintech firms and financial institutions, beginning with ASEAN and Indian banks and fintech companies.

India and Singapore are also working to connect Indian and ASEAN small and medium enterprises, anchored on an Indian platform, and expand it globally.

Friends, 

I have heard of an advice going around in start-up circles. 

● To increase your Venture Capital or VC funding by 10 percent, tell the investors you run a ""platform”, not a regular business.

● If you want to increase your VC funding by 20 percent, tell the investors that you are operating in the ""fintech space”.

● But, if you really want the investors to empty their pockets, tell them that you are using ""blockchain” .

It tells you of the excitement and promise of emerging technologies to transform the world of finance.

Indeed, history has shown that finance is often the first to embrace new technology and connectivity.

Friends, 

We are in an age of a historic transition brought about by technology. 

From desktop to cloud, from internet to social media, from IT Services to Internet of Things,we have come a long way in a short time. There is daily disruption in businesses.

The character of the global economy is changing. 

Technology is defining competitiveness and power in the new world. 

And, it is creating boundless opportunities to transform lives. 

I had said at the United Nations in 2014 that we have to believe that development and empowerment can spread with the same speed at which Facebook, Twitter or mobile phones have spread.

Across the world, that vision is rapidly changing into reality. 

In India, it has transformed governance and delivery of public services.It has unleashed innovation, hope and opportunities.It has empowered the weak and brought into mainstream those who were on the margins .It has made economic access more democratic.

My government came to office in 2014 with a mission of inclusive development that would touch the lives of every citizen – the weakest in the remotest village.

That mission needed a solid foundation of financial inclusion for all – a task that was not easy in a country of India’s size.

Yet, we wanted to achieve this in months, not years that conventional wisdom suggested.

With the power of fintech and the reach of digital connectivity, we have started a revolution of unprecedented speed and scale.

To begin with financial inclusion has become a reality for 1.3 billion Indians. We have generated more than 1.2 billion biometric identities – called Aadhaar or foundation - in just a few years.

With our Jan DhanYojana, we aimed to give a bank account to every Indian. In three years, we have opened 330 million new bank accounts.These are 330 million sources of identity, dignity and opportunities.

Less than 50 percent of Indians had bank accounts in 2014; now, it is nearly universal.

So today, more than a billion biometric identities, more than a billion bank accounts and more than a billion cell phones give India by far the biggest public infrastructure in the world.

More than Rupees 3.6 lakh crore, or 50 billion dollars of benefits from government have reached the people directly.

No longer must a poor citizen in a remote village travel long distances or pay off middle-men to get her rights.

No longer can fake and duplicate accounts bleed government finances. We have saved over Rupees 80,000 crore, or 12 billion dollars in prevented leakages.

Now, millions who lived on the edge of uncertainty receive insurance in their accounts; and, have access to the security of pension in old age.

A student can get her scholarship directly into her account. No longer will she be lost in end-less paper chase.

Banking has come to doorsteps even in remote villages through 400,000 micro ATMs based on Aadhaar.

And now, this digital infrastructure has helped launch the world's largest healthcare scheme this year. 'Ayushman' will provide affordable health insurance to 500 million Indians.

It has also helped us extend 145 million loans for small entrepreneurs through Mudra scheme. In four years, they amount to Rupees 6.5 lakh crore, or 90 billion dollars. Nearly 75 percent of these loans have gone to women.

Just a few weeks ago, we launched the India Post Payments Bank. Over 150 thousand post offices across India and 300,000 postal service employees are using technology to provide house to house banking.

Of course financial inclusion also needs digital connectivity. 

More than 120,000 village councils in India have already been connected by nearly 300,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables.

Over 300,000 Common Service Centres have brought digital access to villages. They give our farmers better access to land records, credit, insurance, market and the best price. They deliver health services and hygiene products to women.

None of this would have been as effective without the other big change brought about by fintech – the digitisation of payments and transactions in India.

India is a nation of diverse circumstances and challenges.Our solutions must also be diverse.Our digitization is a success because our payment products cater to everyone.

For those with mobile and internet, the BHIM-UPI is the world’s most sophisticated, simpleand seamless platform for payments between accounts, using a virtual payment address.

For those who have a mobile, but no internet, there is U.S.S.D. system in 12 languages.

And, for those who have neither mobile nor internet, there is Aadhar Enabled Payment System, which uses biometrics. And, it has already registered a billion transactions and grown six-fold in two years.

RuPay is bringing payment cards within the reach of all.Over 250 million of these are with those who did not have a bank account 4 years ago.

From cards to QRs and wallets, digital transactions in India are growing rapidly. Today, 128 banks in India are connected to UPI.

Transactions on UPI grew 1500 times in the last 24 months. Every month, the value of transaction is growing by over 30 percent.

But, more than the pace, I am inspired by the opportunities, efficiency, transparency and convenience that digital payment is generating.

A shopkeeper can go online to reduce his inventory and speed up collections. 

For a fruit grower, a farmer or a rural artisan , the markets are direct and closer, earnings are higher,and payments are faster.

A worker collects wages or remits money home quickly without giving up a day’s work.

Every digital payment saves time. It adds to a huge national saving. It is increasing productivity of individuals and our economy.

It also helps improve tax collection and inject fairness in the economy. 

Even more, digital payments are a gateway to a world of possibilities. 

Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence are helping us build a whole range of value added services for people.This includes credit to those with little or no credit history.

Financial inclusion also extends to micro, small and medium enterprises. 

They are all coming on the nation-wide Goods and Services Tax digital network, launched just over a year ago.

Banks are reaching out to them with credit. Alternative lending platforms are offering innovative financing models. They no longer have to look at informal markets for credit at high interest rates.

And, just this month, we committed to approve loans up to Rupees 1 crore, or one 150,000 dollars for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises within 59 minutes - without even visiting a bank. This is driven by an algorithm that uses GST returns, Income Tax returns and bank statements to make credit decisions. In just a few days, 150,000 such enterprises have come on board for loans.

This is the power of fintech to drive enterprise, employment and prosperity. 

Digital technology is introducing transparency and eliminating corruption through innovations such as the Government e-Marketor GEM. It is an integrated platform for purchases by government agencies.

It provides everything – search and comparison, tender, online ordering, contract generation and payment.

It already has 600,000 products.Nearly 30,000 buyer organisations and more than 150,000 sellers and service providers are registered on the platform.

Friends

There is an explosion of fintech innovation and enterprise in India. It has turned India into a leading fintech and Startup nation in the world. The future of fintech and Industry 4.0 is emerging in India.

Our youth are developing apps that are making the dream of paperless, cashless, presence-less, and yet safe and secure, transactions possible for all. That is the wonder of India Stack– simply the largest set of Application Programming Interface in the world.

They are using Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and machine learning to create solutions for banks, regulators and consumers.

And, they are also embracing our nation’s social missions – from health and education to micro credit and insurance.

This enormous talent pool in India benefits from the ecosystem created by initiatives such as Digital India and Startup India, and by supportive policies, incentives and funding programmes.

It also helps that India has the largest data consumption in the world and the cheapest rates for data.And one of the top nations in fintech adoption. So, I say this to all the fintech companies and startups – India is your best destination.

The economies of scale achieved in India by the LED bulb industry allowed this energy efficient technology to become more affordable globally. Likewise, India’s vast market can enable fintech products to achieve scale, reduce risks and costs, and go global.

Friends. 

In short, the Indian story shows six great benefits of fintech: Access ,inclusion; connectivity; ease of living; opportunity; and, accountability.

Across the world, from the Indo-Pacific to Africa to Latin America, we see inspiring stories of extraordinary innovation changing ordinary lives .

But, there is much to be done. 

Our focus should be development of all, through , that is, development of the most marginalised.

We must bring the unbanked 1.7 billion people in the world into the formal financial market.

We must extend the security of insurance and pension to more than a billion workers in the informal sectors worldwide, who still do not have it.

We can use fintech to ensure that no dream remains unfulfilled, and no enterprise remains still born, because of lack of access to finance.

We must make banks and financial institutions more resilient in managing risks,fighting frauds and dealing with disruption of traditional models.

We have to use technology to improve compliance,regulation and supervision, so that innovation flourishes and risks are contained.

We must use fintech tools to combat money laundering and other financial crimes. 

The emerging world of finance will succeed in our inter-connected world when our data and systems are trusted and secure.

We have to make our globally wired system safe from cyber threats. 

We must also ensure that the pace and the push of Fintech work to the advantage of the people, not to their disadvantage; that technology in finance ensures improvement of the human condition through direct contact with the most marginalized.

We also need to enhance awareness of the masses and educate them about the opportunities which inclusive policies and use of technology open up for them.

For this,fintech will need to be not merely a mechanism but a movement. 

And, we have to address the inevitable questions of data ownership and flow, privacy and consent; private and public good; law and ethics.

Finally, we must invest in creating skills for the future. And, be prepared to back ideas and invest for the long term.

Friends. 

Each era is defined by its opportunities and challenges.Each generation has its responsibility to shape future.

This generation will shape the futurein the palm of every hand in the world. 

At no time in history were we blessed with so many possibilities: 

to make opportunities and prosperity a reality in a lifetime, for billions. 

to make the world more humane and equal –between rich and poor, between cities and villages, between hopes and achievements.

Just as India will learn from others, we will share our experience and expertise with the world.

Because,what drives India also holds hope for others. And,what we dream for India is what we also wish for the world.

This is a common journey for all. 

Like the festival of light that calls us to spread light over darkness,hope and happiness over despair,this festival calls us to come together in pursuit of a better future for humanity.

Thank you.

“I will be visiting Singapore on 14-15 November, to participate in the ASEAN-India and East Asia Summits. In addition, I would also participate in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Leaders' Meeting.

My participation in these meetings symbolizes our continued commitment to strengthening our engagement with ASEAN Member States and with the wider Indo-Pacific region. I am looking forward to my interactions with other ASEAN and East Asia Summit Leaders.

On 14 November, I will have the honour to be the first Head of Government to deliver the Keynote Address at the Singapore Fintech Festival. As the world's largest event on financial technology, the Festival is the right forum not only to showcase India's strengths in this fast-growing sector, but also to forge global partnerships for fostering innovation and growth.

During my visit, I will also have the opportunity to interact with the participants and winners of the joint India-Singapore Hackathon. It is my firm belief that if we provide the right encouragement and a nurturing ecosystem, our youth has the ability to become global leaders in providing solutions to the challenges facing humanity.

I am confident that my visit to Singapore will impart fresh momentum to our growing partnership with ASEAN and East Asia Summit nations.

As I depart for Singapore, I would like to extend my heartiest congratulations to Singapore for their able Chairmanship of ASEAN this year, and convey my best wishes for all success in hosting ASEAN and related Summits”.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today met and interacted with the members of his Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC). This Council renders advice on all matters related to Science, Technology and Innovation and monitors the implementation of the Prime Minister’s vision on these issues.

 

Members of the Council briefed the Prime Minister on various steps being taken to nurture innovation and research in key sectors of science and technology.   

 

The Prime Minister emphasized that the fruits of science, technology and innovation must reach the common man, solve common day-to-day problems, and facilitate ease of living for the people of India. In this context, he urged the Council members to work towards establishing strong linkages between the educational institutions, R&D labs, industry and various government departments. He reiterated the need to break silos among academic and research institutions.   

 

The Prime Minister called for development of suitable platforms and mechanisms which can identify and nurture scientific talent among schoolchildren, and link them to Atal Tinkering Labs at the district and regional level. In this context, the Prime Minister mentioned some priority areas of research such as raising agricultural income, solutions for chronic and genetic diseases such as sickle cell anaemia, waste management and cyber security.

 

The meeting was attended by Principal Scientific Advisor to the Prime Minister, Prof. K. VijayRaghavan, members of the Council, and senior officers of the Government of India.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, visited Varanasi today. 

 

He dedicated, inaugurated or laid the foundation stone of projects worth over Rs. 2400 crore.

 

He dedicated the Multimodal Terminal on the River Ganga, to the nation, and received the first container cargo. He inaugurated the Varanasi Ring Road Phase 1, and the development and construction for four laning of Babatpur-Varanasi Section of NH-56.

He mentioned the various other projects, including roads, and projects related to Namaami Gange, which were inaugurated, or for which the foundation stone was laid today. 

 

The Prime Minister said that the inland water-way would save time and money, reduce congestion on roads, reduce the cost of fuel, and reduce vehicular pollution. 

 

He said the road connecting Babatpur Airport with Varanasi was becoming an attraction for tourists, besides facilitating travel. 

 

The Prime Minister said that modern infrastructure has been built at a rapid pace in the last four years. He said that airports in remote areas, rail connectivity in parts of the North East, rural roads and highways have become a part of the Union Government's identity. 

 

The Prime Minister said that projects worth Rs. 23,000 crore have been approved under Namaami Gange so far. He said almost all villages along the banks of the River Ganga have now become open defecation free. He said these projects are part of the Union Government's commitment to cleaning the River Ganga.

                Har har Mahadev!

My best wishes to all the mothers, sisters and the people on this auspicious occasion of sun worship i.e. Chhat. 

I wish happiness and prosperity for every household on the occasion of this four-day festival.

My best wishes to you for all the upcoming festivals viz. Deepavali, Bhai dooj and Govardhan Puja, together. 

On the stage, my cabinet colleague Shri Nitin Gadkari ji, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath ji, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya ji, Minister in the UP Government  Shri Suresh Khanna ji, my Parliamentary Colleagues Dr. Mahendranath Pandey ji and Shri Ramcharit Nishad ji, the other dignitaries present here and my dear brothers and sisters of Varanasi.

Friends,

After the festivals of Deepavali and Dussehra, once again I have got the opportunity to meet you all, the people of Kashi. This time I was fortunate to get a darshan of Baba Kedarnath on Deepavali. Now, within a week, I got the opportunity to seek your blessings in the city of Baba Vishwanath. I was blessed to have worshipped mother Bhagirathi in Uttarakhand while today I have got the opportunity to get the darshan of mother Ganga.

This day also marks the death anniversary of the Mahamana  Malviya ji. With great respect, I salute his great work and penance today.

Friends,

This day is historic for Kashi, Purvanchal, Eastern India and the entire India.

Today Varanasi and the country are a witness to the work of development which should have been completed decades ago but unfortunately that didn't happen.

Today Varanasi and the country are also a witness to the fact that whenever a task is completed with a resolution, the ultimate picture is so magnificent, bright and glorious.

Today Varanasi and the country are also a witness to the concept of how the Next Generation Infrastructure in the country is going to rejuvenate the transport systems.

As your Prime servant as well as a Parliamentarian from Varanasi constituency, this occasion has brought twice the happiness for me. There is indeed a spiritual link with this land but today there has been a transmission of a new energy that connects all the three - water, land and sky.

Friends,

Just sometime back, I welcomed the country's first container vessel that reached via the waterway. At the same time, the multi modal terminal built at a cost of more than Rs. 200 crores was launched. It took decades to complete this work but I am delighted today that the nation's dreams could be fulfilled on the land of Kashi. The operation of these container vessels means Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Purvanchal and Eastern India are now connected to the Bay of Bengal by waterway.

Brothers and sisters,

Today various projects like the road connecting Babatpur airport to the city, Ring road, projects related to the connectivity of Kashi or the projects to lay underground electricity wires or making mother Ganga pollution-free, have either been launched or the foundation stones have been laid. These projects worth approximately more than Rs.2500 crores will paint a grand and a magnificent image of Varanasi. I congratulate all the people of Kashi and Purvanchal for these numerous projects from the bottom of my heart.

Friends,

This is the first time since independence that we have been successful to utilize our waterways for trade and business to such a grand level. The people of Kashi are a witness to the fact that four years ago when I had placed my idea of connecting Varanasi with Haldia through waterway, everyone had made a mockery of it and had said negative things about it. However, the vessel that arrived from Kolkata just a short while ago, has given a befitting reply to the critics. 

This first container vessel of the country is not just a part of the freight transport process but also an evidence of a new vision for New India. It symbolizes that idea where the country's resources and capability are trusted.

Brothers and sisters,

The container vessel that has reached Varanasi today has carried industrial goods from Kolkata and will take back fertilizers. That is, the goods including that of fertilizers produced in the factories in UP and Purvanchal will directly reach the ports of Eastern India.

This is just an example. That day is not far when all the vegetables, food grains and the products of my weaver brothers in Varanasi and the surrounding areas will be transported through this waterway. Just imagine, such a great path has been opened up for the farmers and lakhs of people associated with small scale industries of this region. This waterway will play a pivotal role in getting inputs, raw materials for their industries and agriculture and sending the products back after value addition.

Thanks a lot for your love and enthusiasm. I offer my heartfelt gratitude for your love and enthusiasm. But please save this enthusiasm for 2019. Shall I start? Shall I speak? Will you listen to me peacefully or keep on shouting 'Modi! Modi!'? I am really grateful to you for so much love and zeal but today the people of Kashi want to hear and understand the nuances of it. So, let me try to explain everything, how the transformation has been made and how the transformation will be made.

In the coming days, when the RoRo service will be flagged off from the Multi Modal Terminal constructed at Varanasi, you will get another alternative to cover longer distances. Huge tanker-trucks, buses and cars will easily reach other cities with the help of ships.

Friends,

If the quantity of goods that was transported here today through ship was transported by roads, it would have taken 16 trucks to do the job. Moreover, transporting freight through waterway has saved Rs.4500 per container. That is, there has been a direct saving of Rs.70000-750000 on the goods that have reached. In a nutshell, this waterway will save money and time, reduce the traffic on roads, save fuel and also provide a relief from pollution.

Friends,

There was a time when massive ships used to sail in the rivers of our country. However, after independence, instead of paying attention to strengthening these routes, they were neglected. The country was at a loss. Just imagine how the previous government did injustice to the country's capability and the power of the rivers.

Our government is working to end this injustice that was being done to the country's capability. Today work on more than 100 waterways is underway. Varanasi-Haldia waterway is one of them. Several facilities are being developed at a cost of more than Rs.5000 crores between the Varanasi- Haldia stretch in Farrakka, Sahibganj and Buxar. This waterway will benefit not only Uttar Pradesh but also a major part of eastern India i.e. Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.

Brothers and sisters,

This waterway will aid not only in freight transport but also in increasing tourism and connect the pilgrimage centres of eastern India with East Asian countries. Purvanchal including Varanasi and parts of the Eastern India will be known for cruise tourism with time. And this will be in line with Kashi's culture and civilization. The map of development will be worked out by blending the traditional Kashi with its modern form.

Brothers and sisters,

These ancient routes with modern facilities will become a place of confluence of nature, culture and adventure. 

Friends,

Varanasi, Bhadohi and Mirzapur have been the centres of carpet manufacturing and are now becoming a global hub for textile export of the country. Last month, for the first time, India Carpet Expo was organized successfully in Deen Dayal Hastakala Sankul. I had inaugurated this expo from Delhi. The national waterway started between Varanasi and Kolkata will also help the people associated with this sector. They will be highly benefitted for their exports.

Friends,

There is a direct relation between easy accessibility and convenience; and sometimes convenience becomes the reason for pride. The world class road connecting Babatpur airport is one such example. I was told that people come from far-flung areas to click selfies there. Varanasi and this road are the focus in social media. This is the season of festivals. Whoever among you has returned to his hometown by flight must have been filled with immense pride after coming out of the Babatpur airport. I was told that the people, who had gone out of the city for some days and have now started returning to the city, are finding it hard to believe that they are passing through the same Harihua and Tarna-shivpur road. Try to recall those days when you used to miss your flights due to heavy traffic jams on this road and you had to leave your home several hours before to catch a flight. The potholes on the roads used to make you cry. Now this situation has changed.

Friends,

Constructed at a cost of more than Rs.800 crores, the road connecting Babatpur airport and the city was not only widened and made 4-lane, but has started attracting tourists from around the world. This road will not only save the time for the people of Kashi and other tourists but will also facilitate the journey to Jaunpur, Sultanpur and Lucknow. The first phase of the city's Ring Road has been dedicated to the people of Kashi today. With this road constructed at a cost of approximately Rs.760 crores, the vehicles travelling to and from Gorakhpur, Lucknow, Azamgarh and Ayodhya will not have to enter the city.

Friends,

These two road projects were decades-old demand of the city of Varanasi. Just 6 months after becoming the Prime Minister, I had started my efforts to complete these two projects at a rapid pace. These two projects are now complete with your cooperation. Now the work on the second phase of the Ring Road is also progressing at a rapid pace. This too will be completed soon. These projects will reduce traffic jams and pollution in Varanasi and also save your time. This will also facilitate the tourists going to Sarnath. The foundation stone of the heliport to be constructed in Ramnagar has also been laid just a short while ago. This too will benefit the tourism here.

Friends,

Connectivity increases not only tourism potential and employment opportunities but also trust in the country. All the projects that have been launched or the foundation stone for which have been laid today in Varanasi will open up new opportunities of employment for the youth.

Brothers and sisters,

For the BJP governments and the governments led by the BJP, the development of the country and its countrymen is everything. Now the country desires only the politics of development. The public makes decisions on the basis of development and not on the basis of vote bank politics.

 

We can clearly see that in the last four years the modern infrastructure has developed at a rapid pace. New airports at difficult terrains, the trains that have reached for the first time in the tribal belts and remote areas of the north eastern India, the rural roads and the Grand National Highways and the network of expressway have become an identity of our government.

Friends,

We have not only emphasized upon the development of the resources but have also seriously worked on every need of the common man like cleanliness and health. The percentage of rural cleanliness before 2014 which was less than 40% has now become more than 95%. Due to Ayushman Bharat Mission, the poorest of the poor has now been assured of treatment in the hospitals for serious diseases. Under this scheme, till date, free treatment has been provided to more than 2 lakh poor. And it has not even been more than 40 days since the scheme was launched.

Friends,

We have not only focused on the health of the people but have also taken a pledge to keep our lifelines i.e. our rivers healthy. To achieve this, the Namami Gange Mission that has been going on for the cleanliness of mother Ganga has now reached a new level. 

Just sometime back, I got the opportunity to launch and lay the foundation-stone of four projects worth more than Rs.400 crores for the treatment of the sewage water flowing into the Ganges. Three sewer treatment plants in Dinapur will prevent the dirty water from the city from flowing into mother Ganga for several years to come. Similarly, the plant at Ramnagar will also be ready to serve mother Ganga. 

Friends,

Our government is not wasting the money meant for Ganga ji but utilizing it to treat the filthy water flowing into the Ganga. Under the Namami Gange Mission, till date projects worth Rs.23000 crores have been approved. Work is going on for the projects worth Rs.5000 crores. Now almost all the villages on the banks of river Ganga have become Open Defecation Free. These projects are part of our resolution to make the Ganga clean from Gangotri to Gangasagar.

Today, this fast progress in this Mission is because of public participation and the sense of responsibility in every citizen towards rivers. Otherwise, we are well aware of the fact how the previous governments had spent thousands of crores of rupees in the name of cleaning Ganga.

Friends,

The work of power reforms in some of the areas of Varanasi has also been launched today. In addition to the old Kashi, the work has also been completed for other areas under IPDS scheme. All the dangling electric wires have been put underground. This too is an important step towards fulfillment of our dreams of a grand Kashi. In the coming days, this work will also be extended to other areas of the city.

Friends,

With your efforts and inspiration, today a new image of the ancient Kashi has started appearing before the country and the world. Now we have to preserve it and keep it safe so that our glorious city will be honoured all over the world.

Next year, Pravasi Bharatiya Divas will also be held on the holy land of Kashi in January. Just like all of you, I will be present in Varanasi to welcome people from all over the world for this event. Ardha-Kumbha will also be held in Prayagraj at that time. From there, many people will come to Varanasi.

We all wish that the amalgamation of the glory of the world's oldest city Kashi and the best facilities takes place in such a way that the Kashi's memories become indelible in the minds of the visitors and they visit the city again and again.

In the end, once again, I would like to congratulate you all for these numerous facilities and new development projects. My best wishes to you all my friends of Purvanchal and Eastern India for Chhat Puja.

Jay Chhati maiyya! Har har Mahadev!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will dedicate to the nation, two important national highways in Varanasi, having a total length of 34 kilometres and constructed at a cost of Rs 1571.95 crore on Monday, the 12th of November, 2018. He will be accompanied by UP Governor Shri Ram Naik, Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The function will be held in the afternoon at Ring Road Tiraha, Hardua, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.

The 16.55 km Varanasi Ring Road Phase-I has been completed at a cost of Rs 759.36 crore, while the work of four-laning and construction of 17.25 km Babatput-Varanasi road on NH-56 has cost Rs 812.59 crore.

The Babatpur Airport highway will link Varanasi to the airport and go on to Jaunpur, Sultanpur and Lucknow. With a flyover at Harhua and an ROB at Tarna, the road will reduce the travel time from Varanasi to the airport. This will prove a big relief to the people of Varanasi and to tourists and other visitors to the city.

The Ring Road, with two ROBs and a flyover, will provide a way for traffic on NH 56 (Lucknow-Varanasi), NH 233 ( Azamgarh-Varanasi), NH 29 ( Gorakhpur-Varanasi ) and Ayodhya – Varanasi highways to by pass Varanasi city, thereby reducing traffic congestion in the city. This will reduce travel time, fuel usage and pollution in the area. The Ring Road will provide easier and more convenient access to Sarnath, an important site for Buddhist pilgrimage.

These projects will also provide increased employment opportunities, development of small and medium industries and give a boost to economic development in the area. Currently NH projects of total length 2833 km, costing Rs 63,885 crore are underway to link Varanasi to other places in Eastern Uttar Pradesh..

Prime Minister will also dedicate to the nation an inland waterways terminal on river Ganga in Varanasi. This is the first of the four multi modal terminals being constructed on NW-I ( River Ganga) as part of the World Bank aided Jal Marg Vikas project of the Inland Waterways Authority of India. The other three terminals are under construction at Sahibganj, Haldia and Gazipur. The project would enable commercial navigation of vessels with capacity of 1500-2,000 DWT on river Ganga.

PM will also receive the country’s first container consignment (post independence) to be sent on an inland waterways vessel. This consignment containing cargo of the food and beverage company Pepsico set sail from Kolkata in the last week of October.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has paid tributes to the Indian soldiers who fought in the First World War. 

 

""Today, as we mark one hundred years since the end of the horrific First World War, we reiterate our commitment towards world peace and pledge to work to further an atmosphere of harmony and brotherhood so that the trail of death and destruction caused by wars does not occur.

 

India remembers our brave soldiers who fought in WW-1. This was a war in which India was not directly involved yet our soldiers fought world over, just for the cause of peace.

 

I have had the honour of paying tributes at the Neuve-Chapelle Memorial in France and at the memorial in Israel's Haifa, places associated with India's role in the First World War. When PM Benjamin Netanyahu came to India, we paid tributes at the Teen Murti-Haifa Chowk"", the Prime Minister said.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today celebrated Diwali with jawans of the Indian Army and ITBP, at Harsil in Uttarakhand. 

 

Greeting the jawans on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that their devotion to duty in the remote icy heights, is enabling the strength of the nation, and securing the future and the dreams of 125 crore Indians. He said that Diwali is the festival of lights; it spreads the light of goodness and dispels fear. He said that the jawans, through their commitment and discipline, are also helping to spread the sense of security and fearlessness among the people. 

 

The Prime Minister recalled that he has been visiting soldiers on Diwali, ever since he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat. He also spoke of his interactions with the jawans of ITBP, years ago when he was part of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. 

 

The Prime Minister said India is taking great strides forward in the defence sector. He spoke of various measures being taken for welfare of ex-servicemen, including OROP (One Rank, One Pension). 

 

The Prime Minister said that the Indian Armed Forces draw admiration and appreciation across the world, in UN peacekeeping operations. 

 

The Prime Minister offered sweets to the jawans. He also interacted with people from nearby areas who had gathered to greet him on Diwali.

                Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with H. E. Mrs. Kim Jung-sook, First Lady of the Republic of Korea today. 

First Lady Kim is visiting India at the invitation of Prime Minister Modi. She will be the Chief Guest at the Deepotsav event being organized by the State Government of Uttar Pradesh and the ground-breaking ceremony of the new Memorial of Queen Suriratna (Heo Hwang-ok) in Ayodhya on 6 November 2018. Ayodhya and Korea have a deep historical connection through the legendary Princess Suriratna of Ayodhya, who traveled to Korea in 48 CE and married Korean King Suro.

In their meeting today, the Prime Minister and First Lady Kim discussed the deep civilizational and spiritual links between India and Korea, and exchanged views on promoting people-to-people exchanges.

First Lady Kim congratulated the Prime Minister on being awarded the Seoul Peace Prize. The Prime Minister said that this honour truly belongs to the people of India.

The Prime Minister also warmly recalled the successful visit of President Moon Jae-in to India in July 2018, which imparted fresh momentum to India-Republic of Korea Special Strategic Partnership.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi received today the crew of Strategic Strike Nuclear Submarine (SSBN) INS Arihant. The submarine recently returned from its first deterrence patrol, completing the establishment of the country's survivable nuclear triad.

Stressing the significance of the successful deployment of INS Arihant for the completion of India's nuclear triad, the Prime Minister congratulated the crew and all involved in the achievement which puts India among a handful of countries having the capability to design, construct and operate SSBNs. 

Noting that the indigenous development of the SSBN and its operationalisation attest to the country's technological prowess and the synergy and coordination among all concerned, the Prime Minister thanked them for their dedication and commitment in realising this pioneering accomplishment enhancing immensely the country's security. 

The Prime Minister commended the courage and commitment of India's brave soldiers and the talent and perseverance of its scientists, whose untiring efforts transformed the scientific achievement of nuclear tests into establishment of an immensely complex and credible nuclear triad, and dispelled all doubts and questions about India's capability and resolve in this regard. 

The Prime Minister stated that the people of India aspire for a 'Shaktimaan Bharat' (Strong India) and building a New India. They have strived tirelessly to overcome all challenges in this path. He stressed that a strong India will fulfill the hopes and aspirations of over a billion Indians and will also be an important pillar for global peace and stability, especially in a world full of uncertainties and concerns.

The Prime Minister extended greetings to the participants and their families on the occasion of Deepawali, the Festival of Light. He expressed the hope that just as light dispels darkness and all fear, INS Arihant will be harbinger of fearlessness for the country. 

As a responsible nation, India has put in place a robust nuclear command and control structure, effective safety assurance architecture and strict political control, under its Nuclear Command Authority. It remains committed to the doctrine of Credible Minimum Deterrence and No First Use, as enshrined in the decision taken by the Cabinet Committee on Security in its meeting chaired by the then Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee on January 04, 2003.

                My eminent colleagues of the Cabinet Shri Arun Jaitley ji, Shri Giriraj Singh ji, Shri Shiv Pratap Shuklaji, Shri Pon Radhakrishnan ji, other supporters from the banking sector, financial institutions, the great business and industry leaders, important dignitaries joining today from all over the country, small scale entrepreneurs, ladies and gentlemen!

In this event dedicated to the small scale industries of the country, I extend my heartfelt welcome and compliments to all you entrepreneurs joining from all parts of the country.

First of all, accept my advance best wishes on Deepawali and Hindu New year (New Samvat). We all know how significant Deepawali and New Samvatis for all of us here. Now this fervour is also spread worldwide. Especially it holds a lot of importance for our brothers and sisters engaged in business who elebrate their new financial year today hope that Deepawali augurs well for good business round the year.

Apart from it, this time is also important because in the same period the agriculture crops and agri-products grown by our farmers reach the market. The transactions in this period also settle precedent for the upcoming year's market trends and the growth of the country.

That's why the Deepawali season is as significant for the country as the annual budget is. The decisions taken during this time have a big impact on our future.

Today, in this special event, I want to tell you in detail about the 12 big decisions taken by the government for the small industry sector. In the past few weeks several Ministries have relentlessly deliberated together to reach to these monumental decisions. Some of these have been implemented as a pilot project at a smaller scale to judge their feasibility. After rigorous assessments and reviews now it is an opportune time today when I can proudly share the 12 landmark decisions with the country.

Friends, these 12 decisions are also testimony of the fact that when Silos are broken and a Collective Initiative and Collective Responsibility isendorsed, when a Collective Decision is taken, then it has an ambient impact holistically.

In silos, unfortunately, all your dreams remain buried in the files. But when silos break, the officers themselves speed up the matter and make sure decisions are taken faster.

These 12 decisions have come as a great gift for Deepawali for the country's MSME i.e. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. It is the harbinger of a new era in small scale industries in our country. History shall unfold for this sector. 

Brothers and Sisters, before presenting what the future shall be like, I would like to revisit with you some things of the past and the present as well.This is also important because we need to rejoice the glorius past, which will keep us confident in the present;and it is important to reinforce such things. 

Friends, it is well known that MSME or small scale industries are the means of livelihood of millions of people in our country and they also play an important role in the economy. The MSME is the second largest employment generating sector after agriculture. The way farming is the backbone of India's economy, the MSMEs are strong steps, which accelerate the development of the nation.

Small scale industries have been contributing significantly in several sectors ranging from embroidery to weaving, from agri to sports industry, from clothing to weaponry, from wool to energy generation. Be it-


	Kanchipuramsaree or Panipat handloom
	Hosiery of Ludhiana or bronze articles of Muradabad
	Banaraseesaree from Banaras or locks of Aligarh
	The auto industry of Jamshedpur and Pune or  Chemical industry of Bharuch and electric pumps of Coimbatore
	Handicrafts and Stone craft from Jodhpur and Kishangarh, as well as silver jewellery of Cuttack
	Paintings of Madhubani or Sports Industry ofMeerut


From East to West or North to South, our Small scale industries are spread far and wide across the expanse of the country. 

These do not just hold the industry status for us, but they are our heritage, our tradition, and are an important part of our lives. Several cities are identified on the map only because of the small scale industries running there.

I may not be wrong in saying that every district of our country holds a unique identity, and the onus of this lies on the small scale industry of that district. 

Upholding the rich traditions and heritage, our small industries have indeed strengthened over time and thereby contributing significantly to the Economy of India.

Friends, today India is shining as a bright spot in the Global Economy space. All eyes across the world are set on India; a new India has become thecenter of all global business discussion; a new India which has the conviction and power to fulfill the hopes and aspirations of its 130 million citizens.

MSME sector, that is YOU alone,deserve the credit for bringing India to this place of pride by inducing new energy in the country. This is the result of your endeavors and hardwork due to which India has achieved the stature of an Economic Powerhouse today.

MSME sector has proven to be the biggest shareholder in the past four or four years in India. You have made great efforts towards formalization of the sector, have adapted digital transactions proactively, have aligned with new infrstructures like e-commerce, and have also adopted such a monumental tax reform of the country like GST. You are also competing with the global market with great wisdom and bravery.

Due to these developments in the country, today, India is heading towards leading the fourth industrial revolution. We are leapfrogging into a new orbit and are slated to enter into a new era. All this is happening because you, the country's MSME sector in already in sync with the developments and is keeping its infrastructure upgraded and aligned with the latest. 

Friends, government is unitedly moving forward with you to encourage you in all future endeavors. 

Due to several recent reforms and decisions implemented in the country, India has improved the infrastructure required to simplify the process of doing business here. Escalation in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Rankings released just two days ago stands a testimony to this. What was unimaginable four years ago, India has achieved it for the world to see.

Friends, it is a matter of pride for all of us that India has moved meteorically in the Ease of Doing Business Rankings. Just four years ago, before we formed this government, we were at 142nd position. Today, I am happy that we have moved 77 ranks and reached 65th position. I believe,withthe initiatives taken bythe State Governments and Central Government in all departments, I am confident that achieving a berth amongtop 50 would not be a far cry.

With the increased simplicity and convenience due to enhanced Ease of Doing Business, theMSME sector stands to gain a lot. Getting clearance for a construction permit or electricity supply has always been a big challenge for our small scale industries.By working at the grassroot level and modifying the rules, we have now achieved the exemplary job of making business convenient for MSME industry.

Apart from this, in the past for about four or four and a half years’ special focus has been on developing the MSME sector. Several comprehensive changes in policies and decisionshave further strengthened this sector.

Friends, 

In order to strengthen the sector, according to me a special focus has to be on the following five categories: 

A- You get capital easily, get loans at cheaper rate and ascertain cash flow

B- You get a market as well as an increased share on E-commerce platforms 

C-Technology Upgradation is accessible

D-Ease of Doing Business is enhanced and government interference is minimised

and

E-Employees are guaranteed a sense of security

I would now elaborate on each category one after the other. 

Let me first talk about category A–ie., you get capital easily, get loans at cheaper rate and ascertain cash flow and that too without several visits to the banks.

This is your first requirement for any business. I am aware that many people start their own business by investing their own capital too. But in order to expand the business, one still has to resort to loans. This support is provided by our banks. 

However, what is its ground reality? Small entrepreneurs, whose annual turnover is between 20 lakh and five crores rupees, they have difficulty in getting loans. Due to their smaller size of the balance sheet, they are often delayed in getting loans, and therefore they do not qualify for an adequate amount of loan. Above all, they face further crisis in getting their dues cleared from the major companies or large industries where their goods are supplied as there is delay in clearing the bills. The entire business suffers as this adversely affects the cash flow cycle. 

To resolve this critical problem of yours, I am happy to make this first announcement today- and that is dedicating a 59-minute loan portal which is being launched today nationwide. That is, as much time you take to reach your office from home in the morning, or as much time you invest in bookkeeping of your Ledger account in the evening, you will be able to get intransigent approval of a loan of up to one crore rupees.

Friends, some time ago an attempt was made under the leadership of Mr ArunJaitley. At that time, I told the officials that though you are launching it as a trial, but will it reach the conclusion we are aspiring?

Friends, this year it is 72 years since we achieved our independence. I asked them that on the day when the portal will be implemented throughout the country, will they be able to approve the loans of 72 thousand small entrepreneurs.

Friends, at this moment, when I am talking to you, look what this counter is showing! What appears as the clock, is telling us how many MSME entrepreneurs have so far borrowed through this portal, got loans approved or renewed. You can constantly see how this number is changing.

Sitting in some farway corner of the country, far from here, your entrepreneur contemporary has just got a loan of one crore rupees sanctioned in just 59 minutes. Yes indeed, within just 59 minutes. Just 59 minutes! And, I intentionally kepta cap of 59 minutes or else it would not take long to extend from one hour to two. 

Friends, this could have been accomplished by previous governments too. But then such important initiatives require honest intentand credible reputation. Our government, on the basis of Minimum Government Maximum Governance mantra, is striving to provide you hassle free accessibility to resources at every step.

I remember, when I was talking about this portal with the officers, I said that the information of the turnover of entrepreneurs is available in their GST Return, income is reported through their Tax Return, Cash Flow is also available via the bank account, then banks should simply adopt Analytics to assess the loan request and grant the loan.

I had also said that this facility should be promoted in a robust manner, and it should be linked to all such platforms like GST Portal which are accessed by MSME fraternity. 

Why should an honest taxpayer or an honest businessman who joins this portal face any problem of getting a loan sanctioned? So when you file your return on the GST portal, you will also get this facility. As soon as you go to the portal, you will be asked if you want a loan? If you approve inYES, you will get access to the facility of a 59 minute loan portal.

Friends, our efforts are that government faciltities should reach the doorstep of every MSME entrepreneur and businessmenpaying GST. Today, I am glad that keeping all these things in mind, now I am finally dedicating this GST PORTAL to you to facilitate loan acceptance in just 59 minutes. The benefit of this has begun to reach the small entrepreneurs of every sector of the country today.

It is a new India.No more traumas of several bank visits now. 

Friends, now I come to today's second announcement.

While you do get intransigent approval of loan in 59 minutes, but it is also important that at what rate of interest you are getting.

Now listen carefully to what I am going to say!

Friends,now it has been decided that every GST registered MSME will be given a rebate of two percent interest on new loan or incremental loan for a loan amount of upto Rupees One crore.

This is the scope of your integrity and honesty. As an extension of the same, joining GST and paying tax will not only make you secure, but will entitle you to a discount of 2 percent interest on your loan. 

Not only this. There is aDeepawali Gift ready for exporters too. The government has also decided to increase the rate of interest from present 3 percent to 5 percenton the loan accrued by exporters in between the pre-shipment and post-shipment period.

Dear Friends, MSMEs have a huge contribution in the country's exports. You handle about 40 percent of the country's total exports. For you to also reap the benefit of India's enhancedglobal credentials, it has been decided to give this discount in the rate of interest to all MSME exporters.

I am hopeful this move will increase the stakes of MSME Exporters.

So far all announcements that have been made will make it easier for you to get loans on reduced interests without making innumerable visits to the banks. 

But I also want that the exigencies that force you to take a loan should further be reduced.

I know that the approval of bills are kept pending for long durations by large companies to which MSMEs supply goods.it is too late to get the bill approved. Many times you have to wait for months for your own money. In this case, you have to take a loan to manage your business.

My third announcementof today is related to this. It is now mandatory that all such companies with a turnover of above 500 croresshall now have to register on Trade Receivables e-Discounting System (TReDS) platform so that MSMEs do not face problems in cash flow.

Many of you may know that TReDS is a platform which is a community of few MSME's, government PSUs, some banks as well as those companies to which these SMEs supply their goods.

Now the government is aiming to expand the scope of TReDS. All PSUs of the government have been instructed to join theTReDS platform and encourage industries related to them to also be brought onto TReDS.

Now I would like to tell you about the benefits TReDS platform will offer for thecompanieswith a turnover of 500 crores+. 

Suppose a big company has purchased goods worth 10 lakh rupees from a small scale entrepreneur. The entrepreneur has already received a confirmed receipt of supply of order and he has also fulfilled the order. But for some reason when a big company does not pay him for his supplies in due time the small businessman is unfortunately trapped. Afterall, for him, Rs 10 lakh is a big deal.

In such a scenario, the small trader receives help from the TReDS platform. He is required to simply upload a confirmation receipt or bill received from that large company on this platform. On the basis of this bill, he can make a valid claim that within a month or two he is awaitingthe due payment from that big company. Since the bill is issued by a big company, banks are liable to give credence to it and on the basis of this the SME businessman is qualified to receive an appropriateamont of financial support. In future when he receives his payment, it is credited to the bank and hence he can run his business uninterrupted. 

Friends, the biggest benefit of this is that there will never be a shortfall in the money which is to be rotated or invested in your business, and thus your cash flow cycle shall remained maintained. 

However, on this occasionwith this announcement, I will also request the big companies that the bills associated with small scale industries should be accepted early and their payments should not be delayed.

Friends,

However, if the payment still gets delayed, we have prepared another option to ease you. Our Small Scale Enterprises can register their grievances on the MSME Ministry's portal, which will be resolved within a given timeframe with government’s intervention. This will certainly motivate big companies to settle your payments within a stipulated time.

Friends,
It is our government's top priority that loans are made easily available at low interest rates, MSME exporters get the benefit of discounts on interest rate, and cashflow cycle is maintained for all businessmen. My first three announcements have been in this direction.

Now I come to the category ""B"", and this  isfor you,creation of new market for the country's MSME sector. On this front, the government has taken several important steps, and I am going to proudly announce some important decisions today.

 

Friends, in the last year, about 1,14,000crore rupees worth of supplies were bought by government companies from different sources. It was mandatory till date for all government companies that 20 percent of such purchasesmust have been made MSME sector i.e. micro and small scale industries.

My fourth announcement of today is related to this. The government has decided to increase this compulsory requirement of 20 percent to 25 percent. That is, now due to the 5 percent increase in the purchases made by government enterprises, the share of Micro and Small Enterprises is slated to increase.

Taking this further another important and the fifth announcement is related to women entrepreneurs. Further to the clause of 25% purchase mandatory from MSME sector, it has also been decided that 3% of the total purchase from it would be reserved from women entrepreneurs. That is, now it has become necessary for the government companies to buy at least 3% of their purchases from women entrepreneurs.

In my opinion today's decision will strengthen women entrepreneurship in the country.

The government has developed another platform to provide market for partners, MSME, GeM i.e. Government E-marketplace. When it started two-and-a-half years ago, a big motive behind it was to bring transparency in procuring government goods. 

The MSME sector is also getting the direct benefit of this transparency. Because of GeM, it has been easy for small entrepreneurs to reach out to Government buyers. I still remember the lady of Tamil Nadu, who had sold a small thermos to the Prime Minister's Office and was paid on time. As such, several micro and small enterprises have been given new opportunities due to this portal. It has given new inspiration to their lives. Otherwise, no small scale businessman could have ever imagined that he would stand in good stead in front of large-scale supply companies and would be able to sell his products to the government. But because of GeM portal all this is now possible.

Friends, so far, over 1.5 lakh suppliers have been added to the GeM portal, which has 40 thousand MSMEs. Under this, 9 lakh orders have been given so far and transaction of around 14 thousand crores of rupees have already been made. 

Just imagine how many entrepreneurs have reaped the benefit of this portal without sharing their earnings with or paying commission with any middlemen.

Friends, to strengthen the system of GeM, today the Central Government has made an important decision. This is my sixth announcement today, your sixth Deepawali gift. 

Friends, now all Central Government companies have been mandated to subscribe to GeM. Not only this, they will also register all their MSMEs vendors on this platform, which will give them maximum benefit upon purchases made from MSMEs. Subscribing to GeM shall open up endless possibilities. And with today's announcement it is certainly going to get more consolidated with enhanced scope. 

Friends, in today’s era of computerization and technology, e-commerce and online marketing, it is imperative for more small scale industry to join the portal to seek optimal benefit for their businesses.

Similar to GeM, to be able to sell goods on other e-commerce platform SMEs would require a quality certification. The government is working with various Certification Agencies to ensure such certificationprosess is available closer to your clusters andfactory.

We are also developing this model of Aggregator to connect small industries with private sector companies.

Frends, I will now address the category ""C"". Apart from the Capital and Market, a major challenge that SMEs face is of Technological Upgradation. Many of our small industries do not have timely support so as to get the benefits of modern technology.

The toolrooms set up in the country today are currently extending support to you in designing and improving product design. In these tool rooms, you can also create high technology products, for which machines are not available with you.

For the past four years the government has also emphasized on improving the conditions of these toolrooms. While the previous government facilitated the trainings of approximately three and a half million people in these toolrooms, our government managed the training of more than six and half million people.

Today's seventh announcement that I am about to make is linked to this crucial topic of Technological upgradation.

Friends, the government has decided that this system of toolroom should be expanded further across the country. To achieve this, 20 hubs will be built across the country and 100 spokes such as Toolrooms will be installed. Today I announce a package of six thousand crores for this important work.

This will provide MSMEs wider platform to develop better designs, enhance quality, and avail training and consultancysupportwhichwill prove to be highly beneficial.

After apprising you about the efforts being made to support you in Technological Upgradation, friends, I will now discusscategory ""D"" and that is - Ease of Doing Business.

Many of you entrepreneurs work in the Pharma sector. You manufacture and also export medicines. Several of our small scale companies are producing life saving essential drugs, which are verypotent. These small companies have immense talent and skill, but unfortunately they have to sell their medicines through the brand of large companies.

My eighth announcementtoday is linked to these pharma companies. Pharma companies belonging to MSME sector have the ability to do business, and hence for them to have a direct reach to the customers we have decided to make a dedicated cluster. I also declare that 70% expenditure on these clusters shall be borne by the Central Government. This landmark decision of our government announced today will also prove to be crucial for increasing production in the Pharma sector.

Freinds, you might have realised that since the beginning of my speech I have been reiterating terms like technology, GST, online portal, Formalization, TReDS, GeM Portal and many such terms. In fact, these are the mechanisms that are going to emancipate you from the conundrum of the procedures.

GST has formalized and organized the economy. This has made it easy to connect business with new technology like Big Data Analytics. From this analysis of data, there will be more improvements in the Ease of Doing Business, and it will help in bringing such facilities to your doorsteps.

I am of the strong opinion that this is going to be the foundation of a new Business Environment for new India and it will certainly encourage honesty. 

Friends, in view of making government procedures foolproof and convenient for MSMEs, I am going to make a ninth announcement today. An epochal decision has been taken so that youhave to fill lesser forms and returns.Returns liable under eightlabor laws and 10 central rules will now have to filed only once in a year instead of twice as in earlier years. 

The government is constantly working to reduce human intervention and reinstate transparency in the system.Arunjihas also referred this with respect to Income tax. This sets the context of my 10th declaration today.

To get rid of unnecessary scrutiny, the government has decided that the roster aboutallocation of factory visit will be decided only by a Computerized Random Allotment. It will record not only the details and status of his visit to a factory, but also the details of his week later review visit. He will have to put it on his report portal in 48 hours. This ensures that now he can not go anywhere with his own will and register falls claims of fake visits.

This decision will prove very important in getting rid of the Inspector Rule prevalent in small scale industries. Now no inspector will barge into your company on his own will. You have the right to question his credibiltiy and question his purpose of visit.

Friends, the government trusts you, it trusts all the citizens of our country. In the last four years, our government has abandoned the Affidavits at many places, and also done away with interviewing in many categories of government jobs, and has permitted self certification.

Now today I am going to announce a major reform related to environmental laws for small scale industries. That is, this is your 11th Deepawali gift and my 11th announcement.The announcement is also directly related to mutual trust between you and the government. This is the 11th declaration:simplification of the process of environmental clearance and promotingself certification.

Friends, you all know that to set up an enterprise till now, it is necessary to cross the two stages of Environmental Clearance and Consent to Establish. The government has decided that by consolidating both these for MSMEs under air pollution and water pollution laws, only one Consent will be mandatory now.

The government will accept your returns on self-certification on trust. Similar to labour Department, routine Inspection of the Environment will also be done away with. Now onwards only 10 percent of MSMEs will be inspected.

It has also been decided by the Government to increase the number of enterprises in the Green and White category. You would recall my words said from Red Fort “zero defect zero effect”. Regardless of whether I talk about the tool room or talk about self-certification we will ensure that no one in the world market can point out any defect in our manufacturing. We will be manufacturing our products with such scientific technology and strategy they will have zero effect on the environment. We are marching ahead with this mantra.

The Government believes that only if we trust our citizens and entrepreneurs we can protect the environment more effectively. Due to this entrusting, partaking in the country has increased, and the results arealready visible in the enhancement of the country's forest cover.

Tomorrow, the government has taken another major decision in this direction. This decision is my 12th declaration of today. The government has made a major amendment in the Company Act to provide MSMEs some relief from legal complexities.

Friends, there were such provisions in the Companies Act so far, there were such laws related to them that, due to minor mistakes or unintentional violations, it was relegated asa crime. You were tried like a criminal. Due to these minor or inadvertent mistakes many times the merchants have often been jailed. You were forced into legalities and several court visits to correct your mistakes. 

All this came at a cost of your precious time and money. It also harmed your self esteem. Small and medium enterprises have been acing a lot of trouble because of this.

I am happy to share with you all that the government has issued an Ordinance to save from such perils.

The rules implemented presently have now been changed by the government. Now you will not have to go to court to rectify the minor mistakes. Now, for even the smallest violation, you can simply visit the relevant department and rectify all those mistakes by following few simple procedures.

Another advantage of this is that, more than 60 percent of cases which are filed in different special courts will now be out from there. I have been told that the number of such cases is not in thousands but in lakhs. Because of this, many of the cases will go under regional directors of NCLT-National Company Law Tribunal. If this happens then the case hearings will speed up towards faster resolution. 

Friends, the government has also provided relief to small scale industries and single-owned companies. They were subjected to many penalties earlier which has been reduced to half now.

Friends, now I move to the category ""E"".While taking these big decisions the government also made efforts to ensure social security to the skilled labours, artisans and labourers working in MSMEs.This is very crucial as this is an unorganised sector.

That's why the government is running a campaign and has decided that the MSME workers across the country should be linked to the government's social security schemes. The Government will ensure that workers working in MSME have a Jandhan account and are registered as beneficiaries of social security like Prime Minister's SurakshaBimaYojna and Insurance Scheme likePradhanMantriJyotiBimaYojna.

If the factory is a bit larger, then the facilities like Employee Provident Fund and ESIC are being acscertained. Meanwhile, the new recruitees in MSME sector shall be eligible for the benefit of the Prime Minister's Employment Incentive Scheme.

Friends, these 12 decisions in the era of Globalisation will certainly strengthen the MSME sector and begins a new paradigm.

Loan facility in just 59 minutes, loan through GST portal, entrepreneurs linked to GST enjoy enhanced interest rates, cheap export credit, the decision to register all government companies as well as those with a turnover of more than 500 milliononTReDS platform and, government mandate of minimum 25 percentpurchase to be made from MSME's, compulsory threepercentpurchase from women entrepreneurs, registration of all government companies on GeM, 20 HUB and 100 Spokes nationwide for Technology Upgradation, formulation of Pharma Clusters, changes in labor laws, ease of return, inspection report in 48 hours, simplification of procedures related to environmental clearance and major changes in the Companies Act, all these decisions are going to strengthen the MSME sector and take it to new heights.

I urge the Center and the state government employees to work further and contribute proactivelyin this mammoth nation building mission. With your earnest efforts, these decisions will bear optimal results and their benefits will reach the small entrepreneurs across the country.

Friends, when my team is shouldering such a mission, and will put in so much hard work, then it is obligatory for me to also contribute in a big way.

Therefore, I undertake the responsibility to personally review 100 such districts which have a legacy of MSMEs and are specializedin a certain skill or craft. I will personally scrutinise the work being carried out there. I will join the team working on the ground zero and supervise them for the next 100 days. I will offer hands onsupport while working hand in hand with you and lead it towards success.

 

Friends, all you MSMEs of India are really the Aspirational India, Ambitious India. You can see the result of your hard work. With these hard earned earnings, MSMEs nurture themselves from seeds to big enterprises in the future and become a role model for new entrepreneurs. 

MSMEs  are to ensign the government's vision of nurturing more Job Creators in place of Job Seekers. You are not just entrepreneurs but one of the main pillarscreating New India.

I sincerely hope these campaigns will be beneficial for small scale industries, and MSMEs across the country will reap the benefitsof all these decisions.

I am also convinced that small enterprises will further give a new dimension to the industrial revolution of the country, and will lay the foundation stone of technology driven clean business.

With all these developments you all shall contribute in escalating the momentum and vitality of Make In India initiative.With this conation I conclude my talk.

I am sure that this Deepawali will not only be auspicious for all of you, but will be harbinger of benefits and new opportunities for the entire MSME sector of the country.

Best wishes to all of you!

Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, received a telephone call today from the President of the World Bank, Mr. Jim Yong Kim.

Mr. Kim congratulated the Prime Minister for India’s historic rise in the Ease of Doing Business rankings. He said that it is remarkable that a nation of over 1.25 billion people has achieved a rise of 65 ranks in a short period of 4 years.

	PM unveils 12 key initiatives
	59 minute loan portal to enable easy access to credit for MSMEs
	Mandatory 25 percent procurement from MSMEs by CPSEs
	Ordinance for simplifying procedures for minor offences under Companies Act


 

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched a historic support and outreach programme for the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector. As part of this programme, the Prime Minister unveiled12 key initiatives which will help the growth, expansion and facilitation of MSMEs across the country. 

The Prime Minister said that the 12 decisions that he is announcing today, will mark a new chapter for the MSME sector. Noting that MSMEs are one of the principal employment generators in India, the Prime Minister recalled the glorious Indian traditions of small scale industry, including Ludhiana’s hosiery, and Varanasi’s sarees. 

The Prime Minister said that the success of economic reforms launched by the Union Government, can be gauged from the rise in India's “Ease of Doing Business Rankings,” from 142 to 77 in four years. 

The Prime Minister said that there are five key aspects for facilitating the MSME sector. These include access to credit, access to market, technology upgradation, ease of doing business, and a sense of security for employees. He said that as a Diwali gift for the sector, the 12 announcements he is making, will address each of these five categories. 

 

Access to Credit

As the first announcement, the Prime Minister announced the launch of the 59 minute loan portal to enable easy access to credit for MSMEs. He said that loans uptoRs. 1 crore can be granted in-principle approval through this portal, in just 59 minutes. He said a link to this portal will be made available through the GST portal. The Prime Minister asserted that in New India, no one should be compelled to visit a bank branch repeatedly. 

The Prime Minister mentioned the second announcement as a 2 percent interest subvention for all GST registered MSMEs, on fresh or incremental loans. For exporters who receive loans in the pre-shipment and post-shipment period, the Prime Minister announced an increase in interest rebate from 3 percent to 5 percent. 

The third announcement made by the Prime Minister was that all companies with a turnover more than Rs. 500 crore, must now compulsorily be brought on the Trade Receivables e-Discounting System (TReDS). He said that joining this portal will enable entrepreneurs to access credit from banks, based ontheir upcoming receivables. This will resolve their problems of cash cycle. 

Access to Markets

The Prime Minister said that on access to markets for entrepreneurs, the Union Government has taken a number of steps already. In this context, he made his fourth announcement, thatpublic sector companies have now been asked to compulsorily procure 25 percent, instead of 20 percent of their total purchases, from MSMEs. 

The Prime Minister said his fifth announcement is related to women entrepreneurs. He said that out of the 25 percent procurement mandated from MSMEs, 3 percent must now be reserved for women entrepreneurs. 

The Prime Minister said that more than 1.5 lakh suppliers have now registered with GeM, out of which 40,000 are MSMEs. He said transactions worth more than Rs. 14,000 crore have been made so far through GeM. He said the sixth announcement is that all public sector undertakings of the Union Government must now compulsorily be a part of GeM. He said they should also get all their vendors registered on GeM. 

 

Technology Upgradation

Coming to technological upgradation, the Prime Minister said that tool rooms across the country are a vital part of product design. His seventh announcement was that 20 hubs will be formed across the country, and 100 spokes in the form of tool rooms will be established. 

 

Ease of Doing Business

On Ease of Doing Business, the Prime Minister said his eighth announcement is related to pharma companies. He said clusters will be formed of pharma MSMEs. He said 70 percent cost of establishing these clusters will be borne by the Union Government. 

The Prime Minister said that the ninth announcementis on simplification of government procedures. He said the ninth announcement is that the return under 8 labour laws and 10 Union regulations must now be filed only once a year. 

The Prime Minister said that the tenth announcement is that now the establishments to be visited by an Inspector will be decided through a computerised random allotment. 

The Prime Minister noted that as part of establishing a unit, an entrepreneur needs two clearances namely, environmental clearance and consent to establish. He said that the eleventh announcement is that under air pollution and water pollution laws, now both these have been merged as a single consent. He further said that the return will be accepted through self-certification. 

As the twelfth announcement, the Prime Minister mentioned that an Ordinance has been brought, under which, for minor violations under the Companies Act, the entrepreneur will no longer have to approach the Courts, but can correct them through simple procedures. 

Social Security for MSME Sector Employees

The Prime Minister also spoke of social security for the MSME sector employees. He said that a mission will be launched to ensure that they have Jan Dhan Accounts, provident fund and insurance. 

The Prime Minister said that these decisions would go a long way in strengthening the MSME sector in India. He said the implementation of this outreach programme will be intensively monitored over the next 100 days.

                          The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 for regulation and standardisation of education and services by allied and healthcare professionals.The Bill provides for setting up of an Allied and Healthcare Council of India and corresponding State Allied and Healthcare Councils which will play the role of a standard-setter and facilitator for professions of Allied and Healthcare.

Details:

 


	Establishment of a Central and corresponding State Allied and HealthcareCouncils; 15 major professional categories including 53 professions in Allied and Healthcare streams.


 


	The Bill provides for Structure, Constitution, Composition and Functions of the Central Council and State Councils,   e.g.   Framing  policies  andstandards, Regulation of professional conduct, Creation and maintenanceof live Registers, provisions for common entry and exit examinations, etc. 


 


	The Central Council will comprise 47 members, of which 14 members shall be ex-officio representing diverse and related roles and functions andremaining 33 shall be non-ex-officio members who mainly represent the 15professional categories.


 


	The State Councils are also envisioned to mirror the Central Council,comprising 7 ex-officio and 21 non-ex officio members and Chairperson tobe elected from amongst the non-ex officio members.
	Professional Advisory Bodies under Central and State Councils will examine issues independently and provide recommendations relating to specific recognised categories.


 


	The Bill will also have an overriding effect on any other existing law for any of the covered professions.


 


	vii. The State Council will undertake recognition of allied and healthcare institutions.


 


	Offences and Penalties clause have been included in the Bill to check mal­practices.


 


	The Bill also empowers the Central and State Governments to make rules.


 


	Central Govt. also has the power to issue directions to the Council, tomake regulations and to add or amend the schedule. 


 

Targets:

 


	
	
		An Interim Council will be constituted within 6 months of passing of the Act holding charge for a period of two years until the establishment of the Central Council.
		The Council at the Centre and the States are to be established as body corporate with a provision to receive funds from various sources.
		Councils will also be supported by Central and State Governments respectively through Grant-in-aid as needed. However, if the StateGovernment expresses inability, the Central Government may release some grant for initial years to the State Council.
	
	


 

Major Impact, including employment generation potential:

 


	Bring all existing allied and healthcare professionals on board during thefirst few of years from the date of establishment of the Council.


 


	Opportunity to create qualified, highly skilled and competent jobs inhealthcare by enabling  professionalism of the allied  and  healthcare workforce.


 


	 High quality, multi-disciplinary care in line with the vision of AyushmanBharat, moving away from a 'doctor led' model to a 'care accessible and team based’ model.


 


	Opportunity to cater to the global demand (shortage) of healthcareworkforce which is projected to be about 15 million by the year 2030, asper the WHO Global Workforce, 2030 report.


 

Expenditure involved:

 

Total cost implication is expected to be Rupees 95 crores for the first four years. About four-fifth of the total budget (i.e. Rupees 75 crores) is being earmarked for the States while the remaining fund will support the Central Council operations for 4 years and also establish the Central and State Registers.

 

Number of beneficiaries:

 

It is estimated that the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 will directlybenefit around 8-9 Lakh existing Allied and Healthcare related professionals inthe country and several other graduating professionals joining workforce annually and contributing to the health system. However, since this Bill is directed to strengthen the healthcare delivery system at large, it may be saidthat the entire population of the country and the health sector as a whole will be benefited by this Bill.

 

Background:

 


	In the current state of healthcare system, there exist many allied and healthcare professionals, who remain unidentified, unregulated and underutilised. Our system is highly focused on efforts towards strengthening limited categories of professionals such as doctors, nurses and frontline workers (like Accredited Social Health Activist or ASHAs, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife or ANMs). However, numerous others have been identified over the years, whose potential can be utilised to improve and increase the access to quality driven services in the rural and hard to reach areas.


 


	Allied and Healthcare Professionals (A&HPs) constitute an important element of the health human resource network, and the skilled and efficient Allied and Healthcare Professionals (A&HPs) can reduce the cost of care and dramatically improve the accessibility to quality driven healthcare services.


 


	Globally, Allied and Healthcare Professionals typically attend undergraduate degree programme of a minimum of three to four years to begin with and may attain up to PhD level qualification in their respective streams. However, most of Indian institutions offering such courses lack standardisation.


 


	Majority of the countries worldwide, have a statutory licensing or regulatory body that is authorised to license and certify the qualifications and competence of such professionals, particularly those involved in direct patient care (such as physiotherapist, nutritionist etc.) or those whose occupation impact patient care directly (such as lab technologists, dosimetrists etc.).


 


	Though such professionals have existed in the Indian healthcare system for many decades, a considerable gap in the allied and healthcare space is because of a lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework and absence of standards for education and training of A&HPs.


 


	The Bill thus seeks to establish a robust regulatory framework which will play the role of a standard-setter and regulator for Allied and Healthcare professions.

The Cabinet observed two-minute silence in his memory and passed a condolence resolution. The text of resolution is as follows:

“Shri Ananthkumar was born on 22nd July, 1959 in Bengaluru. He earned his Bachelor's Degree in English literature from Karnataka University in Hubballi and LLB Degree from JSS Law College, Karnataka University.

Shri Anantkumar started his public activities as a student activist. Subsequently, he became a member of the BJP and was the Organising Secretary of the Party's Karnataka Unit. Later on, he became the President of the Party in Karnataka. It was under his stewardship that Party expanded in the State of Karnataka and eventually formed the Government of its own. He was the National General Secretary of the Party and a Member Secretary of its Parliamentary Board. He was amongst key strategists of the Party.

 In 1996, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Bengaluru South for the first time. In his subsequent term as an MP in 1998, he became the youngest minister in the Vajpayee Cabinet and was appointed the Minister for Civil Aviation. He continued to represent the prestigious Bengaluru South Lok Sabha Constituency till date, for the 6th time.

In his long political career, he had earlier held the portfolios of Union Minister of Tourism; Culture, Youth Affairs and Sports; Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation; Rural Development. He had also been Chairman and member of several Parliamentary Committees.

Shri Ananthkumar was an active social worker and was involved through his NGOs in undertaking many social service projects such as providing nutritious mid-day meal to under-privileged school children with Government support, running a mobile unit fitted with educational gadgets covering different schools situated in slums of Bengaluru, adoption of Government schools to provide drinking water and other facilities and running vocational training programmes for under-privileged, especially girls and women. He also launched an initiative called 'Green Bengaluru 1:1', which aims to increase the green cover in Bengaluru by planting one crore saplings for taking 'Tree-to-Person' ratio to at least one in Bengaluru. This initiative has seen regular planting and nurturing drives.

The Cabinet places on record its appreciation of Shri Ananthkumar's services to the Nation in different capacities. The Cabinet also expresses its deep sense of grief on his death. In his untimely demise, the Nation has lost an experienced leader. On behalf of the entire Nation, the Cabinet extends its heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family”.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the following:


	""In-principle"" approval for leasing out six airports of AAI viz. Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram and Mangaluru for operation, management and development under Public Private Partnership (PPP) through Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC).
	Constitution of an Empowered Group of Secretaries headed by CEO, NITI Aayog with Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs and Secretary, Department of Expenditure to decide on any issue falling beyond the scope of PPPAC.


Benefits:


	PPP in infrastructure projects brings efficiency in service delivery, expertise, enterprise and professionalism apart from harnessing the needed investments in the public sector.
	The PPP in airport infrastructure projects has brought World class infrastructure at airports, delivery of efficient and timely services to the airport passengers, augmenting revenue stream to the Airports Authority of India without making any investment, etc. of these, for development of Greenfield Airports at Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Presently, the airports being managed under the PPP model include Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Cochin. 
	The PPP airports in India have been ranked among the top 5 in their respective categories by the Airports Council International (ACI) in terms of Airport Service Quality (ASQ). 
	While these PPP experiments have helped create world class airports, it has also helped AAI in enhancing its revenues and focusing on developing airports and Air Navigation infrastructure in the rest of the country.


Background:

The increase in domestic and international air travel in India combined with congestion at most airports, and the strong traffic growth at the 5 airports which were privatized over a decade ago has attracted the attention of several international operators and investors. The airport sector is the top contender among infrastructure sectors in terms of international interest. International operators and investors prefer brownfield airport expansion opportunities with having more than 3-4 million passenger capacity. The airport sector may provide an immediate opportunity to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) by adoption of a PPP approach.

Therefore, it has been decided to lease out six airports viz. Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guwahati, Thiruvanthapuram and Mangaluru of AAI in the first phase for development, operation and management under PPP. This is expected to enhance the revenue to AAI and increased economic development in these areas in terms of job creation and related infrastructure. .

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of India joining as Member of Advanced Motor Fuels Technology Collaboration Programme (AMF TCP)under International Energy Agency (IEA) on 9thMay, 2018.  AMF TCP works under the framework of International Energy Agency (IEA) to which India has ""Association"" status since 30thMarch, 2017.

 

Details:

 

The primary goal of joining AMF TCP by Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoP&NG) is to facilitate the market introduction of Advanced motor fuels/ Alternate fuels with an aim to bring down emissions and achieve higher fuel efficiency in transport sector. AMF TCP also provides an opportunity for fuel analysis, identifying new/ alternate fuels for deployment in transport sector and allied R&D activities for reduction in emissions in fuel intensive sectors.

 

The R&D work in AMF TCP is carried out within individual projects called ""Annex"". Over the years, more than 50 Annexes have been initiated in AMF TCP and a number of fuels have been covered in previous Annexes such as reformulatedfuels (gasoline & diesel), biofuels (ethanol, biodiesel etc.), synthetic fuels (methanol, Fischer- Tropsch, DME etc.) and gaseous fuels. R&D Institutions of Public sector Oil Marketing companies and Automobile Testing Agencies such as ARAI, CIRT, ICAT etc. have State-of-the-art facilities and resources will also be a contributor to the Annex(s) participated by MoP&NG.

 

Prime Minister at UrjaSangam, 2015 had directed to reduce the import in energy sector by at least 10% by 2022.  Subsequently, MoP&NG has come up with a detailed action plan wherein Biofuels, Advanced/ alternate fuels and fuel efficiency play a major role. Association with AMF TCP will help MoP&NG in furthering its efforts in identification & deployment of suitable fuels for transport sector in respect of higher efficiency and lesser emissions.

 

Government of India has recently notified National Policy on Biofuels-2018 which focusses on giving impetus to R&D in field of advanced biofuels such as 2G Ethanol, Bio-CNG, biomethanol, Drop-in fuels, DME etc. These advanced fuels can be produced from various kind of wastes such as crop residues, Municipal solid waste, Industrial waste, waste gases, Food waste, plastic etc. Though some of these advanced biofuels have successfully been deployed in few countries, India is still awaiting its deployment in transport sector. These advanced fuels are presently in their early stages of development in our Country and necessitate extensive R&D for making these fuels a viable option for meeting our energy needs. Association with AMF will help MoP&NG in identifying advanced biofuels suitable for deployment in transport sector in near future. In such cases, experience of member countries in deploying advanced biofuels will be an additional benefit for MoP&NG.

 

The benefits of participation in AMF TCP are shared costs and pooled technical resources. The duplication of efforts is avoided and national Research and Development capabilities are strengthened. There is an information exchange about best practices, network of researchers and linking research with practical implementation. After becoming member, India will initiate R&D in other areas of its interest in advanced biofuels and other motor fuels in view of their crucial role in substituting fossil fuel imports.

 

Background:

 

AMF TCP is an international platform for co-operation among countries to promote cleaner and more energy efficient fuels & vehicle technologies. The activities of AMF TCP relate to R&D, deployment and dissemination of Advanced Motor Fuels and looks upon the transport fuel issues in a systemic way taking into account the production, distribution and end use related aspects.

 

Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Government of India has joined AMF TCP as its 16th member on 9th May, 2018. The other member Countries of AMF TCP are USA, China, Japan, Canada, Chile, Israel, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Spain, Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Thailand.

          The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the mechanism and procedure for sale of the enemy shares. Details are as follows:

 


	 ‘In principle’ approval has been accorded for sale of enemy shares under the Custody of Ministry of Home Affairs/ Custodian of Enemy Property of India (CEPI), as per sub-section 1 of section 8A of the Enemy Property Act, 1968.
	Department of Investment and Public Asset Management has been authorized under the provisions of sub-section 7 of section 8A of the Enemy Property Act, 1968, to sell the same.
	Sale proceeds are to be deposited as disinvestment proceeds in the Government Account maintained by Ministry of Finance. 


 

Details:

 


	
	
		
		
			A total number of 6,50,75,877 shares in 996 companies of 20,323 shareholders are under the custody of CEPI.  Of these 996 companies, 588 are functional/ active companies, 139 of these are listed with remaining being unlisted.  The process for selling these shares is to be approved by the Alternative Mechanism (AM) under the Chairmanship of Finance Minister and comprising Minister of Road Transport and Highway and Home Minister.  The AM will be supported by a High Level Committee (HLC) of officers co-chaired by the Secretary, DIPAM and Secretary, MHA (with representatives from DEA, DLA, M/o Corporate Affairs and CEPI) that would give its recommendations with regard to quantum, price/price-band, principles/ mechanisms for sale of shares, etc.
		
		
	
	


 


	
	
		
		
			Before initiation of sale of any Enemy Shares, the CEPI shall certify that the sale of the Enemy Shares is not in contravention of any judgment, decree or order of any court, tribunal or other authority or any law for the time being in force and can be disposed off by the Government. 
		
		
	
	


 


	
	
		
		
			The advisors/ intermediaries like Merchant Bankers, Legal Adviser, Selling Brokers etc. as may be required for the disposal of movable enemy property, will be appointed by DIPAM through an open tender/limited tender process. An Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG) will guide the process of sale.  
		
		
	
	


 

In the Act of 1968, the definition of ""enemy"" was as follows: ""enemy"" or ""enemy subject"" or ""enemy firm"" means a person or country who or which was an enemy, an enemy subject or an enemy firm, as the case may be, under the Defence of India Act and Rules, but does not include a citizen of India.  In the amendment of 2017, this was substituted by “.... including his legal heir or successor, whether or not citizen of India or the citizen of a country which is not an enemy or the enemy..... who has changed his nationality”.  

 

Impact:

 


	The decision will lead to monetization of enemy shares that had been lying dormant for decades since coming into force and the Enemy Property Act in 1968.


 


	With the amendment of 2017, an enabling legislative provision was created for the disposal of enemy property.


 


	With the approval, now, of the procedure and mechanism for sale of enemy shares an enabling framework has been institutionalized for their sale. 


 

Major Impact:

 

The decision will lead to monetization of movable enemy property lying dormant for decades. Sale proceeds from this may be used for development and social welfare programmes.

 

Background:

 


	
	
		The Enemy Property Act, 1968 provides for continued vesting of enemy property vested in the CEPI under the Defence of India Rules, 1962 and the Defence of India Rules, 1971, (w.e.f. 27.09.1997). 
	
	


 


	
	
		In 2017, through an amendment to this Act, vide Section 8A, the CEPI has been empowered for sale of enemy property. Further, 
	
	
	“ Notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment, decree or order of any court, tribunal or other authority or any law for the time being in force, the Custodian may, within such time as may be specified by the Central Government in this behalf, dispose of whether by sale or otherwise, as the case may be, with prior approval of the Central Government, by general or special order, enemy properties vested in him immediately before the date of commencement of the Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2017 in accordance with the provisions of this Act, as amended by the Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2017”.


 


	According to amendment, as in sub-section 7 of section 8A of the Enemy Property Act, 1968, Central Government may direct that disposal of enemy property shall be made by any other authority or Ministry or Department instead of Custodian.

                          The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the filling of Padur Strategic Petroleum Reserves(SPR) at Padur, Karnataka by overseas National Oil Companies (NOCs). The SPR facility at Padur is an underground rock cavern with a total capacity of 2.5 million metric tonnes (MMT) having four compartments of 0.625 MMT each. The filling of the SPR under PPP model is being undertaken to reduce budgetary support of Government of India. 

          The Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd. (ISPRL) has constructed and commissioned underground rock caverns for storage of total 5.33 MMT of crude oil at three locations namely Vishakhapatnam (1.33 MMT), Mangalore (1.5 MMT) and Padur (2.5 MMT). The total 5.33 MMT capacity under Phase-I of the SPR programme is currently estimated to supply approximately 9.5 days of India’s crude requirement according to the consumption data for FY 2017-18. Government has given ‘in principle’ approval in June 2018 for establishing additional 6.5 MMT SPR facilities at Chandikhol in Odisha and Padur in Karnataka, which is expected to augment India’s energy security by 11.5 days according the consumption data for FY 2017-18.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Agreement between India and Morocco on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters.

 

Benefits:

The Agreement will provide a broad legal framework for bilateral cooperation between India and Morocco in investigation and prosecution of crime, tracing, restraint, forfeiture or confiscation or proceeds and instruments of crime. It aims to increase effectiveness in investigation and prosecution of crime, and in providing the necessary peaceful ambience which is a pre-requisite for the development of society as a whole. It will further be instrumental in gaining better inputs and insights in the modus operandi of organized criminals and terrorists, which in turn can be used to fine-tune policy decisions in the field of Internal Security.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to expand the scope of mandatory packaging norms under the Jute Packaging Material (JPM) Act, 1987 as follows: 


	The CCEA approved that 100% of the food grains and 20% of the sugar shall be mandatorily packed in diversified jute bags. The decision to pack sugar in diversified jute bags will give an impetus to the diversification of the jute industry. 
	Initially 10% of the indents of jute bags for packing foodgrains would be placed through reverse auction on the Gem portal. This will gradually usher in a regime of price discovery.


 

Impact:


	The decision will give a fillip to the development of jute sector; increasing the quality and productivity of raw jute, diversification of jute sector and also boosting and sustaining demand for jute product.
	This is important considering the fact that nearly 3.7 lakh workers and several lakh farm families are dependent for their livelihood on the jute sectors, the government has been making concerted efforts. 
	The jute industry is predominantly dependent on Government sector which purchases jute bags of value of more than Rs. 6,500 crore every year for packing foodgrains. This is done in order to sustain the core demand for the jute sector and to support the livelihood of the workers and farmers dependent on the sector.
	The decision will benefit farmers and workers located in the Eastern and North Eastern regions of the country particularly in the states of West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya and Tripura.


 

Measures by the Government to support the Jute Sector:


	In order to improve the productivity and quality of raw jute through a carefully designed intervention, called the Jute ICARE, the Government has been supporting close to one lakh jute farmers by disseminating improved agronomic practices such as line sowing using seed drills, weed management by using wheel-hoeing and nail-weeders, distribution of quality certified seeds and also providing microbial assisted retting. These interventions have resulted in enhancing the quality and productivity of raw jute and increasing income of jute farmers by Rs. 10,000 per hectare.


 


	In this connection, to support jute farmers, Jute Corporation of India (JCI) has been given a grant of Rs. 100 crore for 2 years starting from 2018-19 to enable JCI to conduct MSP operations and ensure price stabilization in the jute sector.


 


	With a view to support diversification of jute sector, the National Jute Board has collaborated with National Institute of Design and a Jute Design Cell has been opened at Gandhinagar. Further, promotion of Jute Geo Textiles and Agro-Textiles has been taken up with the State Governments particularly those in the North Eastern region and also with departments such as Ministry of Road Transport and Ministry of Water Resources.


 


	With a view to boost demand in the jute sector, Government of India has imposed Definitive Anti-Dumping Duty on import of jute goods from Bangladesh and Nepal with effect from 5th January, 2017. As a result of these measures, 13 Twine mills in Andhra Pradesh had resumed operation, benefitting 20,000 workers. Further, imposition of Definitive Anti-Dumping Duty has provided scope for an additional demand of 2 lakh MT of jute goods in the domestic market for the Indian jute industry.


 


	With a view to promoting transparency in jute sector, Jute SMART, an e-govt initiative was launched in December, 2016, providing an integrated platform for procurement of B-Twill sacking by Government agencies. Further, the JCI is transferring 100% funds to jute farmers online for jute procurement under MSP and commercial operations.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has given ‘in principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 100% Government of India's shares in DCIL to consortium of four ports namely, Vishakhapatnam Port Trust, Paradeep Port Trust, Jawahar Lal Nehru Port Trust and Kandla Port Trust.

Presently the Government of India holds 73.44% shares in Dredging Corporation of India Limited. The approval will further facilitate the linkage of dredging activities with the ports, keeping in view the role of the DCIL in expansion of dredging activity in the country as well as potential scope for diversification of ports into third party dredging. The co-sharing of facilities between the company as well as ports shall lead to savings for ports.  This would further provide opportunities for larger investment in DCIL as integration with ports shall help ineffective vertical linkage in the value chain.

The strategic disinvestment of DCIL shall be undertaken after conducting due diligence exercise by both the entities with the help of Advisors, appointed for the transaction.

The AYUSH Minister informed that the ancient Scriptures of Ayurveda have at least 1.25 lakhs formulations which are collected in Traditional knowledge Digital Library. Each one of these formulations can be used to treat 20 to 30 different diseases. In this way we have 20 lakh medicines which is an incredible and unimaginable figure for entrepreneurs.      

Dr.  Mahesh Sharma said that Ayurveda is a part of our rich cultural heritage and we have to propagate it not only in India but all over the world. 

Secretary AYUSH vaidya Rajesh Kotecha said that the Ministry has taken up the challenge of increasing the market share of Ayurveda to three fold by the year 2022. He said, “We are working with Ministry of MSME to organize 50 entrepreneurship development programs in next one year in different cities covering all the states across the country. Similarly to sensitize the Ayurveda fraternity, especially the young people, we are also in close cooperation with Industry Chambers like FICCI, CII, PHD chambers and ASSOCHAM etc. to achieve this goal”.

Nearly 800 participants from across the country are expected to participate in the main function of 3rd Ayurveda day. “The seminar is expected to develop awareness among stakeholders about the business opportunities, encouraging young entrepreneurs to use of modern technologies and modern innovations in business development in the sector and to highlight opportunities at global level. The experts in marketing, finance management, innovation, telemedicine, the policy makers, experts in start-up as well as experienced entrepreneurs in Ayurveda pharmaceuticals and hospital industry will guide and share their experiences with the participants. The deliberations in the seminar are expected to educate the young entrepreneurs about the various possibilities of business development in Ayurveda sector, how to use the technology and the ease of business being facilitated by the Government for promoting their business in the field of Ayurveda.

                The Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C43) successfully launched 31 satellites from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) today in Sriharikota. 

The PSLV-C43 lifted off at 9:57:30 (IST) from the First Launch Pad and injected India’s Hyper-Spectral Imaging Satellite (HysIS) into a 645 km sun-synchronous polar orbit 17 minutes and 19 seconds after the lift-off. Later, 30 foreign satellites were injected into their intended orbit after restarting the vehicle’s fourth stage engines twice. The last satellite was injected into its designated orbit 1 hour and 49 minutes after the lift-off. 

After separation, the two solar arrays of HysIS were deployed automatically and the ISRO Telemetry Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru gained control of the satellite. The satellite will be brought to its final operational configuration in the next few days. HysIS Project Director Shri Suresh K. said that the satellite is performing normally after the launch.

HysIS is an earth observation satellite built around ISRO’s Mini Satellite2 (IMS-2) bus weighing about 380kg. The mission life of the satellite is five years. 

The primary goal of HysIS is to study the earth’s surface in both the visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Data from the satellite will be used for a wide range of applications including agriculture, forestry, soil/geological environments, coastal zones and inland waters, etc. HysIS had the company of one micro and 29 nano-satellites from eight countries, including Australia (1), Canada (1), Columbia (1), Finland (1), Malaysia (1), Netherlands (1), Spain (1) and USA (23). The total weight of these satellites was about 261.50 kg. Satellites from Australia, Columbia, Malaysia and Spain were flown aboard PSLV for the first time. These foreign satellites launched are part of commercial arrangements between Antrix Corporation Limited and customers.

Congratulating the ISRO scientists after the successful launch of PSLV C-43, ISRO Chairman Dr K. Sivan said it is a very proud moment for the nation as the HysIS was indigenously designed and built. “HysIS is a state-of-the-art satellite with many indigenous components developed by SAC, Ahmedabad and SCL, Chandigarh,” he said. 

Dr Sivan said the main purpose of the HysIS is to exactly identify the objects on the surface of the earth with high precision and resolution. “HysIS will start sending images from the fifth day of its injection. With HysIS, we have 47 operational satellites that are active now in their orbits, meant for applications like communications, earth observation, scientific studies and navigation,” he added. 

Dr Sivan said that the team has achieved another spectacular mission 15 days after the successful GSLV-MkIII/GSAT-29 launch. “Today once again we have proved our excellence,” he said. Mission Director Shri R. Hutton termed the launch as a grand and marvellous one with clockwork precision. “We have used a lighter version of PSLV today. It has once again proven its capabilities to launch multiple satellites into different orbits,” he said.

PSLV is a four stage launch vehicle with a large solid rocket motor forming the first stage, an earth storable liquid stage as the second stage, a high performance solid rocket motor as third stage and a liquid stage with engines as fourth stage.

Today’s was the 45th flight of PSLV and 13th one in the Core Alone configuration. So far, the PSLV has launched 44 Indian and nine satellites built by students from Indian universities. The vehicle has also launched 269 international customer satellites. In the last PSLV launch on September 16, PSLV-C42 had successfully launched two commercial satellites from UK-based Surrey Satellite Technology Limited. Dr Sivan thanked the foreign countries for posing faith in India to launch their Satellites. “Our customers are very happy that their satellites are precisely delivered into orbit,” said Dr Sivan.

Dr K. Sivan said in the month of December ISRO has planned two more launches, - GSAT 11 from French Guiana and GSAT 7A from Sriharikota. Next year, ISRO will have its long expected second mission to moon, Chandrayaan – II, expected in the month of January. “ISRO will launch its heaviest satellite, GSAT-11 on Dec 5, 2018, at 2.08 am from French Guiana and later GSLV-MkII will launch GSAT-7A from Sriharikota in December,” said Dr Sivan. “ISRO has planned twelve to fourteen launch missions in the year 2019, which includes Chandrayaan –II,” he added.

When asked why GSAT-11 is being launched from French Guiana, Director, U.R. Rao Satellite Centre, Shri P. Kunhikrishnan said GSAT-11 weighing 5.86 ton cannot be carried by the GSLV Mk – III which has the capacity to lift only up to four-ton class payloads. Though its capacity is being augmented gradually to carry much heavier satellites, the national space agency has to go in for launches from abroad to meet the current requirement.  

Speaking on the Gaganyaan, Dr Sivan said the process is going in the right direction and ISRO is planning to launch the first unmanned mission as a precursor to Gaganyaan by December 2020, followed by one more mission by July 2021. He further added that ISRO plans to accomplish the manned mission by December, 2021.

            India’s GSAT-29 communication satellite was successfully launched by the second developmental flight of Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle MarkIII (GSLV MkIII-D2) today from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota. 

GSLV MkIII-D2 lifted off from the Second Launch Pad of SDSC SHAR at 17:08 hours (IST), carrying the 3423-kg GSAT-29 satellite. About 17 minutes later, the vehicle injected the satellite into the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) as planned. 

After injection, ISRO’s Master Control Facility at Hassan has assumed the control of the satellite. In the coming days, three orbit raising manoeuvers will be executed to position the satellite in the Geostationary Orbit at its designated location.

 GSLV Mk III is a three-stage heavy lift launch vehicle developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). 

Two massive boosters with solid propellant constitute the first stage, the core with liquid propellant form the second stage and the cryogenic engine completes the final stage. 

GSAT-29 is a multiband, multi-beam communication satellite, intended to serve as test bed for several new and critical technologies. Its Ku-band and Ka-band payloads are configured to cater to the communication requirements of users including those from remote areas especially from Jammu & Kashmir and North-Eastern regions of India. 

In addition, the Q/V-Band communication payload onboard is intended to demonstrate the future high throughput satellite system technologies. Geo High Resolution Camera will carry out high resolution imaging. Optical Communication Payload will demonstrate data transmission at a very high rate through optical communication link.

 After the successful launch, ISRO Chairman Dr K Sivan said: “India has achieved significant milestone with our heaviest launcher lifting off the heaviest satellite from the Indian soil. The launch vehicle has precisely placed the satellite in its intended orbit. I congratulate entire ISRO team for this achievement.” 

Declaring GSLV MKIII operational, Dr Sivan announced that Chandrayaan-2 and Gaganyaan missions will be launched by this heavy-lifter. 

Shri Jayakumar B, Mission Director, GSLV Mark III said it is the guidance of the Mentors at ISRO that helped the team to march ahead while facing obstacles. “The industry partners too played a key role in this mission,” he said. 

Shri K Pankaj Damodar, Project Director, GSAT-29 said the launch will help to bridge the digital divide. He also said several next generation payload technologies will be demonstrated with this mission soon. 

The success of GSLV MkIII-D2 marks an important milestone in Indian space programme towards achieving self-reliance in launching heavier satellites. The success of this flight also signifies the completion of the experimental phase of GSLV Mark III. 

The first successful mission of GSLV Mark III was an experimental suborbital flight in 2014. Subsequently, GSLV Mark III-D1 launched GSAT-19, a high throughput communication satellite, with a lift-off mass of 3150 kg, into GTO on June 5, 2017.

                            The Election Commission of India today announced the launch of its newly designed website at https://eci.gov.in . The completely revamped website features a streamlined and simplified design, improved functionality, and enriched content areas which will help visitors to make well-informed decisions regarding their election-related matters. 

The new website has been built keeping users in mind. The streamlined user interface provides a more interactive experience, allowing users to easily find the information they are looking for. Visitors can browse the website based on their own interests and learn more about Election Process in a more engaging way.

With a fresh look and feel, the new site offers users the opportunity to navigate through Election Commission of India extensive resource and service offering with ease. Delivering a fully responsive experience, the new website gives users a seamless transition from desktop to mobile browsing, and intelligently pulls the latest content from all the relevant space for users to access information, quickly and easily.

Departing from the legacy format of separate areas, the new visitor sees everything rehoused in one central space with the ability to browse content based on topic or division. 

“We are excited about the launch of our new site, we hope every citizen will be able to find information on the Election Commission of India website with ease. Visitors would love the new look and feel of the site, especially the new navigation where all of ECI content is available in one place. The revamped website demonstrates our commitment to free, fair and inclusive elections. The new site is an important piece for our voter-centric strategy and aligns ECI digital platform much more closely to ECI vision”- says Sh. O.P Rawat, Chief Election Commissioner.

            New Features of the site include


	Responsive Design: The New Website is fully mobile optimized. The mobile-optimized ECI site is a far more advanced website. Mobile optimized means that the ECI site will reformat itself for handheld or tablet devices. Larger navigation buttons, the reformatted content, and differently optimized images appear when the user is on an iPhone/ Android or another device.  Not only is the new ECI website mobile optimized, but it is also with a fully responsive design. Responsive design means that ECI site is completely flexible regardless of device. Rather than detecting a specific browser type or device type, the website automatically orients itself based on the screen size of the device. A combination of reformatting and re-optimizing the site as a whole provides a practical flexibility beyond imagination.
	Revamped and easy navigation: The site has been primarily designed keeping in view Citizens, Electors, Candidates, Political party, Researchers, Media, and ECI Officials. The categorization has also been kept in mind for purposes of easy navigation and role-based access control. The new website has further enhanced the security features keeping in view the Cyber Security Regulations of ECI
	Advance search: “Surface the most compelling content”. With a number of powerful tools to help users to discover the new content, the new website decreases the time users will spend searching for relevant content of his choice. A full search engine is included with precise controls for finding content. With a wide range of filters available and the ability to drill down by content type, finding relevant content is simple. It's convenient too - the quick search box is available on every page.
	Universally Accessible: The site has been made accessible for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs). The newly designed website has accessible features like screen reader access, high contrast, structured headings e.t.c
	Dynamic Content & Sharing: One of the paramount requirements of the modern world is faster information sharing through various social media platform. The new ECI website provides extensive sharing features through modes such as Email, Facebook, Twitter, and others.  The decentralized content deployment will ensure accurate and fast dissemination of news, circulars, and messages.


As the existing website was familiar to many users, Commission had made sure that the existing website continues to operate for a short while. The existing website will continue to be available at https://eci.nic.in and the new website will be operational at https://eci.gov.in.

Changes to the ECI Website appearance and design will be apparent to any person visiting the website who has been familiar with the earlier version. The ECI ICT Division has significantly modernized this user interface to accommodate a growing user-base, as the Election Commission of India continues to branch out into new technology areas and caters for massive information dissemination requirements for its 875 million Electors during the upcoming elections.

The production of pulses also rose by 40% from 18.01 million tonne in 2010-14 to 25.23 million tonne (4th Advance Estimate) in 2017-18. Production of horticulture crops recorded 15.79% growth, fisheries production under Blue Revolution 26.86% and animal husbandry & milk production 23.80%.

He said that in order to reduce the cost of production, Soil Health Card, use of neem-coated urea and schemes related to ‘per drop more crop' are being targeted and implemented. To promote organic farming, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) was initiated in 2014-15 and for north east Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCD-NER) was started. He further said that National Agriculture Market (eNAM), a new market mechanism has been started in order to ensure remunerative price for the farmers’ produce while advancing towards 'one nation one market'. Till March 2018, the target of integrating 585 mandis with e-NAM has been achieved.  Besides this, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) was initiated from Kharif 2016 to overcome the risks related to agriculture against disasters. This scheme covers all foodgrains, oilseeds and commercial/ horticultural crops. All risks - prior to the crop sowing, during the harvest and after harvest - are included in the scheme.

Shri Singh added that the government is also promoting quality in agriculture through food processing. Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana has been started with an allocation of Rs 6,000 crore. The forward and backward linkage of agro processing clusters is being developed in order to enhance food processing capabilities. Close to 20 lakh farmers are being benefitted while also creating employment opportunities for about 5.5 lakh people.

The Minister informed that the government has taken a historic decision towards fulfilling the promise made to farmers by increasing MSP by 1.5 times or more of production cost for all notified crops from Kharif 2018-19.

Union Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister Shri Radha Mohan Singh has said that agriculture and dairy business complement each other for the social and economic upliftment of cattle farmers. To achieve this objective, it is essential to have good quality livestock breed in order to increase production. Speaking on the occasion of “National Milk Day” he said that under the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM), 10 semen centres have been identified for the production of Sex Sorted Semen for the production of more female animals. Proposals for two centres, in Uttarakhand and Maharashtra, have been approved. The foundation stone of sex sorted semen centre in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand was laid in June 2018. Besides, INDUSCHIP has been developed for genomic selection of indigenous breeds and 6000 dairy animals have been genetically evaluated using it. He informed that under the RGM, 20 Gokul Grams in 13 states at a total cost of Rs 197 crore have been approved. Apart from this, Under the Pashu Sanjivni component of the scheme, 9 crore milch animals are being identified using UID (Unique Identification Device). 

He said that the credit for India becoming the world’s largest milk producer goes to livestock farmers and the various schemes of the Indian government. He further added that 20 Embryo Transfer Technology (ETT) centres are being established in the country and proposal of 19 centres have been approved so far. These centres are producing 3000 high genetic merit bulls of indigenous bovine breeds.

Shri Singh added that in an effort to double farmers’ income, the government launched e-pashuhaat (https://epashuhaat.gov.in/) portal in November 2016. The portal is playing a crucial role in connecting farmers, breeders and other agencies to trade in disease-free germplasm, namely live animals, frozen semen and embryos. Now, a mobile application - e-pashuhat (GPMS Transportal) - has been created and integrated with UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) application. Farmers can download UMANG app on their mobile phone from Google Play store and Apple App store.  They can now know the availability of disease-free germplasm services within 100KM radius of their location. So far, e-pashuhaat (GPMS Transportal) App has been automatically downloaded and available for 1 crore registered UMANG users.

The Minister informed that this year a new scheme the Dairy Processing & Infrastructure Development Fund (DIDF) has been initiated by the government. It aims to benefit 95 lakh milk producers in 50,000 villages and provide both direct and indirect employment to many skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers. He said that under the Dairy Entrepreneurship Development Scheme, there is a provision to provide financial assistance for providing self employment opportunities in various activities from milk production to marketing. Under this, 3, 31,314 dairy units have been established and the government has provided subsidy of Rs 1401.96 crore. Apart from this, World Bank-funded National Dairy Plan Phase-I, National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD) etc. are being operationalised by the state governments through milk cooperative / federations related to the state.

Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh has said that Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University has begun work on five new themes targeted by Union Agriculture Ministry for the development of agriculture sector. These include “har khet ko pani”, increase the production of pulses, soil health, doubling farmers’ income and more crop per drop. He informed that in two years, positive results have started to appear. Major works include irrigation through solar power and single phase pumps, seed production of pulse crops, soil testing in farmers' fields through six mobile soil testing laboratories, food processing to double the income of farmers, mushroom production, honey production, research on reduction of post-harvest losses and efficient irrigation system. 

Speaking on the occasion of the first convocation ceremony of Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Pusa, Samastipur (Bihar) he stated that the Modi government has granted a lot of support to strengthen this University. Horticulture and Forestry College, Centre of Excellence on Embryo transfer & indigenous breed, a new centre for beekeeping, modern processing center for jaggery production etc are important steps in this direction. Apart from this, a center for Sahiwal breed in Bettiah, training centre by National Cooperative Development Corporation, seed storage and sale centre by National Seeds Corporation, fish production by cage culture in all KVKs are also proposed. Shri Singh said that Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has launched four new projects to accelerate the 'Lab to Farm' programme for all-round development of agriculture. In order to increasing the connectivity of farmers with scientists, technical assessment, evaluation, training and capacity building, the government has initiated the Farmer First program.

Considering the importance of capacity development for entrepreneurship in rural youth, Student READY (Rural Entrepreneurship Awareness Development Yojana) program has been started and in order to create new opportunities of employment generation for the youth in agriculture and to prevent their migrations, Attracting and Retaining of Youth in Agriculture (ARYA) has been started. The Minister said that under the “Mera Gaon Mera Gaurav” program, agricultural experts of agricultural universities and ICAR have been given the responsibility of a village in order to create awareness among farmers about scientific farming. The Minister hoped that the university is soon counted among the leading universities of the country and the seeds & technologies developed here bring prosperity to the farmers of Bihar and the country thereby doubling their income.

 To cater to the needs and aspirations of the youth, the National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) has come up with a youth-friendly scheme ‘Yuva Sahakar-Cooperative Enterprise Support and Innovation Scheme” for attracting them to cooperative business ventures.

“NCDC has created a dedicated fund with liberal features enabling youth to avail the scheme,” Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh said at the launch of   the scheme.

The Central Government has been encouraging ‘Start-Ups’ for ease of doing business, non-conventional opportunities are emerging and are being encouraged. The conducive environment is being leveraged by private and corporate sectors and ‘Hub Start-ups’ are being promoted. The newly launched scheme would encourage cooperatives to venture into new and innovative areas.

The scheme will be linked to Rs 1000 crore ‘Cooperative Start-up and Innovation Fund (CSIF)’ created by the NCDC. It would have more incentives for cooperatives of North Eastern region, Aspirational Districts and cooperatives with women or SC or ST or PwD members. The funding for the project will be up to 80% of the project cost for these special categories as against 70% for others. The scheme envisages 2% less than the applicable rate of interest on term loan for the project cost up to Rs 3 crore including 2 years moratorium on payment of principal. All types of cooperatives in operation for at least one year are eligible.

The Minister explained that this scheme is expected to meet the needs of today’s youth. He added that NCDC, being the most preferred financial institution in the world of cooperatives, has embarked on Sahakar 22, a Mission for Doubling Farmers’ Income by 2022.

The Minister while complimenting the NCDC on its remarkable performance since 2014 stated that  the NCDC had an excellent track record and would provide the required handholding for making the scheme a success.

The NCDC has the unique distinction of being the sole statutory organisation functioning as an apex financial and developmental institution exclusively devoted to cooperative sector. It supports cooperatives in diverse fields apart from agriculture and allied sectors. It is an ISO 9001:2015 compliant organisation and has a distinctive edge of competitive financing. It has extended financial assistance of Rs 63702.61 crore during 2014-2018 (as on November 13), 220% more than Rs 19850.6 during 2010-14.

Union Agriculture Secretary Mr Sanjay Agarwal and NCDC MD Shri Sundeep Kumar Nayak were also present at the launch.

The Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh hailed the efforts of Prof. M. S. Swaminathan, the architect of India’s Green Revolution and said that India is today not only self-sufficient in foodgrains but is also an exporter due to his efforts. Shri Singh appreciatedand felicitated Professor M. S. Swaminathan, the recipient of the World Agriculture Prize at an event in Chennai.

The Union Agriculture Ministersaid that under the ‘Green Revolution’ programme led by Prof. Swaminathan in 1960s and 80s, wheat and rice seeds with better yields were planted in the farmers' fields. This revolution made India self-reliant in foodgrain in less than 25 years thereby bringing glory to Swaminathan as the scientific leader of India’s ‘Green Revolution Movement'. Shri Singh added that Prof. Swaminathan has won many awards and recently won the World Agriculture Prize conferred by the Indian Council of Food and Agriculture (ICFA) for his research on genetics, cytogenetics, radiation and food and biodiversity conservation.

The Union Minister asserted that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi led government, after taking over in 2014, started working towards all-round development of the agriculture sector. Shri Singh said that it has always been the government’s vision to not only fill the stock of agriculture commodities but also to enhance the income of farmers. In this context, the Dalwai Committee was constituted for doubling farmers’ income. The government is working with a concrete strategy in line with the recommendations of the DFI committee. To reduce the cost of production, the use of soil health card and neem-coated urea and schemes related to “more crop per drop” are being targeted and successfully implemented.

Shri Singh further added that for the first time in 2014-15, the government launched a comprehensive scheme to promote organic farming in the country. Under this, the Paramparagat Krishi VikasYojana (PKVY) is being implemented and Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) is also being implemented as a central scheme for the northeast region considering the possibility of organic farming in this part of the country. 

The Union Agriculture Minister reiterated government’s commitment to ensure remunerative price to farmers for their produce. The goal of integrating 585 mandis with e-NAM has been achieved till March 2018. By 2019-20, additional 415 mandis (200 in 2018-19 and 215 in 2019-20) will be integrated with e-NAM. Besides, the government started the Pradhan MantriFasalBimaYojana (PMFBY) from Kharif 2016 to eliminate the risks associated with agriculture. 

Shri Singh praised the role of ICAR in achieving the goal of doubling the income of farmers by 2022. In the last three years, high-yielding variety crops that are tolerant to climate change, bio-fortified crops and new animal breeds have been developed. In order to bring self-reliance in the area of pulse production, 150 seed hubs have been set up in the country, resulting in record production of 22 million tonnes of pulses. In order to increase the income of small and marginal farmers of the country, 45 integrated farming system models have been developed, in which special emphasis has been given to livestock farming, poultry rearing and horticulture. 

The Union Agriculture Minister further informed that the Rashtriya Gokul Mission has been initiated for conservation and promotion of indigenous breeds. Under this a sum of Rs 546.15 crore has been released to the states till March 31, 2018& called the government’s decision of implementing the hike in MSP by atleast 1.5 times of all Kharif 2018-19 crops as historic thereby fulfilling the promise made in the budget of 2018-19. Shri Singh expressed hope that under the leadership of Professor Swaminathan, the agriculture and food security will continue to be sustainable in the coming years in India and the government will be successful in doubling the income of farmers within the given target.

The Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh addressed the Inter-Session Meeting of Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare in New Delhi today. Shri Singh’s address focused on the “Climate Resilient Villages and their Replication” in which he stated that the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has taken up a flagship programme - National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) to comprehensively address the impact of climate change and variability on crops, horticulture, livestock, and fisheries. Its aim is to develop adaptation & mitigation practices to minimize the losses and to enhance resilience of Indian agriculture. 

The Union Agriculture Minister said that the project has components of research technology demonstration and capacity building. The technology demonstration component aims at demonstrating location specific technologies to minimise the impact of climate change in farmers’ fields. It is being taken up in 151 climatically vulnerable districts across the country by taking one representative village in each district.  The predominant climatic vulnerabilities addressed are drought, flood, cyclone, heat wave, cold wave, frost and hail storm. 

The Minister informed that the technologies demonstrated can be categorised into four modules namely Natural Resource Management, Crop production & Horticulture, Livestock & Fisheries and creation of Institutions in the village. The technologies for demonstration were identified based on the climatic vulnerability, predominant farming systems in the village and the resource availability.  These demonstrations have led to minimization of impact of climatic variability and stabilized production leading to their adoption.

Shri Singh further said that several states have shown interest in replicating the climate resilient village models. For example, the Government of Maharashtra through World Bank funding formulated a project by the name PoCRA with a budget outlay of Rs 4500 crore being implemented in 5000 villages in the drought prone villages of Vidharbha and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra. Several other state governments also initiated similar projects of climate resilient agriculture (Karnataka, Odisha, Telangana etc.). 

The Minister emphasised the need to bring convergence of these programmes at the village level so as to enhance the adaptive capacity of communities to effectively address the concerns of climate change. Shri Singh further added that in order to effectively bring convergence of the developmental programmes at the village level and at the household level, there is a need for an integrated scheme by converging the ongoing schemes.  This suggested title could be Integrated Climate Resilient Agriculture Programme (INCRAP). A few pilots may be taken up in identified climatically most vulnerable districts of the country by selecting few villages / mandals / blocks as implementing units. The experiences of such pilots can be used for the spread of Climate Resilient Villages in the country.

                Minister of State for Chemicals & Fertilizers, Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya informed in a statement here today that patients across the country have saved around Rs. 15,000 crores under Government’s initiative of ensuring ‘Affordable, Quality Medicines for All’, as per estimates of the National Pharmaceutical Pricing authority (NPPA).

Following the vision of Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, to ensure health security for all citizens of India, the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers has taken the step of fixation of ceiling prices and MRPs of essential and lifesaving drugs, as the case may be, by implementing the Drug Prices Control Order (DPCO), 2013. This step has resulted in patients saving over Rs. 5,000 crores since then, which is a big step in the direction of ensuring that no citizen suffers due to lack of affordable and good quality medicines in the country, the Minister said.

Further, Shri Mandaviya informed that these savings are in addition to approximately 10 lakh heart patients saving around Rs. 8,000 crores since fixation of ceiling prices of coronary stents (in February 2017, including re-fixation in February 2018)  and around 1.5 lakh knee patients saving about Rs. 2,000 crores since price fixation of knee implants (in August 2017).

                Impact of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on Pharma sector has largely been positive and constructive, informed Minister of State for Road Transport, Highways, Shipping and Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, in a statement here today. Following the vision of Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, to ensure health security for all citizens of India, the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers has taken various steps to ensure availability of ‘Affordable, Quality Medicines for All’, the Minister added.

In this background, Shri Mandaviya informed that the Pharma sector has seen a positive growth after the implementation of GST. This is evident from the following:-

Before GST, Annual Turnover of the Pharma Sector (as on 31.05.2017) was Rs 1,14,231 crores while after GST, the Annual Turnover of Pharma sector (as on 31.05.2018) touched Rs 1,31,312 crores, which is 6% higher than the Pre-GST regime.

Exports from Pharma Sector during 2016-17 were Rs 2,75,852 crores while post-GST, in the year 2017-18, they were recorded at Rs 3,03,526 crores, which is 10% higher than the Pre-GST Regime. The Minister added that as per estimates, the export figure for the current year is likely to be Rs 3,27,700 crores, which will be almost 12% higher than the export figure of Pre-GST regime (2016-17).

Further, it was informed that there has been a significant jump in number of Drug Approvals from 7,857 before GST (01.07.2016 to 30.06.2017) to 10,446 post-GST (01.07.2017 to 30.06.2018).

Elaborating on the reasons for this positive impact post-GST, Shri Mandaviya said that under the ‘One Nation, One Tax’ regime, the removal of complexity of multiple taxes has reduced their cascading effect on the final product. GST is expected to decrease the manufacturing cost in view of merging of different taxes levied earlier and promote ease of doing business. It will create one single market for all stakeholders with equal chance towards development.

Shri Mandaviya informed that due to discontinuation of Central Sales Tax post-GST, it will reduce transaction costs, as inter-state transaction between two dealers will become tax neutral. Now, the pharma companies can consolidate their warehouses at strategic locations, effecting a reduction in cost of distribution. As a result, it will benefit warehouse strategy and improve supply chain efficiency in pharma sector, the Minister explained.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the following:


	""In-principle"" approval for leasing out six airports of AAI viz. Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram and Mangaluru for operation, management and development under Public Private Partnership (PPP) through Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC).
	Constitution of an Empowered Group of Secretaries headed by CEO, NITI Aayog with Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs and Secretary, Department of Expenditure to decide on any issue falling beyond the scope of PPPAC.


Benefits:


	PPP in infrastructure projects brings efficiency in service delivery, expertise, enterprise and professionalism apart from harnessing the needed investments in the public sector.
	The PPP in airport infrastructure projects has brought World class infrastructure at airports, delivery of efficient and timely services to the airport passengers, augmenting revenue stream to the Airports Authority of India without making any investment, etc. of these, for development of Greenfield Airports at Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Presently, the airports being managed under the PPP model include Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Cochin. 
	The PPP airports in India have been ranked among the top 5 in their respective categories by the Airports Council International (ACI) in terms of Airport Service Quality (ASQ). 
	While these PPP experiments have helped create world class airports, it has also helped AAI in enhancing its revenues and focusing on developing airports and Air Navigation infrastructure in the rest of the country.


Background:

The increase in domestic and international air travel in India combined with congestion at most airports, and the strong traffic growth at the 5 airports which were privatized over a decade ago has attracted the attention of several international operators and investors. The airport sector is the top contender among infrastructure sectors in terms of international interest. International operators and investors prefer brownfield airport expansion opportunities with having more than 3-4 million passenger capacity. The airport sector may provide an immediate opportunity to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) by adoption of a PPP approach.

Therefore, it has been decided to lease out six airports viz. Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guwahati, Thiruvanthapuram and Mangaluru of AAI in the first phase for development, operation and management under PPP. This is expected to enhance the revenue to AAI and increased economic development in these areas in terms of job creation and related infrastructure. .

He further said that India is sensitive to the issues and challenges of Artisanal & Small-Scale Mining (ASM) and acknowledged the contribution made by the KP members, observers and agencies for the upliftment of ASMs. India, during its Chairmanship will continue with the tradition and aim to support the ASMs with capacity building, technical assistance and education on valuation, differentiation between natural and lab grown diamonds, importance of legal and formal mining practices.

Mr. Regis Immongault in talks with Suresh Prabhu

 

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Gabon, Mr. Regis Immongault, called on Union Minister for Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, in New Delhi today. Commerce Minister while welcoming the Foreign Minister of Gabon said that India attaches lot of importance to its relations with Gabon and it will give all assistance to Gabon in order to fulfil the objective of Gabon to become an emerging economy by 2025. 

 

Suresh Prabhu further said that it is possible for the two countries to work together in sectors like logistics, infrastructure, energy, water, agriculture, services and tourism. Suresh Prabhu informed the Foreign Minister of Gabon that bilateral trade between India and Gabon is currently valued at USD 440.47 million and is yet to realize its full potential. Both sides will have to work together to improve bilateral trade in the coming years. 

 

At present Indian companies are already operating in wood, plywood, mining and fisheries sectors. The Gabonese Foreign Minister said that Gabon is looking for stronger involvement of BRICS countries in the development of different sectors in Gabon.

 

Gabon has shown interest in entering into a Bilateral Investment Treaty with India. India has also urged Gabon to avail the offer of Lines of Credit (LoC) for developmental projects. As a member of the International Solar Alliance, Gabon is also eligible to avail LoC for solar projects.

 

India also suggested that Gabon may give a complete list of minerals for Indian industries to consider investing in for mining projects.

 

Gabon has the 6th largest reserves of Manganese in the world. It is one of the four countries in the world with high grade reserves along with South Africa, Australia and Brazil. It is the 4th largest producer, globally, of manganese ore with 11 % share in global production after South Africa (26%), China (17%) and Australia (15%). With large reserves yet to exploited, the Gabonese side is keen to develop this sector. Manganese Ore India Ltd (MOIL) team visited Gabon in July 2018 to explore possibilities of joint collaboration with Gabonese mining companies.

 

Gabon is also making efforts to attract investment from India in construction of railway lines in key mining clusters in Gabon. A feasibility study was conducted by RITES for one of the proposed lines. Both India and Gabon have agreed to send business delegations to look at opportunities for trade and investments.

The Baba Kalyani headed committee presenting SEZ policy report to Commerce Minister

 

The Baba Kalyani led committee constituted by the Ministry of Commerce& Industry to study the existing SEZ policy of India submitted its report to the Union Minister for Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, in New Delhi today.

The objectives of the committee were to evaluate the SEZ policy and make it WTO compatible, suggest measures for maximizing utilisation of vacant land in SEZs, suggest changes in the SEZ policy based on international experience and merge the SEZ policy with other Government schemes like coastal economic zones, Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor, national industrial manufacturing zones and food and textiles parks. 

While submitting the report to the Commerce Minister, Baba Kalyani, Chairman, Bharat Forge Ltd., said that if India is going to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025 then the current environment of manufacturing competitiveness and services has to undergo a basic paradigm shift. The success seen by services sector like IT and ITES has to be promoted in other services sector like health care, financial services, legal, repair and design services. 

The Government of India has set a target of creating 100 million jobs and achieving 25% of GDP from the manufacturing sector by 2022, as part of its flagship ‘Make in India’ programme. Furthermore, the Government plans to increase manufacturing value to USD 1.2 trillion by 2025. While these are ambitious plans to propel India into a growth trajectory, it requires evaluation of existing policy frameworks to catalyse manufacturing sector growth. At the same time, policy needs to be compiled with the relevant WTO regulations.

In his interaction with the committee Suresh Prabhu said that the suggestions of the committee are very constructive and the Commerce Ministry will immediately begin formal consultations with the Finance Ministry and other Ministries so that implementation of the committee’s recommendations may be done without any delay.

Suresh Prabhu delivering keynote address on strategic alliance for WTO and trade remedies

 

            The Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, said that India will work along with other member countries to reform the World Trade Organization (WTO) to ensure that it remains an engine for global trade. Speaking at a conference on Strategic Alliance for WTO and Trade Remedies in New Delhi today, he said that the multilateral trading system is under stress and number of fresh trade restrictive measures have surged which will affect global trade and economic growth.

 


	Suresh Prabhu said that without WTO, trade, economy will not expand as it is the only organization dealing with global rules of trade between nations. The WTO acts as an essential pillar of global trade governance providing the framework of rules and practices that underpin some 98% of global trade today and is expected to provide rule based system as well as stability and predictability in world trade. 


            Suresh Prabhu informed that India is not for or against any country but desire to make WTO a forward looking organization, which is able to support a better global trade order.He said that during the last few months he has discussed substantive issues with over 100 Ministers of Trade and Commerce of various countries to evolve new reform agenda for WTO which will be acceptable to most the countries.

Suresh Prabhureleasing the report on Industrial Park Rating System

            The Union Minister for Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, released the report prepared by the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce & Industry, on Industrial Park Rating System. Speaking on this occasion, Commerce Minister said that manufacturing has emerged as one of the high growth sectors in India and it has moved 23 places up in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business (EODB-2019) and achieved rank 77 out of 190 countries. In order to ensure that India moves into the top 50 countries in Ease of Doing Business the Ministry has undertaken this exercise in studying infrastructure across states and in 3354 industrial clusters in order to assess quality of infrastructure in industrial parks.

            Suresh Prabhu stated that this will be a useful tool for policy makers and investors at the click of a button. 3000 parks are on the database and the industrial parks have been rated on 4 points: internal infrastructure, external infrastructure, business services and facilities and environment, safety management.

            To optimise resource utilisation and enhance the efficiency of the manufacturing sector, DIPP launched the Industrial Information System (IIS), a GIS-enabled database of industrial areas and clusters across the country in May 2017. The portal serves as a one-stop solution to the free and easy accessibility of all industrial information including availability of raw material – agriculture, horticulture, minerals, natural resources, distance from key logistic nodes, layers of terrain and urban infrastructure. 

            Over the last one year, State Governments and Industrial Development Corporations have actively used the portal and nominated over 200 parks for their assessment along the above parameters. 

            IPRS is proposed to be translated into an annual exercise covering all the parks across India. Coverage would be widened and updated to bring in deeper qualitative assessment feedback, bring in technological intervention and develop it as a tool that helps effectively for demand driven and need based interventions both by policy makers and investors.  

            On this occasion Secretary DIPP, Ramesh Abhishek, Country Director of Asian Development Bank, Kenichi Yokoyama and other senior officials were present.

Suresh Prabhu giving away innovation awards to agri startups in New Delhi

 

Countries across the world are facing threat of climate change and there is an urgent need for innovation in agriculture, said Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu. He was speaking at an international conference and awards function for innovations by agri startups in New Delhi today.

The Minister said that in the next few years there will be more demand for food as the world population is growing and therefore there is a need for agri startups to produce more food crops in limited fertile soil and use less water.  Suresh Prabhu also called for innovations to minimise wastage of food grains, fruits and vegetables. 

The Commerce Minister said that the agricultural sector will have immense possibilities for startups, which are now confined mainly to think tanks and manufacturing. He said that high yielding and disease resistant crop varieties, soil nutrient maps, improved design of dairy, poultry and fisheries technologies should be developed with new innovations.    

Urging the agri startups to become more innovative Suresh Prabhu said that the Government is working on a comprehensive strategy for facilitating growth of start-ups. He said that the Ministry is actively engaged with the startup community.

The Minister gave away innovation awards to agri startups in different categories and also released the PWC Knowledge report of FICCI.

                The Union Minister for Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, led the Indian delegation to the 7th RCEP Inter-Sessional Ministerial Meeting in Singapore on 12-13 November, 2018. The Minister for Trade and Industry of Singapore Mr. Chan Chun Sing was the Chair of the meeting as Singapore is currently the Chair of ASEAN this year. The Ministerial Meeting was held in preparation for the 2nd RCEP Leaders Summit to be held on 14th November 2018 in Singapore in which Prime Minister of India will be participating. 

 

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a mega regional free trade agreement being negotiated amongst 16 countries, comprising 10 ASEAN countries (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) plus six ASEAN FTA partners, namely Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea and New Zealand. So far 6 Ministerial Meetings, 7 Inter-Sessional Ministerial Meetings and 24 rounds of the Trade Negotiating Committee at the technical level have been held.

 

The Ministers took stock of the state of negotiations across the various chapters. The Chair of the Trade Negotiating Committee, Mr. Pak Iman Pambagyo, made a detailed presentation on the state of play of RCEP negotiations and sought ministerial guidance and direction on pending issues. The Ministers acknowledged the good progress made in the negotiations so far with successful conclusion of 5 chapters this year alone, taking the total to 7 chapters, namely (i) Economic and Technical Cooperation (ii) Small and Medium Enterprises (iii) Customs Procedures and Trade Facilitation (iv) Government Procurement (v) Institutional Provisions (vi) Standards, Technical Regulations and Conformity Assessment Procedures (STRACAP); and (vii) Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS).   

 

The Ministers made an assessment of the progress on ‘The Package of Year End Deliverables’. Suresh Prabhu underlined that ‘substantial progress’ has been achieved in the negotiations which should be reported to the Leaders. He impressed upon all the trade ministers to lend political support to fast track the negotiations.

 

Commerce Minister defended India’s interests effectively and secured maximum flexibilities. Both in STRACAP and SPS negotiations, India managed to obtain balanced outcomes in the application of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism. India showed flexibility on the principle of ‘consensus’ in the Institutional Provisions Chapter which helped in its successful conclusion during the meeting.  

 

Ministers guided the negotiators to deliberate further on E-Commerce, Competition and Investment chapters where consensus could not be reached during this meeting. Ministers urged the negotiators to intensify their work with a view of narrowing gaps and finding balanced outcomes in the negotiations with the aim of concluding negotiations by 2019.

 

On the side lines of the RCEP, Commerce Minister held bilateral meetings with his counterparts from Singapore, China, Japan and New Zealand. He discussed bilateral issues and progress in RCEP negotiations. He also had pull-aside meetings with Trade Ministers of South Korea, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Australia and Philippines to discuss matters of mutual interest.

DG, WIPO addressing Press Conference in New Delhi

 The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, is hosting a conference on Global Digital Content Market (GDCM)2018, on14th- 15thNovember 2018, in New Delhi.The conference will feature sessions on music, film, broadcasting and publishing, as well as collective management, emerging models and the implications for the market and policy makers. 

 India has been chosen as a host nation for the conference byWorld Intellectual Property Organization(WIPO) due to the strong creative industry in the country in films, music and media. The focus for this year’s conference is the Asia Pacific region. The GDCM 2018 will see participation of professionals from various creative fields, the digital industry around the world and delegates of the diplomatic community from Missions to the United Nations.

The aim of GDCM 2018 is to give industry stakeholders a platform to come together and discuss new avenues in the films, music, gaming and creative industry along with points of challenge that is presented due to thechanging creative landscape because of the disruption brought about by digital technologies.It is hoped that through the GDCM 2018 an exchange of knowledge, culture and good practices amongst the nations of the Asia Pacific region will take place.GDCM is a platform to discuss vital issues and enhance development of the digital and IP generating industries such as publishing, films, music, and gaming all of which are major contributors to the Indian GDP. The presence of key stakeholders from India in GDCM will place it on the global digital stage. 

GDCM 2018 is the second edition of the conference.The first conference was held in Geneva 2016. Speaking at a press conference today in New Delhi, Mr. Francis Gurry, the Director General of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Geneva, said that the aim of WIPO is to ensure that a creative artist continues to be protected and receives better remuneration on the digital platform. He appreciated India’s efforts of integration with international systems through the National IPR policy 2016 under which the Government of India has taken efforts for creating an environment in the country that is conducive for the generation of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) by increasingawareness among the citizens on the subject and strengthening IPR enforcementmechanisms. 

Secretary DIPP, Ramesh Abhishek, informed in the press conference that India’s rank in the Global Innovation Index 2018 has improved by 24 places from that of 2015 and now ranks 57th. India is the top-ranked economy in Central and Southern Asia and has now outperformed on innovation relative to its GDP per capita for seven years in a row.

Secretary DIPP further stated that to better equip the enforcement agencies to deal with IP related crimes 33 enforcement training programmes have already been conducted in 9 states in order to train police, customs and the judiciary for tackling cases on IP. Government has also pulled down 80 rogue websites to combat online piracy. India has recently approvedaccession to the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) that has increased the coverage of protection of copyrights in the international IP regime as it is extended to even the internet and digital environment. This will bring the Indian creative industry under and international copyright system, secure distribution of their work and provide them with a level playing field.

Secretary DIPP also informed that large scale augmentation of man power of Indian IP offices has been done which has brought down pendency of IP applications. Trademark registration has increased by leaps and bounds and patent applications have quadrupled in 2017-18 as compared to 2015-16. These efforts are being made to ensure that the country moves towards realizing the goals of Creative India; Innovative India.

                The Union Minister for Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, is leading the delegation for the meeting for trade Ministers of RCEP member countries which is taking place in Singapore on November 12-13, 2018.

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a pact that aims to cover goods, services, investments, economic and technical cooperation, competition and intellectual property rights. Trade Ministers of the 16 member RCEP are meeting in Singapore to continue to exert all efforts towards meeting the targets set. The chief negotiators had recently concluded the 24th round of meeting in Auckland, New Zealand, last month.  

India already has a free trade agreement with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan and South Korea and it is negotiating similar pacts with Australia and New Zealand. 

India is pushing for liberalizing norms to promote services trade as the sector accounts for about 55 % of India’s GDP. India is looking for a balance trade agreement as it would cover 40% of the global GDP and over 42% of world’s population. 

The RCEP members include 10 ASEAN members – Brunei Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos and Vietnam and their 6 free trade agreement partners – India, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. 

The ministerial meeting will be followed by the 2nd RCEP Leaders Summit on 14th November, 2018, in Singapore.

                Indian exporters of four key commodities of rice, tea, spices and dry fruits will be meeting the major importers in Saudi Arabia during a Food and Agro Buyer-Seller Meet (BSM) organised by Consulate General of India in Jeddah in association with Jeddah Chamber and Trade Promotion Council of India (TPCI). Twenty-five Indian companies from food and agricultural products sector, exporting rice, tea, spices and dry fruits, will be meeting the Saudi importers at the BSM which will be inaugurated by Md. Noor Rahman Sheikh, Consul General of India in Jeddah and Hassan IbraheemDahlan, Secretary General of Jeddah Chamber on November 11, 2018. 

The four commodities being focused on have great prospects for furthering Indian exports to Saudi Arabia.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been a major food and beverages (F&B) market for India. The BSMwill be an ideal platform for Indian participants to explore the business opportunities for trade, acquaint with new consumer trends and initiate marketing tie-ups and joint ventures.

Basmati rice export continuously dominates India’s rice export basket. India accounts for around 72% of the total Basmati rice produced and it offers India not just the leading producer tag but also very high product visibility in the world market.

 Indian tea, is among the finest in the world owing to strong geographical indicators, heavy investments in tea processing units, continuous innovation, augmented product mix and strategic market expansion. India is the 2nd largest producer and 4th largest exporter of tea in the world with a 23% share in global production and a 7.5% share in world tea exports. India exports tea to more than 60 countries globally with Iran, Russia, UK, USA and the Gulf countries being major markets.

 Indian spices too are much in demand in the GCC countries, given their exquisite aroma, texture and taste. Saudi Arabia primarily imports pepper, chilli, turmeric, ginger and cardamom from India. 

Saudi Arabia is India’s one of the most important trade partnersand is a major FDI partner of India after the UAE in Gulf region. India’s export to Saudi Arabia was worth USD 5 billion in 2017. The major products exported by India to Saudi Arabia were rice, chemicals, refined petroleum oil and motor vehicles and its parts. India’s import from Saudi Arabia was worth USD 21 billion in 2017, amounting to a huge trade deficit of USD16 billion. The major products imported by India from Saudi Arabia were petroleum products.

 India is seeking to reduce the trade deficit by enhancing exports in areas where Saudi Arabia is importing from the world. India exported F&B products worth USD 4.6 billion in 2017. During 2017, India’s total exports in F&B products stood at USD 33 billion while the exports to Saudi Arabia in this sector during the same period stood at only USD 1.43 billion.

                Export of raw sugar from India to China willbegin early next year. A contract for exporting 50,000 tonnes of raw sugar has been entered to by the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) and COFCO, a Government of China run public sector company. 

This is due to the initiative taken by the Ministry of Commerce and several rounds of meetings held by officials of both countries the import of raw sugar has materialized now.

India plans to export 2 MT of raw sugar to China beginning from next year. Raw sugar is the second product after non-basmati rice that China will import from India. It is a move to reduce the USD 60 billion trade deficit that China has with India. India’s export to China in 2017-18 amounted to USD 33 billion while imports from China stood at USD 76.2 billion.

India is the largest producer of sugar in the world with 32 MMT production in 2018. India produces sugar of all three grades- raw, refined and white. Indian sugar is also of a high quality and is Dextran free because of the minimum time taken from cut to crush. India is in a position to become a regular and dependable exporter of high quality sugar in significant volumes to China.

                Commerce Secretary,Dr. Anup Wadhawan, had a bilateral meeting with Mr. Wang Shouwen, Vice Minister of China’s Commerce Minister, today in Shanghai. The Commerce Secretary was accompanied by senior officials from Department of Commerce, Department of Food and Public Distributionand officials from Embassy of India in Beijing and Consulate in Shanghai. The Indian delegation on this visit included Chairman APEDA, MD NAFED, DG FIEO, DG Pharmexcil. 

The Commerce Secretary while expressing concern regarding the large trade deficit, acknowledged Chinese Government’s efforts in clearing some of the market access issues such as for rice and rapeseed meal during the past few months and expressed satisfaction over progress on soya bean meal and pomegranate and related issues. He also informed Mr. Wang about the encouraging response to the business promotion events organized by the Indian Embassy and Consulates covering products like sugar, rice, tea and oil meals.Dr. Wadhawan requested Mr. Wang to provide MOFCOM’s guidance to its importers to source these products from India. 

The Commerce Secretaryinformed that areas like agriculture products, pharmaceuticals, information technology services and tourism in which India has proven strengths and significant global presence but minuscule presence in China, need to be encouraged in bilateral trade. Dr. Wadhawan asked for guidance, facilitation, support and assistance to the relevant stakeholders for creating a suitable environment for India’s exports in these sectors to China. 

MOFCOM thanked India for accepting its invitation to participate in the 1st CIIE and assured all support for increasing India’s exports to China.

 During this visit, the Commerce Secretary also had a detailed discussion with important sugar importers of China including China Sugar Association and briefed them about India’s sugar sector and its proven available capacity in terms of both, quality as well as quantity, to meet the Chinese requirements on a sustained long term basis.Important players from Indian sugar industry including MD, NFCSF also attended related meetings during the visit. These meetings would be helpful in tapping this major import market for Indian sugar.

                On the invitation of China’s Ministry of Commerce, India has set up a Country Pavilion in the 1st China International Import Expo (CIIE) which was inaugurated today at the National Exhibition & Convention Centre, Shanghai, China. During the Joint Economic Group Meeting held in Delhi in March 2018, China’s Commerce Minister Mr Zhong Shan had extended an invitation to participate in this event. 

The Ministry of Commerce, in consultation with the Embassy of India in Beijing decided to showcase areas where India has proven strength with significant global presence, and there are good prospects for further more market access in China. In this background, India’s country pavilion has focussed on key sectors such as food and agro products, pharmaceuticals, IT & ITES, tourism and services sector. These four areas represent very minuscule Indian presence in China contrary to India’s strength and overall global presence. Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) is the lead agency for the India Country Pavilion in CIIE, Shanghai along with other stakeholders like Ministry of Tourism, APEDA, NAFED, MPEDA, Pharmexcil, Electronics and Software Export Promotion Council to showcase India’s strength in these diverse areas. The Consulate General of India in Shanghai has extended all local support. 

China is India's largest trading partner with a total trade expecting to reach $ 100 billion mark in near future. Both countries have expressed a resolve to address India’s concern regarding large trade deficit with China. 

Government of India is consistently making sincere efforts to promote its exports to China. This has been achieved through various bilateral meetings at the government level and continuous engagement of Indian businessmen with China. Recently the Embassy of India in Beijing and Consulates in Shanghai and Guangzhou had organised a series of business promotion and buyer seller meets covering products like sugar, tea, rice, oil meals and pharmaceuticals which received encouraging participation from Chinese importers.

Commerce Secretary,Dr.AnupWadhawan visited and inaugurated India pavilion today. He will hold a bilateral meeting with China’s Vice Minister for Commerceon 6th November. Dr.Wadhawan will also hold meetings with major sugar importers.

                            The recommendation of the Union Cabinet for promulgation of the Companies Amendment (Ordinance), 2018 has been assented to  by the President of India.  The Ordinance, which has been promulgated today is based on the recommendations of the Committee appointed by the Government to review  offences under the Companies Act, 2013.

The twin objectives of the Ordinance are promotion of Ease of Doing Business along with better corporate compliance.  The main amendments are as under;


	Shifting of jurisdiction of 16 types of corporate offences from the special courts to in-house adjudication, which is expected to reduce the case load of Special Courts by over 60%,thereby  enabling them to concentrate on serious corporate offences.  With this amendment the scope of in-house adjudication has gone up from 18 Sections at present to 34 Sections of the Act. 
	The penalty for small companies and one person companies has been reduced to half of that applicable to normal companies. 
	Instituting a transparent and technology driven in-house adjudication mechanism on an online platform and publication of the orders on the website.
	Strengthening in-house adjudication mechanism by necessitating a concomitant order for making good the default at the time of levying penalty, to achieve the ultimate aim of achieving better compliance.
	Declogging the NCLT by:


 


	
	
		enlarging the pecuniary jurisdiction of Regional Director  by enhancing the  limit up to Rs. 25 Lakh as against earlier limit of Rs. 5Lakhunder Section 441 of the Act;
		vesting in the Central Government the power to approve the alteration in the financial year of a company under section 2(41); and
		vesting the Central Government the power to approve cases of conversion of public companies into private companies.
	
	


 


	Recommendations related to corporate compliance and corporate governance include re-introduction of declaration of commencement of business provision to better tackle the menace of ‘shell companies’; greater disclosures with respect to public deposits; greater accountability with respect to filing documents related to creation, modification and satisfaction of charges; non-maintenance of registered office to trigger de-registration process; and holding of directorships beyond permissible limits to trigger disqualification of such directors.

The 26th meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) was held during November 13-16 2018 at Palais des Congrés, Versailles, France. CGPM is the highest international body of the world for accurate and precise measurements. The 26th CGPM meeting was very special and historic as the members have voted for the redefinition of 130 years old “Le grand K – the SI unit of kg” in terms of the fundamental Planck’s constant(h). The new definitions will come into force on 20 May 2019.

The CGPM comprises 60 countries including India and 42 Associate Members. In this meeting India was represented by Shri Avinash K. Srivastava, Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India, Dr. D.K. Aswal, Director, National Physical Laboratory(NPL), New Delhi and Dr. T.D. Senguttuvan, Head Planning, Monitoring & Evaluation, NPL. 

The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), the main executive body of CGPM has the responsibility of defining the International System of Units (SI). This revision of the SI is the culmination of many years of intensive scientific cooperation between the National Metrology Institutes (The national Physical Laboratory for India) and the BIPM. The dissemination of SI units for the welfare of society and industries in the country is the responsibility of Legal Metrology, Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India.

Out of five draft resolutions the revision of the International System of Units and the definition of timescales are the important. The most important is the resolution on the revision of International System of Units. The definition of the seven base units namely, second, metre, kilogram, ampere, Kelvin, mole and candela has been changed from being linked to artefacts to being based on the fundamental constants on nature. Notably the definition of kilogram has been changed from being the mass of prototype sanctioned by the 1st CGPM held in Paris in 1889 and deposited at the BIPM to the Planck constant which is a physical constant. Likewise, the definition of metre has been changed to link it to the speed of light. There is a change in definition of time also. The change in the definition will result in uniform and worldwide accessible SI system for international trade, high- technology manufacturing, human health and safety, protection of environment, global climate studies and the basic science under-pinning these. The units are expected to be stable in the long term, internally self-consistent and practically realisable being based on the present theoretical description of nature at the highest level.

The International prototype of kilogram (IPK) is kept at the BIPM, Paris and serves as the international standard of kilogram. It is made of 90% platinum and 10% iridium and is a cylinder of 39 mm diameter and 39 mm height. Replicas of the IPK are made of the same material and used at BIPM as reference or working standards and national prototype of kilogram (NPK), kept at different National Metrology Institutes (NMIs). NPK-57, kept at CSIR- National Physical Laboratory, is sent periodically to BIPM for calibration. NPK further is being utilised through transfer standards of mass to provide unbroken chain of traceability for dissemination of mass through Legal Metrology to the user industries, calibration laboratories etc. The precise and accurate measurements help country in the production of international quality products and help commerce through elimination of the technical barrier to trade.

Kibble balance is a self-calibrating electromechanical balance and provides the measurements of mass, traceable in terms of electrical parameters and provides linkage of macroscopic mass to the Planck constant(h). NPL-UK, NIST-USA,NRC- Canada, PTB-Germany etc. Have successfully developed Kibble balance for 1 kg with an uncertainty of measurement in order of 10-8. NPL-India, in association with Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India is looking forward for the development of 1 kg Kibble balance.

The advantages of Kibble balance would be that the NPK need not to be sent to BIPM for calibrations and the accuracy and stability of Kibble balance is very high which is very important where low weights with high accuracies are essential, for example in pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies.

After the kilogram’s definition is changed officially- on 20th May, 2019, also known as World Metrology Day- most people will never notice the difference. It would not change baking ingredients on a kitchen scale, or even have an effect on the tons of goods shipped globally every day.

For astronomers calculating the movements of stars and galaxies or for pharmacologists trying to define doses of medications sown to the molecule, the new standard of measurement could change the way they work.But for many metrologists, thatday to day work is not necessarily what inspired this change. The metric system was intended to be rational, universal set of units “for all people, for all time”.The SI unit will finally be truly universal system, free of any human artefacts.

Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) organised a seminar on “International Standards and the Fourth Industrial Revolution” in New Delhi to celebrate the World Standards Day 2018. The event was inaugurated by Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan in the presence of the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Shri C.R. Chaudhary. Today’s event was the culmination of the four curtain raisers which dovetails the four regional events into a finale event with presentations by the experts followed by panel discussion on “India’s way forward for Industrial Revolution 4.0”. Marking the event, Union Minister Shri Ram Vilas Paswan also released Pre Standardisation Study Report on Smart Manufacturing and launched the revamped website of BIS.

Union Minister Shri Ram Vilas Paswan in his address highlighted the relevance of the theme to India’s aspirations to be among the top in the emerging fields of manufacturing. Shri Paswan also appreciated the efforts of BIS in the direction of developing Standards to support the same and said that the release of ‘Pre Standardisation Study Report on Smart Manufacturing’ is a right step in this direction.

 

In his special address, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Shri C. R. Chaudhary said that the technical force of the country needs to make the ambition of the Hon’ble Prime Minister a reality through the Industrial Revolution 4.0. He asserted that the report being released is a right step in this direction. 

Director General, BIS, Smt. Surina Rajan in her address emphasised on the need for Standardization to enable growth in all facets of the economy. On the release of the revamped website of BIS she said that the new interface will enable easy access to all stakeholders and will give user a rich experience.

The technical sessions and panel discussions were enriching for the audiences as eminent speakers like Sh. Venkat Sarma, Head Delivery IoT & MES Practice L&T Infotech, Prof. Asim Tewari, Head, NCAIR, IIT Bombay, Sh. Vidyabhushana Hande, Head, Simulation Solutions, SIEMENS and Dr. Allabaksh Naikodi, Head, R&D Mahindra Electric not only shared their valuable thoughts during the sessions but also answered queries.

Each year, ISO decides a theme of the World Standards Day based on a current aspects of standardization.  The theme of this year “International Standards and Industrial Revolution 4.0” is very relevant as the industry is embracing new technologies for automation along with artificial intelligence making use of advanced communication modes. The theme has far reaching impact on a vibrant nation like India with its large industrial base and is the need of the hour with India taking up the ambitious Make in India program. To enable an impactful outreach with the future generation, four curtain raiser seminars were held in premier educational institutions on the various facets of Industrial Revolution 4.0. The seminars were held at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, IIT – Bombay, IIT- Guwahati and IIT- Kanpur. The topic of seminars were around Smart Energy Storage, Smart Manufacturing and Block-chain, Green technology and Sustainability and 5G. 

World Standards Day, is an international day of observance recognized world over since 1970.  This annual event is celebrated across the globe jointly with the International Electro-technical (IEC), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). This occasion provides a perfect opportunity to reflect how Standards work in the real world, and the benefits they bring to business, society and the environment.

                The three- day ‘South Asia Regional Youth Peace Conference’ was inaugurated by Mr ShriKrishna G Kulkarni, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi at Gandhi Darshan, New Delhi, yesterday, the 28th November, 2018. The Conference is being organised by Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti, UNESCO MGIEP and STEP (Standing Together to Enable Peace). About 100 youth leaders from South Asian countries and different parts of India have come together to discuss different dimensions of ‘peace’.

 Speaking at the event ShriKrishna G Kulkarni underscored on how the Mahatma was a man of action. He called upon the youth leaders to take to nonviolent action to promote peace and sustainable development in South Asia. Shri Krishna Kulkarni during the interaction said that ‘Indians are seekers and not just believers and that’s our source of plurality and that secularity is in our DNA’. Speaking of fearlessness, kindness and compassion, Mr Kulkarni talked about the vision and philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi and hoped that the South Asia Youth Pacific Conference will be able to mobilise youth across the region.

Mr. Abel Caine, representative UNESCO MGIEP talked about UNESCO’s ‘International Youth Campaign on Kindness for Sustainable Development Goals’ to mobilise the world youth to achieve 17 SDG through acts of kindness. He stressed on youth participation for mobilisation of stories of kindness.

The Director of Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti, Mr Dipanker Shri Gyan talked about the interventions of the Samiti for peace and nonviolence in different sections of the society. He said the life and message of the Mahatma offers insightful education for peace, nonviolence and a path for living an ethical life.

Ms Shreya Jani, Managing Trustee of Standing Together to Enable Peace Trust said, “As peace builders, we must listen to the stories and wisdom of our elders carefully, of visionary like Ba-Bapu, Mandela, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and many more who have taught us that we are all interconnected in a web of relationships one that includes our enemies.”

The countries represented include: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. As part of the ongoing celebrations of the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation, the young people have come together to create an action plan to power the Sustainable Development Goals through the lens of love and kindness. 

The objective of the conference is to eliminate stereotypes, prejudices across all borders, to understand micro-macro aspect of the issues, identify common challenges and develop plan of action, to build a network of youth leaders. The conference will have conversations on Gender, Food Security, Interfaith Harmony, Digital media, Art Democracy and other Dialogues. Amongst the objectives include the aim to equip young leaders with skills and knowledge based on peace education, critical enquiry and socio-emotional learning as a tool to engage with their peers. The aim is also to build a network of youth leaders and change-makers across South Asia who will join hands to address common challenging issues together.

The 150th birth anniversary celebrations offer the right climate for young people of South Asia to further the peace agenda in the region.

                The Annual Chief Engineers Conference of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) was heldhere from November 28-30, 2018. Raksha  Rajya Mantri Dr Subhash Bhamre addressed the conference today. Speaking on the occasion, Dr Bhamre said, “Security needs of the country demand faster construction of these roads.  I am aware that BRO has certain challenges due to terrain and climate and other factors, but I am sure that BRO shall overcome all challenges and enhance the pace of construction as well as adopt newer technologies and procedures.”

He mentioned that the Ministry has delegated enhanced financial and administrative powers to BRO, going upto Task Force Commander level. This would have made a positive impact on the pace of progress and would have gone a long way in improving the efficiency of the Organisation.  He also informed that two jobs for construction of Sela Tunnel and part of Balipara-Charduar-Tawang road in Arunachal Pradesh have been sanctioned in Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) mode. This brings greater responsibility on BRO to complete the work with quality in assigned time frame.

Dr Bhamreurged all stakeholders to put in their best for achieving the goals set for the Organization, which ultimately shall facilitate good network of roads in border areas to fulfil the strategic needs of the country as well as to meet the requirements for socio economic development of the region as a whole.He appreciated the efforts being made by BRO for completion of pending Indo China Border Roads and the Rohtang tunnel project in the time frame committed by the Organization.  No slippages will be permitted in these critical timelines.

 The event commenced with a synergy conference with Controller General Defence Accounts (CGDA). The conference provided an excellent forum for discussion on critical issues including an assessment of current performance for chalking out the future course of action. 

 Some important achievements of the organisation during the year: construction of highest motorable road between Chisumle-Demchok in Ladakh region on Umling La Top (19,300 feet above MSL), construction of 578 metre Theng Tunnel on Gangtok – Chungthang road in Sikkim, connectivity of Damchu-Chukha road in Bhutan, connectivity of TCC-Taksing in Arunachal, connectivity of Manali – Padam axis and construction of strategically important 290 feet long bridge at Hussainiwala. Work on the Rohtang Tunnel is proceeding at a fast pace. During the early snowfall in Manali BRO had rescued many stranded tourists and locals.  Another big achievement is the apparent commencing of the work on the Sela Tunnel.

Dr Bhamre also released BRO Technical Magazine “OonchiSadakein”. The conference also witnessed the presentation of Best Task Force and Best Road Trophy by the Minister.The Director General, Addl Dir Gens, Senior officials of Defence Accounts Services and Chief Engineers of all Projects attended the three-day long conference.

                The ninth edition of the Admiral’s Cup Regatta, the prestigious international military sailing event hosted annually by Indian Naval Academy (INA), Ezhimala will be conducted at Ettikulum Bay from 02 December to 06 December 2018. The Regatta will witness participation by teams from 31 foreign Naval Academies competing in the Laser (Radial) class of sail boats.

The Indian Navy instituted the ‘Admiral’s Cup Regatta’ as a ‘Fleet Race’ in a single crew Olympic class ‘Laser Radial’ sail boat in 2010 with eight foreign Naval Academies participating that year.

This year’s participants are from 31 foreign countries viz., Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, France, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Oman, Poland, Sri Lanka, UK, USA, Saudi Arabia, Maldives, Qatar, Germany, Italy, UAE, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Portugal, South Africa, Singapore, Bahrain, Iran and China in addition to two teams from India (INA and NDA). This year’s Admirals Cup Regatta will see the highest number of participants in the cup series. The closest other military event was the 2011 Military World Games held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with 26 countries participating in that event. The participating teams will be competing in 16 races spread over four days with each country fielding by two boats. The coveted ‘Admiral’s Cup’ would be awarded to the team winning the championship on the basis of their combined performance. In addition, individual medals will also be awarded.

The teams are scheduled to arrive INA on Saturday, 01 December 2018. Registration of team members, practice racing and opening ceremony are scheduled on Sunday, 02 December 2018. The competitive races are scheduled from 03 December – 06 December 2018. Admiral’s Cup Regatta 2018 is expected to be much more exciting and challenging given the highest ever number of countries participating in the event and first time participation of teams from Bulgaria. It will thus be a tough challenge for the winners of 2017 (Team USA) to hold on to their title, with the competition hotting up!.

                Naval cooperation between India and the United Kingdom is based on the long term strategic relationship between both countries. Both Navies have, over the years, undertaken bilateral activities such as training exchanges and technical cooperation. The Bilateral KONKAN exercise provides a platform for the two Navies to periodically exercise at sea and in harbour, so as to build interoperability and share best practices.

 

The KONKAN series of exercises commenced in 2004, and since then has grown in scale. KONKAN-2018 will be conducted from 28 Nov to 06 Dec 18 off Goa with units participating from both navies. The harbour phase is scheduled from 28 Nov to 30 Nov 18, followed by the sea phase from 02 to 06 Dec 18. The Royal Navy will be represented by HMS Dragon, a Type 45 Class Destroyer equipped with an integral Wildcat helicopter. The Indian Navy will field INS Kolkata, the first ship of latest Kolkata class destroyers, equipped with integral Seaking and an IN submarine. In addition, IN maritime patrol aircraft, Dornier will also participate in the exercise.

 

The regular IN-RN interaction over the years has resulted in an increase in the professional content of the bilateral exercise. The thrust of the exercise this year would be on Anti-Air warfare, Anti-Surface Warfare, Anti-Submarine Warfare, Visit Board Search and Seizure (VBSS) and Seamanship Evolutions. Besides exercises at sea, KONKAN-2018 also encompasses professional interactions and sports fixtures. 

 

The exercise is aimed at deriving mutual benefit from each others’ experiences and is indicative of the continuing cooperation between the two countries. The inter-operability achieved over the years as a result of such exercises has proved to be operationally beneficial to both navies. The naval cooperation is a tangible symbol of the commitment of both nations in ensuring a positive climate at sea for enhancing strategic stability and promoting economic prosperity.

The Tenth Edition of Indo-Russian joint military exercise EX INDRA 2018 culminated on 28 November 2018 after a joint tactical exercise and an impressive closing ceremony held at Babina Military Station. The eleven day long joint training that commenced on 18 November 2018 included developing common understanding of transnational terrorism, interoperability and conduct of joint tactical operations controlled by a Joint Command Post working under the aegis of United Nations.

Classes were organised on cordon and search operations, raid on terrorist hideout, intelligence gathering and sharing, perception management, humanitarian laws and hostage rescue. Integrated live firing was carried out apart from specialised joint training which included road opening drills, clearance of built up areas and destruction of a rebel stronghold in an urban terrain setting. The participating contingents also carried out specialised joint training on hostage rescue by slithering from MI-17 helicopters.

Major General PS Minhas, General Officer Commanding, White Tiger Division of Indian Army and Major General Tsekov Oleg Moosovich, Commander Fifth Army of Russian Army along with representatives and military officials of both countries witnessed the validation exercise conducted at Babina Field Firing Ranges. The troops learnt about each other’s organisations and exchanged ideas and best practices being followed in peace enforcement under aegis of the United Nations.

                The Security Restrictions Guidelines enunciated by Ministry of Defence on 31.10.1990, were restrictive in nature towards developmental activities near border areas. In supersession of all previous orders, fresh guidelines were issued on 27.11.2017 on security restrictions of construction activities in Border areas which are also not fully facilitating construction/developmental works of small nature in Border areas.

Keeping in view the requests of State Governments, that construction/developmental works in border areas are getting affected due to provisions listed in the MoD’s existing guidelines, Government of India has decided to allow the developmental works of small nature like construction, repair and maintenance of village ponds, construction and maintenance of Government Buildings like Schools, Hospitals etc by Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and other Central/State Government Statutory bodies for faster development in border areas.

Security considerations for construction activities/other activities in border areas/ other areas issued earlier from time to time by Ministry of Defence shall not be applicable for the above mentioned development works in border areas.

                Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman has formally launched ‘Mission Raksha Gyan Shakti’, here today. The event showcased salient inventions and innovations achieved by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) and Ordnance Factories (OFs) which have resulted in successful filing of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) applications. Smt Sitharaman also felicitated some of the scientists, who invented and innovated useful products for the nation. A panel discussion was held with participation of Chairman and Managing Directors of all DPSUs to formulate a strategy for the future in this regard.            

While addressing the audience,Raksha Mantri lauded the efforts of Department of Defence Production and Directorate General Quality Assurance (DGQA) for focused efforts in spreading awareness about IPR, thus promoting a culture of innovation and creation of Intellectual Property. Smt Sitharaman highlighted that while India has always been a knowledge hub since ancient times, however, due to lack of awareness on modern legal framework for protection of IP rights, our knowledge and creativity have often not been utilised to its full potential. Delivering the keynote address, Secretary Defence Production Dr Ajay Kumar highlighted the need to migrate from the culture of seeking Transfer of Technology (ToT) from foreign sources to generating Intellectual Property in India, to achieve the goal of self-reliance in Defence sector. 

The IPR has emerged as a key ingredient of an ecosystem which stimulates innovation and ingenuity. An IP Facilitation Cell was established in April this year which has worked tirelessly to achieve ambitious targets of training 10,000 personnel of OFB and DPSUs on IPR and to facilitate filing of at least 1,000 new IPR applications. 

As part of the ongoing initiatives to enhance self-reliance in defence, the Department of Defence Production has instituted a new framework titled ‘Mission Raksha GyanShakti’ which aims to provide a boost to the IPR culture in indigenous defence industry. The Directorate General of Quality Assurance (DGQA) has been entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating and implementing the programme. The event brought out that the end objective of ‘Mission Raksha Gyan Shakti’ is to inculcate IP culture in Indian defence manufacturing ecosystem.

The event was attended by Secretary, Department of Defence R&D and Chairman DRDO Dr G Satheesh Reddy, senior officers of the three Services, Chairman Ordnance Factories Board and Managing Directors of all DPSUs, amongst a large number of other dignitaries.

                Director General Border Roads (DGBR) Lt Gen Harpal Singh, reviewed the progress of works of operationally critical roads in the Area of Responsibility of Project Arunank from November 20 to 21, 2018.

The DGBR carried out inspection of Road TCC - Taksing & TCC-Bidak. The General officer was accompanied by CE (P) Arunank Brig RS Rawal during the inspection of sector. While expressing general satisfaction towards the works, the DG stressed that the quality of work should be of highest standard and at the same time PDC should be adhered to at all costs.

The DGBR travelled by road from Taksing to Gelensiniak-Bidak and arrived at Limeking. Enroute the General officer inspected the ongoing road construction and took stock of plan of Bailey Bridges on various Nallahs and rivers for fair weather connectivity to Taksing and Bidak. Lt Gen Harpal Singh was convinced about the difficulty of terrain, unpredictable weather and the constraints of local resources in the region which posed huge challenge to BRO in timely completion of the roads. DG met the BRO personnel and CPLs at various work sites, complimented and exhorted them to keep pushing forward so that connectivity on these roads could be established.

Lt Gen Harpal Singh carried out the inspection of Hapoli- Sarli-Huri Road on 21 November, 2018. DG expressed his satisfaction at the pace of progress and directed that the PDC for connectivity should be met at all costs. He complimented them for their dedication in working in extremely remote area with tough terrain conditions and persistent inclement weather. He exhorted them to continue the good work and ensure timely completion of the task with highest quality.

The General officer called on the Governor and Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh and apprised about the status of road works in the state. The interaction between the BRO officials and Arunachal State dignitaries will surely pave the way for a harmonious and balanced roadwork progress in the State. The visit will go a long way in timely achievement of targets with highest quality by BRO.

                The 3rd Defence Ministers’ Dialogue (DMD) between India and Singapore was successfully concluded today. The DMD commenced after both countries signed the revised Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) in 2015 to further strengthen the long standing defence relationship between the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the Indian Armed Forces. 

Of particular significance during this meeting was the renewal of the Bilateral Agreement for the conduct of Joint Army Training and Exercises in India. This agreement gives out an exhaustive framework for the conduct of joint training as well as exercises for the Singapore Armed Forces in India and will further strengthen the cooperation between the two Armed Forces. 

Earlier in the day, Dr Ng attended the final sea phase of the 25th edition of the Singapore-India Maritime Bilateral Exercise - SIMBEX on board INS Shakti. This multi dimensional exercise witnessed participation of ships, submarines a well as aircraft from both sides and live firings at sea. Both Ministers complimented all personnel participating in the milestone event and for making it a success which is a testament of the long standing ties between the armed forces of the two countries. 

Both Ministers commended the conclusion of the Navy Implementing Arrangement Concerning Mutual Coordination, Logistics and Services Support in June 2018, which together with the Navy Bilateral Agreement concluded in November 2017, have expanded and deepened bilateral naval cooperation. 

Dr Ng expressed appreciation for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Keynote Address at the 2018 Shangri-La Dialogue, wherein PM Modi articulated India’s vision for the Indo-Pacific region. In this regard, Singapore strongly supports India’s deep engagement with ASEAN member states participation in patrols along the Straits of Malacca with Singapore and looks forward to a inaugural conduct of the trilateral maritime exercise with Thailand in the Andaman Sea. 

Smt. Sitharaman affirmed India’s full support and active participation in the regional security architecture of the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM)-Plus and its many initiatives. As an ADMM Plus member, India supports the adoption of the Guidelines for Air Military Encounters. 

As littoral countries astride key Sea Lines of Communication, the Ministers underscored the importance of maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight consistent with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 

Smt Sitharaman reaffirmed India’s belief that disputes should be resolved through peaceful means, and in accordance with the universally recognized principles of international law. Both Ministers agreed on the importance of international cooperation in tackling transnational security threats and in particular measures to collectively tackle the threat of terrorism. 

Both ministers agreed to step up intelligence and information sharing, particularly in the areas of maritime security and counter terrorism and expand collaboration on submarine safety and rescue.   

Ministers also commended the progress in defence technology collaboration under the auspices of the lndia-Singapore Defence Technology Steering Committee and the India-Singapore Defence Industry Working Group. These joint R&D collaborations included areas such as Combat Care and Vehicle Armour. 

The Ministers expressed satisfaction at the deepening defence ties between India and Singapore and reaffirmed their commitment to support further initiatives that would promote stability to the region. It was also agreed to hold the 4th DMD in Singapore next year on mutually convenient dates.

                Silver Jubilee Commemoration Ceremony to mark the 25th edition of SIMBEX, “Singapore-India Maritime Bilateral Exercise” was held onboard INS Sahyadri at Visakhapatnam today, 19 November 18.  The Ceremony was attended by Adm Sunil Lanba, the Chief of Naval Staff and Rear Adm Lew Chuen Hong, Chief of Navy Republic of Singapore, Vice Adm Karambir Singh FOC-in-C ENC, Flag Officers, Commanding Officers and personnel from participating ships.  

Rear Adm Dinesh K Tripathi, Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet welcomed the Guests to the historic occasion to commemorate the 25th edition of the bilateral exercise between the two navies of India and Republic of Singapore.  Speaking on the occasion, Adm Sunil Lanba highlighted that SIMBEX is the longest un-interrupted bilateral maritime exercise that India has had with any navy.  The importance of this achievement was also flagged by the Hon’ble Prime Minister at the Shangri La Dialogue in June this year.  He also reiterated that naval cooperation through SIMBEX underscores the shared commitment of both nations to security, safety and freedom of navigation and overflight in the global commons.   The 25th edition of SIMBEX is the largest in terms of complexity, weapon firings and maritime geography. He concluded by reminding the audience the motto of the Republic of Singapore Navy ‘Beyond Horizon’ while that of the Indian Navy ‘Sam No Varunah’ which translates to ‘May the Ocean Gods be Auspicious Unto Us’.  As the Silver Jubilee of the maritime bilateral exercises progress, he wished SIMBEX to go Beyond Horizons and in the process, let the ocean gods be auspicious unto both the navies. 

Addressing the gathering, Adm Lew Chuen Hong, Chief of Navy Republic of Singapore Navy referred to the historic maritime links through maritime trade of both countries dating back to 3rd and 4th century.  He brought out that Singapore and India are like minded countries that share similar outlook towards preserving freedom of sea following rules and norms laid down in UNCLOS.  He highlighted the special relations that both navies have through substantive interactions.  Corner stone for Navy-Navy relations is SIMBEX which stated as a basic anti-submarine exercise in 1994 as ‘Lion King’ has grown from strength to strength.  The 25th edition of SIMBEX is the largest ever participation by the Singapore Navy in any bilateral exercise. 

To mark the historic occasion and as a symbol of growing trust and comfort levels between the two navies, a special Logo was also released. The occasion was also utilised to simultaneous release Special Postal Cover and Singaporean Postage Stamp on SIMBEX.

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman reiterated that the ICG discharges a silent but invaluable service to the nation and lauded the efforts of all personnel of Coast Guard for its multiple successful search and rescue missions, humanitarian aid, assistance to fishermen and increased surveillance capability.  Smt Sitharaman also laid emphasis on modernization of the ICG with the Definitive Action Program 2017 – 22 which envisages acquisition of 43 ships, 20 aircraft and other infrastructure. Raksha Mantri appreciated the Coast Guard for successfully implementing Minister's directions on use of local language speaking personnel onboard the ships and aircraft to alert the fishermen during emergencies and rescue operations. Raksha Mantri sought the support of all members of the house and their influence in their home states to spread awareness among the sea-faring community regarding utility of carrying emergency communication equipment which they tend to leave behind and face difficulty in communicating SOS messages in times of emergencies. Raksha Mantri declared that the next meeting of the Consultative Committee will be on Ordnance Depots.

 A wreath laying ceremony was organised today at the Teen Murti Memorial by the Cavalry Officers’ Association, to honour the sacrifices, valour, and splendid contribution of the Indian Cavalry since World War I.  The Indian Cavalry has a long and awe-inspiring history of valour and sacrifice.  

 

 Teen Murti memorial was instituted in the memory of the cavalry officers, non commissioned officers and men of the 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade composed of cavalry regiments from the Indian states of Hyderabad, Mysore and Jodhpur, with detachments from Bhavnagar, Kashmir and Kathiawar who were martyred in the Great War of 1914-1919, in the Sinai, Palestine and Syria. The Armoured Corps, a successor and inheritor of the cavalry traditions has proven to be the spear of the Indian military might with its mighty T-72, Arjun and T-90 tanks. 

 

 The memorial service was a solemn ceremony of poise and grace wherein wreaths were placed by serving and retired officers of the cavalry fraternity. 

 

 Lt Gen Amit Sharma (Retd), President COA, highlighted the great contribution of the Indian Armoured Corps, in protecting the nation’s sovereignty.  This is aptly reflected by the ‘Gallantry Awards’ earned by the Corps since independence, which include two Param Vir Chakras, 16 Mahavir Chakras, Three Kirti Chakras, 57 Vir Chakras and 26 Shaurya Chakras.

                     After an intense sea phase of SIMBEX, Singapore India Maritime Bilateral Exercise in the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal, ships of the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) arrived Visakhapatnam on 16 November.  In what could be termed an unprecedented level of interoperability between the two navies – ships, submarines and aircraft of India and Singapore - undertook multi-dimensional exercises at sea with perhaps very high degree of complexity.  After the initial harbour phase at Port Blair, the exercises witnessed action at sea and have now shifted gears to the second harbour phase at Visakhapatnam which is home to the Eastern Naval Command (ENC) of the Indian Navy.  

Few in 1994 would have predicted that the maiden basic Anti-Submarine Warfare exercises that were held that year between navies of India and Singapore would transform into one of the most high level maritime exercises in the years to come and sustain itself for quarter of a century – a milestone like no other. SIMBEX marked its 25th anniversary and is currently underway.  This year, the exercises are being conducted in four phases, two each in harbour at Port Blair and Visakhapatnam and two sea phases in the Bay of Bengal. 

Phase 1 of the 25th edition of SIMBEX has already witnessed over a dozen ships and submarines and a never seen before number of weapon firings at sea.  The action now shifts to the harbour activities at Visakhapatnam before they kick off the intensive Second Phase of the exercise.  In addition to the number of Operational Conferences towards planning and preparing for the final sea phase scheduled from 19 to 21 November, friendly Volleyball and Basketball matches would also be played between the two navies.  The highlight of the sporting activity is the participation of personnel from RSN in the Vizag-Navy Marathon on 18 November off RK Beach.  It is a signature event in the state of Andhra Pradesh and Visakhapatnam’s largest community event with participants from armed forces, corporate sector, government sector, educational institutions including international participants. The event attracts a large scale tourist population for participation from various states and countries.   Personnel from the RSN would be participating in the 10K Friendship Run. Personnel from Singapore Navy also savoured the local culture and cuisine during their stay at Visakhapatnam.

To mark the historic Silver Jubilee of SIMBEX, Naval Chiefs from both the participating countries would also be in Visakhapatnam.  Admiral Sunil Lanba, the Chief of the Naval Staff of the Indian Navy would host Rear Admiral Lew Chuen Hong, the Chief of Navy of the RSN at the SIMBEX Silver Jubilee Dinner on 18 November.  

On 19 November, the Silver Jubilee Commemoration Ceremony would be held at Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam.  In a symbol of growing trust and comfort levels between the two navies, the event will witness unveiling of the SIMBEX logo, and release of commemorative Indian Special Postage Cover and Singaporean Postage Stamp. The simultaneous release of Postal Cover and Stamp by Indian and Singaporean Postal department respectively also highlights the significance of this historic occasion between the two nations.  Earlier, in June this year, the Prime Ministers of both – India and Singapore, on the sidelines of the Shangri La Dialogue held at Singapore had remarked that they looked forward to the 25th and enhanced edition of bilateral annual naval exercise SIMBEX.  

The high intensity final sea phase of the exercises is scheduled to commence on 19 November and will be marked by the presence of Defence Ministers of both India and Singapore.  This in fact would be the first such occasion, when such high level ministerial level presence from both countries would take place at sea.

                Indian Coast Guard (ICG) initiated a large-scale series of pre-emptive and proactive measures to prevent loss of fishermen lives at sea in the wake of alerts on cyclone in Bay of Bengal since November 09, 2018. Lessons from cyclone Ockhi and success in preventing loss of lives during recent cyclones Luban and Titliwere put into practice by the ICG. 

Around eight ICG ships and two Dornier aircraft were pressed into action since November 09, 2018 for issuance of advisories and warnings in local languages to fishermen at sea for their safe return to ports. The Coast Guard Remote Operating Stations commenced issuance of warnings for fishermen in local languages. The Indian Coast Guard requested fisheries authorities at Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh to account for all fishing boats. The ICG conducted series of community interaction programmes at Kanyakumari, Mandapam, Rameswaram, Cuddalore, Chennai, Nellore, Nizampatnam, Uppada and Vishakhapatnam to sensitise fishermen and coastal population for taking safety measures for the impending cyclone.



 

Anticipating the need of relief material and essential items post impact of cyclone in Southern Tamil Nadu areas of Mandapam and Karaikal. One large ICG ship with Helicopter embarked was sailed from Vishakhapatnam with relief items such as potable drinking water, essential medicines, packaged food and life-saving material to southern Tamil Nadu coast. Three other ICG ships were also sailed from Chennai for Mandapam on November15, 2018 for augmenting search and rescue and post cyclone relief operations. Further, merchant vessels transiting at deep seas were requested through International Safety Net by Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centre (Chennai) to alert fishermen at deep seas for early return and shelter at nearest ports. Indian Coast Guard has kept Coast Guard response teams at short notice at Chennai, Mandapam, Karaikal and Puducherry for immediate response. The ICG is closely coordinating with state fisheries authorities, port authorities and civil administration for reducing impact of the impending cyclone. 

Similar warnings have also been issued for the westerncoast, as the likelihood of formation of a low pressure exists in the Arabian Sea from November 17, 2018 onwards.

                Maldivian Coast Guard Ship (MCGS) Huravee successfully completed her refit at Naval Dockyard Visakhapatnam and the ship was formally handed over to Major Mohamed Jamshad, Commanding Officer MCGS Huravee in a ceremony organised to commemorate the occasion on 15 November 2018. The chief guest for the function, Rear Admiral Amit Bose, Admiral Superintendent Naval Dockyard thereafter addressed the gathering wherein he ensured continued support of the Indian Navy to the Maldivian Coast Guard.  The Commanding Officer also took this opportunity to thank the Indian Navy for the successful completion of the refit. The event concluded by customary crest exchange between the ship and the chief guest.

 

The four-month long refit to MCGS Huravee is an initiative by the Indian Navy undertaken in furtherance of the Indian Navy's diplomatic outreach to friendly foreign navies in the Indian Ocean Region.  The ship had arrived at Visakhapatnam on 12 Jul 18 and successfully completed her refit on 14 Nov 18. During the refit, major repairs were undertaken on the ship’s hull, main propulsion and auxiliaries. In addition number of systems and equipment were upgraded for better performance and reliability. All equipment were put through extensive harbour and sea trials so as to achieve full combat capability of the ship and ensure her continuous availability for operations to the Maldives Coast Guard for next operational cycle. 

 

MCGS Huravee was originally commissioned as INS Tillanchang, a Trinkat class patrol vessel built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers, Kolkatta in Mar 2001 and was subsequently gifted to Maldives by the Govt of India in Apr 2006 to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two nations and work together to ensure the maritime safety of the Indian Ocean Region.  The Indian Government through the Navy has undertaken such diplomatic courtesies previously when it undertook the refit of the ship in 2015.

                The Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC) and Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) Admiral Sunil Lanba,PVSM, AVSM, ADC along with the the Commander of Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) Navy Rear Admiral HosseinKhanzadiflagged off a Tall Ship Sail-together from naval base, Kochi  on 14 Nov 18. The event which was organised by the the Indian Navy as part of the 10th Anniversary celebrations of IONS, was attended by chiefs from navies and delegates from 26 countries participating in the 10th anniversary commemorative activities besides a large gathering of Indian naval personnel.

The Royal Omani Vessel Zinat-al-Bihaaralong with two Indian NavalSailing Ships Sudharshini, Tarangini, with  one each “Sea Rider” from Sri-Lanka, China, United Kingdom, Australia, Bangladesh and Maldives are participating in this ‘Sail Together’ which is planned over a distance of 1200 nm to Muscat and back. It seeks to retrace the maritime trade route of yesteryears between the Malabar Coast and the Persian Gulf. The ships were accompanied by smaller Indian sailing vessels Mhadei which would be heading towards Seychelles while the others would continue towards Muscat. A grand fly past with nine helicopters and three fixed wing aircraft was undertaken to mark the occasion.The eventcarries with it the memoriesof a glorious maritime past and the ancient cultural exchange  that opened long-distance political and economic relations between thegreat civilizationsof India and those in Persia andArabia.The route also honours the socio-cultural andmaritime historythat is shared among populations across the Indian Ocean as a result of this trade.

To have Kerala as the starting point for the sail-together is both apt and befitting. Kerala’s coastal magnificence has been a legendary maritime hub for traders from across the world dating all the way back to the first century AD. Its majestic shipyards known by the iconic Urus, have been in the midst of intense ship-building and maritime trade over 1500 years. Arab traders were especially captivated by these vessels and were among the first major patrons of these boats.

The “Sail Together”would culminate with the Tall Ships being received at Muscat on 29 Nov 18.

The Indian Army and Japanese Army today completed their joint military exercise, ‘DHARMA GUARDIAN’ – 2018 at Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School, Vairengte, Mizoram, India. It is a significant step towards fostering military and diplomatic ties between the two courtiers.

 The primary focus of the exercise was to train and equip the contingents to undertake joint counter insurgency and counter terrorist operations in urban and semi urban terrain. The participants were initially familiarized with each other’s organisational structure, tactical drills and planning process before graduating to joint tactical exercises.

The contingents honed their tactical and technical skills in a wide spectrum of counter insurgency operations including joint training on weapons and equipment, field training exercises and handling of improved explosive devices.

 Commanders at various levels from both sides were exercised to work in close coordination to receive and collate information jointly, plan operations and issue suitable orders to respective integrated groups. The exercise provided and ideal platform for both contingents to share their operational experience and expertise while also instrumental in broadening the interoperability and cooperation between armies of India and Japan.

 Observers of both the nations appreciated the professionally conducted training which has resulted in instilling confidence in each other’s capability.

                There are only a few militaries that can boast of continuity and cooperation in the field of maritime combat drills like the navies of India and Singapore and that too sustained for 25 years.  When the frontline ships of the Eastern Fleet of the Indian Navy and those of the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) made their entry into the azure waters of Port Blair in the pristine Andaman and Nicobar Islands on  10 November 2018, it was a treat for the on lookers.  The ships arrived at Port Blair for the commencement of the 25th edition of the SIMBEX - Singapore India Maritime Bilateral Exercise.  Started as Basic ASW exercises in 1994, today these exercises have graduated to complex maritime combat drills including missile and torpedo firings and shore based intensive professional exchanges.  

Home to India’s only Tri-Services Command, the crew of the participating warships and the Maritime Reconnaissance Aircraft and integral helicopters, would go through the last minute exercise coordination details with a fine comb at Port Blair.  During the harbour phase, in addition to operational conferences towards preparation of the sea phase of the exercises in the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal, courtesy calls by both sides on the Senior Officers are also scheduled.  

In addition, Subject Matter Expert Exchanges or SMEE as they are commonly known by militaries worldwide are also scheduled.  The SMEEs, have over the years provided a platform to formally exchange best practices of respective navies so that learning and improvement never ceases.  Cross deck visits by air crew towards deck familiarisation are also planned.  

Over the next two days, Port Blair is playing host to Indian Naval Ships Ranvijay, Satpura, Sahyadri, Shakti, Kirch, Kadmatt, Sumedha and Sukanya along with the RSN Ships, Formidable, Steadfast, Unity, Valiant and Vigour.  Maritime Patrol Aircraft of both countries – the versatile P8I of the Indian Navy and Fokker F50 from Singapore would also be based out of Port Blair.  Local Flotilla ships based at Port Blair would be ensuring seafront security including in the exercise areas towards smooth conduct of the exercise.

Also participating in the exercises are RSS Swordsman, an Archer Class submarine and Swift Rescue, a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV).  While the Indian Navy recently inducted a DSRV on the western seaboard and is slated to induct another on its eastern seaboard, it continues to exercise with various navies and assimilate best practices as well as enhance interoperability.

The exercises at sea this year are unprecedented and largest of kind in terms of the complexity and weapon firings. The sea phase would be held under Commander Task Group of Joint Forces of SIMBEX-18, Rear Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet. Senior Lieutenant Colonel Ho Jee Kien, Commanding Officer of 188 Missile Corvette Squadron would be leading the Republic of Singapore Navy during the first sea phase and would also be the Deputy Task Group Commander.

                The 25th edition of SIMBEX, an acronym for “Singapore-India Maritime Bilateral Exercise” is scheduled from 10th to 21st November 2018 off Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal. Bilateral cooperation between Singapore and India was first formalised when RSN ships began training with the Indian Navy in 1994. What began as a modest endeavour to exchange best practices in the field of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), has in the recent years evolved into a complex high stakes exercise with both nations attaching premium in terms of time, complex advanced exercises and type of platforms involved.

Complementing India’s ‘Act-East’ policy, there have been a number of agreements and high level visits in the recent past between the two countries.  Indo-Singapore bilateral relations have been on an upswing in the recent past.  Both countries have a full calendar of more than 20 bilateral mechanisms, dialogues and exercises, many of which take place annually.  In November 2015, the robust relationship between the two countries was elevated to ‘Strategic Partnership’.  

In June this year, on the side-lines of the Shangrila Dialogue, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore inked many agreements including those under the ‘Defence and Strategic Partnership Sectors’. Key among them is the ‘Implementation Agreement between Indian Navy and Republic of Singapore Navy concerning Mutual Coordination, Logistics and Services Support for Naval Ships’, Submarines and Naval Aircraft (including Ship borne Aviation Assets) visits.  The Implementation Agreement since coming in force has facilitated deployment of naval assets from bases of the other through logistics and services support.  

Both sides agreed to undertake continuous and institutionalised naval engagements in their shared maritime space including establishing maritime exercises with like-minded regional / ASEAN partners.  On the occasion, the Prime Ministers of both countries had commended the Armed Forces for maintaining a high level of annual exercises, goodwill visits and professional exchanges. Both Prime Ministers also remarked that they looked forward to the 25th and enhanced edition of bilateral annual naval exercises SIMBEX.  The previous edition of the exercise was held off Singapore in the South China Sea in May 2017.

The 2018 edition marks the Silver Jubilee of SIMBEX.  To mark the historical occasion, both navies are undertaking exercises over an extended geography.  This year, the Indian Navy is being represented by the Ranvir class destroyer – INS Ranvijay, two Project 17 multirole stealth frigates – INS Satpura and INS Sahyadri, the Project 28 ASW corvette - INS Kadmatt the Project 25A missile corvettes, INS Kirch, the OPVs INS Sumedha and INS Sukanya, the Fleet Support Ship, INS Shakti, a Sindhughosh Class submarine, INS Sindhukirti, the P8I Long Range Maritime Patrol and ASW aircraft from INAS 312, Dornier 228 Maritime Patrol aircraft from INAS 311, Mk 132 Hawk AJTs from INAS 551 and integral helicopters such as the UH3H, Seaking 42 B, Seaking 42C and Chetak utility helicopters.  

The Republic of Singapore Navy is being represented by two Formidable Class stealth frigates - RSS Formidable and RSS Steadfast, one Littoral Mission Vessel - RSS Unity, two Missile Corvettes, RSS Vigour and RSS Valiant, an Archer class Submarine, RSS Swordsman, ‘Swift Rescue’ a Deep Sea Rescue Vehicle (DSRV), a Fokker F50 maritime reconnaissance aircraft, embarked S70B helicopters and Scan Eagle unmanned aerial systems.  Indian Navy has recently inducted its own DSRV and proved the capability at sea on the western seaboard.  

The sea phase of this year’s edition is being conducted under the Command of Rear Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, NM, Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet, who will take on the mantle of the Commander Task Group.  The Deputy Commander Task Group from Singapore Navy will be SLTC Ho Jee Kien, CO 188 Missile Corvette Squadron for Sea Phase 1 and Col Lim Yu Chuan, CO 185 Formidable Class Frigate Squadron for Second Sea Phase.

SIMBEX 2018 will be the largest edition since 1994 in terms of scale and complexity. The initial harbour phase will be held at Port Blair, the capital of Andaman and Nicobar Islands from 10 to 12 November followed by Sea Phase from 12 to 16 November in the Andaman Sea.  The second harbour phase from 16 to 19 November will be held at Visakhapatnam – ‘the City of Destiny’.  Silver Jubilee Commemoration Ceremony, various professional and training interactions, 10 Km ‘Friendship Run’ during the Annual Vizag-Navy Marathon, social evening and joint cultural programmes would be held during the harbour phases to commemorate the 25th anniversary.  The final sea phase would be held in the Bay of Bengal from 19 to 21 November.  High level delegations including respective Defence Ministries are also scheduled to observe the exercises including advanced weapon firings marking a new high in the series.  


The 25th edition will witness a diverse range of exercises at sea ranging from live weapon drills including multiple missile firings, Heavy Weight Torpedo (HWT) and Medium Range Gun/ Anti Submarine Rocket firings; advanced Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) exercises, Submarine Rescue demonstrations; integrated Surface and Anti-Air Warfare (AAW); Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations and Cross Deck Helicopter flying among others.  The number of missiles and torpedo firings being undertaken are in fact unprecedented and perhaps the largest the Indian Navy has undertaken with any foreign Navy till date, indicative of the growing trust and operational comfort between the two navies. This year would also witness the highest numbers and variety of platforms fielded by both sides.  Over the years the two navies have increased their interoperability to a level that could be matched by few other navies.

                The Ministry of Defence has delegated greater financial decision-making powers to Vice Chiefs of the three Services in order to expedite the decision making process involved in the revenue procurements of the Armed Forces. With the new delegation, the Vice Chiefs will be able to exercise financial powers upto five times more than the existing powers with an enhanced ceiling of Rs. 500 crores. This is likely to give another fillip to the capacity of the three Armed Forces. 

 

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman has taken this important decision to augment the arms and ammunition reserves of the Armed Forces to enhance their operational preparedness.

                The Indian Navy has inducted a Submarine Rescue System with a Deep Submergence Rescue Vessel (DSRV) along with associated equipment. This System has a Side Scan Sonar for locating the position of the submarine in distress at sea, providing immediate relief by way of posting Emergency Life Support Containers with the help of Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and thereafter rescuing the crew of the submarine using the DSRV itself. In a submarine accident, rapidity of response is most crucial to safety of life. To ensure early mobilisation, the System has been procured in a Flyaway configuration which permits rapid transportation of the Rescue System from the base to the exact location of the distressed submarine by transportation using air/land/sea vessels. 

The Indian DSRV has the capability to rescue personnel from a distressed submarine (DISSUB) up to a depth of 650 m and it is the latest in terms of technology and capabilities. It has been designed and supplied to meet unique requirements of our submarines by M/s James Fishes Defence, UK. We have ordered two Systems which shall be based on the West and East Coast of India respectively to provide redundancy, high operational availability and early response to deal with a submarine contingency. 

The Rescue System has recently undergone extensive Sea Trials wherein many records have been set. Our DSRV dived to over 666 m, the Remote Operations Vehicle (ROV) dived to 750m and the Side Scan Sonar dived to 650m. Live undersea matings with different types of submarines along with transfer of personnel from submarine to DSRV has also been achieved, thereby simulating the submarine rescue. 

With this capability, India has joined a select league of nations which have this unique capability and we are now in a position to not only provide rescue cover to our own submarines but also to other friendly nations in the IOR and beyond. Our vision is to emerge as a centre of regional excellence for Submarine Rescue Services in line with the stature of our great nation.

The DSRV is likely to be inducted in the Indian Navy by end of this year.

                The second edition of this years’ bi-annual Naval Commanders’ Conference concluded today after three days of fruitful deliberations. The Hon’ble RM addressed Naval Commanders today and complimented all personnel of the Indian Navy for maintaining a high operational tempo and ensuring maritime security of the country. The Hon’ble RM reiterated the need for the nation to be strong at sea and the Navy to be ready and vigilant to counter any challenge in the maritime domain. She appreciated Navy’s efforts in the area of indigenisation, self-reliance and support to the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government.  She expressed her satisfaction at Navy’s initiatives to achieve ‘Digital Navy’ vision in line with the Government’s initiative of ‘Digital India Programme’. During the interaction the Hon’ble RM reviewed the combat readiness of the Navy, pace of modernisation and progress of various acquisition and infrastructure related cases. She extolled IN’s diplomatic efforts to support the regional Navies that are in consonance with the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision of SAGAR – Security and Growth for all in the Region.  The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri also appreciated the efforts underway to improve the quality of life and welfare of personnel.

Opening her address to the senior echelons of Navy and Ministry of Defence, the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman began by complimenting all naval personnel who continue to tirelessly and selflessly perform their duty of securing the maritime interests of the nation. She lauded the Navy for the outstanding and efficient HADR operations undertaken in the wake of the recent floods in Kerala wherein close to 17,000 personnel were rescued. The selfless dedication displayed by IN personnel during this national crisis and the ability of the Navy, as an organisation, to rise to the demand of the occasion to provide succor to our fellow countrymen in distress, has added yet another feather to the list of accomplishments of Indian Navy said the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri.

The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri also expressed her satisfaction with which both the Navy and the Ministry of Defence were performing their tasks in a constructive and a cohesive manner to ensure that the capability shortfalls are mitigated in the shortest possible time.

The Conference undertook a review of the Navy’s modernisation plan including induction of aircraft carrier, ships, nuclear powered submarines, conventional submarines, re-vitalisation of the aviation and sub-surface assets and induction of certain state-of-the-art weapons, sensors and equipment. Further, development of technical and support infrastructure for maintenance of these assets were also discussed in consonance with the ‘Indian Naval Indigenisation Plan 2015-30’, which has formulated the requirements of the IN towards indigenous development of equipment and systems over the next 15 years.

Chairing the conference, Admiral Sunil Lanba, Chief of the Naval Staff, addressed the Naval Commanders on various important issues pertaining to operational readiness, capability enhancement, maintenance, op logistics, infrastructure development and human resource management.

Extensive discussions were undertaken on the functional re-organisation of the Indian Navy towards improving operational efficiency and the CNS encouraged the Commanders to implement innovative and modern ideas towards achieving the same.

                A two-day seminar has been organised by Indian Institute of Bridge Engineers (IIBE) duly supported by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) on the ‘Planning, Design and Construction of Long-span bridges’ beginning here today. It was inaugurated by Minister of State (Independent Charge) for the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, Prime Minister Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Space Dr Jitendra Singh. 

Dr. Singh in his inaugural address highlighted that in overall development of nation connectivity plays a vital role. He expressed his appreciation that IIBE and BRO have taken the initiative to organise this Seminar on such a vital and important topic. Director General Border Roads (DGBR) Lt Gen Harpal Singh highlighted that the topic of the Seminar is a vital subject in today’s context to give due boost to the pace of development of infrastructure in the country.  

Vice Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen DevrajAnbu expressed the need for development of road infrastructure in North and North East of the nation for efficient and speedy mobilisation of strategic resources along the border. Therefore, the seminar on long span bridges is an apt theme to be deliberated by the fraternity of Bridge Engineers.

Construction of bridges across water bodies having widespread water ways, excessive depths of flow, high velocities of current and bouldery riverbed has always been a challenging task for the fraternity of Engineers. Long Span bridges have a significant role to play at such difficult locations especially to facilitate safe and sustainable connectivity with least disturbance to the natural settings of the area and ecology. 

Engineer-in-Chief Lt Gen SK Shrivastava, MD NHIDCL Shri NN Sinha, MD, National High Speed Rail Corporation Shri AchalKhare and Chairman Technical Committee of Indian Institute of Bridge Engineers Shri Mahesh Tandon also shared the dais with Minister. The seminar is being attended by more than 400 delegates, all dealing with the specialised subject.

                Mrs Devika Harikumar, President Air Force Wives Welfare Association (Regional) and wife of Air Officer Commanding in Chief, Western Air Command, kick started the AFWWA celebrations at Subroto Park with all the 47 President AFWWA (Local) of the Command being present. AFWWA at local station level is headed by the wife of the Air Officer Commanding/ Station Commander of the station.

A plethora of activities including future plans for each station was lined up for the ladies. The day started with the board meeting which was presided over by Mrs Kamalpreet Dhanoa, President AFWWA and wife of Chief of the Air Staff.

The main attraction of the day was the grand fete and Mela organised at the Subroto Park sports ground. The ground had a colourful air about it with approximately a hundred stalls from all over North India presenting their wares for sale and exhibition. In all, the area represented a mini India, of sorts. A big hit among the tiny tots were the free rides andinflatable slides put up at the venue. For the women, of course, it was the shopping of goodies from all over north India ‘under one roof’. The proceeds from the Mela go to fund welfare activities of the AFWWA in WAC.

The event would be on for two days, concluding on 03 Nov 18 at 1800 hrs. The event is also open to civilians who wish to visit.

            “I am happy that we have been able to get all the presidents of AFWWA(Local) at one place. It also gives us the opportunity to discuss our future plans for the organisation and review our work done in the current year. The Mela was to give the event a festive mood since the time is just right for one” said Mrs Devika Hari Kumar the lead mind behind this event.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has asked the North Eastern States to expedite fund utilization, so that the financial support made available to them from the Centre can be availed to the maximum extent for the development of the region. He said, he will personally write to all the eight Chief Ministers of Northeast, to impress upon them to expedite the budget utilization.

While presiding over a meeting of senior officers of Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) and North Eastern Council (NEC) to review the status of Central Budget expenditure so far in Northeast during the current Financial Year, Dr Jitendra Singh expressed serious concern about the funds not getting utilized at the pace and scale at which it is expected. He said, the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi places Northeast very high on the priority and the Prime Minister himself takes keen interest in following the development activities in the region, but delayed response on the part of some of the states deprives the people from getting the optimum benefits envisaged for them.

Dr Jitendra Singh recalled when the Government took over in 2014, there were complaints of gross under-utilization of Central funds allocated to the North Eastern States. However, he said, in the last four years, the Ministry of DoNER had modified a number of procedures, as a result of which, both the funding as well as the accountability has increased manifold. This, in turn, has led to a visible and revolutionary fast-track development in the region, which was being appreciated by all, he added.

Dr Jitendra Singh emphasized that he wished the State Governments to make 100% utilization of the funds made available to them, so that in the next budget, more allocations could be planned. He called upon the State Governments to particularly focus on prompt submission of Utilization Certificates (UCs) and avoid delays on account of land acquisition, etc.

At the meeting, it was also decided that in the next coming months, the Ministry of Northeast and North Eastern Council will embark on hi-tech Digitization programmes for all the eight States. In addition, commemorative programmes to observe the 150th birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi will also be held at Northeast.

Secretary DoNER Shri Naveen Verma, Secretary NEC Shri Ram Muivah and other senior officers were present at the meeting.

                With the country's toilet coverage reaching close to completion, people from across the country today celebrated the World Toilet Day with mass awareness and mobilization activities. The focus was on usage of toilets, which is closely linked to the Prime Minister’s call for a Swachh Bharat by October 2019. 

In a tweet on this occasion, the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi reiterated the country’s commitment towards enhancing cleanliness and sanitation facilities. He said, “We in India take pride at the remarkable speed with which sanitation cover has increased in the last four years.”

 

The Swachh Bharat World Toilet Day Contest organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation culminated today with massive community activities across States and districts. School children, health workers and Anganwadi workers and common people came out in large numbers on World Toilet Day to reaffirm their commitment to keep their villages open defecation free. Men, women and children took Swachhta oaths; school children marched through villages and performed plays spreading the message of Swachhta; videos and other demonstrations were shown on the use of twin pit technology; mass hand washing drives were taken up and Swachhta champions were awarded and recognized.

In a special event, CEO NITI Aayog, Shri. Amitabh Kant and Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri. Parameswaran Iyer emptied a toilet pit and then participated in "" Toilet Parliament "" organized in village Vajidpur in Firozabad district of Uttar Pradesh. The Toilet Parliament resolved that the community would sustain its ODF status, convert all single pit toilets to twin pits, promote composting, eliminate plastic usage and use organic fertilizers in the district.

Shri. Amitabh Kanth underscored the importance of manure coming out from twin pit toilets. He said this manure multiplies the productivity of farm land ten times. Shri. Parameswaran Iyer congratulated the village and the district for achieving ODF status. He said the six resolutions demonstrate the commitment of the village to sustain the ODF outcomes. Swachhagrahis, Swachhata Champions, Members of the Nigrani Samiti were felicitated on the occasion for making the district ODF.

The Districts and States who have taken the best set of initiatives during the World Toilet Day will be awarded by the MDWS at national level.

The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) will celebrate the World Toilet Day tomorrow with mass  awareness and mobilization activities across States and districts.  The focus is on usage  of toilets, which is closely linked to the Prime Minister’s call for a Swachh Bharat by October 2019.

The central part of the day’s celebrations  is the the Swachh Bharat World Toilet Day Contest 2018 among all districts by organizing grassroots activities involving district, block and panchayat level teams, swachhagrahis and swachhata champions. The objective is to engage with communities and reaffirm the national resolve to a sustain the Sanitation achievement. States and districts are working on a competitive mode since 9th November with a range of innovative activities centred around Toilets and Swachhata creating unprecedented momentum in the country which is expected to culminate with mega initiatives tomorrow. 

    Since the inception of the Swachh Bharat Mission, the rural sanitation coverage of India has increased significantly, from 39%      in October 2014 to over 96% today. Over 8.8 crore household toilets have been built by rural Indians. As a        result, 25 States/Union Territories, 530 districts, and over 5.2 lakh villages have declared themselves free from open      defecation.   The number of people practicing open defecation in rural India has gone down from 550 million in 2014, to less than 100 million today through the progress made under the Swachh Bharat Mission.

In recognition to the work done by the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, is  receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award at the World Toilet Summit in Mumbai tomorrow.

	Wind warning



	Squally wind speed reaching 45-55 kmph gusting to 65 kmph very likely to prevail along & off Tamil Nadu & Puducherry and adjoining south Andhra Pradesh coasts. It is very likely to increase gradually becoming Gale wind speed 80-90 kmph gusting to 100 kmph along & off central parts of Tamil Nadu & Puducherry coasts from today, the 15th November evening onwards. 
	Strong wind speed reaching 30-40 kmph gusting to 50 kmph very likely over interior Tamilnadu, Kerala, southeast Arabian Sea along & off Kerala coast, Comorian area, Gulf of Mannar and Palk Strait on 16th November. Strong wind speed reaching 30-40 kmph gusting to 50 kmph very likely to prevail over southeast Arabian Sea and along & off Kerala coast on 17th November. 



	Sea condition


Sea condition is high over Southwest Bay of Bengal. The sea condition is very likely to be rough to very rough along and off Tamil Nadu-south Andhra Pradesh coasts and high along & off Tamil Nadu & Puducherry coast from today, the 15th November evening onwards.

 


	Storm Surge Warning


Storm surge of height of about 1.0 meter above astronomical tide is very likely to inundate low lying areas of Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Pudukkottai and Ramanathapuram districts of Tamil Nadu and Karaikal district of Puducherry at the time of landfall.


	Damage Expected over districts of Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur, Pudukkottai and Ramanathapuram districts of Tamil Nadu and Karaikal district of Puducherry:


Major damage to thatched huts/houses, roof tops may blow off and unattached metal sheets may fly. Damage to power and communication lines. Major damage to Kutcha & minor damage to Pucca roads. Breaking of tree branches and uprooting of large avenue trees. Damage to paddy crops, banana, papaya trees and orchards. Sea water inundation in low lying areas after erosion of Kutcha embankments.


	Action Suggested:



	Total suspension of fishing operations along & off Tamil Nadu & Puducherry and adjoining south Andhra Pradesh coasts during next 24 hours.
	The fishermen are advised not to venture into Southwest & adjoining westcentral Bay of Bengal during next 24 hours.


· Coastal hutment dwellers are advised to move to safer places. Other people in the affected areas to remain indoors.


	Post landfall outlook:



	After landfall, cyclonic storm likely to retain its intensity of cyclone for about six hours. Hence gale wind speed reaching 60-70 kmph gusting to 80 kmph is likely to prevail over adjoining interior districts of Tamilnadu. Heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places and isolated extremely heavy rainfall is also likely over these interior districts during the same period.   


· It is likely to cause damage to thatched huts, minor damage to power & communication lines due to breaking of tree branches, damage to Kutcha roads and some damage to paddy crops, banana, papaya trees & orchards.

                            Dr. Satya Pal Singh, Minister of State, Ministry of Human Resource Development, launched two new initiatives; Leadership for Academicians Programme (LEAP) and Annual Refresher Programme In Teaching (ARPIT) today at New Delhi. He also released information brochures of both the initiatives during the event. While addressing the gathering, Dr Satya Pal Singh said that developing good teachers is an arduous task and if teachers show enough commitment, ARPIT will go a long way in empowering the teaching faculty. Committed teachers will develop confidence and competence and must become effective communicators so that they can spread knowledge like the rays of the sun. Combining the qualities of a good teacher and an effective leader is still more daunting task but not an impossible task, the Minister said. LEAP will fulfill this critical need which will make higher education institutions perform their roles of developing better students who will be future torch bearers. A leader must talk for all generations, present and future; only then institutional growth can be achieved, Dr. Satya Pal Singh explained.

                The Government has today approved the process of constitution of new Boards of Governors for the IIMs as per the IIM Act 2017.""The process of constitution of Boards for the IIMs, which have been given full powers of running the institutions, is a major development which signals complete autonomy of quality institutions in higher education and will ensure quality expansion of higher education"", said Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Human Resources Development after approving the process of constitution of Boards for the (20) IIMs in accordance with the IIM Act 2017.  

This process is in accordance with the provisions of the Section 10 of the IIM Act 2017, andhas been approved in consultation with the Ministry of Law and Justice.  

The IIM Act is a historical step of the Govt which for the first time, provided comprehensive autonomy to the higher educational institutions. In accordance with the spirit of the Act, Govt has decided to immediately withdraw the Govt nominees who are in excess of the provisions of the Act. This will pave way for complete control of the institutions by reputed academicians and alumni. 

The process of constitution of the first Boards as laid down in Section 10 of the Act would be kicked off with the (3) Ex-officio members. who will select Chairperson, who shall normally be the current Chairperson and would be given the full term under the new Act(except where there are issues of ineligibility). Then on, the Chairperson would lead the further process of constitution of the Boards as laid down under the Act. 

Thereafter, the Board consisting of Chairperson and ex-officio members will co-opt (5) alumni from each of the IIMs, who will normally be the current serving members, except in cases of ineligibility.

In the first meeting of the Board, the regulations for selection of (4) eminent persons and two faculty members would be framed; and based on this, normally the current serving persons would be selected for a full term. This process is expected to be completed before 15th Dec 2018. 

On completion of the constitution of the Boards in the above manner, the Rules under the IIM Act would be issued, which would bring out the operational details more clearly.

                Union Minister of HRD Sh. Prakash Javadekar visited ‘KVS Rashtriya Ekta Shivir-EK Bharat Shreshth Bharat’ at Vigyan Bhawan Lawns on the second day of the Shivir today. While addressing the gathering the minister applauded the attempts of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan. He said that Unity in Diversity is the speciality of India and KVS has very well presented this speciality in this three day event. 

The HRD Minister expressed his happiness and satisfaction at the wondrous ways in which KVS is creating an environment which promotes learning between states by sharing best practices and experiences. He said such ventures of KVS instill mutual respect and acceptance for diversity of ethos, culture, food etc. He re-iterated that Unity in Diversity is indeed the strength of KVS and of the Nation. He stressed upon learning 5 to 6 words of another language of a state daily by the students, this will help in materializing the concept of Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat on ground. Minister also lauded the exceptional performances of Kendriya Vidyalayas in every field. He said that KVS is a role model for not only government schools, but also for private schools too. He mentioned the highest CBSE results obtained by KVS in class XII which was around 98% this year.

Commissioner KVS, Sh. Santosh Kumar Mall greeted the Chief Guest Shri Prakash Javadekar with Green Welcome by gifting him a plant. In his address he said that every KV is a mini India in itself, because we have children from various states studying under one roof. He also highlighted some major schemes of KVS going before the august gathering. 

Students of Guwahati region presented the Haryanvi Dance and Students of Delhi Region presented the Egyptian Dance on the occasion. Vote of thanks was proposed by Shri U N Khaware, Additional Commissioner (Acad).

This ongoing KVS event will culminate on 2nd November at Vigyan Bhawan Lawns, where Secretary (SE&L) MHRD Ms. Rina Ray will grace the occasion as Chief Guest in Closing Ceremony. 

The Concept

The very concept of National Integration Camp is unique in many ways. The 25 regions of KVS cover 25 Indian States and 25 Countries altogether in terms of the cultural heritage- Dance, Music, Song, and Socio-Economic progress. This mega-event is a broad platform for the students to display their creativity, originality, artistic skills, etc. It gives them an opportunity to know about the culture, tradition, art and architecture of not only the other states of India but of the various countries of the world. In the process of satiating the thirst for information, they overcome many challenges and linguistic and geographical barriers and awaken a strong sense of national pride and widen their horizons with a better cosmopolitan outlook. In nut-shell, the programme not only encompasses performing arts but also provides a glimpse of the processes through which they learn and acquire knowledge.

This year following competitions will be conducted during KVS National Integration Camp – “Ek Bharat Shresth Bharat” & “Lit-Fest”

 

“Ek Bharat Shresth Bharat”


	Group Song
	Group Dance ( State & International)
	Theatre

	Quiz 
	Sanskrit Shloka Recitation
	Hindi KaavyaPaath
	English Elocution

This year 1600 students with 175 escorts are coming together to be the part of this mega event. The unique feature of this event is that the students of one part of the nation exhibit the cultural diversity of the other part of the country and the world.

KVS National Social Science Exhibition–cum-National Integration Camp is organized at School, Cluster, Regional & National level every year. All the 25 regions of KVS are allotted one State different from their own State and one Country. The students prepare projects/exhibits on the culture, customs, dress, crops, economy, climate etc of the State and of the Country allotted to them. The States and Countries are exchanged/rotated each year.

                Union Minister of Electronics & IT and Law & Justice, Sh. Ravi Shankar Prasad today called for a National movement spearheaded by IT professionals to make India a truly digital society. He urged IT community reach out to the deserving and underprivileged section and make them digitally literate. This, he said, would help the government in achieving the goal of transforming India to a digital society and also catalyze efforts to make all sections of society benefit from Government services and initiatives.

 

He said the government has provided two lac Datasets on open data platform to provide an opportunity for innovation to all. He said the government does not encourage data to be available for privileged few only as mass involvement in these initiatives would give better and earlier results. Sh. Prasad said the government supports independence of social media but utmost care should be taken to ensure that it does not rupture the National fabric.

 

Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India (https://data.gov.in) India is at the forefront in promoting innovation in Open Data ecosystem in India. It has been set-up by National Informatics Centre (NIC) in compliance with the Open Data Policy whose objective is to provide a platform for proactive access to Government-owned shareable data. These datasets are directly published on the platform by the Government Departments.

 

Till date, OGD India has 2,29,793 dataset resources, 4,431 catalogs contributed by 137 Ministry/Departments (85 Central and 52 States), 1,500 Visualizations created, 7860 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) created, 196 Chief Data Officers (105 Central and 91 States). OGD India has 17.13 million times viewed and 6.22 million datasets have been downloaded.

 

The Open Government Data Team, National Informatics Centre (NIC) in association with Internet & Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) & Start-Up India had organized Hackathon - “#OpenGovDataHack” for Students, Entrepreneurs, Innovators, Start-ups, Developers and Community to create unique and innovative service delivery Applications & Info-Graphics to foster innovation.  sectors selected for the Hackathon are Water & Sanitation, Transport, Education, Crime and Health. The Hackathon was conducted successfully in 2 phases. The National screening committee shortlisted 20 Apps for final presentation out of which 3 (three winning) apps and 7(seven) other excellence apps will be felicitated in an award event on 1st November, 2018 by the Hon’ble Union Minister.

 

Recognizing the importance of making open data available to its citizens for increased levels of proactive transparency and accountability and to promote higher level of public participation, the Government of India under the aegis of National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) initiated Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India (https://data.gov.in) to share government data with its citizens. This has built a foundation to create an open data ecosystem in the country.

 

OGD demonstrated its potential to the App Developers‟ Community through various contests. #OpenGovDataHack Hackathon event has been conducted in 7 Cities – Surat, Bhubaneswar, Patna, Jaipur, Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad and an online since September 2017.

                United Nation Environment has awarded Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India with Asia Environment Enforcement Awards, 2018 for excellent work done by the Bureau in combating transboundary environmental crime.

Congratulating the Bureau Union Environment Minister said that the Asia Environmental Enforcement Award, recognizes the excellent work done by Government officials and teams from the bureau who are diligently involved in combating trans boundary environmental crime.

The Asia Environment Enforcement Awards publicly recognize and celebrate excellence in enforcement by government officials and institutions/teams combating transboundary environmental crime in Asia. The awards are given to outstanding individuals and/or government organizations/teams that demonstrate excellence and leadership in enforcement of national laws to combat transboundary environmental crime in one of the following eligibility criteria areas: collaboration; impact; innovation; integrity and gender leadership.

WCCB has been conferred this award in Innovation category. WCCB has adopted innovative enforcement techniques that have dramatically increased enforcement of transboundary environmental crimes in India. Notably it has developed an online Wildlife Crime Database Management System to get real time data in order to help analyze trends in crime and devise effective measures to prevent and detect wildlife crimes across India.

This system has been successfully used to analyse trends, helping put in preventive measures as well as for successfully carrying out operations such as Operation SAVE KURMA, THUNDERBIRD, WILDNET, LESKNOW, BIRBIL, THUNDERSTORM, LESKNOW-II along with other enforcement agencies resulting in the arrest of 350 wildlife criminals and huge seizures of Tiger/Leopard Skin/bones and other trophies, Rhino Horn, Elephant Ivory, turtles/tortoises, Mongoose raw hairs as well as Mangoose hair bruses, protected birds, Marine products, live Pangolin as well as its scales, deer antlers etc. across all the states.

In order to involve the public in the fight against wildlife crime, WCCB has also developed a scheme to enroll willing persons as WCCB Volunteers.

The award was decided upon by a selection panel set up by the UN Environment and this is the second time in a row the awards are being given by UN Environment to India.

                Following is the text of the Union Environment Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan’s welcome address today, at the ministerial meet of BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) Countries, being hosted by MoEFCC in New Delhi.

“I welcome you all to 27th BASIC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change in this historic city of Delhi. The Paris Agreement is historic too, and we all know its role in uniting countries, both developed and developing, in their resolve to do their utmost in the fight against climate change. 

This Agreement is particularly significant as it represents the faith that countries, especially the developing countries, have placed in the multilateral processesknowing well that their actions towards addressing climate change will have a strong developmental impact.

Although BASIC group of countries are the leading emerging economies, still they have significant percentage of the world’s poorest people. For us, enabling the growth of the poor out of poverty trap, is an important part of our response to tackling climate change and we know that the opportunities for the two efforts to complement each other are significant. To that effect, the efforts outlined in our NDCs - increasing clean energy production and access, deploying new energy efficient technologies, and adapting to low carbon-intensive lifestyles – are targeted at creating opportunities for sustainable livelihoods, and sustainable development for the poor.

To further these objectives, we need to ensure that the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) is prepared in accordance with the agreed principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) as enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement.

In addition, anchoring the COP 24 outcomes in the vision of equity will help deliver climate justice not only to the present but also to our future generations.

The climate actions of developing countries are ambitious despite the fact our contribution to the issue of climate change is minimal. The historical responsibility lies squarely with the developed countries. Therefore, it is the developed countries who must fulfil their climate obligations expeditiously. They must take the lead in the fight against climate change by their actions as well as the provision of enhanced financial and other support to developing countries for enabling them to enhance their climate ambition.

Lack of ambition of developed countries and their unfulfilled promises should not place additional burden on developing countries to further enhance the level of ambition of their NDCs.

   We must ensure that the progress on NDCs at COP 24 does not yield an outcome that is 

   Mitigation-centric but it should address all elements including mitigation, adaptation, 

   finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building.

Barriers continue to impede the progress of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency deployment. We must attack these barriers. High patent cost of such technologies and non-facilitative IPR regimes are barriers that the Financial Mechanism should address. We are not asking IPR regime to be tampered or dismantled but only support for quick dissemination of technologies.

We need to explore possibilities to fund research and development of climate friendly technologies and shorten technology deployment cycle in absence of which transformative development would be delayed.

Adaptation is a pressing issue for developing countries. They are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts as is also evident from the recent natural disasters and extreme events, which have caused extensive damage to life and property. Naturally, adaptation is an integral part of most developing country NDCs. Since the developing countries have played little role in the present climate change challenge and bearing the brunt of the historic greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries, adequate support must be provided to developing countries by developed countries to help them undertake adaptation actions. 

The reporting under the transparency framework should be based on the principle of differentiation, providing greater flexibility to developing countries, and should also provide relevant information on the support provided by developed countries to developing countries.

A balanced approach towards development of Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines (MPGs) for the Enhanced Transparency Framework that enhances global action and financial support will serve us well in the negotiations at Katowice. In addition, adequate support should be provided to developing countries to participate in the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement.

The developed countries seem to be shedding their responsibilities in pre-2020 period and delaying climate action, which is neither in accordance with the agreed principles of the UNFCCC, or latest scientific findings on climate change. This would not only put additional mitigation burden on developing countries in post-2020 period but will also increase the overall costs and present greater economic challenges for us to make a transition to low carbon growth pathway.

At COP 24, we must prioritize pre-2020 agenda as it would help build trust among Parties and strengthen their faith in the multilateral process.Developed countries should be encouraged to fulfil their pre-2020 commitments even in the post 2020 period and this will form a strong foundation for post 2020 action. 

Finance is one of the critical enablers of climate actions in developing countries along with technology development and transfer and capacity-building support.  Any regression or slow progress on these will hamper the progress of developing countries towards achieving higher ambition in their actions. We find that there is considerable difference in what is communicated as climate finance by different countries. Public finance in the form of grants and concessional finance is required for climate actions. 

Developed countries are far from realizing their climate finance commitment of mobilizing USD 100 billion per year by 2020. They should not only make urgent efforts to honour this commitment but also progressively and substantially scale up their financial support in post-2020 period. The developed countries should finalize a new collective finance goal in time for the global stocktake in 2023 which would inform Parties for future action through NDCs.

India looks forward to constructive engagement and meaningful outcomes from the Facilitative Talanoa Dialogue at COP 24 that will pave a way for a better starting point in 2020 for the implementation of the Paris Agreement.”

The team will comprise of the local Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) as the team leader, senior official from Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and representatives from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). While Delhi has 44 teams the cities in NCR region namely Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad have two teams each. 

Speaking at the flagging off ceremony Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that active participation from all concerned agencies will be required to ensure that quick action is taken on the cases of violations reported by field teams. “In case of repeat violations, criminal proceedings against defaulters will also be initiated” added the Union Minister. Stepping up on mitigation efforts, pilot project, Pariyayantra by a group of scientists from Manav Rachna Educational Institutions was also inaugurated today by the Union Minister wherein air enters the filters that are mounted on roof tops of city buses and gets purified of particulate matter as these buses move. The pilot project has deployed 30 buses mounted with these devices. 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan today also chaired meeting with State Governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan and noted that though the incidents of stubble burning has seen a reduction of 30 percent from the previous year but overall the steps taken by the State Governments to control stubble burning are far from satisfactory. “In Punjab only daily cases of stubble burning were still running into thousands” said Dr. Vardhan. He requested that effective steps be taken aggressively by State Governments to control stubble burning. He also directed Government of Delhi and NCR States to ensure 100% stoppage of open burning of domestic and industrial wastes. 

A mechanism of implementation score to quantify the remediation actions, based on the observation/report of CPCB teams has also been devised by CPCB.Since 15th September, construction activities, open dumping/ burning of wastes including industrial wastes, traffic congestion and road dust have been observed during inspection visit of CPCB.  The scores however indicate that actions on ground are not even 10% of the incidents. Union Minister directed that all agencies should take full remedial steps expeditiously to ensure improvement in the scores.

                Dr. Ajay Bhushan Pandey (IAS: MH 1984) took over as the Union Revenue Secretary upon superannuation of Dr Hasmukh Adhia here today. Outgoing Finance Secretary & Revenue Secretary, Dr Hasmukh Adhia welcomed Dr Pandey in his office. A Maharashtra cadre officer, Dr. Pandey will continue to head the Unique Identification authority of India (UIDAI) as its CEO and will also hold his position as the Chairman of GSTN.

An Indian Administrative Service officer with over 34 years of experience in State and Central Governments, he had a remarkable stint of more than 8 years in UIDAI where he played a key role in establishing and steering Aadhaar across the country and drafting the historic Aadhaar legislation for providing statutory basis to Aadhaar. He also successfully explained Aadhaar and its benefits and the underlying technology to the 5-judge Constitution bench in the Supreme Court through his two-day long power point presentation in the open court room which helped the Government in successfully defending the Aadhaar case against 37 petitions. He was also instrumental in scaling up Aadhaar in delivery of government subsidies and benefits which led to savings of more than Rs 90,000 Crore during the last three years by eliminating ghosts and duplicates and ensuring that the benefits reach the real and deserving beneficiaries. It is under his steering that Aadhaar has earned worldwide acclaim.  

Prior to joining UIDAI in 2010, he played an important role in reforming power distribution system as Managing Director of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company where he brought down transmission and distribution losses remarkably and helped the state in tiding over massive power shortage. Also, during his tenure as Principal Secretary, Information Technology in Maharashtra, he contributed significantly in driving many key e-Governance projects. Early in his career, he had also headed Enforcement Division of Maharashtra Sales Tax department.

An Electrical Engineering graduate from IIT Kanpur, he joined the University of Minnesota in 1998 to obtain his MS and PhD in Computer Science and was later awarded Distinguished Leadership Award for Internationals by the University of Minnesota for his outstanding leadership accomplishments in his professional career.

Later speaking to the media, Dr. Pandey said that his priorities among others would be to help government improve Tax–GDP ratio, enhance tax compliance through integration of technology, stabilize the implementation of GST, bring transparency and simplification of laws and procedures for better tax administration and ease of business. He would welcome any suggestions from public regarding direct and indirect tax reforms as this would help to get feedback and pave the way for providing better incentives and services to the tax payers.

                Government of India and the Asian Development Bank signed a $75 million loan here today to provide 24 x7 water supply in Karnataka’s four coastal towns of Kundapura, Mangalore Puttur and Udupi and improve sanitation infrastructure for Mangalore town.

The signatories to the tranche 2 loan agreement of Karnataka Integrated Urban Water Management Investment Program were Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary (Fund Bank and ADB), Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, who signed for the Government of India, and Mr. Sabyasachi Mitra, Deputy Country Director of ADB’s India Resident Mission, who signed for ADB.

The Program, approved by ADB Board in 2014, aims to improve urban water resource management in selected river basins in Karnataka through modernization and expansion of urban water supply and sanitation infrastructure and strengthening institutions to improve water use efficiency, water resource planning, monitoring and service delivery. The $75 million tranche 1 loan is helping strengthen urban water supply and sanitation services in three other towns of the State - Byadagi, Davangere, and Harihar.

The investment program is supporting four coastal towns in Karnataka to provide continuous piped water supply to people, and promote efficient and sustainable use of water. It will also adopt information technology based smart water management system and undertake community awareness programs on water conservation and demand management, said Mr. Khare.

Apart from providing continuous piped water supply and improved sanitation services to nearly one million people, the Program is helping the urban local bodies to become efficient and responsive urban water utility service provider, said Mr. Mitra. 

The provision of performance-based construct and operate contract (PBCOC) modality, piloted by ADB in another urban project in the state, will help ensure the sustainable water service delivery through the optimal risk allocation between the public sector and private water operator.

The project finances will be used to augment water treatment production capacity by about 16 MLD, lay about 90 kilometers of new water transmission lines and feeder mains, construct 29 overhead tanks and four ground-level service reservoirs and establish town level supervisory control and data acquisition system to strengthen the centralized supervision and control of water flow and water pressure. Other outputs include 1,300 km long distribution network and provision of about 140,000 household connections with new meters. In Mangalore, about 11 km of pumping mains will be installed to rehabilitate the sewerage system.

                The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of India signed here today in New Delhi a $200 million loan on 26.11.20L8 to finance widening and upgrading of about 230 Kilometers State Highways in Bihar to all-weather standards with road safety features. 

The signatories to the loan agreement for the Bihar State Highways III Project (BSHP-III) were Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary (Fund Bank and ADB), Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, who signed on behalf of the Government of India, and Mr. Rajeev P. Singh, Officer in-Charge of ADB's India Resident Mission, who signed for ADB. The project agreement was signed by Mr. Vipin Kumar, Resident Commissioner, Govt. of Bihar and Mr. Chandra Shekhar, Chief General Manager, Bihar State Roads Development Corporation Limited. 

After signing the Loan Agreement, Mr. Khare said that this loan will complement the efforts of the Government of Bihar to upgrade all State Highways to meet the minimum two-lane standard with better surfaces and improved road safety leading to improved connectivity. 

Mr. Singh said that the New Loan will continue ADB's support in the development of the road sector in Bihar. The improved roads under the Project will contribute to savings in vehicle operating cost and travel time, reduce vehicle emissions, and improve road safety. The Project will also establish a State-level Road Research Institute to improve technical and management capacity of the Road Agency Staff. 

Since 2008, ADB has provided four loans to Bihar, amounting to $1.43 billion, to upgrade about 1,453 km of State Highways and to construct a New Bridge over the Ganga River near Patna. 

This BSHP-III project, approved by the ADB Board in October this year, will involve upgrading State Highways to standard two-lane width with road safety features and paved shoulders including reconstructing, widening, and strengthening culverts and bridges. The Project will also build institutional capacity of the State for road design and maintenance and incorporate appropriate new technologies in the State's road sub-sector.

                The Government of India, the Government of Jharkhand and the World Bank signed here today in New Delhi a $310 million Loan Agreement for Jharkhand Power System Improvement Project to provide reliable, quality, and affordable 24x7 electricity to the citizens of Jharkhand.

 

The Jharkhand Power System Improvement Project will help build new power transmission infrastructure, as well as put in place systems to improve the technical efficiency and commercial performance of the state power sector utilities. The Project will help bring in modern technology solutions such as automated sub-stations, and network analysis and planning tools to provide reliable power supply and enhance customer satisfaction.

 

While a significant portion of the proposed investments are aimed at improving power transmission infrastructure, the Project will also focus on developing institutional capacities of State-owned power transmission and distribution companies and improving their operational performance.

 

The Project is part of the Government of India’s Power for All program launched in 2014. The plan envisages addition of over 4.5 GW generation capacities by 2022 (including a significant share of 1.5 GW from solar energy), through a mix of Private and Public-sector investments.

 

The Agreement for the Project was signed by Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; Ms. Vandana Dadel, Secretary, Energy Department, on behalf of the Government of Jharkhand; and Mr. Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, World Bank India, on behalf of the World Bank.

 

After signing the Agreement, Shri Sameer Kumar Khare ,Additional Secretary, DEA said that Jharkhand was one of the first States’ to join the Power for All plan and is making efforts to improve access to power through reforms in transmission and electricity distribution. He further said that with the demand for reliable power expected to almost double in the coming years, the Project will help meet the energy needs of the State for its economic growth.

 

 Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Junaid Ahmad, World Bank Country Director in India said that the Government of Jharkhand is committed to providing quality power supply to its people for the State’s economic development. This Project will help the State increase supply of reliable electricity to households, industries, businesses and various other productive sectors, and contribute to poverty alleviation, and inclusive growth in Jharkhand.

 

The Government of Jharkhand has achieved significant results towards electrification. As per data from the Jharkhand Distribution Company more than 80 percent of all citizens in the State have access to electricity. However, the State will have to continue to work towards providing reliable 24x7 power for all its consumers. The Per Capita Consumption of electricity in Jharkhand at 552 kWh at the end of FY16 is roughly half of the national average. Improved availability of power in the region from plants owned by the Central Government and Independent Power Producers (IPPs) has helped the State achieve lower demand supply deficits in recent years.

 

Some of the major components of the project include construction of new substations and transmission lines, primarily at 132kV voltage level; provide support to the Jharkhand Urja Sancharan Nigam Limited (JUSNL) in setting-up systems for strengthening the State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) operations including financing software solutions for improving scheduling and dispatch functions. This will help integrate renewable energy in the State grid.

 

The Project will also support smart meters, with two-way communication and backend IT infrastructure, deployed in select urban towns. These meters will not only reduce technical and commercial losses, but also improve peak load management. The meters are expected to provide consumers with better access to data which will encourage them to reduce their electricity consumption. To begin with, the Project will finance smart metering for around 350,000 consumers in the capital city of Ranchi.  

 

“Implementing such a large program and improving the financial health of the sector, requires deeper institutional development of its power transmission & distribution utilities. Hence, one of the key elements of the current project will be to support institutional strengthening of the State-owned utilities in the areas of procurement, contract implementation, financial management, and commercial operations among others,” said Mr. Amol Gupta, Energy Specialist and Ms. Kavita Saraswat, Senior Power Engineer and World Bank’s Task Team Leaders for this project.

 

The $310 Million Loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 5-year grace period, and a final maturity of 25 years.

                The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of India today signed a $105 million loan to continue financing the transmission system upgrades in Himachal Pradesh for increased supply of hydropower to the state and the national grid.

The tranche 3 loan is part of the $350 million multi-tranche financing facility (MFF) for Himachal Pradesh Clean Energy Transmission Investment Program approved by the ADB Board in September 2011. The program is aimed at developing and expanding the transmission network to evacuate clean and renewable power generated from the State’s hydropower sources to load centers within and outside the State. It also supports the institutional capacity development of the state transmission utility, Himachal Pradesh Power Transmission Corporation Limited (HPPTCL), as the executing agency for this project.

The signatories to the loan agreement were Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary (Fund Bank and ADB), Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, who signed on behalf of the Government of India; and Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director of ADB’s India Resident Mission, who signed for ADB.

“This particular loan will help Government of Himachal Pradesh to benefit electricity consumers in the state and throughout northern India, by increasing the transmission system capacity for inflow of the hydropower generated in the state into India’s national grid,”said Mr. Khare after signing the loan agreement.

“This last tranche under the MFF will help sustain confidence among existing and potential hydropower developers about the availability of sufficient transmission capacity for evacuation of power from hydropower generation sources in Himachal Pradesh,” said Mr. Yokoyama.

The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB’s lending facility based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), and a commitment charge of 0.15% per year.

ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members—48 from the region. In 2017, ADB operations totaled $32.2 billion, including $11.9 billion in cofinancing.

The signatories to the loan for the Tamil Nadu Urban Flagship Investment Program were Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary (Fund Bank and ADB), Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, who signed for the Government of India; and Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director of ADB’s India Resident Mission, who signed for ADB.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr Khare said that the State has faced recurring droughts and erratic monsoons in the recent past resulting in severe water scarcity and urban flooding. He said that ADB’s support will help address these complex urban challenges through innovative and climate-resilient investment and deeper institutional support. 

Mr. Yokoyama said that the ADB program forms part of its support to the state’s Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 to provide universal access to water and sanitation and to develop world-class cities in high-performing industrial corridors. 

Though Tamil Nadu is the most urbanized of India’s large States, urban service levels remain low, with less than half of households served by piped water, only 42% of households are covered by a sewerage network, with 43% of sewage disposed directly into waterways untreated. 

The program will develop climate-resilient sewerage collection and treatment and drainage systems in 10 cities, and install the country’s first solar-powered sewage treatment plant. Introduction of smart water management systems will help reduce non-revenue water and strengthen operational efficiency. Around 4 million people will benefit from piped water and sewerage connections and improved drainage. The program will boost institutional capacity, public awareness, and urban governance as part of a comprehensive approach for developing livable cities. 

The First Tranche Loan will target the cities of Chennai, Coimbatore, Rajapalayam, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, and Vellore. A $2 million grant from the Asian Clean Energy Fund, established by the Government of Japan, will fund the solar energy pilot project. An ADB technical assistance grant of $1 million will accompany the program to support capacity building.

                XVFC concluded the International Workshop in India on Financing of Disaster Risk Management yesterday in New Delhi. The two-day conference discussed various issues related to Disaster Risk Management (DRM) ranging from urbanization, climate change, coastal erosion, localizedcatastrophes and the price associated with it, among many other issues. The need for a Disaster Mitigation Fundwas also discussed. Chairman of XV Finance Commission Shri N.K. Singh in his closing remarks said that there has to be clear understanding of what exactly 'Mitigation' means in an environment of multilayered risks (High Frequency, Low Impact and various other combinations). He also said that there is a need to rework the ways in which funds can be collected for disaster risk management, both on tax and non-tax front. Impact on revenues of state govt.s due to GST is important as states are the first responders in case of any disasters. How should the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) be funded in GST era, Issue of cess on GST for the purpose of funding disaster response are some policy level issues on which GST Council may have to take a view.

This is not only the issue of earmarking of funds for DRM but also to ensure that funds earmarked are used for DRM like in case of funds devolved to states on account of Forest cover. Deciding on conditionality for use of such funds is a tricky thing. Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary DEA in his closing remarks urged the Commission to come up with a structure to make Disaster Mitigation an integral part of development expenditure. We need to rethink about ways to finance flexible safety net for the people during stress, he said. Dr. P. K. Mishra said that issue in funding arises due to the different nature of mitigation activities (non-contingent) and relief activities (contingent needs-depends on scale of disaster).

Conference also discussed various sources of funding Disaster Risk Management viz. Finance Commission devolution, NDRF, SDRF, crowd sourcing, CSS, CSR and funds from multilateral institutions and enhancing their utility. Role of insurance companies and the issues associated were also discussed in terms of risk transfer. It was also suggested in the conference that FC should look at institutions that enable federalism to strengthen Horizontal Exchange of resources and expertise between the states during the times of disasters.

It was also opined that a Country's credit risk is impacted bypresence or absence of disaster resilience in policies and the resultant losses. Criteria for deciding the quantum of NDRF/SDRF is a key question. DRM needs are very diverse as they include relief, recovery, resilience, mitigation and therefore need careful consideration in decision making which in turn depends on availability of suitable data, analytical tools and replicable models. Experts agreed that any resilience model may be started in Pilot mode and then scaled up. Funds for DRM will require resources and investment not only from govt. but also from private sector, NGOs and civil society.

Participants including Ms. Fracine Pickup, Country Director, UNDP and Dr. Junaid Kamal, Country Director, World Bank India thanked the Chairman and members of the Commission for organizing the International Conference on DRM in India and bringing together ideas, models and expertise from across the globe. Ms. Fracine Pickup said that disasters and development are inextricably linked. Investment that is resilient to disaster risk, sets a pathway for Sustainable Development. She mentioned that UNDP has introduced the concept of 'Risk Index of States' to guide resource allocation and enable policy commitments to specific DRM interventions. Dr. Junaid Kamal said that in a rapidly urbanizing nation, it would be to the country's advantage to invest in building disaster resilient infrastructure which will eventually help lower the cost of impact.

XVFC begins a two day International Workshop on Financing Disaster Risk Management in India, jointly organised by XVFC, NDMA, UNDP and The World Bank in New Delhi. Opening session was attended by the Chairman Shri N K Singh, all the members of the Commission, Shri P K Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Shri Junaid Kamal, World Bank country director and representatives from various countries, insurance sector and public finance specialists.

The Chairman in his opening remarks highlighted the changing paradigm of disaster management in the wake of changed trilogy of Risk, Responsibility and Resources due to increased number of stakeholders and the complexity. He mentioned the need of coherent response in financing of DRM by public, private and multilateral institutions. He also emphasised on the need to look into mitigation aspect in Disaster Management.

Dr. P. K. Mishra in his remarks stressed that 'Business As Usual' will not work. There is a steady paradigm shift from relief and response centric approach to mitigation, adaptation and preparedness. India is a signatory of Sendai Framework which has identified investment in resilience as one of its four priorities, he added. He further said that funds given by earlier Finance Commissions had ensured a predictable way of financing post disaster relief and response works.

He emphasized on the need to be responsive to the needs of states as they are at the front line of innovations related to disaster resilience activities. He urged XV FC to look into it whether the funds with the states are adequate. Striking a balance between funds availability to both NDRF and SDRF is important.

Presentations were made by UNDP and Indian Institute of Human Settlement as part of keynote sessions on Overview of the evolution of DRM and Financing Urban Resilience in India respectively based on the studies commissioned to them by the Commission. Few imp points out of the presentations:

1. We need a credible data system that is publicly available.

2. Effective safety nets need to be included so as to speed up the ability to move money quickly into the hands of victims of droughts, floods etc.

 

3. Centre-state matching grants to prepare for the resilience should be made available. 

 

4. A Hazard Risk index can be developed and the vulnerability score of the state can be measured. Parameters of the index should include Hazard Profile of the state and Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) of the state. 

 

The Workshop is being organised in the context of increasing frequency and severity of disasters . The FC is responsible for advising the Government on the nature and form of Grants-in-Aid to the States. Disaster Relief is one of the major purposes for which grants are provided to the states and is increasingly taking up a larger percentage of grants due to the rising frequency and intensity of disasters every year.

ToR of XV FC states that ‘The Commission may review the present arrangements on financing Disaster Management initiatives, with reference to the funds constituted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (53 of 2005), and make appropriate recommendations thereon’. The workshop will continue on 13th Nov 2018.

                The GST Act provides for allotting a Unique Identification Number (UIN) to Consulates, Embassies and other UN Organizations to enable such entities to claim refund of GST paid. One of the conditions for claiming this refund is to file Invoice Level Data in their FORM GSTR-11 on the common portal. There are common discrepancies which have been noticed by GST Authorities while processing refund applications.

FORM GSTR-11 under Rule 82 of the CGST Rules, 2017 mandates reporting “Place of Supply” for every invoice on which refund is applied for. Many UIN entities while filling invoice data have been reporting their place of supply as the State where they are registered instead of the place of supply as reflected in the invoice.

For example, it was observed that Embassies registered in Delhi have been consistently declaring their place of supply as “New Delhi” even on hotel service consumed in the State of Maharashtra for which the place of supply is Maharashtra.

It may be noted that under the GST law, place of supply determines the chargeability of CGST / SGST or IGST tax on an invoice. Generally, except few exceptions, if the location of the supplier and the place of supply are in the same State then CGST + SGST is charged on an invoice and if the location of the supplier and the place of supply are in separate States then IGST is charged.

Therefore, it is advised that while reporting the “place of supply” and charging of CGST / SGST or IGST on an invoice, the details shall be exactly as per the details mentioned in the invoice issued by the supplier of goods or services. Wrong reporting of invoice level data in FORM GSTR-11 or in the statement of invoice submitted may lead to delay in processing / rejection of refund claims.

          The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the mechanism and procedure for sale of the enemy shares. Details are as follows:

 


	 ‘In principle’ approval has been accorded for sale of enemy shares under the Custody of Ministry of Home Affairs/ Custodian of Enemy Property of India (CEPI), as per sub-section 1 of section 8A of the Enemy Property Act, 1968.
	Department of Investment and Public Asset Management has been authorized under the provisions of sub-section 7 of section 8A of the Enemy Property Act, 1968, to sell the same.
	Sale proceeds are to be deposited as disinvestment proceeds in the Government Account maintained by Ministry of Finance. 


 

Details:

 


	
	
		
		
			A total number of 6,50,75,877 shares in 996 companies of 20,323 shareholders are under the custody of CEPI.  Of these 996 companies, 588 are functional/ active companies, 139 of these are listed with remaining being unlisted.  The process for selling these shares is to be approved by the Alternative Mechanism (AM) under the Chairmanship of Finance Minister and comprising Minister of Road Transport and Highway and Home Minister.  The AM will be supported by a High Level Committee (HLC) of officers co-chaired by the Secretary, DIPAM and Secretary, MHA (with representatives from DEA, DLA, M/o Corporate Affairs and CEPI) that would give its recommendations with regard to quantum, price/price-band, principles/ mechanisms for sale of shares, etc.
		
		
	
	


 


	
	
		
		
			Before initiation of sale of any Enemy Shares, the CEPI shall certify that the sale of the Enemy Shares is not in contravention of any judgment, decree or order of any court, tribunal or other authority or any law for the time being in force and can be disposed off by the Government. 
		
		
	
	


 


	
	
		
		
			The advisors/ intermediaries like Merchant Bankers, Legal Adviser, Selling Brokers etc. as may be required for the disposal of movable enemy property, will be appointed by DIPAM through an open tender/limited tender process. An Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG) will guide the process of sale.  
		
		
	
	


 

In the Act of 1968, the definition of ""enemy"" was as follows: ""enemy"" or ""enemy subject"" or ""enemy firm"" means a person or country who or which was an enemy, an enemy subject or an enemy firm, as the case may be, under the Defence of India Act and Rules, but does not include a citizen of India.  In the amendment of 2017, this was substituted by “.... including his legal heir or successor, whether or not citizen of India or the citizen of a country which is not an enemy or the enemy..... who has changed his nationality”.  

 

Impact:

 


	The decision will lead to monetization of enemy shares that had been lying dormant for decades since coming into force and the Enemy Property Act in 1968.


 


	With the amendment of 2017, an enabling legislative provision was created for the disposal of enemy property.


 


	With the approval, now, of the procedure and mechanism for sale of enemy shares an enabling framework has been institutionalized for their sale. 


 

Major Impact:

 

The decision will lead to monetization of movable enemy property lying dormant for decades. Sale proceeds from this may be used for development and social welfare programmes.

 

Background:

 


	
	
		The Enemy Property Act, 1968 provides for continued vesting of enemy property vested in the CEPI under the Defence of India Rules, 1962 and the Defence of India Rules, 1971, (w.e.f. 27.09.1997). 
	
	


 


	
	
		In 2017, through an amendment to this Act, vide Section 8A, the CEPI has been empowered for sale of enemy property. Further, 
	
	
	“ Notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment, decree or order of any court, tribunal or other authority or any law for the time being in force, the Custodian may, within such time as may be specified by the Central Government in this behalf, dispose of whether by sale or otherwise, as the case may be, with prior approval of the Central Government, by general or special order, enemy properties vested in him immediately before the date of commencement of the Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2017 in accordance with the provisions of this Act, as amended by the Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2017”.


 


	According to amendment, as in sub-section 7 of section 8A of the Enemy Property Act, 1968, Central Government may direct that disposal of enemy property shall be made by any other authority or Ministry or Department instead of Custodian.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has given ‘in principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 100% Government of India's shares in DCIL to consortium of four ports namely, Vishakhapatnam Port Trust, Paradeep Port Trust, Jawahar Lal Nehru Port Trust and Kandla Port Trust.

Presently the Government of India holds 73.44% shares in Dredging Corporation of India Limited. The approval will further facilitate the linkage of dredging activities with the ports, keeping in view the role of the DCIL in expansion of dredging activity in the country as well as potential scope for diversification of ports into third party dredging. The co-sharing of facilities between the company as well as ports shall lead to savings for ports.  This would further provide opportunities for larger investment in DCIL as integration with ports shall help ineffective vertical linkage in the value chain.

The strategic disinvestment of DCIL shall be undertaken after conducting due diligence exercise by both the entities with the help of Advisors, appointed for the transaction.

                Following is the Text of the Article written by the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley on completion of two years of Demonetisation entitled “ Impact of Demonitisation”:

 

            “Today we complete two years after demonitisation.

 

            Demonitisation is a key step in a chain of important decisions taken by the Government to formalise the economy.

 

            The Government first targeted the black money outside India.  Asset holders were asked to bring this money back on payment of penal tax. Those who failed to do so are being prosecuted under the Black Money Act.  Details of all accounts and assets abroad which have reached the Government, resulted in action against the violators.

 

            Technology has been used for both Direct and indirect taxes to facilitate filing of returns and expanding the tax base.

            Financial inclusion was another important step to ensure that even weaker sections became part of the formal economy.  Jan Dhan Accounts have resulted in most people being connected to the banking system.  The Aadhaar Law has ensured that Direct Benefit Transfer of Government support system reached directly into the bank accounts.  The GST has further ensured that in the matter of Indirect taxes, the tax procedures become simple.  It is now becoming increasingly difficult to evade the tax system.

 

            THE ROLE OF CASH

            India was a cash dominated economy.  Cash involves anonymity in transactions.  It bypasses the banking system and enables its possessors to evade tax.  Demonitisation compelled holders of cash to deposit the same in the banks.  The enormity of cash deposited and identified with the owner resulted in suspected 17.42 lakh account holders from whom the response has been received online through non-invasive method.  The violators faced punitive actions.  Larger deposits in banks improved lending capacity for the banks.  A lot of this money was diverted to the Mutual Funds for further investments.  It became a part of the formal system.

 

           

            THE MISCONCEIVED ARGUMENT

            An ill-informed criticism of the demonitisation is that almost the entire cash money got deposited in the banks.  Confiscation of currency was not an objective of demonitisation.  Getting it into the formal economy and making the holders pay tax was the broader objective.  The system required to be shaken in order to make India move from cash to digital transactions.  This would obviously have an impact on higher tax revenue and a higher tax base.

 

            EFFECT ON DIGITISATION

            The Unified Payment Interface (UPI) was launched in 2016 involving real time payments between two sets of mobile holders.  Its transactions have grown from Rs. 0.5 billion in October, 2016 to Rs. 598 billion in September, 2018.  The Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) is an App developed by NPCI for quick payment transactions using UPI.  It is currently used by 1.25 Crore people.  The value of BHIM transactions has gone up from Rs. 0.02 billion in September, 2016 to Rs. 70.6 billion in September, 2018.  The share of BHIM transactions in overall UPI transactions is at about 48% in June, 2017.  

 

            The RUPAY Card is used both at the Point of Sale (PoS) and for e-commerce.  Its transactions have increased from Rs. 8 billion before demonitisation to Rs. 57.3 billion in September, 2018 for PoS and from Rs. 3 billion to Rs. 27 billion in e-commerce.  

 

            Today Visa and Mastercard are losing market share in India to indigenously developed payment system of UPI and RUPAY Card whose share have reached 65% of the payments done through debit and credit cards.

 

            IMPACT ON DIRECT TAXES  

            The impact of demonitisation  has been felt on collection of personal income tax.  Its collections were higher in Financial Year 2018-19 (till 31-10-2018) compared to the previous year by 20.2%.  Even in the corporate tax the collections are 19.5% higher.  From two years prior to demonitisation, direct tax collections have increased 6.6% and 9% respectively.  In the next two years, post demonitisation the increase by 14.6% (part of the year before impact of demonitisation in 2016-17) and an increase of 18% in the year 2017-18.

 

            Similarly, in the year 2017-18, the tax returns filed reached 6.86 crore, an increase of 25% over the previous year.  This year, as on 31-10-2018, already 5.99 crore returns have been filed which is an increase of 54.33% compared to the previous year till this date.  The new filers added this year are 86.35 lakh.  

 

            In May, 2014, when the present Government was elected the total number of the filers of income tax returns was 3.8 crore.  In the first four years of this Government, it has increased to 6.86 crore.  By the time the first five years of this Government are over, we will be close to doubling the assessee base.

 

            IMPACT ON INDIRECT TAX

            Demonitisation and implementation of the GST curbed cash transactions in a big way.  An increase in the digital transactions is visible.  This formalisation of the economy has led to the tax payer base increase from 6.4 million in the pre-GST regime to 12 million tax payers in the post-GST regime.  The actual consumption of goods and services being recorded as a part of the tax net has now increased.  This has given a buoyancy to the indirect tax growth in the economy.  This has benefited both the Centre and the States.  Every State, post GST, is getting a mandatory 14% increase in the taxation each year.  The fact that assessees have to now declare their business turnover not only impacts the indirect tax calculations, but also ensures that income tax arising out of them is disclosed in the tax assessments.  In 2014-15, the indirect tax to GDP ratio was 4.4%.  Post-GST it has climbed up by at least 1 percentage point to 5.4%.

 

            Despite an annual income tax relief of Rs. 97,000 Crore given to the smaller tax payers and a Rs. 80,000 Crore relief given to the GST assesses, tax collections have gone up.  Rates of taxes, both direct and indirect have been reduced, but tax collections have gone up.  The tax base has been expanded.  GST rates on 334 commodities which were paying an effective 31% tax pre-GST have witnessed a tax reduction.

 

            Government has used these resources for better infrastructure creation, social sector and Rural India.  How else could we visualise villages being connected by Road, electricity in every home, 92% coverage for rural sanitation, a successful Awas Yojana, a cooking gas connection in  8 crore poor homes.  Ten crore families are covered under Ayushman Bharat, Rs. 1,62,000 Crore is being spent on subsidised food, 50% increase in MSP for farmers and a successful Crop Insurance Scheme.  It is the formalisation of the  economy which has led to 13 crore entrepreneurs getting Mudra Loans.  The Seventh Pay Commission was implemented within weeks and the OROP was finally implemented.

 

            More formalisation, more revenue, more resources for the poor, better Infrastructure, and a better quality of life for our citizens”.

As part of Finance Commission of India’s interactive process with major central ministries, discussions were held today with Minister of External Affairs Smt. SushmaSwaraj and other senior officials of the ministry. The Commission led by Chairman Shri N. K. Singh and other members Sh. Shaktikanta Das, Dr. Anoop Singh, Dr. Ashok Lahiri and Dr. Ramesh Chand was appraised of the broad architecture of the working of the foreign affairs in their detailed presentation. The highlights of the meeting are:


	MEA’s budget has remained less than 1 % of the total budget of the GOI’s budget which needs a fillip with the kind of activities it has to undertake. Out of total budget, Establishment expenditures have been consistently below 30%. Around 25% of the Establishment Expenditure is used for Central Passport Organization. Of Non-establishment expenditures, Aid (Grant plus Loans) which is major head standing at around 58%, is facing shortfall of about 3900 crores.
	MEA is working on strategic connectivity, shaping choices and balancing interests & creating goodwill by various development projects, humanitarian assistance and aids to friendly countries, innovative diplomatic outreach and partnerships. Development partnership of about 27.7 billion dollars is in place at present with various countries under India’s Neighborhood First and Act East policies. To increase the outreach and efforts towards such partnerships, 18 new missions are to be opened by 2022 in various countries which need additional resources.
	MEA is working vigorously to enhance public service delivery through a network of 322 Passport Centers (including Post Office – PSKs) across the country, up from mere 77 passport centers in 2014 with excellence. Post Office Passport SevaKendras, launched in January 2017, have been a major policy decision for last mile coverage. MEA has a target of Passport Centre in every parliament Constituency in future. 
	As part of its outreach to the Indian diaspora as well as Indian citizens, MEA has stared various programmes like Bharat EkParichay, Know India Programme, Pradesh Me Videsh and SAMEEP.


The Commission was conscious that contours of foreign policy of an increasingly interdependent India entails multiple challenges and opportunities. The emergence of other major powers in this region and the need for timely completion of projects initiated in number of friendly countries, needed adequacy of resources.

The opportunities in Africa and other developing countries also needed to be harnessed to the country’s advantage and predictability of finances was central in these endeavors. Enhancing the reach and quality of India’s diplomatic power needed further strengthening by both the ministry as well missions abroad. The need to open so many new embassies in different parts of the world in near future and improving the public service delivery by a network of Passport Centers across the country, both need finances for physical infrastructure and manpower. 

Chairman and Members tried to understand the trade relations of India across the globe, its challenges and efforts done to enhance this. Overall, Commission was given an understanding of the challenges in matching India’s diplomatic power with India’s economic power as world’s fastest growing emerging economy in 21st Century – The Asian Century.Following today’s preliminary meeting, more such meetings and consultations will be held between the Ministry and the Commission.

 The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched a historic support and outreach programme for the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector. As part of this programme, the Prime Minister unveiled 12 key initiatives which will help the growth, expansion and facilitation of MSMEs across the country.

 

The Prime Minister said that the 12 decisions that he is announcing today, will mark a new chapter for the MSME sector. Noting that MSMEs are one of the principal employment generators in India, the Prime Minister recalled the glorious Indian traditions of small scale industry, including Ludhiana’s hosiery, and Varanasi’s sarees.

 

The Prime Minister said that the success of economic reforms launched by the Union Government, can be gauged from the rise in India's “Ease of Doing Business Rankings,” from 142 to 77 in four years.

 

The Prime Minister said that there are five key aspects for facilitating the MSME sector. These include access to credit, access to market, technology upgradation, ease of doing business, and a sense of security for employees. He said that as a Diwali gift for the sector, the 12 announcements he is making, will address each of these five categories.

 

Access to Credit

As the first announcement, the Prime Minister announced the launch of the 59 minute loan portal to enable easy access to credit for MSMEs. He said that loans upto Rs. 1 crore can be granted in-principle approval through this portal, in just 59 minutes. He said a link to this portal will be made available through the GST portal. The Prime Minister asserted that in New India, no one should be compelled to visit a bank branch repeatedly.

 

The Prime Minister mentioned the second announcement as a 2 percent interest subvention for all GST registered MSMEs, on fresh or incremental loans. For exporters who receive loans in the pre-shipment and post-shipment period, the Prime Minister announced an increase in interest rebate from 3 percent to 5 percent.

 

The third announcement made by the Prime Minister was that all companies with a turnover more than Rs. 500 crore, must now compulsorily be brought on the Trade Receivables e-Discounting System (TReDS). He said that joining this portal will enable entrepreneurs to access credit from banks, based on their upcoming receivables. This will resolve their problems of cash cycle.

 

Access to Markets

The Prime Minister said that on access to markets for entrepreneurs, the Union Government has taken a number of steps already. In this context, he made his fourth announcement, that public sector companies have now been asked to compulsorily procure 25 percent, instead of 20 percent of their total purchases, from MSMEs.

 

The Prime Minister said his fifth announcement is related to women entrepreneurs. He said that out of the 25 percent procurement mandated from MSMEs, 3 percent must now be reserved for women entrepreneurs.

 

The Prime Minister said that more than 1.5 lakh suppliers have now registered with GeM, out of which 40,000 are MSMEs. He said transactions worth more than Rs. 14,000 crore have been made so far through GeM. He said the sixth announcement is that all public sector undertakings of the Union Government must now compulsorily be a part of GeM. He said they should also get all their vendors registered on GeM.

 

Technology Upgradation

Coming to technological upgradation, the Prime Minister said that tool rooms across the country are a vital part of product design. His seventh announcement was that 20 hubs will be formed across the country, and 100 spokes in the form of tool rooms will be established.

 

Ease of Doing Business

On Ease of Doing Business, the Prime Minister said his eighth announcement is related to pharma companies. He said clusters will be formed of pharma MSMEs. He said 70 percent cost of establishing these clusters will be borne by the Union Government.

 

The Prime Minister said that the ninth announcement is on simplification of government procedures. He said the ninth announcement is that the return under 8 labour laws and 10 Union regulations must now be filed only once a year.

 

The Prime Minister said that the tenth announcement is that now the establishments to be visited by an Inspector will be decided through a computerised random allotment.

 

The Prime Minister noted that as part of establishing a unit, an entrepreneur needs two clearances namely, environmental clearance and consent to establish. He said that the eleventh announcement is that under air pollution and water pollution laws, now both these have been merged as a single consent. He further said that the return will be accepted through self-certification.

 

As the twelfth announcement, the Prime Minister mentioned that an Ordinance has been brought, under which, for minor violations under the Companies Act, the entrepreneur will no longer have to approach the Courts, but can correct them through simple procedures.

Social Security for MSME Sector Employees

The Prime Minister also spoke of social security for the MSME sector employees. He said that a mission will be launched to ensure that they have Jan Dhan Accounts, provident fund and insurance.

 

The Prime Minister said that these decisions would go a long way in strengthening the MSME sector in India. He said the implementation of this outreach programme will be intensively monitored over the next 100 days.

 

The Union Minisyter of Finance and CorporateAffairs, Shri Arun Jaitley, Union Minister of State (I/C) for MSME, Shri Giriraj Singh, MOS(Finance) Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla, MOS(Finance & Shipping), Shri Pon. Radhakrishnan, Secretary, DFS, Shri Rajiv Kumar, Secretary, MSME, Shri Panda and senior officials of different Departments/Ministries, Banks and Financial Institutions were also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Smt.

The Park will also provide direct and indirect employment to 5,000 persons and benefit about 25,000 farmers in the CPC and PPC catchment areas.

The Minister added that the modern infrastructure for food processing created at Park will benefit the farmers, growers, processors and consumers of Maharashtra and adjoining areas immensely and prove to be a big boost to the growth of the food processing sector in the State of Maharashtra.

Smt. Badal also said that the government is fully committed to providing an environment that is smooth, transparent and easy for investors wanting to start an enterprise in India and in a bid to make India a resilient food economy and the Food Factory of the World, the government has made Food Processing a major thrust area of ‘Make in India’.

Aimed at giving a major boost to the food processing sector by adding value and reducing food wastage at each stage of the supply chain with particular focus on perishables, Ministry of Food Processing Industries is implementing Mega Food Park Scheme in the country. Mega Food Parks create modern infrastructure facilities for food processing along the value chain from farm to market with strong forward and backward linkages through a cluster based approach. Common facilities and enabling infrastructure is created at Central Processing Centre and facilities for primary processing and storage is created near the farm in the form of Primary Processing Centers (PPCs) and Collection Centers (CCs). Under the Scheme, Government of India provides financial assistance upto Rs. 50.00 Crore per Mega Food Park project.

                The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India today approved formula for determination of compensation for those patients who had received (prior to August, 2010) faulty Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) hip implants manufactured by M/s. DePuy International Limited, U.K (M/S Johnson & Johnson Pvt Ltd).

 

An expert committee was constituted by the Ministry under the Chairmanship of Dr. Arun Kumar Agarwal, Ex-Dean and Professor of ENT, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi to examine the issues relating to faulty ASR Hip Implants. The committee, after detailed examination of the issue, submitted its report alongwith its final recommendation. The report was accepted by the Central Government.

 

Based on the recommendations, the Government constituted a Central Expert Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. R.K. Arya, Director, Sports Injury Centre to determine the quantum of compensation. All the State/UTs Government have also been requested by the Ministry to form State Level Committees to examine the effected patients within the respective states and to make the process less arduous for the patients. These committees would send their recommendations to the Central Committee.

 

All the State/UTs Government had also been requested to make people aware through newspaper advertisements so that they may approach either Central Expert Committee or State Level Committee. 

Dr. R.K. Arya, Chairman, Central Expert Committee after holding five meetings prepared a formula for determining compensation for the ASR victim patients. This reads as 

 

B x R x F  + Rs 10 lakh towards non-pecuniary damages.

 99.37 

 

B is the base amount i.e., Rupees Twenty Lakh (Rs 20,00,000)
R is the Risk Factor-Disability

                “People’s participation and people’s awareness is the key for encouraging organ donation.” This was stated by Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare on the occasion of ‘9th Indian Organ Donation Day’, organised by the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO),  here today.  Shri Choubey also administered the pledge to the participants to donate organs.

Smt. Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Dr. C. Vijaya Baskar, Minister of Health, Government of Tamil Nadu, Smt Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health), Dr. R.K. Vats, Addl. Secretary and Dr S. Venkatesh, DGHS, were also present at the event.

In his address, Shri Choubey further said that many myths and misconceptions surround organ donation. He stated that very often, organ donation gets discouraged on the basis of superstitions. Shri Choubey urged the people to come forward for organ donation without any fear. He said, “I salute all those who have shown courage to donate organ of their near and dear ones, and shown us a direction to emulate this brave act.”

Speaking at the function, Smt Anupriya Patel stated that “When seen from the perspective of reason and rationale, the gift of life is the ultimate gift that one could give and organ donation is, therefore, a ‘God like act’ and needs to be encouraged.”  She further said that it is important to understand that in India it is mainly the living donors who are donating organs and only about 23% of the organ transplant is being done with organs obtained from the cadavers. “There is a need to promote cadaver or deceased organ donation rather than relying on living donors in order to avoid the risk of commercial trading of organs and also to avoid the inherent risk to the health of the living donor, Smt Anupriya Patel added.

Dr. C. Vijaya Baskar, Minister of Health, Government of Tamil Nadu, expressed happiness at the announcement of Tamil Nadu being adjudged the Best State in Organ Donation for the fourth time in a row. He highlighted the exemplary work that Tamil Nadu had done in retrieving organs from donors; and had been the first state in India for various initiatives like mandatory certification of Brain Stem Death, streamlining organ distribution and setting up green corridors. 

Smt Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health), applauded the donor families and congratulated the state of Tamil Nadu for leading the nation in the field of organ donation. She urged the people to tell their near and dear ones about their willingness to donate organs so that it can be done smoothly after they are gone. “Gift life after life, let’s make life better even after we are dead,” she said.

At the event, the Ministers felicitated the families of deceased organ donors from various parts of the country. The best performing State of Tamil Nadu was also felicitated. The State of Maharashtra received an award for being the best State for promoting awareness on organ donations. Dr Subramania Iyer K, AIMS, Kochi was felicitated for conducting first hand transplant in the country and Dr Shailesh Puntambekar, Pune, received the award for conducting 1st Uterine Transplant in India.  Special awards were also given to the collaborating institutions and organizations at the awards ceremony.

Also present at the event were senior officers from BSF, CRPF and the students and representatives of various development organizations.

                          The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 for regulation and standardisation of education and services by allied and healthcare professionals.The Bill provides for setting up of an Allied and Healthcare Council of India and corresponding State Allied and Healthcare Councils which will play the role of a standard-setter and facilitator for professions of Allied and Healthcare.

 

Details:

 


	Establishment of a Central and corresponding State Allied and HealthcareCouncils; 15 major professional categories including 53 professions in Allied and Healthcare streams.


 


	The Bill provides for Structure, Constitution, Composition and Functions of the Central Council and State Councils,   e.g.   Framing  policies  andstandards, Regulation of professional conduct, Creation and maintenanceof live Registers, provisions for common entry and exit examinations, etc. 


 


	The Central Council will comprise 47 members, of which 14 members shall be ex-officio representing diverse and related roles and functions andremaining 33 shall be non-ex-officio members who mainly represent the 15professional categories.


 


	The State Councils are also envisioned to mirror the Central Council,comprising 7 ex-officio and 21 non-ex officio members and Chairperson tobe elected from amongst the non-ex officio members.
	Professional Advisory Bodies under Central and State Councils will examine issues independently and provide recommendations relating to specific recognised categories.


 


	The Bill will also have an overriding effect on any other existing law for any of the covered professions.


 


	vii. The State Council will undertake recognition of allied and healthcare institutions.


 


	Offences and Penalties clause have been included in the Bill to check mal­practices.


 


	The Bill also empowers the Central and State Governments to make rules.


 


	Central Govt. also has the power to issue directions to the Council, tomake regulations and to add or amend the schedule. 


 

Targets:

 


	
	
		An Interim Council will be constituted within 6 months of passing of the Act holding charge for a period of two years until the establishment of the Central Council.
		The Council at the Centre and the States are to be established as body corporate with a provision to receive funds from various sources.
		Councils will also be supported by Central and State Governments respectively through Grant-in-aid as needed. However, if the StateGovernment expresses inability, the Central Government may release some grant for initial years to the State Council.
	
	


 

Major Impact, including employment generation potential:

 


	Bring all existing allied and healthcare professionals on board during thefirst few of years from the date of establishment of the Council.


 


	Opportunity to create qualified, highly skilled and competent jobs inhealthcare by enabling  professionalism of the allied  and  healthcare workforce.


 


	 High quality, multi-disciplinary care in line with the vision of AyushmanBharat, moving away from a 'doctor led' model to a 'care accessible and team based’ model.


 


	Opportunity to cater to the global demand (shortage) of healthcareworkforce which is projected to be about 15 million by the year 2030, asper the WHO Global Workforce, 2030 report.


 

Expenditure involved:

 

Total cost implication is expected to be Rupees 95 crores for the first four years. About four-fifth of the total budget (i.e. Rupees 75 crores) is being earmarked for the States while the remaining fund will support the Central Council operations for 4 years and also establish the Central and State Registers.

 

Number of beneficiaries:

 

It is estimated that the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 will directlybenefit around 8-9 Lakh existing Allied and Healthcare related professionals inthe country and several other graduating professionals joining workforce annually and contributing to the health system. However, since this Bill is directed to strengthen the healthcare delivery system at large, it may be saidthat the entire population of the country and the health sector as a whole will be benefited by this Bill.

 

Background:

 


	In the current state of healthcare system, there exist many allied and healthcare professionals, who remain unidentified, unregulated and underutilised. Our system is highly focused on efforts towards strengthening limited categories of professionals such as doctors, nurses and frontline workers (like Accredited Social Health Activist or ASHAs, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife or ANMs). However, numerous others have been identified over the years, whose potential can be utilised to improve and increase the access to quality driven services in the rural and hard to reach areas.


 


	Allied and Healthcare Professionals (A&HPs) constitute an important element of the health human resource network, and the skilled and efficient Allied and Healthcare Professionals (A&HPs) can reduce the cost of care and dramatically improve the accessibility to quality driven healthcare services.


 


	Globally, Allied and Healthcare Professionals typically attend undergraduate degree programme of a minimum of three to four years to begin with and may attain up to PhD level qualification in their respective streams. However, most of Indian institutions offering such courses lack standardisation.


 


	Majority of the countries worldwide, have a statutory licensing or regulatory body that is authorised to license and certify the qualifications and competence of such professionals, particularly those involved in direct patient care (such as physiotherapist, nutritionist etc.) or those whose occupation impact patient care directly (such as lab technologists, dosimetrists etc.).


 


	Though such professionals have existed in the Indian healthcare system for many decades, a considerable gap in the allied and healthcare space is because of a lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework and absence of standards for education and training of A&HPs.


 


	The Bill thus seeks to establish a robust regulatory framework which will play the role of a standard-setter and regulator for Allied and Healthcare professions.

                Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) under Department of Health Research is in the forefront of advanced research in virology and the ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV) is at par with leading scientific establishments across the world. ICMR-NIV, Pune has sequenced 5 Zika virus strains collected at different time points of the Jaipur outbreak. Advanced molecular studies of Zika virus strains, carried out through Next Generation Sequencing suggest that the known mutations linked to fetal microcephaly and high transmissibility of Zika virus in Aedes mosquitoes are not present in the current Zika virus strain that has affected Rajasthan. 

However, the Government is maintaining high vigil of the possibility of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Zika virus as the strain may mutate in future or some other unknown/host factors may play a role in microcephaly /other birth defects.

The Health Ministry is reviewing the situation on a daily basis.Around 2000 samples were tested for Zika virus positivity, of which 159 positive cases have been confirmed. Adequate numbers of testing kits have been provided to the Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories. The State Government has been supplied with IEC material prepared to create awareness about Zika virus disease and its prevention strategies. All pregnant mothers in the area are being monitored through NHM. Extensive surveillance and vector control measures are being taken up in the area as per protocol by the state government. 

Zika virus disease is an emerging disease currently being reported by 86 countries worldwide. Symptoms of Zika virus disease are similar to other viral infections such as dengue, and include fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise, and headache. 

In India, the first outbreak was reported in Ahmedabad in January/February 2017 and second outbreak in July,2017 from Krishnagiri District in Tamilnadu. Both these outbreaks were successfully contained through intensive surveillance and vector management.

The disease continues to be on disease surveillance radars of Union Health Ministry although it is no longer a Public Health Emergency of International Concern vide WHO notification since 18th November, 2016. 

The situation continues to be monitored regularly.

                “Corporate leaders across all sectors should explore opportunities of investment in the emerging field of senior care.” This was stated by SmtAnupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare during her keynote address at the ‘1st Annual Senior Care Conclave’ organised by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), here today. Speaking at the function, SmtAnupriya Patel stated that the rapidly changing global demographics have resulted in a sharp rise in the demand for senior care services.“Health services are to be designed in such way that there is a complete coordination across the thread of care providers to cure acute conditions and symptoms,” she said. SmtAnupriya Patel also released a CII Report“Igniting Potential in Senior Care Services” and inaugurated an exhibition at the event.

 

Speaking at the occasion, SmtAnupriya Patel statedthat the rapidly changing global demographics have resulted in a sharp rise in the demand for senior care services. This coupled with an increased life expectancy of the population, and an increased tendency globally to have nuclear families, has further accelerated the growth in the senior care sector, she said.

 

Highlighting the initiatives of the Health Ministry,SmtAnupriya Patel saidthat the “National Programme for the Health Care of Elderly (NPHCE)” addresses various health related issues of the elderly people and the programme is an articulation of the international and national commitments of the government. The programme is State oriented and basic thrust of the programme is to provide dedicated health care facilities to the senior citizens (>60 year of age) at various level of primary, secondary and tertiary health care, she added.“The basic aim of the NPHCE Programme is to provide dedicated, specialized and comprehensive health care to the senior citizens at various levels of state health care delivery system including outreach services. Preventive and promotive care, management of illness, health manpower development for geriatric services, medical rehabilitation & therapeutic intervention and IEC are some of the strategies envisaged in the NPHCE,”SmtAnupriya Patel mentioned.

 

The Minister further stated that NPHCE was launched in 100 identified districts of 21 States and Eight Regional Geriatrics Centres in selected medical colleges as referral units during the 11th Plan period. As on March 2018, 520 districts in 34 states and UT’s had been sanctioned for provision of geriatric care services. “19 regional geriatric centres in government medical colleges of 18 states sanctioned for specialized care and training purpose. Two National Centres for Ageing(NCA) in AIIMS Delhi and Madras Medical College, Chennai have been sanctioned to be developed as centres of excellence for geriatrics. In 2018-19, 79 more districts have been recommended, taking the number of districts sanctioned for provision of geriatric care services to 599 districts,” She elaborated.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh launched Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) for Himachal Pradesh at Mandi today. Himachal Pradesh is the first state to launch pan-India single emergency number ‘112’ under ERSS.

Addressing the gathering, Shri Rajnath Singh applauded the initiatives of Government of Himachal Pradesh under the able leadership of Chief Minister Shri Jai Ram Thakur for being the first State to launch the single emergency number 112 under ERSS project. He appealed residents of State of Himachal Pradesh to download ‘112 India’ mobile app available in App store of Google & Apple. Citing the success of Himachal Pradesh in rolling out the ERSS project, he requested other States and Union Territories to make all out efforts to commence rollout of their ERSS project.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Jai Ram Thakur expressed his gratitude to the Union Home Minister for inaugurating the 112-single emergency number, 112 India mobile app and ERSS website and for providing financial assistance of Rs. 4.71 Crore for the project. He further thanked Union Home Minister for approving a dedicated NDRF Battalion for the State of Himachal Pradesh, Rs. 4.2 Crore for modernization of State Police force under MPF scheme and for approving enhancement of monthly salary of SPOs in district of Chamba and Lahaul Spiti from Rs. 4,000/- to Rs. 6,000/-.

This event marks the beginning of commencement of a single number based 112 emergency services which will connect to Police, Fire, Health and other helplines through an Emergency Response Centre in the State. This service obviates the need for citizens to remember multiple helpline numbers. 

Under this project, one Emergency Response Centre (ERC) has been established in Shimla along with 12 District Command Centers (DCCs) covering entire State. Emergency Response Centre has been integrated with Police (100), Fire (101), Health (108) and Women helpline (1090) Services to provide emergency services via single emergency number - 112. The service also includes a ‘112 India’ mobile app integrated with Panic Button of smartphones and ERSS State website for ease of citizen in availing immediate assistance. To increase the effectiveness of Emergency Response, the ERC has also been integrated with Location Based Services provided by Telecom Service Providers.

To ensure safety of women, a SHOUT feature has been introduced in ‘112 India’ mobile app to seek immediate assistance from registered volunteers in the vicinity apart from the immediate assistance from Emergency Response Centre. The SHOUT feature is exclusively available to women. 

The ‘112 India’ mobile app will be subsequently rolled out in all States & Union Territories to help people across the country access the unified emergency services. Central Government has allocated ₹321.69 Crore under Nirbhaya Fund for implementation of ERSS project across the country.

                The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju, inaugurated the 14th Formation Day of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) here today. The theme of this year’s Formation Day is ‘Early Warning for Disasters’. 

Delivering the inaugural address, Shri Rijiju said, “NDMA has changed the way Disaster Management is looked upon as a subject - that a disaster can be prevented. With such a vast geography and population while also being a democracy, we have come a long way in managing disasters; the world cannot ignore India when it comes to Disaster Risk Reduction. India is taking a lead role in matters pertaining to Disaster Management.” He also emphasized that half the battle against the disasters would be won by increasing disaster awareness and improving early warning systems. He said that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is taking special interest in making the country more disaster resilient.

On the occasion, Shri R. K. Jain, Member, NDMA highlighted the activities undertaken by NDMA during the last one year since the last formation day. Highlighting the importance of NDMA, he said, “Over the past 13 years since its formation, NDMA has contributed a great deal not only for effective disaster response, which is visible, but towards overall disaster risk reduction.”

Shri Jain also informed about the Prime Minister’s initiative to give awards annually for outstanding contribution by individuals and institutions in the area of disaster management.  He said that the entries of the same will be open shortly.

On the occasion, NDMA also released a training manual for masons on Hazard-Resistant Construction. A study report on “Gujarat floods 2017: A Case Study” will also be released.

Early warning is a major element of disaster risk reduction and can minimise the loss of lives and economic impacts. Timely early warning is key to a structured and efficient response. 

To be effective, early warning systems need to involve the communities at risk, generate public awareness, effectively disseminate warnings and ensure there is a constant state of preparedness. Over the years, India has made considerable progress in issuing accurate and timely early warning, especially for cyclones. Earlier this month, authorities could evacuate thousands before Cyclone Gaja made its landfall as its path was accurately predicted.

Stakeholders will discuss the roadmap, their roles and key challenges in issuing timely and accurate early warning and its dissemination to all relevant stakeholders, including the vulnerable communities. 

A manual for training masons on Hazard-resistant Construction and a study report on Gujarat Floods of 2017 will also be released on the occasion. Dr. P. K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, will deliver the Valedictory address on the occasion.

Discussions at the event will increase awareness and aid improvement of our early warning mechanisms for disasters.

                A basic training programme aimed at enhancing the preparedness of Airport Emergency Handlers (AEHs) to respond to CBRN emergencies began at the Trivandrum International Airport in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala today. The five-day training programme is being conducted by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

CBRN emergencies pertain to threats emanating from the handling of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear material. 

The training programme is being conducted in collaboration with the Airport Authority of India (AAI), Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

Handling CBRN emergencies need specialised skills and efforts. In fact, even a small CBRN related event can cause panic among people at the airports. This training programme will improve the CBRN safety at our airports by enabling the AEHs to handle any CBRN emergency.

The programme consists of lectures as well as field training, including live demonstrations of detection and decontamination including use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Besides equipping the AEHs to handle CBRN emergencies, the training programme will also enable them to provide medical first aid and initial psycho-social support. 

Experts from stakeholder departments such as Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), INMAS, NDMA, NDRF, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) will train the participants. 

A total of 50 participants representing various agencies responsible for operation and maintenance of the airport will be trained on various aspects of CBRN emergencies. Another 150 working level staff will be sensitized on the subject in a half day module. A mock exercise will also be carried out during the training programme.

This is the eleventh in a series of such programmes being conducted at airports across the country to enable AEHs to respond suitably till the arrival of specialised response teams. Ten batches have already been trained - one each in Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Varanasi, Patna, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Raipur and Bengaluru.

                The Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Kiren Rijiju inaugurated the workshop on ‘Role of Media in Disaster Management’, here today. The workshop was organised by the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The conference was organised keeping in view the significance of role of media at all stages of disaster management especially in preparedness, mitigation, response and relief. The workshop aimed to sensitise media about their role and responsibilities during disaster reporting and about disaster mechanism in the country.  

Addressing the inaugural session, Shri Kiren Rijiju said that there are three aspects to tackle any disaster – pre, during and post disaster. The reaction is mainly focussed on the second i.e. during the disaster aspect, while the focus should be on the first aspect i.e. ‘pre’ disaster phase and preventive steps should be taken to mitigate the effects of disasters, he said. The Minister added that India is prone to natural disasters which calls for greater responsibilities and role to be played by us. Shri Rijiju said that he has been designated as ‘Asia Champion for Disaster Risk Reduction’ by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), which conveyed the importance of India in the field of disaster management. It also conveys the message about the proactive and leadership role that India should play in disaster management, he said. 

 

The Minister said that MHA has always responded to the needs arising out of disasters. He added that National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is one of the largest forces dedicated towards the cause of disaster management. Commenting on the role of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), he said this is a professionally-governed organisation and playing an important role. Speaking about the other aspects related to disaster management, Shri Rijiju said that issue of lack of coordination during disaster should be addressed and states should give priority & allocate adequate funds for disaster management. We need to look at disaster management in a more professional manner, the Minister said. 

The inaugural session was followed by a Technical Session, during which a presentation was given by Prof Santosh Kumar, NIDM, on the topic: ‘Disaster Management – A Glimpse’. The presentation was followed by a session on ‘Media and Disaster Management – Role & Responsibilities’. Shri Kamal Kishore, Member, NDMA chaired the session. Shri Rajiv Shukla, AIR and Dr V. Thiruppugazh, Joint Secretary, NDMA and Shri A Bharat Bhushan Babu, ADG (M&C), MHA participated in the session and shared their views on the subject. The session was followed by an interactive session with media persons present in the workshop. A film on NDMA, NIDM and NDRF was also screened during the session. 

Shri RK Jain, Member, NDMA, Smt. Rajni Sekhri Sibal, Additional Secretary, MHA, Shri Sanjay Kumar, Director General, NDRF and Shri BH Anil Kumar, Executive Director, NIDM, officers from MHA and representatives of media attended the workshop.

It was a long felt need to have an Empowered Body which shall deal with capacity building of women police personnel and provide adequate exposure in the core police functions for achieving absolute professionalism. NCWP has unfolded as a total solution for accomplishing this goal. The debut to augment this effort was made in 2002 by organizing the 1st edition of NCWP in New Delhi by BPR&D in collaboration with Delhi Police. Women Police personnel cutting across different ranks, from across states / UTs and CPOs enthusiastically participated in the conference to have their voices heard, which have been usually and traditionally dominated by the male members.

NCWP has been continuously working on strengthening and monitoring of mechanism to deal with sexual harassment in all the Police Organizations / CPOs by suggesting active ways and means. Sincere efforts have been made for issues related with gender sensitization for all police ranks, exclusive infrastructural development for women police like rest rooms, toilets, crèche etc., equal opportunities for women in career planning and other welfare measures like maternity and child care leave, police housing for women workforce etc.

                India has a robust visa regime to facilitate smooth entry, stay and movement of foreigners in India for legitimate purposes while ensuring the security of the country. During the last one year, the MHA has taken a series of steps to liberalize the visa process in India. Some of the major steps are described below: 

            The Electronic Visa Facility now covers practically all the countries of the world. Foreign nationals of 166 countries can now enjoy this facility at 26 airports and 05 seaports. The foreigner does not have to interact with any Indian official till his arrival at the immigration counter. The Bureau of Immigration (BoI) generally decides within 24-48 hours whether or not to grant an e-visa to a foreigner. The popularity of e-visa is sky rocketing. The number of foreigners who visited India on e-visa has gone up from 4.47 lakhs in 2015 to 17.00 lakhs in 2017. The figure for 2018 is 18.78 lakhs upto 30th October, 2018. 

            Two new categories of e-visa i.e. e-Conference & e-Medical Attendant visa have been introduced recently. E-visa is now available for five categories i.e. (i) Tourist, (ii) Business (iii) Medical (iv) Conference and (v) medical attendant. 

The local FRRO has been empowered now to extend duration of electronic visas beyond 60 days upto 90 days. Moreover, these e-visas can now be availed three times in one year against twice in a year earlier. 

For foreigners who are already in India and who require any consular/visa services like extension of visa, conversion of visa, exit permission or any of the total 27 visa-related services, an online e-FRRO facility has now been launched throughout the country. The foreigners do not have to physically visit the offices of FRROs/FROs. They can apply as well as receive consular/visa services online after making online payment. 

To promote cruise tourism immigration facilities have been provided at five major seaports where e-Landing Permits are granted to passengers for their onshore site-seeing. The condition of biometric enrollment for such tourists arriving at the ports of Mumbai, Cochin, Mormugao, Chennai & New Mangalore has also been suspended till December, 2020 to ensure faster immigration clearance so that cruise tourists can spend maximum time on shore. 

            Foreign nationals who fall sick during their stay in India can now avail medical treatment without converting their visa into Medical Visa. This would take care of sudden medical emergencies. 

            Allowing conversion of any category of visa of a foreign national who is married to an Indian citizen/Person of Indian Origin/OCI Cardholder into an Entry Visa at any point of time by the FRRO himself 

Facilities such as extension of employment and business visas for a period up to ten years within India as against five years at present; extension of visa of foreigners who are staying in India upto 15 years continuously and for 5 years at a time; permitting a foreign national who is already in India on Long Term Visa to attend international conferences/seminars/workshops without any specific permission from the FRRO concerned have also been extended. 

 FRROs have been delegated powers for various visa related services like Visa extension, Visa conversion, registration, exit permission, etc. These measures will help in expediting clearances for various visa related services to foreigners and cut their waiting time.

Foreigners require Restricted Area Permit/Protected Area Permit besides a proper visa to visit areas which have been declared as ""Restricted"" or ""Protected"" areas. In many cases such permits are granted only after a Prior Reference is made by the concerned State/UT Govt. to the MHA. This takes time and creates another entry barrier for a foreigner. The MHA has now rationalized issuance of such permits. Prior Clearance of the MHA for grant of Protected Area Permit (PAP) and Restricted Area Permit (RAP) to foreigners in the following three major areas has been dispensed with : 

➢ Foreigners intending to visit a place covered under the PAP/RAP regime for activities 

  other than tourism on a visa other than Tourist Visa; 

➢ Foreigners visiting a place for tourism purpose which is not opened for tourism; 

➢ Individual foreign tourists.

 Accordingly, the State Government concerned or the FRROs can now take decision locally and grant PAP or RAP to such foreigners immediately. 

               Earlier, foreigners visiting Andaman & Nicobar Islands required a visa as well as an RAP. With a view to promote flow of tourism and investment, 30 islands of Andaman & Nicobar have been excluded from the RAP regime notified under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963. Foreigners will also be allowed to visit 11 uninhabited islands, to be notified by Andaman & Nicobar Islands Admn., only for day trips without any RAP. Requirement of registration by foreigners visiting these islands has also been dispensed with. 

Provisions relating to grant of intern visa have been liberalized with a view to attract more foreigners for internship in India which will be beneficial to Indian organizations. Intern Visa is now available at any time during the course of study. Further, minimum remuneration requirement for grant of intern visa for internship in a company has been reduced from Rs.7.80 lakhs to Rs.3.60 lakhs per annum. 

With a view to enhance transparency and speed in processing of grant of event clearance for international conferences/seminars/workshops, an e-Event Clearance Module has been rolled out in April, 2018. Faster conference clearance would result into faster visa issuance for the foreigners intending to attend such conference.

The Cabinet observed two-minute silence in his memory and passed a condolence resolution. The text of resolution is as follows:

“Shri Ananthkumar was born on 22nd July, 1959 in Bengaluru. He earned his Bachelor's Degree in English literature from Karnataka University in Hubballi and LLB Degree from JSS Law College, Karnataka University.

Shri Anantkumar started his public activities as a student activist. Subsequently, he became a member of the BJP and was the Organising Secretary of the Party's Karnataka Unit. Later on, he became the President of the Party in Karnataka. It was under his stewardship that Party expanded in the State of Karnataka and eventually formed the Government of its own. He was the National General Secretary of the Party and a Member Secretary of its Parliamentary Board. He was amongst key strategists of the Party.

 In 1996, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Bengaluru South for the first time. In his subsequent term as an MP in 1998, he became the youngest minister in the Vajpayee Cabinet and was appointed the Minister for Civil Aviation. He continued to represent the prestigious Bengaluru South Lok Sabha Constituency till date, for the 6th time.

In his long political career, he had earlier held the portfolios of Union Minister of Tourism; Culture, Youth Affairs and Sports; Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation; Rural Development. He had also been Chairman and member of several Parliamentary Committees.

Shri Ananthkumar was an active social worker and was involved through his NGOs in undertaking many social service projects such as providing nutritious mid-day meal to under-privileged school children with Government support, running a mobile unit fitted with educational gadgets covering different schools situated in slums of Bengaluru, adoption of Government schools to provide drinking water and other facilities and running vocational training programmes for under-privileged, especially girls and women. He also launched an initiative called 'Green Bengaluru 1:1', which aims to increase the green cover in Bengaluru by planting one crore saplings for taking 'Tree-to-Person' ratio to at least one in Bengaluru. This initiative has seen regular planting and nurturing drives.

The Cabinet places on record its appreciation of Shri Ananthkumar's services to the Nation in different capacities. The Cabinet also expresses its deep sense of grief on his death. In his untimely demise, the Nation has lost an experienced leader. On behalf of the entire Nation, the Cabinet extends its heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family”.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is conducting a basic training programme at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru. The six-day training programme, aimed at enhancing the preparedness of Airport Emergency Handlers (AEHs) to respond to CBRN emergencies at the airports, started today. CBRN emergencies pertain to threats emanating due to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear material.

The training programme is being conducted in collaboration with the Airport Authority of India (AAI), Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

Handling CBRN emergencies need specialised skills and efforts. In fact, even a small CBRN related event can cause panic among people at the airports. This training programme will improve the CBRN safety at our airports by enabling the AEHs to handle any CBRN emergency.

The programme consists of lectures as well as field training, including live demonstrations of detection and decontamination including use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Besides equipping the AEHs to handle CBRN emergencies, the training programme will also enable them to provide medical first aid and initial psycho-social support.

Experts from stakeholder departments such as Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), INMAS, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) will train the participants.

A total of 50 participants representing various agencies responsible for operation and maintenance of the airport will be trained on various aspects of CBRN emergencies. Another 150 working level staff will be sensitized on the subject in a half day module.

This is the tenth in a series of such programmes being conducted at airports across the country to enable AEHs to respond suitably till the arrival of specialised response teams. Nine batches have already been trained - one each in Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Varanasi, Patna, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Chandigarh and Raipur.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh today reviewed progress of ongoing projects being executed by the Land Ports Authority of India and the Border Management Division under the Ministry of Home Affairs. There was very good progress and Integrated Check Posts (ICPs) at five border crossing points out of seven approved projects have been completed. Terminals for smooth movement of goods and people at ICP Raxaul and ICP Jogbani on India-Nepal Border, ICP Petrapole and ICP Agartala on India-Bangladesh Border and ICP Attari on India–Pakistan Border have been made functional.  At each ICP, facilities have been constructed for customs clearance, Immigration, warehouses for storage of goods, approach roads and terminal buildings to adequately handle import and export of goods and entry and exit of people. Work on ICP Moreh on India-Myanmar Border and ICP Dawki on India-Bangladesh Border is in advanced stage of completion. The total approved expenditure for the seven ICPs is more than Rupees 700 crores.

Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh expressed satisfaction at the progress of work and directed the officials to complete the pending works at an early date.  He also directed the officials to take up construction of additional 13 ICPs at Hili, Jaigaon, Ghojadanga, Mahadipur, Changrabandha, Fulbari, Rupaidiha, Kawrpuichhuah, Panitanki, Sutarkandi, Sunauli, Banbasa and Bhithamore and Passenger Terminal at Petrapole.

Under the Border Management Division, projects have been taken up for construction of 18 Coastal BOPs in Gujarat and improvement of Border Floodlighting in Punjab and Rajasthan. Some Floating BOPs have also been approved in Gujarat and West Bengal. Some projects which have been pending due to issues related to acquisition of land have resumed following Shri Rajnath Singh’s letters to Governments of West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Meghalaya, Tripura and Bihar.

Projects under the Border Area Development Programme (BADP) to improve road and mobile connectivity in the border villages as well as imparting skills to the people living there have also made good progress. To improve coastal security, 121 Coastal Police Stations have been operationalised, 30 jetties have been constructed and Biometric Cards have been issued to 18.5 lakh fishermen. Shri Rajnath Singh expressed satisfaction that the newly established National Academy of Coastal Policing has started functioning at Okha, Gujarat.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Agreement between India and Morocco on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters.

 

Benefits:

The Agreement will provide a broad legal framework for bilateral cooperation between India and Morocco in investigation and prosecution of crime, tracing, restraint, forfeiture or confiscation or proceeds and instruments of crime. It aims to increase effectiveness in investigation and prosecution of crime, and in providing the necessary peaceful ambience which is a pre-requisite for the development of society as a whole. It will further be instrumental in gaining better inputs and insights in the modus operandi of organized criminals and terrorists, which in turn can be used to fine-tune policy decisions in the field of Internal Security.

                Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State (I/C) of Housing  and Urban Affairs  has said that the flagship missions of his Ministry are anchored in the ideals of sustainability.  He was delivering the inaugural address at the day-long conference “CONCREATECH- Sustain to Gain” organized by the Cement Manufacturers Association, here today. He said, today the Swachhata movement has become a “Jan Andolan” with unprecedented citizen participation and behavioral change towards cleanliness.  Shri Puri informed the gathering that the Swachh Survekshan shows that we have achieved complete sanitation and the eradication of open defecation (UDF) in urban areas of 19 states and UTs, and this movement only keeps growing. He said, the theme – Sustain to Gain – reflects the necessities that are driving conversations and cooperation worldwide.

Pointing out that we can no longer think of socio-economic development in isolation from the environment, Shri Puri emphasized that growth cannot be devoid of climate action – we have to get over this zero-sum mindset which pits development against our responsibility towards the climate.

Pointing out that India has played an important role in shaping the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Minister noted that it is no surprise that the Country’s national development goals are mirrored in the SDGs. “India has been effectively committed to achieving the SDGs even before they were fully crystallized”, he said.

Dwelling on the Swachh Bharat Mission, Shri Puri expressed his satisfaction that under this mission, over 60 lakh household toilets and over 4 lakh community toilets have been built in urban areas and we are well on our way to achieving the target of 67 lakh toilets before October 2019. “However, it is also important to remember that achieving physical targets is one thing, but to achieve the vision of an open-defecation-free India, we have focused on sustained behavioral changes through conventional as well as innovative means”, he said.

“Under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), over 2400 projects worth Rs. 74,000 crores that are targeted towards improved water supply, sewerage, and drainage have been approved under the State Annual Action Plans for the period 2015-2020”, the Minister said. Shri Puri informed the audience that “we have also introduced the AMRUT Technology Challenge, which addresses the need for non-essential human entry for cleaning of sewers and septic tanks”. “SMART Cities are also developing smart, sustainable and resilient sanitation systems through public private partnership” he added.

“Under PMAY, the government is building affordable homes for poor people migrating to urban centres, allowing them to live a life of dignity. From categorizing housing under infrastructure, to low taxation rates under the Goods and Services Tax; from credit-linked incentives to providing subsidies, the government has created an enabling environment for the real estate sector, making it one of the most lucrative investment opportunities” Shri Puri said. “Moreover, the government is committed towards in-situ development of slums ensuring residents of such localities won’t be forcibly evicted from their homes under the garb of upliftment”, he added .

Noting that the target under PMAY (U) is to build 1.1 crore homes by 2022, Shri Puri expressed his pleasure that construction of over 63 lakh houses has already sanctioned. “I am confident by the middle of 2019, we would have sanctioned the remaining 50 lakh”, he said. “What is most important about this mission is that each home will be built under the highest standards of sustainability. Each home that we construct will be green and resilient” he added.

Speaking on other important Scheme of the Government for which MoHUA is responsible, Shri Puri said it is the creation of about 100 Smart Cities in the country.  “The Smart Cities Mission is in convergence with other infrastructure projects such as AMRUT, PMAY and the Swachh Bharat Mission”, the minister said. He informed that under the Smart Cities Mission, a number of Smart Road projects, heritage conservation, water front development and public space development have been completed in various cities.

Shri Puri  congratulated the Indian Cement Industry for being the second largest cement producing country in the world, with cement capacity of over 500 million tonnes and production, accounting for about 8 per cent of the global installed capacity.

                BEML, a public sector undertaking of the Government has bagged a contract for Rs.3,015 crore for Mumbai Metro Corridor. Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs has contributed to this one of the biggest success stories under Make in India initiatives of the Government. The order includes manufacturing of 378 Metro cars (63 Metro trains of 6 cars each) for Mumbai Metro Corridor 2A, 2B & 7. BEML was the lowest among seven bidders which included 6 internationally renowned bidders. The state of art, driverless trains shall be manufactured indigenously by M/S BEML. Supply of trains will begin from October 2020 and completed by December 2022. BEML has earlier also supplied metro coaches in smaller numbers but along with an international player as a JV partner. It has now sub-contracted M/s Hitachi only for some designs. The coaches will be manufactured in the BEML factory at Bengaluru. Some of the salient features are:

 

Ø Total Trains: 63

Ø Coaches per Train: 6

Ø Fully Air Conditioned

Ø Driverless train compatibility

Ø Energy friendly with regenerative braking system. Train to operate on 25 KV AC traction.

Ø Equipped with CCTV surveillance for passenger security and real-time track monitoring.

Ø Carrying capacity of 300 passengers in each coach.

Evolution of metro rail in India is indeed a breath-taking story. Today about 536 kms of metro lines are operational in 10 different cities namely, Delhi & NCR (317 km), Bangalore,Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Jaipur, Kochi, Lucknow, Mumbai and Gurugram. In addition, more than 650 kms of metro rail projects are under construction in Delhi & NCR, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Chennai, Kochi, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Nagpur, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Pune, Bhopal and Indore. Many more cities are also planning metro rail system. 

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has made concerted efforts for indigenisation of metro rail systems in the country. For this, it has standardized the specifications for metro rolling-stock, signalling, telecom, electrical and civil components. It has also adopted the Public Procurement Order, Make in India (PPO/MII) 2017, for metro rail systems. MoHUA has also stipulated that minimum 75% of the coaches procured against any tender have to be manufactured in India. Alstom, Bombardier, BEML, and Titagarh have setup manufacturing units in India. As a result of the “Make in India” initiatives, the last two big procurement orders for rolling stock in India, floated on international competitive bidding model, have gone to Indian companies. This has also resulted in substantial reduction in cost. 

This is one of the largest orders of metro rail coaches in the recent times. BEML has bagged this contract purely on its own competence. The award price per coach which is less than Rs.8.00 Crs (including spares, design, installation, and commissioning) is record lowest in recent times. Seven International manufacturers of rolling stock viz. Alstom, Bombardier, CAF, CRRC, Titagarh, BEML, Hyundai Rotem, participated in the bid. The supply of coaches will start from end of 2020 and will be completed in about two years’ time. The project is being assisted by Asian Development Bank and the procurement has been done following their guidelines and concurrence.

Metro line 2A will connect Dahisar to DN Nagar in Mumbai. Metro line 2B will run further from DN Nagar to Mankhurd via Bandra, and Metro line 7 from Dahisar to Andheri (east).

                Shri Hardeep S. Puri, Minister of State (I/C) of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), has stated that the vision and strategy of ensuring access to clean drinking water and to provide sanitation and hygiene related services to everyone, is finding expression in vigorous implementation of critical flagship programs: Swachh Bharat and AMRUT”, launched by the MoHUA, and added that “we are achieving significant success in both these missions”. He was addressing “National Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Innovation Summit 2018” organised by National Institute of Urban Affairs(NIUA) here today. Representatives from various states, USAID, and domain experts were present at the Summit.

Addressing the participants, the Minister pointed out that it is an undisputable fact that poor sanitation, lack of clean drinking water, and lack of hygiene in the household and the community creates an adverse impact on health, as well as economic losses. “The inadequacy of facilities is particularly visible with regard to the inhabitants of slums and informal settlements”, he said. The Ministry is driven by the goal to provide adequate urban infrastructure and services that can ensure the development of healthy Indian cities where all our population can lead productive lives, he added. Stating that urbanization is now here to stay and that we need to plan for it, the Minister said that Indian cities are growing rapidly and providing an opportunity for growth of the economy as well as social mobility and poverty alleviation. 

Shri Puri informed that to achieve the vision of an open-defecation-free India, we have focused on sustained behavioural changes through conventional as well as innovative means. Under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), over 2400 projects worth Rs. 74,000 crores that are targeted towards improved water supply, sewerage, and drainage have been approved under the State Annual Action Plans for the period 2015-2020. He further informed that “AMRUT Technology Challenge” has been launched which addresses the need for non-essential human entry for cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. “These programs are also contributing to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the United Nations, particularly the SDG 6 – 'Ensure access and sanitation for all by 2030' –through collective efforts and innovative approaches”, Shri Puri noted.

The Government is providing various platforms to display, promote and recognize innovations happening across the nation and the youth is coming forward with great ideas and entrepreneurship models in WASH and other areas, through the Atal Innovation Mission, Start-up India, and the 'Swachhathon' – all organized to promote innovation and innovators, he said and added that while we continue in our endeavor to successfully implement new solutions at the pilot scale, our ultimate goal must be to spread these solutions to the entire country. He appreciated and acknowledged the significance of what the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) is trying to do with their project 'Innovation Hub for Urban WASH Solutions' and noted that this is the only way that innovative WASH solutions can have the desired transformational impact by improving the lives of our people.

The Summit deliberated on various aspects and role of innovations to make transformational impact in urban WASH sector.

            The Government has released the Standard Operating Procedures(SOPs) for Cleaning of Sewers and Septic Tanks for use by field staff who respond to sanitary sewer overflows or spills, in order to ensure their safety and prevent critical accidents. Making the announcement during the celebration of the World toilet Day here today, Shri Ramdas Athawale, Minister of state for Social Justice and Empowerment felicitated the winners of the Technology Challenge under the AMRUT Mission and expressed confidence that innovative solutions emerging from initiatives such as this would enable safer management of human waste, without endangering human life. The workshop on urban sanitation is aimed at addressing challenges in the urban sanitation space thereby enable participating states and cities in proactively implementing viable, affordable and sustainable sanitation solutions for a Swachh Bharat.  Shri Anil Baijal, Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary, M/O Housing and Urban Affairs and more than 500 dignitaries comprising Municipal Commissioners and senior officers from AMRUT cities, and other stakeholders working in the area of urban sanitation attended the workshop.

 

            Speaking on the occasion, Shri Baijal said that the feature of locating public toilets on Google Maps had the potential to solve a major issue that citizens face today – that of finding toilets that are clean, functional and usable. While he acknowledged that the condition of several community and public toilets provide scope for improvement, he was glad to note that there are 33,000+ toilets across 800+ cities already LIVE and open to reviews from citizens on Google Maps. Shri Baijal appreciated the SBM Toilet Monitoring Tool Dashboard launched by the Ministry that would serve as a governance and monitoring tool for Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) by providing them with the true picture of the condition of public toilets in their area and help them take corrective action. 

 

            Shri  Durga Shankar  Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA, touched upon the achievements of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) so far. He mentioned that 19 states and UTs are already Open Defecation Free (ODF) in their urban areas, and more than 94% of towns and cities already ODF. This has been achieved by the construction of nearly 60.53 lakh Individual Household Toilets (against Mission target of 66 lakhs; i.e. 91.7% constructed and under construction against target), and 4.7 lakh seats of community / public toilets (against Mission target of 5.07 lakh seats; i.e. 92.7% constructed and under construction against target) under the Mission. In the area of solid waste management, approximately, 40% of the total waste generated in the country is being processed, and 52% of wards are practising source segregation. 

 

            The book of case studies titled ‘Transforming Urban Landscapes of India: Success Stories on Sanitation’ which documents good practices on sanitation from across the country was also released on the occasion. Simultaneously, a document detailing the enabling factors that have contributed to the success of SBM-U titled ‘Cleaning Urban India’ and the ‘Advisory on Public and Community Toilets’ focusing on an end-to-end approach for planning, designing, construction, operation and maintenance, and upgradation of public and community facilities and related infrastructure and a coffee table book highlighting activities undertaken in urban areas during the Swachhata hi Seva campaign (15 September – 2 October 2018) were also released by the Ministry. 

 

            An exhibition showcasing innovations in sanitation from across the country such as special toilets for women, senior citizens and third gender, 4-in- 1 portable urinals for men, on-site faecal sludge, and septage management technologies, and the like was also organized on the sidelines of the event. 

 

            The rest of the day had stakeholders discussing sustainable technology options for faecal sludge & septage management with presentations from States such as Punjab, Odisha, Chhatisgarh, Maharasthra, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana. Participants also engaged in discussions on innovations in the sanitation space and looked at exploring private sector participation in urban sanitation with panel representatives from organizations such as USAID, Water Health and CDD Society.

                Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State (I/C) of Housing and Urban Affairs, has said that in this new era OF RERA, we are witnessing positive transformative changes in the industry. “As we are in the 2nd year of the implementation of RERA, I am happy to note all the States/UTs have notified Rules under RERA except for 6 North Eastern States and the state of West Bengal”, he said. The Minister was delivering the inaugural address at the 3rd regional workshop on “RERA-a new era of transparency and accountability in Real Estate—2 years of implementation and Way Ahead” here today.

Lt. Governor of Delhi Shri Anil Baijal, Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary, M/o Housing and Urban Affairs, various stakeholders, home-buyers, representatives of the developer’s association, Chairpersons and senior functionaries of the Authorities and Appellate Tribunals, senior officers from the State Governments of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh and Delhi, were present on the occasion.

Shri Puri informed the gathering that recently, a separate deliberation with all the north-eastern states was organized by his Ministry, wherein all the clarifications were given. He hoped that RERA will be implemented in all the states of north eastern region very soon. Stating that it was a proud moment for all of us that India has climbed another 23 points in the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business Index” to 77th place, becoming the top ranked country in South Asia for the first time, Shri Puri pointed out that “the biggest gain was in construction permit, where India climbed from 181st ranks to 52nd place on the back of targeted government effort to remove hurdles.” “India reduced the number of procedures and time required to obtain a building permit by implementing an online system that has streamlined the process at the Municipality of New Delhi and Municipality of Greater Mumbai”, he added.

Shri Puri pointed out that till the year 2016, there was no regulator for real estate and construction sector, which is the largest employer after agriculture and housing. He said, in a landmark move, the central government, in the form of RERA, gave the real estate sector its first regulator w.e.f. from 1st May, 2016. 

Shri Puri highlighted that to bring uniformity, professionalism, and standardization in the real estate sector, RERA provides for mandatory registration of Agents and Projects. “So far 33,750 projects and 26,018 Agents have been registered pan India”, he informed. “Maharashtra has the highest number of project and agent registration. In Maharashtra, total 18,392 projects and 17,188 Agents have been registered”, he pointed out.

The Minister emphasised that the full benefits of RERA would be realized only when the provisions of RERA are implemented in letter and spirit. The Minister said, all the stakeholders need to make aware about the powers and other provisions of RERA, as the Act also mandates under section 33 that the Authority shall take suitable measures for the promotion of advocacy, creating awareness and imparting training about laws relating to real estate sector and policies.

Pointed out that a committee was constituted by the Government of Uttar Pradesh under chairpersonship of Secretary, MOHUA to address the issues of home buyers and affected parties of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway, Shri Puri said the recommendations of the Committee are aimed at providing solution to the completion of homes in the stalled projects of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway. “None of the recommendations put any additional burden on the homebuyers, rather they will smoothen completion of the projects to deliver possession to home buyers at the earliest”, he said.

                Shri K.J. Alphons, Union Minister of State for Tourism (I/C) has said that Indian movie industry has made millions of people happy, not only in India but also in other parts of the world.  Movies can be transformative. Nowhere else in the world have we seen feature films on sanitary pads or toilets made. He was addressing the valedictory ceremony of 49th International Film Festival of India in Panaji, Goa today November 28, 2018.

Drawing a parallel between tourism and movies, Shri Alphons said that tourism and movie industry are closely related, since they have the single objective of bringing people close together and making them happy. In a country where many people have sacrificed their lives for their nation, there is plenty of subject matter for amazing realistic movies, he added.

Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore, Union Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting (I/C) said, through a video message, that cinema knows no language and that the 49th International Film Festival of India in Goa proves just that. “Films inspire all of us, they entertain us, they make us strive and above all, they connect us all as human beings”, he added.  

Smt. Mridula Sinha, Governor of Goa; Shri Shripad Naik, Union Minister of State for AYUSH (I/C); Shri VP Singh Badnore, Governor of Punjab; Shri Vijay Sardesai, Minister for Town and Country Planning, Goa; Shri Manoj Tiwari, Member of Parliament; Shri Amit Khare, Secretary, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting; Shri Dharmendra Sharma, Chief Secretary of Goa; and other officials were present on the occasion.

Many renowned film personalities such as IFFI 2018 Lifetime Achievement Awardee Dan Wolman, Anil Kapoor, Arbaaz Khan (son of master screenwriter Salim Khan), Indian Panorama Jury Chief Rahul Rawail, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and Kabir Bedi too attended the closing ceremony.

Stating that the 49th edition has been a great success, Shri Khare said that film bazaar has elicited response from various countries across the world. He said that Israel has been the focus country and Jharkhand the state focus. Noting that the preparations for the golden jubilee celebration of the festival next year has begun, the Secretary said that the government would like to showcase the film culture of each and every region of the country and trace the history of IFFI from the 1st to the 49th. He added that the facilities at Goa would be enhanced, given the overwhelming response received from film-lovers. He said that this is being done, so tha the 50th IFFI can have many more delegates than this year.

Shri Vijay Sardesai, Minister for Town and Country Planning, Goa said that regional cinema has to find a place in national cinema. Film makers should be encouraged to come forward to know Goan way of life, he added.

The nine day long festival of quality cinema concludes with the world premier of German film ‘Sealed Lips’. Various prestigious awards including Golden Peacock, Silver Peacock, Lifetime Achievement Award were conferred during the star-studded ceremony.

On the occasion, the IFFI Special Award has been conferred to Salim Khan for his Lifetime contribution to Cinema. Arbaaz Khan, son of Salim Khan, received the award on behalf of his father. Salim Khan revolutionized Indian cinema in the 1970s, transforming and reinventing the Bollywood formula, pioneering the Bollywood blockbuster format, and pioneering genres such as the masala film and the Dacoit Western. Salim Khan was also responsible for creating the ""angry young man"" character archetype and launching Amitabh Bachchan's career.

Ukrainian film Donbass, directed by Sergei Loznitsa bagged the award for Best Film in IFFI 2018. The award comes with the Golden Peacock trophy, certificate and a cash prize amount of Rs. 40,00,000, shared equally between the Director and the Producer.

Donbass tells the story of a hybrid war taking place in a region of Eastern Ukraine, involving an open armed conflict alongside killings and robberies perpetrated on a mass scale by separatist gangs. In Donbass, war is called peace and propaganda is uttered as truth. A journey through Donbass unfolds as a series of curious adventures. This is not just a tale of one region or a political system; it is about a world lost in post-truth and fake identities.

The Best Director award was given to Lijo Jose Pellissery for the film ‘Ee. Ma. Yau.’, who bagged the Silver Peacock Trophy and a cash prize of Rs. 15,00,000.

Both received the Silver Peacock Trophy and cash Prize of Rs 10,00,000 each.

‘Ee. Ma. Yau.’ is a stunning satire on death and how it affects human lives. Chemban Vinod plays the role of ‘Eeshi’, the son who tries to arrange a worthy funeral for his father but is met with unpredictable obstacles and reactions from different quarters. ‘When the Trees Fall’ is the story of the 5 years old rebellious girl Vitka, her teenage cousin Larysa and her boyfriend Sear. The film describes the gross poverty, ignorance and racism of rural Ukraine and takes place in the extraordinary physical ugliness of the nearest city. Anastasiia Pustovit plays the role of Larysa in the film.

Special Jury award, which carries the Silver Peacock Award and a cash prize of Rs. 15,00,000, was awarded to Milko Lazarov for his Yakut movie ‘Aga’. Aga’ tells the story of Sedna and Nanook, an elderly couple from Yakutia, and the particular challenges in their life in the midst of a frigid landscape. Alberto Monteras II received the Centenary award for ‘Best Debut Feature Film of a Director’ for his Filipino Movie ‘Respeto’. The winner received Silver Peacock, a certificate and a cash prize of Rs. 10 lakh. The movies ‘To Let’ and ‘Volcano’ got special mention under this category.

Receiving the award, Praveen Morchhale said that he dedicates the award to the people of Ladakh. ‘Los Silencios’, the Portuguese, Spanish movie directed by Beatriz Seigner, got the special mention under ICFT-UNESCO Gandhi medal category.

                Watching a film at IFFI may take only a little bit of your time in the form of registration, ticket booking and standing in a queue. But when you enter the theatre and see those handpicked movies from around the world, have you ever thought of the time and effort the film makers have put in making these films a reality? Two national film award winners who came together for a press conference at the 49th International Film Festival of India today in Panaji, Goa had a lot to say on this topic. ‘Sinjar’ and ‘Nagarkirtan’ are two movies that came to IFFI with the glory of national film award. When Pampally, Director of ‘Sinjar’ and Riddhi Sen, lead actor of ‘Nagarkirtan’ poured their hearts out about their hard-made films, it became another proclamation about the power of true content. 

Pampally, who bagged the award for the Best Debut Director at the 65th National Film Awards, said that his story shows how international terrorism affects the life of an ordinary fisherman in Lakshadweep. “When terrorist attacks and conflicts happen around the world, we never thought how such incidents affect ordinary, uneducated people. This film tries to portray the hardships of such people”, he said. 



The distant location of Kavaratti Islands, the limited transportation facilities to mainland and the need for sanctions due to it being a union territory posed much difficulty in the production process, he added. He also explained the challenges he faced while doing a film in the local dialect of Jasari which lacks any script or grammar. “The script was first written in Malayalam and with the help of local youth, it was converted to the local spoken language. The actors were also given some training for pronouncing this dialect. These exercises turned it into a Himalayan task”, said Pampally. 

National Film award winner for Best Actor, Riddhi Sen said that playing the character of a transgender in ‘Nagarkirtan’ was a life changing experience for him. “The movie is about a transgender person who has a woman trapped inside a man’s body. The transformational part from a man to a transgender individual was very difficult. The hardest thing was to capture the physicality of a woman and to maintain the fine line”, he said. The film is a small effort to plunge into the darkness and help those people who are not accepted the way they are. He expressed hope that this film will change the attitude of at least one percent of society towards the third gender. 



Recalling the constraints faced by Director Kaushik Ganguly in making the movie, Riddhi Sen said that people in India continue to be afraid to produce a movie on third gender. The director approached many producers and finally Acropolis Films agreed to produce it. Riddhi Sen also dedicated the film to those transgender people in our country who are struggling every day, stuck in identity crisis. He further added that the success of the film is a tribute to the struggles of the transgender community.

                Indian Cinema is really the standard bearer for us, I don’t think US cinema always rises to the standards of values upheld by Indian Cinema; this is very inspiring for us.  These were the words of Matthew Wilder, the director of ‘Regarding the Case of Joan of Arc’, the mid-festival film at International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa, while addressing a press conference today at IFFI 2018.



Actor Christopher Matthew Cook was also present on this occasion. The film had its World Premiere on November 24, 2018 at Kala Academy, Panjim, during the 49th edition of IFFI. 

Speaking about the genesis of his film, Wilder said, “The Trial of the Joan of Arc is a timeless story and I chanced upon it when it came in news recently due to incidents of shooting in school. In this film, the director tries to depict a future America where domestic terrorism and ISIS become merged into a single institution.  The dialogues in the movie are especially true in today’s political scenario in USA. The protagonist of the movie is a supporter of white nationalism. The film intends to show a character which possesses courage, is unable to be moved but at the same time it supports horrifying values. Nicole got nothing more than six days to gear up for this very heavy role, as the actor who was originally meant to play that role backed out at the last moment. That Nicole got this film is an incredible thing because the lead actor is almost in every scene. She fits the role perfectly; it is as if the film has been written for her. I am overwhelmed by the response that the movie received at the world premiere yesterday at IFFI”.  

Narrating his experience of working in the film, Christopher Matthew Cook said that the collaboration with Matthew and Nicole was great.

                ICFT is involved in major film festivals all over the world but Goa is the master-piece of all Film Festivals, said Mr. Georges Dupont, DG, International Council for Film Television and Audiovisual Communication (ICFT) and jury member of the ICFT UNESCO Gandhi Medal at IFFI. ICFT is trying hard to get into festivals like Cannes in order to get space for young film-makers  he added.  Mr. Dupont  was addressing the media along with Mr. Eric Falt, Director of UNESCO and Regional Representative for India & neighbouring countries on the sidelines of the 49th International Film Festival of India in Goa today.

Elaborating on the process of selection, Mr Dupont said that criteria for selecting films to the ICFT UNESCO Gandhi Medal Section are difficult  because they have to meet UNESCO's  themes of peace,  unity and  international co-operation,  and movies come from different origins and cultures. “Film critics of international repute are involved in the selection process. Movies are shortlisted in India and taken to Paris for jury to watch. Then they are distributed to all the members via internet. The members do their homework as per their convenience and discuss their notes to arrive at a decision. The criteria for selection of movies for  the Medal this year  have been broadened. This year Silver Prize will be given as we are celebrating the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi”, he said.



Discussing the future prospects of  films and film-making, Mr Dupont said ICFT is trying to get youth involved in these festivals as they are the future of cinema. UNESCO is also educating youth about media in the wake of issues like fake news.

Mr. Eric Falt,  Director, UNESCO said UNESCO supports culture in all its forms and there is a long-standing love affair between cinema and the international  organisation. “UNESCO is involved in many cultural programmes in India. The ICFT UNESCO Gandhi Medal eschews the value of Peace, Unity and International Co-operation. We are making efforts to prepare for the 50th anniversary of the festival next year and to bring ICFT and UNESCO closer”, he said.



Replying to a question, Mr. Eric Falt said that India has the most vibrant film industry than anywhere in the world. It makes UNESCO happy and proud to be associated with IFFI. Underlining the importance of dialogue in promoting peace, unity and international co-operation, Mr Falt said UNESCO is  promoting   discourse between international organisations and the  film industry to address various social and cultural issues

Three non-feature films ‘Bunkar: The Last of the Varanasi Weavers’, 'Nani Teri Morni' and 'Burning' were the topics of discussion.

In India, every family thinks it as a matter of great pride to have at least one Banarasi silk in their homes. Yet, those persons who weave these world famous Banarasi silks continue to toil in poverty. Satyaprakash Upadhyay, Director of ‘Bunkar: The Last of the Varanasi Weavers’ said that his film seeks answers to the question as to why the Banarasi sari weavers are struggling despite the popularity of  the valuable product of their hands.  “While doing research on the topic, it was revealed to us that most of the people are buying power-loom woven saris mistaking them  as hand-woven. .The common man don’t have any idea about the difference between hand-loom woven and power-loom products”, he said.  A lot of topics including the history of Banarasi silk, time taken to make one handloom product, GI marks, etc  are covered in the  film. Unless common man get sufficiently informed, he can’t contribute to the cause of handloom weavers, he further added. 



Producer of the film, Ms. Sapna Sharma, said if we don’t support handloom weavers by buying genuine Banarasi silk, the art will become extinct one day. 



Akashaditya Lama, Director of ‘Nani Teri Morni’ described his journey to Nagaland to explore the story of a seven year old child who swam across a river  to save a drowning grandmother. “The stories from our ancestors form the bedrock of our, thoughts, and they in turn create the persons we become. The main character in this film Mhonbeni Ezung who became the youngest recipient of National Bravery award for children in 2015,  was also inspired by such a story told by her grandmother  which prompted her act of bravery”, he said. He added that his perception about Nagaland changed a lot while shooting the film there. 



Journalist turned film maker Sanoj V. S., Director of ‘Burning’ said it is his obsession towards the holy city of Varanasi that prompted him to create such a film. The story shown from the perspective of two mothers depicts how women are subjected to social forces like patriarchy, religion and caste, he said.

Jharkhand has one of the most progressive film policies in India, said Dr. Sunil Kumar Barnwal, Principal Secretary to Chief Minister and Secretary, Department of Information and Public Relations, Government of Jharkhand. With the new film policy unveiled in 2015, the state is witnessing a rush of film makers from all over India, especially regional languages, he said. Dr. Barnwal was addressing a press conference at the 49th International Film Festival of India today November 25, 2018 here in Panaji, Goa. Jharkhand has been chosen as the State in Focus at IFFI this year. This is the first time that IFFI has started a State Focus segment. 



Bestowed with rich mineral deposits ranging from coal to gold, the state is known as the mineral capital of India, accounting for 40% of country’s mineral wealth. But the other aspects like hills, waterfalls, water dams, forests, wildlife and religious places in Jharkhand which have rich potential are not yet explored, the Secretary pointed out. “The state has 30% of geographical area covered by dense forests. There are many scenic water falls ranging from 2 metres to several feet high,” he said. Through the film policy, the state targets to attract the attention of people to the film industry and invites them to come, see and explore the embedded treasure of Jharkhand, he added. 

The Secretary also explained the features of Jharkhand’s film policy, such as incentives and subsidies for films shot in Jharkhand, training for film technicians, tax exemptions and single window system for granting sanctions. According to the policy, films made in Jharkhand’s local languages will be given a grant of maximum 50% of the total costs and those made in Hindi, Bangla, Odia and other regional languages will be given a grant amounting to 25% of the total cost. Films shot in Jharkhand for more than half of the total shooting days of the film will get Rs. 1 crore and those shot for two-third of total days will get Rs. 2 crore. Once a grant is given for film making in the state, further films shot in Jharkhand will get more incentives, Dr. Barnwal elaborated. 



Replying to a question, the Secretary said that there are a good number of local artists available in Jharkhand who can rise to national level if given a chance. Many great filmmakers including Satyajit Ray used to capture Jharkhand on celluloid multiple times in the past. Other Bengali directors also used to explore the nature and scenic beauty of the state. But most of those film shots used to be done in isolation, without government support. The new film policy is expected to streamline such efforts and put film shooting under a single umbrella, thereby turning the state into a film shooting destination, he concluded.

The directors of the films in the World Panorama section of 49th IFFI-2018 - The Bra, A Sacred Gaucho, Phoenix, Autsajder and Nervous Translation addressed the media during the 49th International Film Festival of India, Goa today, November 24, 2018.

Veit Helmer, Director of the German film ‘The Bra’ said that communication with the audience is very important and it would be great to institutionalise a Q&A session with the audience after every movie screening. 



Quoting Alfred Hitchcock, Mr. Veit Helmer said that cinema should be about visual storytelling and that dialogue spoils the visual elements in that narration. “There is no need to think how one can talk to a universal audience. If you talk about something very personal, then everybody in the world will understand”, he further added. He also enquired about the possibilities of films from diverse places like Latin America and Europe getting commercially released in India. 

Mr. Joaquin Pedretti, Director of ‘A Sacred Gaucho’ said that his film is based on a popular hero who represents the poor people. He elaborated that the film has been given its particular structure based on its narrative. “It is so important for us to have the world premiere in IFFI because it is based on the symbolic tradition of India and Argentina, as we have the same type of archetypes”, he said. 



Narrating the characteristics of her film, Camilla Strom Henriksen, Director of Phoenix, said that it is a dark quiet film for grownups, children being the film’s main characters. It is about children who are forced to assume the responsibility as adults because the parents fail to do so. She pointed out that the theme of the film would resonate with many people even though the circumstances can be very different. Replying to a question on how to make a film that can connect to each and every person, she said that if the filmmaker is specific about what she does, she will reach the audience she is meant to reach. 



Adam Sikora, Director of Autsajder said that his movie is about a very difficult time in Poland. It's the story of a young man in 1980s and how he faces these problems. Ms. Dennese Victoria, Cinematographer of ‘Nervous translation’ said that it takes a while for the audience to adjust to a film’s language to understand what the film offers to you.

                The directors of feature films in Indian Panorama - ‘Sudani From Nigeria’, ‘To Let’ and ‘Abyakto’ addressed a press conference at the 49th International Film Festival of India here in Panaji today. Chezhiyan Ra, Director, ‘To Let’ said his personal experience while searching for a house in Chennai led to the making of this film. “Shifting of house seems to look like a small matter. But in real life there are so many emotional strings attached with the house we live. The film tries to portray all those emotions, quarrels and trauma associated with the searching of house within a deadline of 30 days”, the director said. 



Replying to a question, Chezhiyan said that the experience of working as a cinematographer along with great Tamil directors helped him a lot while creating a feature film. He further added that as a cinematographer, he experienced and experimented with the process of converting text into images. 

Sharing his experiences on filmmaking, Zakariya, Director of ‘Sudani from Nigeria’ said the story is about the bonding that ensues after a Sudanese player gets injured during a Sevens tournament in Kerala. Started initially as an independent project funded by friends, the team was fortunate to get two prominent producers from Malayalam film industry. The film, made on a low budget, was released in 128 theatres and successfully ran for more than 100 days, making it a box office success, he added. 



On his transition from a short film to a feature film maker, Shri Arjun Dutta, Director of 'Abyakto', said that it was the most enriching experience of his life. “Though the canvas of feature film is larger, the basic things remain the same. The home work and pre-production should be very strong. We need to be honest towards any film we make, be it the short film or the feature film. The approach towards both should be the same”, the Director elaborated.

                Goa, 24 November 2018

Cinema has, through the generations, captured the stories and creative inspirations of the filmmakers across the world. Though modern advancements have raised the bar on how films are made, it is the heart of the storyteller that still remains the true essence of the movie. This the panellists on Day 3 of the Open Forum agreed to be the crux of any film making endeavour.

In deliberating on ‘New Media opening new opportunities for the survival of the film industry’, David Shapiro, Uplifting Cinema Pvt. Ltd., from America said that it ‘is the heart that has spoken for thousands of years in theatre and drama and in film.’ He eloquently elaborated, “It’s the same heart that has pulsed through the veins of all these dramas.”

It’s not technology, he implored, but ‘what is in the heart’ that speaks. He finds that filmmakers have become so enamoured by the equipment and abilities of the special effects that ‘we’ve lost touch with what motivates people to watch a drama or presentation of art in the first place.’

He cited MTV in India as an example of wearing itself out in terms of content. “It became irrelevant to people’s lives and they tuned into things that made them smile or brought them insight or moved them in some way. That comes not from the cameras but from the heart.”

What counts he noted is how relevant the film is to the audience, what is the means of delivery to them, and what is the content communicated. He said, “No matter what the technology employed, there is a demographic to every audience in mind. Each project has to be tailored to the people you are speaking and that is completely separate from the way in which the film technology is used. You have to consider the means of delivery. Are you going to sell to video in demand like Netflix or a theatrical distribution?”

All the panellists agreed that content still holds a pivotal position in filmmaking. Vinod Ganatra, Chairman, Non-feature Film, IFFI 2018 expressed his concerns over the ‘yeh bhi leh loh’ culture of the current crop. He stated that emphasis was on the script in the old days, and shooting on celluloid meant careful selection of frames and shots. However digitisation has changed this.



He praised the transformation in film making over the years with young film makers making excellent movies. He recalled movies like Kharvas. He noted that short films are taking over the space, with even the duration of feature films getting shorter. This year they received an incredible 60 percent short film submission in all entries.

Making his debut at IFFI this year with his national award winning Sinjar, Pampally noted that the current advancements had definitely enhanced his journey. He has made 40 short films prior to this. While technology has made it easier for younger generations to make movies faster, there is a need he felt, to focus on the craft.

The short presentations were followed by a thought-provoking Q & A session. On being asked about the merits and demerits of new media, Shaji Karun, veteran filmmaker observed that digitilisation has enhanced the production process in terms of correction of images, reconstruction, many interpretations of the images can be manipulated. He spoke of movies like Avatar, Titanic that played heavily on VFX. But the downside he felt that movies that rely on this sort of technology lose their local touch.

When asked about the training required to get started Ganatra was quick to point the emergence of films schools mushrooming across the country. He felt that the faculty at times are inadequately trained and such institutions can reach out to independent filmmakers for support. Young filmmakers as a result of poor guidance lose hope and get frustrated with the whole process.



The event was hosted by N Shashidhara, Vice President, FSSI, South Region.

                Getting audience and funds are the two challenges before the documentary film makers and efforts are being made to overcome these problems said President, IDPA-Indian Documentary Producers Association, Ms. Usha Deshpande while talking to media at Media centre today. General Secretary, IDPA, Sanskar Desai was  also present.  



IDPA is endeavouring to provide exposure to documentary film-makers by organising film screenings, approaching film clubs for screening, negotiating with television channels for slots and participating in film festivals across the country.  It also organises competitions, workshops, seminars, masterclasses etc said Ms Deshpande.

Talking about Open   Forum which is going to be organised from 25-27  November for an hour starting at 1:30 during IFFI 2018, Deshpande said the themes will be: 


	Director’s take on biopics -  how much fact and how much fiction is there  in it? 
	Is technique over-riding content in today’s film-making and its impact.
	Cellphones are making each one of us into film-makers. Is this medium capable of graduating into way of making proper films? 


IDPA is a non-profit organisation established in 1956 and is India ’s single largest association of producers of documentaries, animation films, advertisement films and TV programmes. It is also facilitating the documentary makers by providing them with regular updates, standardised rate cards and by settling disputes. IDPA, as a Trust,  is part of the movement trying to take further legacy of documentary film makers. It has history of distinguished Presidents like Aruna Raje, Mike Pandey and Vijaya Mulay, informed Sanskar Desai.



 It has organised film festivals and instituted awards to deserving talent . IDPA has been associated with Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF) since its inception in 1988.  Currently, the membership of IDPA is open to any Indian filmmaker who makes documentaries, short commercials, corporate films and animation films. said Shri Desai.

Shri Desai told that  IDPA has a slot on DD National  on Saturdays at 10 am.  for documentaries. Screenings are also arranged in Mumbai and at other places to promote documentary movement.” IDPA has proposed and is persuading  for a dedicated channel  for documentaries. It also curates packages as per the needs of the various festivals.

It was a day dedicated for Jharkhand at the 49th International Film Festival of India. The scenic state bestowed with rugged hills, dense forests and mesmerising waterfalls got a much-needed impetus as a film shooting destination when dignitaries came together to celebrate ‘Jharkhand Day’ today at IFFI. 

Governor of Goa, Ms. Mridula Sinha; Shri Amar Kumar Bauri, Tourism Minister, Government of Jharkhand; Shri Amit Khare, Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting; Shri Sunil Kumar Barnwal, Secretary, Department of Information and Public Relations, Jharkhand; Shri Rahul Sharma, Secretary, Department of Tourism, Arts and Sports, Jharkhand; and Shri Sheo Pratap Singh. Tourism Secretary, Government of Goa participated in the special evening celebrations at hotel Cidade de Goa in Panaji this evening. Cultural troops from Jharkhand performed indigenous dance forms like Paika, Mardana Jhumar, Seraikela Chhau and Domkach accompanying the tunes of mandar and bansuri, showcasing the rich cultural legacy of the region. 









Film buffs thronging IFFI are getting a glimpse of the art, culture and cuisine of the Jharkhand through the multiple stalls promoting the State and its tourism initiatives. Handicrafts and cuisine of the state presented at the festival venues are attracting lots of people. A recipient of the Special Mention Award for promoting filmmaking in 2016, Jharkhand has rightfully been chosen as the State in Focus at IFFI this year. This is the first time that IFFI has started a State in Focus segment.  Six films either shot in Jharkhand under the Jharkhand Government Film Promotion Programme, or made in the language/dialect of the state are being screened during the Festival. The films are: ‘Begum Jaan’ (2017), ‘Ranchi Diaries’ (2017), ‘A Death in the Gunj’ (2016), ‘Mor Gaon Mor Desh’ (2018), ‘Ajab Singh ki Gajab Kahani’ (2017), and ‘Panchlait’ (2017). ‘MSD: The untold story’ (2016), the biopic on former Indian Cricket team captain M.S. Dhoni is also being  screened at Open Air Screening venue of IFFI.  

 

Jharkhand had been captured multiple times on celluloid by great filmmakers including Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak when it was part of Bihar. But after attaining statehood, this scenic landscape seems to have slightly gone off the movie location map for some time.  Under the able leadership of Chief Minister Raghubar Das, the state is all set to capture back its lost glory in the arena of cinema making. Since the Jharkhand State Film Policy released in 2015, the State is steadily moving ahead in creating awareness among film-makers about its potential for film-making. Through these focussed celebrations at IFFI, the state has been firmly put in limelight for both the film-making industry as well as tourism.    It   is hoped  these efforts will help create opportunities for the local artists and help convert the state  into a tourist destination. 


#Jharkhand is the State of focus at #IFFI2018. So what better day than #JharkhandDay to sample their culture and food right here from Goa!
So see you there! pic.twitter.com/ekrHFn0EzH

In a country where hardly any one  invests in environmental films, self-funding is the best option to produce quality films, said Shri S. Nalla Muthu, noted cinematographer and director of ‘The World's Most Famous Tiger’ - showcased in the Non Feature Film section at the 49th International Film Festival of India in  Goa.  He was addressing a joint press conference, along with directors of other non-feature films ‘Monitor’, ‘Midnight Run’ and ‘Na Bole Wo Haram’. 



Speaking about his film ‘The World's Most Famous Tiger’, Shri Nalla Muthu said that it is not meant for conservationists, biologists or people who know about wildlife. It is made for the common audience, and the story has been told from an Indian perspective by characterising and humanising animals. He also pointed out that since India does not have a dedicated channel or channel slot for environmental projects, we have to depend on channels like National Geographic and Discovery, which demands a quality product. ‘The World's Most Famous Tiger’ showcases the determination, bravery and confidence of Machli, the legendary Tiger Queen of Ranthambhore National Park.  Replying to a question on human-animal conflict, he said that co-existing is the only option forward. 

Shri Hari Viswanath, Director of the Non-Feature film ‘Monitor’ said that his film is intended to motivate women to stand up against sexual harassment at workplace. The entire film is shown from the point of view of a computer monitor. Based on true events, ‘Monitor’ narrates the life of an IT professional Rupa who struggles to balance her career and personal life in abusive work environment. ""This is a fictional film based on a true story of a friend of mine having been raped. I made this to inspire other women to face such incidents with courage."" He said instead of showing only the problems connected with sexual harassment at workplace, we should come up with some inspirational or motivational solutions. 



Ms. Remya Raj, director of ‘Midnight Run’ said her debut film is an attempt to portray the transformation of fear in a person. The film shows the ability of this universal emotion to trigger a complete transformation in people when they are afraid and when they are trying to make someone afraid. 



Narrating the story of how a news report on Peshawar school terrorist attack led him to a creative work, Shri Nitish Patankar, director of ‘Na Bole Wo Haram’, said that there is a common link between terrorism and all bad things. “People can use anything, be it caste, religion or God for their own interests. The film has been narrated in a simple way, using religion as a background and two children as symbols of human nature”, he added.

                The directors of the three non-feature films, Gyamo-Queen of the Mountains, Malai and Pamphlet, under the Indian Panorama Section of 49th International Film Festival of India, Goa addressed a press conference today.



Rajdeep Paul, the director of the Odia non-feature film Malai, started off by stating that children were the best actors. They are able to channelize their raw energy on to the screen. Once they get involved in the story, they create their own dialogues. During the shoot itself, one doesn’t really have to direct them, as they keep learning and improvising on their own, which is incredible.



The film Malai revolves around an impoverished little boy from a hinterland village in Odisha, who discovers the dark side of the Great Indian Wedding in his quest to get his favourite ice-cream. Sarmistha Maiti, co-director of the film, commented on the persistence of insensitive practices in the Indian society. She cited the example of people from the poor strata of the society having to carry heavy lamps-lights on their heads during wedding processions. She said that their aim was to bring to the audience this harsh reality via a more engaging medium of cinema.



Shekhar Rankhambe shared his views on the making of his short film ‘Pamphlet’ with the local child actors of a village in Maharashtra. He remarked that he loved working with children as they work with utmost honesty and affection. He said that in today’s era, forwarded text messages of a religious character can pose a threat to social harmony. In the film, the protagonist, a young boy develops a tremendous fear of misfortune after reading a religious pamphlet which he is unable to print and distribute as required due to lack of money. This fear transforms the otherwise energetic young boy who wished to reach great heights, into a mentally traumatised child.



Ms. Doel Trivedy, co-director of the wildlife documentary, Gyamo-Queen of the Mountains, talked about the state of snow leopards in the Ladakh region. A healthy population of snow leopards indicates stability in the local habitat. Therefore, by depicting the adverse effects on snow leopards and their dwindling numbers, the film delivers an honest commentary on the effects of human-induced climate change. Produced by Riverbank Studios in association with Discovery Communications India, the movie has been screened at various film festivals including IFFI. It will also be aired on Wildlife channel Animal Planet on November 27.



​Director Gautam Pandey shared his views about wildlife filmmaking & short-films. He said that more than the duration of the film, it’s the content and the kind of message that they want to promote, which is Wildlife and Environmental conservation. It is a niche area for the Indian audience. If we could bring such films to big platforms, the audience may start liking these stories as well.​



​Replying to a question about the possibility of short films being screened in multiplexes apart from only film festivals, all the directors replied that it would be helpful if one could get active government support to get them screened at big screens. Closing the session, Rajdeep Paul talked about his experience at IFFI 2018 and appreciated the efficient way in which the film festival was being organized while reserving special praise for the projection quality in theatres.

India’s diverse cinema has caught the attention and imagination of film fraternity across the world. Right from the first silent film Raja Harishchandra in 1913by Dadasaheb Phalke to the present, the country has presented a bouquet of movies that spans regions, languages and cultures. But what happens once these films have lasted their box office life? Preservation in this context is crucial.  Day 2 at the Open Forum of International Film Festival of India (IFFI),   brought to fore ‘The urgent need for digitization, restoration, and preservation of cinema for posterity’.



Opening the discussion, renowned filmmaker and Technical Committee Chairman, IFFI 2018, Shri A. K. Bir noted that technology has greatly helped in restoring the films that suffered from aging, chemical changes and other defects over the long years.  Digitization has enabled films to be preserved in the same depth and colour in which it was initially made. However restoration suffered the danger of a creative dilution. He warned, “sometimes the person who is connected to the restoration process may be influenced by the technology to bring a new look to the original work that was created years ago.” Here the amount of enhancement depends on the ‘ethical sense’ of the restorer. He maintained that it has to be exactly the way it was created and the depth and tonality of the same have to be retained. While restoring a film, one has to give respect to the person who put so much effort to create certain sensibilities of a particular idea, he said.

Shedding light on the restoration of Swedish films, Ms. Jannike Ahliund, Director, Ingmar Berman Centre, Sweden said that the restoration of the Swedish film archive began in 2010 with substantial aid from the Government. The process started with the celebrated Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Berman in light of the centenary year celebrations. All his movies have been restored and have travelled to retrospectives at film festivals across the world. She also emphasized that it is not essentially hierarchical quality order that always determines the films to be selected for restoration. Finding out who owns the rights to these old films often posed a task, she said. Since many filmmakers have passed on, the institute undergoes an exhaustive research process to trace the relatives who may possess the rights to the work, she added.

Contradicting Ms. Jannike’s views, Shri. Prakash Magdum, Director, National Film Archive of India said that films have to be selectively digitized considering the limitations in resources and time. “Whether to preserve in digital form or go back to celluloid form presents a ‘digital dilemma’ before the archiving world. But there are no universal answers or solutions for archiving”, he told. From an archival process, he noted, celluloid is the best long term process available. “If you keep it in a controlled atmosphere, it can last more than 150 years.” Shri Prakash Magdum further added that publicity materials which are windows to a film needs to be digitized along with the film.

Shri Subhash Chheda, Head-Archival Acquisition, Mumbai took the audience on his personal journey of restoring films and collating a huge database of old film magazines and other memorabilia. He also pointed out that since film is the combination of image and sound, restoration of sound needs to be taken care of along with the image. Accessibility is another aspect in film digitalisation and restoration process that must not be overlooked, he said.

Shri. Kiran V. Shantaram, President, Federation of Film Societies of India said that the federation plays an important role in bringing the old cinema to the younger generation. Film Directors Shri. R Dhanraj and Shri Karthik. J. Shinde were also present. A book on eminent Telugu film maker late K.B. Tilak written by Shri. N. Gopalakrishna was released by Shri Kiran V. Shantaram at the event. Shri N. Sasidhara, Vice President, Federation of Film Societies of India moderated the open forum discussion.

The inspiration for ‘To the Desert’ came from a true news story I had read, about kidnapping in Patagonia. The film uses real-life settings of abandoned houses, employing thereby a documentary approach to film-making. It was an opportunity for me to get involved in the exotic landscape of Patagonia.


- Ulises Rosell, Director


The shooting for the movie was quite difficult as the weather conditions were hard; I always wanted to show Patagonia on the cinema and my wish is fulfilled through this film


- Valentina Bassi, actress

Rosell and Bassi were addressing a joint press conference at the 49th International Film Festival of India, Goa today, November 23, 2018. Their film To the Desert is being screened under the World Panorama section of IFFI 2018.

 “I was very happy when I heard that my film got selected in World Panorama section of IFFI which was like an opportunity to take my film to the other side of the world and we are really grateful for this opportunity”, Rosell said.



Narrating her character, Bassi said “Julia wants to escape in the beginning of the movie but she cannot as she is trapped in a vast open space; the emotions she feels are contradictory as she is dependent on the captor for her survival and she starts to admire the captor’s survival skills in the middle of nothing but at the same time she is very afraid of the harm he can inflict on her. Julia ends up believing that she would not tell anyone about the incidence.” 



The film is thus also a story of a secret that should not be shared, added Rosell.



 



Backgrounder

Rosell is an award-winning Argentinian filmmaker with 12 feature films to his credit. Cast of the film & Rossel’s wife, Valentina Bassi is an Argentine film and television actress. 

The film To the Desert revolves around Julia, a casino employee & Gwynfor, a Welsh descendent, who promises her an administrative position at the oil company where he works. Later on, what starts out as a morning appointment, résumé in hand, becomes a nightmarish journey in the middle of the arid landscape of Patagonia.

                Directors of five feature films in the Indian Panorama Section of IFFI- 2018 interacted with the media today. Jayraj, Director of Malayalam film Bhayanakam; Kamakhya Narayan Singh, Director of Bhor; Nipun Dharmadhikari, Director of Marathi film Dhappa; Srijit Mukherji, director of Bengali film Uma and Priya Krisnaswamy, Director of Tamil movie 'Baram' were of the opinion that alternate cinema has great social transformative potential and that it is really a good thing that alternate cinema is getting good OTT platforms. 



Bhayanakam is an adaptation of two chapters from Takazhy Sivasankara Pillai's epic Malayalam novel called 'Coir' and has won three awards for Best Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Cinematography at the 2017 National Film Awards. 

In 1999, Jayaraj started his Navarasa film series with Karunam, followed by Shantham (2001). Shantham won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film. Bhayanakam released in 2017 is Part 6 of Navarasa series. Navarasa series is nine-film series project. The story is set in Kuttanad and its backwaters in central Kerala during the World War II and revolves around a war-injured postman, who delivers money orders at homes of those who have joined the army. Though Kuttanadu lost lot of soldiers in the war, yet it is not part of the history. Bhayanakam tries to narrate those events from telegram and money-orders delivered by one postman.

Jayaraj said “Without showing any war sequences, gun fight or soldiers, the story of world war is depicted here through the mental trauma of a handicapped Postman. It was very difficult to re-create Kuttanadu of that era but we worked hard for it. I have been trying to do this movie for the last 30 years, and I am happy that I got the opportunity to do this now”. He also added that nowadays, there is no market for panorama cinema. “If we have a digital platform like Netflix and support from DFF for such panorama films, it would help”.

Main protagonist of the movie lead actor Renji Panicker said that his transformation from script writer/director to actor was by sheer accident. 



‘Bhor is a film about Bihar’s Mushahar community and revolves around the plight of a poor girl Budhni, struggling to get her basic right for education and sanitation. The film was also watched by Goa’s Hon’ble Governor Smt. Mrudal Sinha yesterday at IFFI-2018.  

Director Kamakhya Narayan Singh said “Since childhood, I was fascinated by Musahar community, who live in planes near the cities, are simple, poor people but do not cry about their poverty. They are happy and honest people. We wanted to make a honest story on them. The condition of Musahars has improved a bit now. But I wanted to show how these people lived when I was a child. Since Bollywood actors could not spare 2 months from their schedule, we chose to take new faces who lived, worked with them for two months to understand their situation. We used real settings by using clothes actually used by local Musahars. The recording of the music was also done live after performing in the villages”.



Marathi film Dhappa portrays how children come to terms with the stark contrast between the idealistic lessons taught in school and the harsh realities of the world outside. 

The Direction & screenplay of ‘Dhappa’, a Marathi film is done by Nipun Dharmadhikari. In the movie, a children’s play during Ganesh Chaturthi Festival on environment using messages of Jesus Christ and Sant Tukaram turns into a flash-point between elders & children. Dhappa has won the National Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration this year. The film is going to be screened in theatres today. Throwing light on his movie’s idea of national integration, Nipun Dharmadhikri said, Pune which has great tradition of Ganesh festival is of late witnessing emergence of gated communities which have become separate worlds in themselves.



I would rather celebrate kindness of one percent people than talking about cynicism of ninety nine percent, said Srijit Mukherji, Director of Bengali film Uma, which is story of a young girl  fighting a terminal disease and her father struggling to make his daughter’s dreams come true helped by a director whose past is haunting him. Srijit Mukherji is a popular actor, screenwriter and Director. His fifth film Jaatishwar won 4 national awards at India's 61st National Film Awards (2014). He has won the National Film Award for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for his sixth film Chotushkone at India's 62nd National Film Awards.



Sharing his experience about the film, Srijit said his inspiration came from a news report called “The Boy Who Moved Christmas” where the townsfolk orchestrated a Christmas for the terminally ill boy. He decided it to adapt the story to the realities of his hometown Bengal, replacing Christmas with Durga Puja.

Baaram which means burden, is a Tamil film directed & produced by Priya Krisnaswamy, which revolves around a widowed night watchman, Karuppaswamy and his sons during his last days, when he is subjected to the practice of Thalaikoothal. A veteran film-editor ,Priya Krishnaswamy made her directorial debut with Gangoobai produced by NFDC in 2013.

“When I read news about elderly infirm parents being despatched with a cold head-bath (‘Thalaikoothal’) and getting killed, and heard this had social sanction, I could not believe it; until I saw Satyameva Jayate by Aamir Khan who foregrounded the issue.”



Krishnaswamy said she then decided to do a documentary on this. She found out there were 26 documented ways to kill the elderly and that this practice is prevalent not only in south India but also in north India as well as in other countries.

“Baaram is based on true events; I find it incredible, it is all about humanity. As a mother, daughter and grand-daughter, I cannot believe that we have lost out on our humanity. When we lose out on these values, we lose out on kindness, gentleness. It had social sanction, there were traditional killers and it was being done for free. What began as tradition and was for free is now a business with brokers and commissions.” 

When we talk about cultural messaging, this is the country that wants sons, yet the ones who murder the elderly are the sons themselves. We don’t have social infrastructure to take care of the elderly. This systemic failure has infiltrated the family as well. The breakdown of the joint family is a problem that I want to showcase through this movie. When we lose out on a generation before us, we lose out on kindness, wisdom, culture, cuisine. Hence I wanted to tell a story about this, said Krishnaswamy.

                ‘A Translator’ is a film  built around a very personal story within my family.  I never set out to make a political story, though there were many political factors underpinning it. The film is rooted in the Cuban reality – the tiny island has lots of lessons to offer  to the world asserted Rodrigo Barriusso, Director of the film ‘A Translator’, one of the entries in the competitive section of the International Film Festival of India in Goa this year.  Rodrigo was addressing a joint press conference  on his film this evening.

  

Talking about the movie, he said the film is based on the true story of his father.  The  main protagonist  Malin is a professor of Russian Literature at the University of Havana who is torn from the abstract world of academics to the harsh reality of medicine and pain and tragedy as he handles his entrusted job of being a translator between Cuban doctors and child patients after the Chernobyl nuclear  disaster.  Developing a devoted relationship with the patient kids in the hospital, Malin’s own relationship with his wife and son suffers amidst the economic crisis that envelopes Cuba following the breakdown of the erstwhile USSR. 

Rodrigo said the film’s main message is about the drive to revamp  oneself when your life is flipped on its head by elements outside your control. Getting a platform to share such an  intense story is in itself an award, the Director elaborated. The film has already bagged the Golden Goblet Award at the Shanghai International Film Festival this year. 

‘Maine’ a film in the World Panorama section of IFFI  is directed by Matthew Brown, a graduate of the University of North Carolina School of Arts. His micro-budget debut film “In the tree-tops” was world-premiered at the Los Angelos Film Festival in 2015.  

‘Maine’ deals with complex emotions and internal processes like introspection and self-discovery. “I wanted to live vicariously through the characters and their experiences and the inspiration for it came from personal experiences,  and the movie is about how  one can easily connect with people who are in the same place in life as you are, Mr Brown said.  



‘Maine’  tells a story of a married Spanish woman’s journey of self-discovery and introspection, while hiking on an Appalachian mountain trail, where she meets an American hiker. Besides direction Brown also has done the screenplay and acting in the film.

Transgender issues need to be told and the movie is an attempt in the hope that it can spin a genuine dialogue on this sensitive issue said Lenin Sivam, Director of the bilingual film ‘Roobha’ being screened in the World Panorama section of IFFI here in Goa.  Lenin said the movie is a beautiful love story between a young Asian transgender woman ‘Roobha’ and a married man.   Inspired by a character in a Tamil short story, the Canadian Director who has roots in neighbouring Sri Lanka,  said it is story to which he can relate because transgender people are like normal people.



Amrit Sandhu who plays the role of ‘Roobha’ said what inspired him to take up the role is that transgender people are like us and the film shows what happens to women when they have no family or friends’ support and are trying to deal with their transgender status. 



Director Lenin Shivam has many short films to his credit. His short film ‘A Few Good People’  won the Best Short Film Award in 2006 from the Independent Film Society.   His debut feature movie ‘1999’   has also bagged many international  awards.

                The media talks mostly about urban people; through this movie I wanted to talk about rural/village people and their problems.  Whether urban or rural, the emotions of people are more or less the same, said Abhishek Saha, Director of the Bengali film Uronchondi –showcased in the Indian Panorama Section at the 49th International Film Festival of India in  Goa.   Saha was addressing a press conference today 22 November, 2018, along with actor Amartya Roy and lead actress Rajnandini Paul of the film.


 

The film is the story of three women from three generations who desperately need a break from their life situation.  Saha said the film is basically about the spirit of life, about the need for a break,  and freedom from day to day life. The Director said the entire film is shot on the road – it is a road  film where there are no walls,  it is all about sky, road and nature, he elaborated.  

Picking up from where Saha left, actor Amartya explained why he believes the film is important. “The reason why this film is important in today’s world is that it talks about fringe characters from society who are unspoken about. My character is from Jharkhand border and Rajnandini Paul (actress) is from Purulia. A lot of films are made about urban people and about urban crises, many of which may not even be real, whereas rural people face quite a few problems which often remain unspoken about.   He further said the director did not want to be preachy,  but just wanted to present his perspective, leaving it open for everyone to take it as it is. The filmmaking process was quite interesting, he said,  -  it was shot outdoors in a short time span of just 13 days.  Always on the run, t+he whole team is running from location to location in a lorry which I learnt to drive within 30 days as a training for this movie. What I found interesting was that for this movie, I had to completely change myself from an urban guy to a lorry driver. As a debutant actor, I think that is what is most liberating”. 



Agreeing with Amartya, Rajnandini said, “It was a great opportunity for debutants like us to work in this movie. It is very liberating to play someone else and be that person in such a convincing manner that people think that you have not played it but you were that person itself. We all went through lot of mental and emotional homework in playing that character.” 



Amartya said the director has represented the culture of Purulia and Bengal’s fringe districts where different dialects of Bengali are used. Handicrafts and other local crafts are also used. Purulia is shown in this movie in such a picturesque way that no movie has shown before, he said.

Saha said that for the film, they visited a village in which all women work and draw paintings on the home walls using extremely vivid colours that are rarely used by urbanites. He said he loves the rural people approach to life - they are always positive, despite not having anything.



Rajnandini said that Purulia has never before been shot such picturesquely in a film. It got appreciated everywhere and people liked the way it has been shot, she said. She added that the film was received really well in IFFI and audience from different states and even foreigners liked the beautiful way in which it has been shot.

She added that the most beautiful aspect about the film is its subtlety; it does not want to preach about anything, though many have asked whether the decision to choose a male protagonist who is on our side was a conscious one. The director wants the movie to speak for itself.  The film employs emotions which are very subtle, but touch one deeply, said the actress.  



 

Backgrounder

Uronchondi is a Bengali film which is a story of the dreams, desires and emotions of three women who belong to different age groups & social backgrounds.  The journey of three women offers them a sense of freedom until police starts chasing them.

The film also marks the debut of the director, Abhishek Saha. The lead roles of three women in the film are played by Sudipta Chakraborty, Chitra Sen, and Rajnandini Paul.

                Directors of the two non-feature films Decoding Shankar & Sampurak, addressed a joint press conference, at the 49th International Film Festival of India, Goa today, November 22, 2018. Their films are being showcased as part of the Indian Panorama in the Non Feature category.

Sharing her experience about making of the film, Deepti Sivan asserted that it's passion, not education, which would help you get where you want to be. When you do something with passion, you will do it to your best since you enjoy it. Shankar Mahadevan pursued his filmmaking passion though he was good as a software engineer. Follow your heart, follow your passion - that is what we wanted to tell through this story. She said that Shankar Mahadevan was an eminent personality through whom this story could be told.



Sivan stated that barring A. R. Rehman, Shankar Mahadevan is the only Indian musician who has a pan-India presence, and is welcomed in Bollywood as well. She said that it was time people came to know the life of a multi-talented personality like him in a better way.

Picking up from Sivan, Prabal Chakraborty said that he too has pursued his passion. He said that filmmaking has always been and still is dream for him. When he returned to India after his film education, he wanted to do a feature. Speaking about his film and the place of women in society, Chakraborty said the film is about how women manage to  balance their twin worlds of work and home, 

Speaking about his experience of working in the US, Prabal Charaborty said that the international experience serves to widen one’s outlook and views.  

 

Speaking about Prabal, Deepti Sivan said, “It is so nice to see that  both of us are sharing the dais with a similar story:  I have done a story about an engineer who followed his dream, and I have an engineer who has followed his dream sitting next to me.”

Narrating about his efforts in making this short film, Prabal Chakraborty said that what he enjoyed most about the film is the part of directing the film itself. 

Backgrounder

Shankar, directed by Deepti Sivan, explores Singer Shankar Mahadevan’s tryst with music. Narrated in his own inimitable style, the singer-composer recollects the decisive moments that shaped his musical sensibilities. It focuses on how he balances his career as a singer, music composer, teacher and family man and also his passion for food. The film is produced by PSBT (Public Service Broadcasting Trust). 

Sampurak, which means the other half, is a Bengali film directed by Mr. Prabal Chakraborty. After their five-day long business workshop, a woman and a man are declared as joint winners at their presentation. The film traces the life of these two individuals after their joint win. While the man’s win is celebrated by his family and he is offered privileges on his return, the woman’s win is not even talked about and she is expected to manage the pending household chores on her return. She is even made to feel guilty for her absence from home for those five days.

Direction, Story and Screenplay & Editing of film is by Prabal Chakraborty. This is his first short film in Bengali.

                I am very excited about Indian scripts; India has a storehouse of talent, with a rich cinematic history, said film actor Chin Han. He also fondly remembered the inspiration he has drawn from the legendary Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray. 

The celebrated Singaporean-American actor, known as Singapore’s Man on the Moon, was addressing a press conference, at the 49th International Film Festival of India, in Goa today, November 22, 2018. 



Speaking about his visit to India he said “I had come here because I have always appreciated the films of India. I recently watched this hugely popular movie Dangal which did good business even outside India”. 

Speaking about his film career, he mentioned that the journey from theatre and film industry of Singapore to Hollywood was very eventful. He said that his basic training was done in theatre; it is the place where one learns to dance, do projection, voice modulation, etc. The tradition of theatre is very classical; theatre was a great place to train. The movement to television (with its emphasis on speed) meant that it took him a while to get used to that. He said that he never thought that a day would come when he would be starring alongside Dwayne Johnson. 

Speaking about Asians in Hollywood cinema, Chin Han said in movies like The Dark Knight – cast is full of diverse races; and race is not an issue at all. There has been a trend shift in a short period of 10 years from 1997 to 2007. As the world becomes more global, with more platforms to show movies involving different races, there will be greater opportunities for Asian actors to be part of global stories. Already actors like Irrfan Khan have made quite a mark in USA and with lot of fellow Asian actors around Hollywood does not seem foreign at all, Mr Han said. “I would welcome any aspiring actor here in India to be open to the experience of working in Hollywood by continuing to tell stories at home as well. This way, we would be able to come back with a different kind of understanding about filmmaking, which we may not otherwise get”, said the actor.

Speaking about his experience of working for Marco Polo web series, the actor said that web series is a medium which is in-between films and television. He noted that series like that of Netflix gives filmmakers the ability to bring films closer to TV.

He said though Hollywood is not a final destination for actors, it is certainly an important destination as Hollywood has built a very good infrastructure for making films. The technology in filmmaking changes very fast and genius directors like Christopher Nolan are very good at using technology like I-Max in film making. 

Speaking further about Christopher Nolan, Mr Han said Nolan is like a General, who has the whole movie planned in front of him. The script of Dark Knight looked so complicated to Mr Han, he had to take a break in the middle of reading it; it looked so complex but Nolan has the whole movie in his head, before he even begins the shooting. He directs every shot in his movies instead of relying on the second and third units on the sets.

Mr Han, who has a keen interest in Indian television media and industry, observed that shooting takes place at a fast pace in the Indian TV industry. He expressed the hope to be able to learn more about Indian film industry and collaborate with the great talents flowing from India. 



Speaking about the way he chooses films, Mr Han said, “I look at stories as to whether they are truthful to my personal experience, I look at characters I can identify with. The characters need to have personalities on their own; otherwise, those roles do not really help. The choice of roles has to be meaningful and have to be well-written.”

Mr. Han said that storytelling is a universal impulse, and that every culture has the impulse to tell its own story. As long as filmmakers get the opportunity to tell their story, meaningful stories will be told, he asserted.

On his association with Dwayne Johnson, Han said that Johnson is the biggest movie star in the world at the moment. He is super-committed, physically gifted and he really takes care of his fans, Mr Han said. 

Mr. Han was quite impressed with the IFFI opening ceremony and considered it fun and entertaining, and he was happy to meet the Indian superstars.

                “There are lot of similarities in Indian and Israeli cinema so far as diversities are concerned, and both countries need to explore their own cinemas deeper said Dan Wolman in a Press conference at the 49th edition of IFFI, Goa on November 21, 2018. Dan Wolman was presented Lifetime Achievement Award at IFFI in Goa this year. Calling himself a supporter of fringe cinema, Wolman said though he sometimes made movies to earn a living, his desire has always been to make a movie on issues like ageing, prostitution, gay issues etc.

Narrating an experience where he was interviewed by a person unaware of parallel cinema, Mr Wolman, who lost two-thirds of his family in holocaust said, he believes in portraying emotions in indirect and subtle ways.

Replying to question about his interest in theatre Mr Wolman said theatre is an exciting and less expensive means to reach people and Israel with its 18 film schools has a great tradition of theatre. 

Wolman further said, Israeli society is characterised by presence of various ethnic and migrant groups which make film-making challenging. However diversity is our strength and it shows the talent that our film fraternity has, Wolman added.

Bringing out the similarities between Indian and Israeli cinema, His Excellency, Consul General of Israel in Mumbai, Ya’akov Finkelstein said, India and Israel have seen tremendous growth in various fields including film sector and ties between the film industries of both countries will scale further heights. Talking about Indian production houses Like Dharma Production shooting at Tel Aviv beaches, he said Israel and India have vast business opportunities in the film sector. Prime Minister of Israel wants films from both countries to fortify the century long bonds among people of Israel and India.

In the Country Focus Section, IFFI will screen 10 movies from Israel which will showcase landscape, history and social issues faced by the country. Inviting Indians to Israel to witness its beauty and explore its huge shooting potential, the Consul General said, he is proud of democracies like India and Israel where concerns of the people have to be kept in mind while tackling socio-economic issues.

“The Other story” is a movie about two rebellious young women and I can relate to the story myself, said Isareli Producer David Silber while speaking about his movie. I switched from the career of museum curator to become a film producer and my aim is not to just give entertainment but also food for thought to my audiences, Mr Silber said.

                GOA, 21st NOVEMBER 2018: The second day at IFFI 2018 saw some great action unfold on-screen, but even more interesting events played out off-screen at the multiple venues of the coveted film festival. One of the events to unfold early in the day was the inauguration of the Mahatma Gandhi exhibitionat Kala Academy by the Union Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Col Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore accompanied by filmmaker Subhash Ghai and actress Poonam Dhillon. 

Col Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, while speaking at the occasion said, “Along with entertainment and education, I am promoting films of business as well. We have also taken the opportunity to put an exhibition on Mahatma Gandhi, which is one of the finest exhibitions on the Father of the Nation. It is a very interactive exhibition that has been taken around the country earlier. Now we have brought it to Goa taking the opportunity of 49th IFFI.”

This was followed by the inauguration of the State Focus section on the state of Jharkhand.

At the occassion, Amit Khare, Secretary I&B, Govt of India said, “We have begun with the State focus for the first time and we chose Jharkhand because we want to promote the filmmakers of the state. We believe that they are no less than the others. This not only increases the employment opportunities to the people but also trains them and hones their skills. Through IFFI, we want to tell that India has arrived on world platform. This has been made possible only because of positive intervention of states. Through the section of State Focus we want international artists to know how the artists from smaller cities are a powerhouse of creative talent and that they too can make some amazing films. By keeping Jharkhand as State Focus, we aim to promote culture, language and talent. We will continue to do so every year with different states.”

The delegation from Israel, as a part of Country Focus on Israel at IFFI 2018, walked the red carpet. The red carpet saw more action as the versatile playback singer Arijit Singh, who is debuting as a director with his film Sa at IFFI 2018, walked the red carpet with his wife.

Maquinez Palace, an important venue of IFFI 2018 saw a busy day with a Masterclass and a panel discussion being held in the first half of the day. The masterclass by Prasoon Joshi, titled, ‘Lyrical Imagination Unleashed’ was undoubtedly one of the highlights of the day.

Not that he needs an introduction but for the uninitiated, Prasoon Joshi wears many hats –a lyricist, screenwriter, poet, the Chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) and that of being the CEO of McCann World group India and Chairman (Asia Pacific). While his achievements in the field of advertising have won him and the country accolades in the international circuit, Mr Prasoon Joshi graced the audiences at IFFI 2018 with his presence.

In this session moderated by Mr Sachin Chatte, the National Award winning lyricist Padma Shri Prasoon Joshi spoke at length about the factors that inspire his creative process, the difference and similarities between writing lyrics and poetry, and the need to find one’s true voice / style. The session also saw the singer-songwriter croon to the audiences, thereby setting a very emotional tone for the session.

Mr Joshi spent his formative years in the lap of nature – in places like Almora, Nainital, Tehri and other scenic parts of India. When asked if nature plays a role in inspiring the stellar body of work that has won him laurels internationally, Joshi declined the notion, in his signature poetic fashion saying, “It would be unfair to those creative people who have not grown up in the lap of nature.” Mr Joshi further said, “People have written in confinement too. It is the certain mental preparedness, sensitivity and the ability to express that plays a role. The human mind creates a narrative around the things and the places that we observe and experience. This process is personal and beautiful. Every place has its fragrance that gets imprinted on your subconscious. When writing, all of this influences and reflects in the end product.”

While advising budding poets and lyricists, Mr Joshi said, “It is okay to be confused. The youngsters are restless, partly because of the pressure from the society. That is okay. If you’re definitive about your way, there’s no growth in it. You can’t experience something till you touch it. It is important to explore. Unless it is a truth which is experienced by you, it is not authentic. If you want to write, or in any creative profession, my understanding is that one has to look for an authentic voice. It is a difficult journey but one that to have to take.”

The Masterclass was followed by a Q&A session where Mr Joshi took questions from potential lyricists and creative artistes. While trying to answer a question on how to get past the Writer’s Block, Mr Joshi said, “One should not be alienated from one’s thoughts. There should be a union between the person and his thoughts. Then, the writing happens naturally. Also, one should be sensitive to the myriad experience and feel the subject. And finally, read a lot to have a rich vocabulary which will come handy in expressing with greater efficacy.”

IFFI 2018 had on its schedule a panel discussion on Swedish master craftsman Ingmar Bergman, as part of paying him tribute on his birth centenary. The panel discussion titled, ‘Wild At Heart, Master At Craft’ saw Mr Sunit Tandon moderate the session that featured Ms Jannike Ahlund and Ms Ulrika.

For those unfamiliar with Ingmar Bergman - 10 of his films are listed in the 5th edition of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die (edited by Steven Jay Schneider). He is the third best represented director (behind Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks) and has the greatest number of writing credits on that list of any screenwriter. On the list are the films Smiles of a Summer Night (1955), The Seventh Seal (1957), Wild Strawberries (1957), Through a Glass Darkly(1961), Winter Light (1963), Persona (1966), Hour of the Wolf (1968), Shame (1968), Cries and Whispers (1972) and Fanny and Alexander (1982).

IFFI 2018 is celebrating the birth centenary of this master filmmaker by showcasing 7 best films of his career.

While speaking about the effect that Bergman had on him growing up, Sunit Tandon said, “He is one of the few filmmakers who has led to the coining of an adjective. ‘Bergmanesque’ is a word you can look up in the dictionary. It means films of the kind that Bergman made. Bergman has had a huge impact on the world of cinema.”

When asked about where Bergman and his legacy would be placed in today’s times, Ms Jannike Ahlund said, “The social issues that Bergman touched upon in his films are timeless. We will always be interested in the lack of human relationships, the lack of communication which seemed to be his overall theme. Most of his films age very well, with the exception of some of his early works.”

The panel discussion was followed by the screening of Ingmar Bergman’s film, Wild Strawberries.

The 49th International Film Festival of India begins on Tuesday, 20 November 2018 and ends on Wednesday, 28 November, 2018, in Panaji, Goa.

                Cinema possesses a universal language, and the message conveyed by the Malayalam movie ‘Olu’ can reach the audience, irrespective of language barriers, said veteran Malayalam film director Shaji N. Karun.  Aditya Suhas Jambhle, director of the Marathi Film ‘Kharvas’, said that society hardly understands the sufferings of women and his film is an attempt to spread awareness on this critical social issue.

‘Olu’ and ‘Kharvas’ are the opening films in the Feature and Non Feature categories respectively, of the Indian Panorama Section, at the 49th International Film Festival of India, Goa. Both directors were addressing a joint press conference on their films at the Media Centre of IFFI Wednesday 21st November.

The cast of ‘Olu’, including leading actors Shane Nigam, Ms. Esther Anil, Ms. Kani and producer, A.V. Anoop, and the producer of Kharvas, Madhukar Joshi were attended the press conference.

Shaji N Karun said that an original work of cinema has to remain like a painting; its dubbing into other languages would spoil its beauty. The director said that ‘Olu’ depicts the tale of a gypsy girl Maya who mysteriously survives under the Kerala backwaters where she has been sunk by her rapists. Later, fate brings her close to Vasu, a young and amateur painter. Out of love, she empowers him to create paintings that will change his life. In this way, the movie Olu blends reality with fantasy.

Karun said that the devotion of the cast and crew to make an honest expression of themselves was what enabled the film to become a way of addressing a fantasy. He noted that the cast and crew have taken a lot of pain in capturing the visuals as the movie has a lot of underwater scenes. He said that work lasting for six to seven months was done to complete VFX works of the film. The production process was very challenging as there were many technical matters that needed to be taken care of, such as transmission and reception of sound under water.

Talking about his film Kharwas, Aditya Suhas Jambhle said that it took 20 hours to shoot the six-minute climax of the film which presents the mixed feelings of the experience of a woman’s motherhood. Aasawari, a painter by profession, after losing her baby born still, withdraws to her ancestral home in a remote Konkan village. Her emotional struggle to overcome this tragic trauma gets partly resolved when she accidentally learns about a pregnant cow due to deliver in their own cowshed. Kharwas, a sweet dish made from cow’s milk, depicts the emotional depth of the movie.

                The growth of regional cinema in India has been absolutely fantastic, it is making huge strides, noted Shri Rahul Rawail, Chairman of Jury, Indian Panorama (Feature), of the 49th International Film Festival of India (IFFI). He said that the day is not far when there will be no distinctive entity called regional cinema, and all cinema will be referred to as cinema. Highlighting the range of films featured in the Indian Panorama section at IFFI, Shri Rawail said that the array of selected films includes those set in Ladakh, Lakshwadeep, Tulu and Assam.

Addressing a press conference during the 49th International Film Festival of India (IFF) in Panjim, Goa, Shri Rawail said that it was a tough exercise to select 22 films from a list of more than 100 films which were simply great. Shri Rawail was joined by film-maker and jury member (IP – Feature) Major Ravi; and Shri K. G. Suresh, Director General, Indian Institute of Mass Communication, New Delhi, both members of Feature Film Jury.

The jury of Indian Panorama – Non Feature too were present at the media briefing. Shri Vinod Ganatra, Jury Chairman, (Non- Feature); film director and educationist, Smt. Parvathy Menon; actor and director Shri Suneel Puranic shared their perspectives on the evolving nature and timeless worth of the non-feature films.



Shri Rawail said that the festival collection includes some fantastic films with brilliant content that were not previously experimented. He said that the films selected were those worthy enough to showcase India on the global stage, and that content that engages the audience was given prominence.

Replying to a query, the Chairman asserted that there is no such thing as national film of anti-national film; the jury considers all movies that comes before it as Indian movies, he said. He stated that the controversy regarding omission of certain movies from Indian Panorama is unfortunate and that the jury was given full autonomy in arriving at its decisions.



 

Speaking on the importance of highlighting movies that tend to be ignored by the market, Shri Rawail observed that the biggest mafia ruling the industry is the multiplex mafia as they are not interested in the content of the movies and only interested in movies which helps them to attract crowd. He said that there is a need to develop infrastructure for distributing good films that deserve to be watched, at low cost.

Shri. Vinod Ganatra, Jury Chairman, (Non Feature Films) said that with the advent of digital technology, short films with exceptional content are coming out in large number. However, he pointed out that ensuring quality is the biggest challenge for film makers; with a mobile phone in hand, everybody has now become a film maker. He said that while amateur films can be hits, it is a dangerous trend that such films are increasing.

The Chairman said that in an age of decreasing attention spans, short films are going to take over feature films in a short time as many filmmakers are coming forward with beautiful content that are able to powerfully connect with audiences. Two-thirds of the non-feature movies were short films. Shri. Vinod Ganatra added that. He also pointed out that Short Films are very much helpful for those who want to get in to the system of film making. He advised young film makers not no compromise on script which holds the key for making a good film.

Major Ravi said that 18 transgender films were considered for selection in this year’s edition. He pointed out that the jury members have taken a lot of pain in selecting the best films made in the country and have ensured that the Indian Panorama section presents a pan-Indian movie experience to the viewers.

Shri. K.G Suresh, member of Feature Film Jury said that all jury members are satisfied with the selection of movies in Indian panorama section and that it was a very democratic exercise, while there were heated debates between the members on topics ranging from cinematography to acting. He said that the increasing number of stories also pointed out that Indian audience is now ready to watch and accept stories on gender and LGBT issues. He noted that it was very difficult to select the opening film, since all films were so good, and that the one which could give the ultimate cinematic experience was finally chosen.

Smt. Parvathy Menon, jury member for Non feature Films that it is the creativity of short film makers that makes them stand apart from the rest. She also pointed out there were short films with fantastic emotional content, on outstanding subjects which one would not think of making films on. She added that every creator is a mother in one way.

Shri Suneel Puranic, Member of Non Feature Jury said that this year there were relatively less number of entries from southern states which used to contribute much in the previous years. However, he pointed out that there were some brilliant films from Bengali and Marathi languages. He lauded the film makers for their ability to experiment.

Union Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting, Col Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said that “India is a land of storytellers where every person has a story to tell. These stories inspire and entertain us. IFFI is a platform for our young generation to showcase their talent. It is a platform for the international filmmakers to see India and explore the talent that we have. It is a great collaboration for both the sides. It is incredible of the Information and Broadcasting team and Entertainment Society of Goa to have an event on such a massive scale. There are Masterclasses held by experts in the entertainment industry and I hope the organisation involved is putting it online so that it reaches everyone. We are focusing on the past, the present and the future. Showing films like Sholay and also content from OTT platforms. It is a lovely time to come to Goa since this year we are having street cinema open to the tourists who are visiting the state for the next 9 days and they can experience this at IFFI.” The Hon. Minister said this while walking the red carpet at the opening ceremony of 49th International Film Festival of India in Goa.

PWD Minister of Transport & River Navigation of Goa Ramakrishna alias Mr Sudin Dhavalikar said, “Goa is a state of colours and its effervescent culture and welcoming nature makes it a perfect destination to host IFFI. The festival aims at providing platform for cinema lovers and those from the field of art. At the 49th IFFI, I take this opportunity to thank Hon. CM of Goa, Manohar Parrikar who made sure that Goa got the privilege to host IFFI. He did not leave any stone unturned for its preparation since the first time it was hosted at Goa fifteen years ago.”

Celebrated film star Akshay Kumar, who flew down in a charter plane to grace the occasion with his presence for a few hours, said, “There are so many things happening in India in the entertainment industry. Our Minister Mr. Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore is doing an incredible job of combining entertainment and education. It is very important to have films which have substance and meaning behind it. I am very thankful to the government that because of such films and initiatives there are lakhs of villages who get information free of cost and trigger massive positive changes.”

The inaugural ceremony also witnessed some mesmerizing audio visual performances which started with a medley dance performance of songs from some of the best Indian films depicting the country’s vibrant history. The versatile singer Shilpa Rao sang popular songs from across the country in multiple languages such as Bengali, Punjabi, Hindi and a beautiful rendition of the timeless, “Aaj Jaane Ki Zidd Na Karo.” Actor Sonu Sood then took over and set the stage on fire with his dance skills.

In order to disseminate information regarding filming in India, the FFO has now developed a Web Portal. 

Israeli master craftsman Dan Wolman was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the opening ceremony of the 49th IFFI. While speaking at the occasion, Mr Wolman said, “Thank you for honoring me with the Lifetime Achievement Award which is the highest award that I have ever received. It is sweeter because I am receiving it in India – a country whose people, culture and phenomenal cinema I truly admire. This year IFFI has chosen to focus on Israeli cinema. I am glad the films selected for this reflect the range of Israeli cinema. There is chemistry between India and Israel. I hope this chemistry manifests in co productions and collaborations in cinema.”

                GOA, 19th NOVEMBER 2018: As cine lovers await with bated breath for the official opening of the 49th International Film Festival of India (IFFI), the international star cast and crew of the opening film of the festival – ‘The Aspern papers’ –made their presence felt at the press conference held this evening by IFFI.

From among the cast and crew of the film, Mr. Julien Landais (Director) was present with his actors Mr. Nicolas Hau, MsBarbara Meier and MsLois Robbins. 

While addressing the media at the press conference, the Festival Director said, “We are thoroughly delighted to have the cast and crew of The Aspern Papers among us. And what better way to start the 49th edition of IFFI than with a World Premiere! A premiere which speaks for itself, a premiere which will showcase the nuances of cinema, filmmaking, acting, creativity and the way forward. The film kickstarts our whole journey for eight days and it should be a journey which all of us will love to remember. It is a great honour and a privilege to have you here. I thank the cast and crew of The Aspern Papersfor coming to India, coming to Goa, coming to IFFI, and for giving us a great brand value in the international community. Namaskar, welcome to India”

 

Julien Landais, the Director of The Aspern Papers, said, “It is a real honour for me to be in India to present my film at this prestigious festival. My filmis an adaptation of a famous novella by Henry James, which is set in Venice in the late 19th century. I felt like it was the right subject for my first feature and fit in the incredible actors to embody these special characters. So I’m very happy to be here with my team.”

One of the actors of the film, Lois Robbins was also present at the press conference. She said, “I just want to say  howthrilled I am to be here. It is my first time in India. It is a beautiful country;Goa is fantastic and thank you so much for having us all. Shooting The Aspern Papers was an experience I don’t think I will ever have again as an actor for so many reasons. Firstly, it was an extraordinary cast led by an exceptional director who had a beautiful vision for the film. Just the costumes alone, from the Dolce and Gabbana couture archives, were some of the most beautiful things I will ever wear in my life. It was quite exceptional to work with Jonathan (Rhys-Myers), Poppy (Delevingne), Nicolas (Hau), Barbara (Meier) and MorganePolanski.”

Narrating her experience while shooting the film, Lois further said, “It was a lot of fun on the very first day of the shooting of the film. It was very hot in Venice. And I had on a very heavy cape, a hat and gloves and we were shooting in a gondola. For every take, I had to take my gloves on and off. The costume people couldn’t come inside the gondola with me. So for every take, Jonathan would get into the gondola and adjust the gloves and the cape for me. And I was swooning. He is quite handsome. That might have been my favourite day of shooting.”

 

The Aspern Papers tells a story of obsession, grandeur lost and dreams of Byronic adventures.The filmis an adaptation of a famous novella by Henry James based on the letters Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote to Mary Shelley's stepsister Claire Clairmont. The film stars Golden Globe winnerMr.Jonathan Rhys Meyers (lead actor), Golden Globe nominated actressMs.Joely Richardson (lead actress), her mother – six time Oscar nominee and Academy Award winner Vanessa Redgrave, Ms. Julia Robins (actress), Ms.Morgane Polanski (actress ) - daughter of Roman Polanski, and Mr. Nicolas Hau(actor).

Synopsis of TheAspern Papers:

Set in Venice in the late 19th century, it tells the story of an American editor determined to get his hands on the letters his icon, the Romantic poet Jeffrey Aspern, wrote to his beautiful lover and muse, Juliana Bordereau. Juliana lives in a Venetian palazzo with her niece Miss Tina, who she seems to control and Morton tries to manipulate. But when the ambitious adventurer trifles with Miss Tina’s affections she learns to see through his scheme.

	Para Aduma


Director: Tsivia Barkai Yacov

Set in an East Jerusalem neighborhood that's a stone’s throw away from the Old City, Red Cow focuses on the relationship between 16-year-old Benny (Avigayil Koevary) and her devout dad, Yehoshua (Gal Toren). The latter leads a group of Israeli extremists who, as per the film's title, are raising a sacred red heifer they believe will herald the dawn of a new age for Jews, allowing them to return to the Temple Mount, which they have been banned from for so long.

Red Cow is a coming-of-age film that takes place in the days leading up to the assassination of Rabin and depicts the life of Benny, orphaned from mother at birth and the only child of Joshua - a religious, right-wing extremist, in those critical junctures when she is forming her sexual, religious and political awareness.

The journey to save his daughter exposes old wounds and allows him to reconnect with his secular past. Menachem understands that only a new connection to his past and to his music can pave the road to his own redemption. 


	Shalom Bollywood: The Untold Story of Indian Cinema


Director: Danny Ben-Moshe

Shalom Bollywood: The Untold Story of Indian Cinema is a feature length documentary celebrating the all singing, all dancing history of the world’s largest film industry. It reveals the unlikely story of the 2000 year old Indian Jewish community and its formative place in shaping the world’s largest film industry.  

The film tells its tale through the lives of nice Jewish girls who became icons at the heart of Indian cinema from the turn of the 20th century to the present day. From the 1920s silent era we meet Sulochana (aka Ruby Myers), arguably the greatest ever female superstar of Indian cinema. In the 1930s there was Miss Rose (aka Rose Ezra) the Queen of the Bollywood’s racy party scene, and in the 1940s Pramila (aka Esther Abraham) who became the country’s first Miss India. Then, in the 1950s and 1960s golden era of Indian cinema, the quintessential Bollywood vamp Nadira (aka Farhat Ezekiel).

The film had its world premiere at the MAMI Mumbai Film Festival in 2017 and has been the hit of the Jewish, Indian and South East Asian film festival circuit in 2018.

The film also stars present day senior Bollywood figures, including acting legend Rishi Kapoor, who discuss the film industry in general and the impact of the Jewish stars in particular.


	The Bubble


Director: Eytan Fox

The movie follows a group of young friends in the city of Tel Aviv and is as much a love song to the city as it is an exploration of the claim that people in Tel Aviv are isolated from the rest of the country and the turmoil it's going through. The movie looks at young people's lives in Tel Aviv through the POVs of gays and straights, Jews and Arabs, men and women. It all begins when Noam, a young Israeli soldier, serves in the reserve forces and meets at a check point a Palestinian young man called Ashraf. Following an incident during which Noam misplaces his ID card at the check point, Ashraf shows up on the doorstep of the apartment that Noam shares with a gay man and a straight woman. 


	The Unorthodox


Director: Eliran Malka

The film set in 1983 revolves around Yaakov Cohen, the owner of a Jerusalem printing press, whose daughter is expelled from school for ethnic reasons. Yaakov decides to fight back. He has no knowledge, no money, no connections and no political experience. But he does have the will and the passion to take action, and a belief that he and and other Sephardic Jews should be able to hold their heads up high. Yakov brings two friends along and together they start the first ethnic political group in Jerusalem, with an operation characteristic of the people they represent: not the suit-wearing types, but rather the people working their way up from the bottom. Their operation is informal, full of love for their fellow man, animated by a great sense of humor and a whole lot of rage.


	Waltz with Bashir


Director: Ari Folman

Waltz with Bashir is a 2008 Israeli animated war documentary film that depicts Folman in search of his lost memories of his experience as a soldier in the 1982 Lebanon War. One night at a bar, an old friend tells director Ari about a recurring nightmare in which he is chased by 26 vicious dogs. Every night, the same number of beasts. The two men conclude that there's a connection to their Israeli Army mission in the first Lebanon War of the early eighties. Ari is surprised that he can't remember a thing anymore about that period of his life. Intrigued by this riddle, he decides to meet and interview old friends and comrades around the world. He needs to discover the truth about that time and about himself. As Ari delves deeper and deeper into the mystery, his memory begins to creep up in surreal images.

Waltz with Bashir premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival where it entered the competition for the Palme d'Or, and since then has won and been nominated for many additional important awards while receiving wide acclaim from critics. It won a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, an NSFC Award for Best Film, a César Award for Best Foreign Film and an IDA Award for Feature Documentary, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language and an Annie Award for Best Animated Feature.


	Working Woman


Director: Michal Aviad

This Israeli film focuses on workplace harassment and features a quietly powerful lead performance by Liron Ben Shlush. Life at work becomes unbearable for Orna as her boss appreciates and promotes her, while making inappropriate advances. Her husband struggles to keep his new restaurant afloat, and Orna becomes the main breadwinner for their three children. When her world is finally shattered, she must pull herself together to fight, in her own way, for her job and a sense of self-worth.

The film was screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival. The film received a bow at the Toronto International Film Festival and then the Busan International Film Festival.

                In a section of media, there have been some reports about Maternity Leave Incentive Scheme. In this regard, the Ministry of Labour & Employment has clarified the following - 

 

Background- (i) The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 applies to establishments employing 10 or more than 10 persons in Factories, Mines, Plantation, Shops & Establishments and other entities. The main purpose of this Act is to regulate the employment of women in certain establishments for certain period before and after child birth and to provide maternity benefit and certain other benefits. The Act was amended through the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 which, inter alia, has increased the paid maternity leave to women employees from 12 weeks to 26 weeks.


	While the implementation of the provision is good in Public Sector, there are reports that it is not good in Private Sector and in contract jobs. There is also a wide perception that private entities are not encouraging women employees because if they are employed, they may have to provide maternity benefit to them, particularly 26 weeks of paid holiday. In addition, the Ministry of Labour & Employment is also getting complaints from various quarters that when the employers come to know that their women employee is in the family way or applies for maternity leave, the contracts are terminated on some flimsy grounds. There have been several representations before the Labour Ministry on how the extended maternity leave has become a deterrent for female employees who are asked to quit or retrenched on flimsy grounds before they go on maternity leave.
	Therefore, the Ministry of Labour & Employment is working on an incentive scheme wherein 7 weeks’ wages would be reimbursed to employers who employ women workers with wage ceiling upto Rs. 15000/- and provide the maternity benefit of 26 weeks paid leave, subject to certain conditions. It is estimated that approximately an amount of Rs. 400 crores would be the financial implication for Government of India, Ministry of Labour & Employment for implementing the proposed incentive scheme.


Major Impact: The proposed Scheme, if  approved  and  implemented shall ensure the women in this country an equal access to employment and other approved benefits alongwith adequate safety and secure environment. Also, the women shall continue to bear the major share of household work as well as child care. The work places will be more and more responsive to the family needs of the working women.

Current Stage of the Proposal:

There are some media reports that this Scheme has been approved/notified. However, it is clarified that Ministry of Labour & Employment is in the process of obtaining necessary budgetary grant and approvals of Competent Authorities. The reports that it will be funded from Labour Welfare Cess, is also incorrect, as no such cess exists under this Ministry.

India and Morocco have interacted in historical terms going back to the 14th century when the famous traveler and writer from Tangier, Ibn Batuta travelled to India. His writings on medieval Indian society are as much an important source of historical information about India to the Indians as to the Moroccans. In modern history, India was active in the UN supporting the Moroccan freedom movement and recognized Morocco on 20 June 1956 when it became independent of the protectorate arrangements with France and diplomatic Missions were established in 1957. 

Since the establishment of relations, India and Morocco have enjoyed cordial and friendly ties. From time to time dignitaries of one country visited other country. Indian dignitaries who visited Morocco includes Vice-President Dr. Zakir Hussain (1967) and Minister of Law & Justice (2016).

                Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, in consultation with National Institute of Wind Energy Chennai, has prepared a draft of new Scheme called Indian Wind Turbine Certification Scheme (IWTCS) incorporating various guidelinesTurbine Certification Scheme (IWTCS).

The IWTCS is a consolidation of relevant National and International Standards (IS/IEC/IEEE), Technical Regulations and requirements issued by Central Electricity Authority (CEA), guidelines issued by MNRE and other international guidelines. It has also strived to incorporate various best practices from other countries to ensure the quality of the wind energy projects. 

The draft Scheme enlists the guidelines for the benefit of all the stakeholders from concept to lifetime of wind turbine, including Indian Type Approved Model (ITAM), Indian Type Certification Scheme (ITCS), Wind Farm Project Certification Scheme (WFPCS) and Wind Turbine Safety & Performance Certification Scheme (WTSPCS). 

The IWTCS is envisaged to assist and facilitate the following stakeholders; (i.) Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) (ii.) End Users -Utilities, SNAs, Developers, IPPs, Owners, Authorities, Investors and Insurers (iii.) Certification Bodies (iv.) Testing Laboratories 

Wind energy has matured over the decades to be the mainstream source of renewable power generation in India. The steady growth of the sector has seen different types of wind turbines with diverse performance and safety criteria. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India through various policies and schemes has facilitated the healthy and orderly growth of the wind energy sector. The guideline for the recognition of the certification schemes in India by MNRE was paramount for the success of quality wind turbines installed in India. The successful evaluation under the recognised schemes resulted in the wind turbines being listed in the Revised List of Models and Manufacturers (RLMM). This listing has resulted in stakeholders having confidence on the quality of the wind turbines offered by various manufacturers in India.Wind sector in India is growing at a rapid pace with increased utilization of wind energy for the power development. The modern wind turbines have higher hub heights, larger rotor diameter, higher capacity and improved Capacity Utilization Factor (CUF) along with technological improvements. Under these developments, there is a need for comprehensive document which provides the complete technical requirements which shall have to be complied by the wind turbines for the safe and reliable operation by all the stakeholders viz, OEMs, Independent Power Producers (IPPs), wind farm developers, Financial Institutions, Utilities and others. Also, there is a need for technical regulations which shall facilitate common ground for OEMs, Developers, Investors and Financial Institution for systematic development.

Type Certification of wind turbines plays an active role in ensuring that wind turbines in India meet the requirements of requisite IS/IEC/IECRE standards in vogue. Internationally, IEC /IECRE Certification schemes for wind turbines are well recognized and widely used and the IWTCS in its formulation has incorporated the rules and procedures of IS/IEC/IECRE.

The Ministry has uploaded the draft Scheme on its website https://mnre.gov.in and has invited comments from all stakeholders/ public latest by 5th December, 2018 for finalising the new scheme. Here is the web link of the Scheme:

                 Union Minister Dr Jitendra Singh, who is also a renowned Diabetologist, has mooted ""Heli-Clinics"" / Helicopter Clinics for remote areas, which could particularly be of great help to provide specialized medical care to people living in inaccessible hilly terrains of the States like Jammu & Kashmir and Northeast.

 

Speaking at ""India Health Summit 2018"", organized by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Healthcare Council here today, Dr Jitendra Singh observed that the Corporate Hospitals and the leading private sector medical practitioners had mostly got concentrated in Tier-1 or big cities, while the rural and sub-rural areas, more so the remote areas, had been left deprived. However, he said, the cities are almost reaching their saturation point with overwhelming number of private practitioners and therefore, from the point of view of a profitable private practice also, it will be good for the private sector doctors to turn to rural and remote areas.

 

There are vast stretches of land, particularly in the hill States of India, said Dr Jitendra Singh, where the Corporate Hospitals, either on their own or in a private-public participation mode, could provide helicopter-based super-specialty clinics. He said, for instance, each day of the week, one super-specialist doctor like Cardiologist or  Diabetologist or Nephrologist or Gastroenterologist, etc. can, in turn, set up a Helicopter OPD along with the requisite para-medical staff and medicines. On way back, he said, the same helicopter can also carry one or two needy patients to the town or city for hospitalization.

 

In a heterogeneous country like India, Dr Jitendra Singh said, public sector healthcare run by government will never lose its relevance. But, nonetheless, private sector is gradually assuming a big role and could work in synergism with the public sector.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, Tele-Medicine and e-Healthcare assume a special significance in a country like India to reach the patients in inaccessible regions. Here too, the private sector can play a big role by supplementing the government efforts, he said.

 

Lauding the Central  Government's focus on healthcare for all, Dr Jitendra Singh referred to some path-breaking decisions in the last four years, which include opening of Dialysis Centres in every district hospital, setting up of Wellness Centres and, above all, launch of ""Ayushman Bharat"". He also emphasized the need to incentivize medical practitioners to go to remote rural areas and to provide adequately satisfactory facilities for the government doctors to be able to serve in the rural areas.

 

During the panel conversation, Dr Naresh Trehan, renowned Cardiologist, spoke about the various new initiatives envisaged by the private sector doctors and the CII Healthcare Council. He said, Indian Healthcare is passing through one of the most exciting times for investment, collaborations and partnerships.

 

Dr Trehan expressed optimism at the fact that, of late, the public and private healthcare sectors in India are converging.

                Shri Hemant G. Contractor, Chairman, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) delivered the 37th lecture of the “Lecture Series” organized by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) here today. He spoke on the topic “Pensions and Social Security”.

 

He differentiated between social security, social assistance and social insurance as concepts and discussed the concept of social protection as a broad idea, encompassing social security and voluntary welfare measures.

 

The history of social security schemes in the context of the emergence of the modern nation state was highlighted. Further, he listed out various progressive social security laws of the Indian state and the related schemes launched under these laws. The unique need for social security in India, stemming from the increase in longevity as a result of the welfare state and the gradual breakdown of the joint family system was explained during the lecture.

 

The speaker explained many aspects of the National Pension Scheme (NPS), the role of PFRDA in regulating the pensions and social security schemes and spoke of the Atal Pension Yojana in the context of the opening of Jan Dhan Accounts and the implementation of the Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) scheme by the government.

 

Full time and part time Chief Vigilance Officers (CVOs) based in Delhi/NCR attended the lecture along with Chairman-Cum-Managing Directors (CMDs), Board of Directors and Managers of Public Sector Enterprises as well as officers of the vigilance administration. The lecture may be viewed online as it was webcast live through National Informatics Centre (NIC). The web page link is available on www.cvc.nic.in.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh stated here today that in the last four and half years, the government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has brought most of the public authorities under the purview of the RTI act, which is in keeping with the commitment to ensure maximum transparency in the working of these institutions. The Department of Personnel and Training(DOP&T), which is the nodal department for the Right to Information and Central Information Commission, has so far successfully covered nearly 2000 public authorities under the RTI Act, he said.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh made these observations when the outgoing Chief Information Commissioner (CIC), Shri R.K. Mathur called on him today.

 

Lauding the achievements of the last over four years, Dr Jitendra Singh said, when the government came in, there were very few public authorities under the purview of RTI Act, but  a fast - track process was initiated to make the RTI more effective and more inclusive.

 

In addition, Dr Jitendra Singh noted that the filing of RTI has been made much more convenient and easy with the use of latest technology. There is now a portal and an App, as a result of which, any citizen can file an RTI from his mobile phone, at any time of the day or night, and from anywhere.

 

The disposal time of the RTI application received in the Central Information Commission has been drastically reduced, said, Dr Jitendra Singh, and added that the pendency has also considerably reduced in comparison to what it was before 2014.

 

In the DOP&T, Dr Jitendra Singh said, we have tried to sincerely live up to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s commitment of maximum governance with minimum government, maximum transparency and maximum citizen-participation. He said, there has also been a successful effort to compile inputs from the various RTIs received, in order to prepare research manuals for  planning future strategies and improve upon the existing methodologies.

                The Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh released a book titled ‘Radio Kashmir – In Times of Peace & War’ written by Dr Rajesh Bhat, here today. 

Dr Jitendra Singh congratulated the author of the book and appreciated his efforts for writing a book on Jammu and Kashmir after extensive and in-depth research. He said that the writer has wide experience of working in print and electronic, as well as private and government media. Dr Singh said that reporting of radio in Jammu and Kashmir has its own significance. He said the radio has evolved from a small set up to a level of influencing the lives of people in remote areas. The Minister added that a 10KW transmitter of All India Radio at Patnitop in Ramban District of J&K was inaugurated recently, that will provide services to people living in a radius of around 60 km (aerial) in various districts and also said that a radio station at Udhampur would be commissioned soon. 

Speaking about the youth of J&K, the Minister said that many students from the state, supported by ‘Kashmir Super 30’ Project, have qualified for the JEE (Main & Advance) exam in recent years. He added that every year youth from Jammu and Kashmir are gaining top positions in Civil Services Exams, which shows that youth of J&K are hard working and aspiring for a bright future. The youth are now well-connected with the world with the increasing reach of internet, he added. 

The book titled ‘Radio Kashmir – In Times of Peace & War’ has emanated from an extensive and intensive research by the author on the significant role played by the media in safeguarding the strategic interest of the Government and the masses by addressing the core issues concerning the welfare and security of a nation. Ever since its inception in 1947, the author traces the assiduous role played by Radio Kashmir in weaving a cohesive social and cultural fabric. It depicts unique distinction earned by Radio Kashmir by serving people and the nation, in this region, fostering and strengthening democratic institutions in the State. 

The author Dr Rajesh Bhat is currently posted in the Policy Division of Directorate General, All India Radio, New Delhi. Dr Bhat has penned more than 250 academic research papers and articles. 

The DG, AIR Shri F. Sheheryar and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.

Extending a warm welcome to Mr Haroun Suleiman and his delegation, Dr Jitendra Singh recalled that India shared a traditionally friendly relationship with Tanzania right from the time of President Mr Julius Nyerere. Because of these common linkages of legacy, he said, it is far much easier to expect a successful engagement between the two countries.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh referred to the visit to Tanzania by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in July, 2016 and pointed out the special emphasis given by the Government to the relations with the African countries.

 

During the half-an-hour interaction, Mr Haroun Suleiman expressed keenness for further and deeper engagement with India in the fields of civil services and governance. He proposed to Dr Jitendra Singh the desirability of arranging visits by civil servants from Tanzania to India, so that they could enrich themselves from the vast experience of the Indian Administrative Service. 

 

Dr Jitendra Singh informed his Tanzanian counterpart that the Union Ministry of  Personnel is already engaged in such exchange programmes with several countries .

 

In response to Mr Suleiman's request for the visits of Indian faculty to his country, Dr Jitendra Singh said, a group of officers can be assigned to work out this arrangement. For this purpose, he said, the representatives from Ministry of External Affairs will also be involved.

                The Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the geriatric study has gained relevance in the recent years with increase in life span of people. This field has unique speciality where the parameter is based on age. He said that more than 70% of the population is below the age of 40 years, due to which India is facing bi-polar challenge. On the one hand we have increasing number of old population and on the other hand there is a large percentage of population in young age. He was speaking at the inauguration of 4th International Congress on Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine that is being organized along with the Asia Pacific Geriatric Medicine Network Conference  at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.  The vision of the conference is to improve old age care around the world. The Congress focuses on sensitisation and reorientation of health care professionals with the theme: ‘Future of Geriatric Medicine practice - Are you Ready?’ Keeping in mind the recent advances in healthcare and information technology, the discussions are being held on topics such as subjects of biogerontology and social & clinical geriatrics such as diabetes, euthanasia, elder abuse and geriatric patient care.

The Minister said earlier the challenge used to be of spread of communicable diseases, while now the challenge is that of non-communicable diseases spreading fast irrespective of age. This trend has posed a new challenge keeping in mind the economic and social cost of these diseases, he added. The younger generation, if affected with metabolically disorder diseases, will have to pay huge economic costs keeping in mind the increasing life span, the Minister said.

Speaking about the Government’s efforts to improve health sector in India, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has accorded high priority to health care and prevention services. He said that launch of ‘Aayushmaan Bharat’ programme is an example specially in a developing country like India. He also spoke of other initiatives taken by Government for senior citizens like increase in minimum pension etc.

The Director, AIIMS, Dr Randeep Gulleria, Chairman, Power Grid, Shri I S Jha, Vice-Chancellor, Pt B D Sharma University, Dr O P Kalra, Joint Secretary, Department of Pensions & Pensioners Welfare Shri S N Mathur and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today laid the Foundation Stones of City Gas Distribution (CGD) Projects in 65 Geographical Areas (GAs) in 129 Districts under the 9th CGD Bidding Round, remotely from Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi. During the event, Hon’ble PM also launched 10th CGD Bidding Round in 50 GAs spread over 124 districts in 14 states.

Speaking on the occasion, the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said that the Government is working to move towards the gas-based economy. Presently the share of gas in the country’s energy mix is just over 6% and the aim is to reach the 15% figure, while the world average is 24%. He said the Prime Minister has assured the world that India will take initiative to bring down its carbon emission level, and a number of initiatives have been taken in this direction like LED bulbs, BS VI fuel, Bio-energy, International Solar Alliance, Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana, and providing clean piped gas supply to more cities is also a step in this direction. The Minister also mentioned about enhancing the LNG terminal capacity, renegotiating Indo-Qatar Gas deal, and positive Indo-US engagement in this direction. He said that efforts are not only being made to increase the use and supply of Gas, but also to produce gas through agro-wastes and other products and including the same into the CGD network.

Government of India has put thrust to promote the usage of environment friendly clean fuel i.e. natural gas as a fuel/feedstock across the country to move towards a gas based economy. Accordingly, development of CGD networks has been focused to increase the availability of cleaner cooking fuel (i.e. PNG) and transportation fuel (i.e. CNG) to the citizens of the country. The expansion of CGD network will also benefit to industrial and commercial units by ensuring the uninterrupted supply of natural gas.

Till September 2018, 96 cities/Districts in different parts of the country were covered for development of CGD networks. About 46.5 lakh households and 32 lakh CNG vehicles are availing the benefit of clean fuel through existing CGD networks. To boost the expansion of PNG/CNG network, PNGRB launched 9th CGD bidding round in April, 2018 for 86 Geographical Areas (GAs) covering 174 districts in 22 States/ Union Territories. Subsequent to processing of received bids, grants of authorization have been issued to the successful bidders to develop CGD network for 84 GAs at present. As per commitment made by various entities in this bidding round, around 2 crore PNG (Domestic) connections and 4600 CNG stations are expected to be installed in next 8 years across the country.  This has expanded the potential coverage of CGDs to about 50% of country’s population spreading over 35% of India's area. Various pre-project activities for these GAs have already commenced and efforts are being made to commence the physical works at the site. In addition, PNGRB has also initiated the process of 10th CGD bidding round for additional 50 new GAs covering 124 districts in 14 States to increase the potential coverage to about 53% of the country’s area covering 70% of country’s population.

Why Natural Gas
Natural gas is a superior fuel as compared with coal and other liquid fuels being an environment friendly, safer and cheaper fuel. Natural Gas is supplied through pipelines just like one getswater from the tap. There is no need to store cylinders in the kitchen and thus saves space. As per WHO database released in May 2018, India has 14 out of 15 world’s most polluted cities in terms of PM 2.5 concentration. Large number of industries also consume polluting fuels like pet coke and furnace oil which emit polluting CO2. Some of the courts recently ordered for banning use of pet coke in states within their jurisdiction.

Natural Gas (as CNG) is cheaper by 60% as compared with petrol and 45 % w.r.t. Diesel. Similarly, Natural Gas (as PNG) is cheaper by 40 % as compared with market price LPG and price of PNG almost matches with that of subsidised LPG (based on prices in Delhi). An autorickshaw owner can save Rs 7000-8000 on his monthly fuel bill by conversion from petrol toCNG. Thus, even on cost front as well, natural gas is preferable to petrol, diesel and LPG.

India made a commitment in COP21 Paris Convention in December 2015 that by 2030, it would reduce carbon emission by 33% of 2005 levels. Natural gas, as domestic kitchen fuel, as fuel for transport sector as well as a fuel for industries and commercial units, can play a significant role in reducing carbon emission.

Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production



 

 

2.1  Natural gas production by ONGC during October, 2018 was 2110.39 MMSCM which is 5.12% lower than the monthly targetbut 4.60% higher when compared with October, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC duringApril-October, 2018 was 14127.86MMSCM which is 5.87% lower than the cumulative target but3.18% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year.Some of the reasons for shortfall against monthly target are as under:

 

Ø  Less than planned gas production from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUs Sagar Samrat and Sagar Laxmi.

Ø  Decline of pressure/potential in GS-4 gas cap reservoir in Gandhar.

 

2.2  Natural gas production by OIL during October, 2018 was 235.48 MMSCM which is 13.17% lower than the monthly targetand3.19% lower than October, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-October, 2018 was 1601.27 MMSCM which is 13.96% lower than the cumulative target and7.15% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year.The reason for monthly target shortfall is due to loss of well head production potential of high producing wells of Deohal area, due to downhole tubing corrosion. Work over operations are in progress to revive the wells.

 

2.3        Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during October, 2018 was 451.79 MMSCM which is 12.15% lower than the monthly target and17.50% lower when compared with October, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-October, 2018 was 3322.83MMSCM which is 11.62% lower than the cumulative target and12.65% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

 

•      KG-DWN-98/3: MA field ceased production from 18.09.2018. Closure of 3 wells in D1D3 field. Well A20 ceased to flow in D1D3 field from 23.10.2018. (RIL)

•      RJ-ON/6: Less offtake by buyer. Low gas production due to stuck up in two wells. (FEL)

•       Sohagpur West CBM Block: Underperformance of CBM wells. Production impacted due to the constraint imposed by IFFCO on CBM offtake from 22.09.2018 onwards (RIL).

 

3.        Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)

 

Refinery production during October, 2018 was 21883.06TMT which is 0.63%lower than the target for the month and1.02%lowerwhen compared with October, 2017. Cumulative production during April-October, 2018 was 150541.02 TMT which is 1.69% higher than the target for the period and4.11% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III. Company-wise production for the month of October, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-October, 2018 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production     

                

3.1         CPSE Refineries’ production during October, 2018 was 12938.81TMT which is 1.31%lower than the target for the month but2.54%higher when compared with October, 2017.Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-October, 2018 was 87733.93 TMT which is 1.64% higher than the target for the period and 5.97% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:

 

Ø  IOCL, Guwahati: Throughput is lower due toplanned M&I shutdown.

Ø  IOCL, Gujarat: Throughput is lower due tolower NG crude receipt and AU-1 interruption.

Ø  IOCL, Paradip: Throughputis lower due to high coke stock leading to lower DCU capacity utilization and lower crude throughput.

Ø  HPCL, Mumbai: Throughputis lower due to fresh water supply constraint from source.

Ø  CPCL, Manali: Throughputis lower than target due to M&I shutdown of CDU-2 / FCCU, which was originally scheduled during July / Aug'18.

 

3.2    Production in JV refineries during October, 2018 was 1159.32TMT which is 16.17% lower than the target for the month but 28.05% lowerwhen compared with October, 2017.Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-October, 2018 was 9878.30TMT which is 4.0% higher than the target for the period and22.0%higherthan the production during corresponding period of last year.Reason for shortfall in throughput is due to progressive commissioning of secondary processing units post refinery turnaround of BORL in Aug-Oct’2018.

3.3    Production in private refineries during October, 2018 was 7784.93TMT which is higherby 3.41% than the target for the month but1.18% lowerwhen compared with October, 2017. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-October, 2018 was 52928.79 TMT which is 1.35% higher than the target for the period butlowerby 1.47% compared to production during corresponding period of last year.

                Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi would lay the Foundation Stones of City Gas Distribution (CGD) Projects in 65 Geographical Areas (GAs) in 129 Districts under the 9th CGD Bidding Round recently awarded by PNGRB, remotely from Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi. It would herald the availability of convenient, environment-friendly and cheaper natural gas for almost half of the country’s population spread across 26 States and Union Territories upto 9th round. 

The main event would be held at 4 p.m. on 22nd November, 2018 at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi. At each of the GA across 19 states in India, the authorised entities would also hold their event locally. The event at the Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi would be telecast live at the respective GAs. Thus, the people in 65 different places across India would simultaneously know the plan to implement CGD project in their authorised area. In the local events, the authorised entities plan to invite dignitaries like Chief Ministers, Union Ministers, Ministers in the respective state governments, the local MPs and MLAs besides senior government officials, other eminent persons and public.

During the event, Hon’ble PM would also launch 10th CGD Bidding Round in 50 GAs spread over 124 districts in 14 states.

 

CGD Network

Government of India has put thrust to promote the usage of environment friendly clean fuel i.e. natural gas as a fuel/feedstock across the country to move towards a gas based economy. Accordingly, development of CGD networks has been focused to increase the availability of cleaner cooking fuel (i.e. PNG) and transportation fuel (i.e. CNG) to the citizens of the country. The expansion of CGD network will also benefit to industrial and commercial units by ensuring the uninterrupted supply of natural gas. 

 

Till September 2018, 96 cities/Districts in different parts of the country were covered for development of CGD networks. About 46.5 lakh households and 32 lakh CNG vehicles are availing the benefit of clean fuel through existing CGD networks. To boost the expansion of PNG/CNG network, PNGRB launched 9th CGD bidding round in April, 2018 for 86 Geographical Areas (GAs) covering 174 districts in 22 States/ Union Territories. Subsequent to processing of received bids, grants of authorization have been issued to the successful bidders to develop CGD network for 84 GAs at present. As per commitment made by various entities in this bidding round, around 2 crore PNG (Domestic) connections and 4600 CNG stations are expected to be installed in next 8 years across the country.  This has expanded the potential coverage of CGDs to about 50% of country’s population spreading over 35% of India's area. Various pre-project activities for these GAs have already commenced and efforts are being made to commence the physical works at the site. In addition, PNGRB has also initiated the process of 10th CGD bidding round for additional 50 new GAs covering 124 districts in 14 States to increase the potential coverage to about 53% of the country’s area covering 70% of country’s population. The e-bidding process has been initiated on 8th November, 2018. Pre-bid conference is scheduled on 6th December, 2018. Bids can be submitted by 5th February, 2019; Technical Bids would be opened during 7th to 9th February, 2019. The LoIs are planned to be issued by end-February, 2019.

Why Natural Gas

Natural gas is a superior fuel as compared with coal and other liquid fuels being an environment friendly, safer and cheaper fuel. Natural Gas is supplied through pipelines just like one gets water from the tap. There is no need to store cylinders in the kitchen and thus saves space. As per WHO database released in May 2018, India has 14 out of 15 world’s most polluted cities in terms of PM 2.5 concentration. Large number of industries also consume polluting fuels like pet coke and furnace oil which emit polluting CO2. Some of the courts recently ordered for banning use of pet coke in states within their jurisdiction.

Natural Gas (as CNG) is cheaper by 60% as compared with petrol and 45 % w.r.t. Diesel. Similarly, Natural Gas (as PNG) is cheaper by 40 % as compared with market price LPG and price of PNG almost matches with that of subsidised LPG (based on prices in Delhi). An autorickshaw owner can save Rs. 7000-8000 on his monthly fuel bill by conversion from petrol to CNG. Thus, even on cost front as well, natural gas is preferable to petrol, diesel and LPG.

Share of Natural Gas in India’s energy basket is 6.2% as against 23.4% globally. In India - in the state of Gujarat itself, it is 25%. If Gujarat can achieve share of gas consumption more than global average, rest of India can also.

India made a commitment in COP21 Paris Convention in December 2015 that by 2030, it would reduce carbon emission by 33% of 2005 levels. Natural gas, as domestic kitchen fuel, as fuel for transport sector as well as a fuel for industries and commercial units, can play a significant role in reducing carbon emission.

                The Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has invited the private investors to participate and make the most of the India growth story. Speaking at the roadshow for Discovered Small Field-II bids in Abu Dhabi on Monday, he said that in the last four years, we have made giant strides in oil and gas sector, however the best is yet to come. No country, international organization or company alone can go far without partnership and collaboration.

 

Shri Pradhan said that India is presently the 3rd largest energy consumer in the world. Energy consumption in India in the past decade has increased at a compound annual growth rate of more than 5%. In future too, energy consumption in India is expected to rise by more than 4% annually.  Globally, majority of the growth in energy demand is going to come from India. Our oil & gas demand is expected to increase nearly 3 fold from 229 Million Metric Tons currently to 607 Million Metric Tons in 2040. He said that there are several bright prospects in upstream oil and gas sector in India.

 

The Minister said that Government of India has undertaken measures to overhaul the policy framework encompassing the entire energy value chain to ensure energy security for the country. One of the most important area of focus to ensure energy security is towards the E&P sector. Both Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy and Discovered Small Fields Policy are progressive measures aimed at facilitating investment for exploration in Indian acreages.55 blocks spread across 10 sedimentary basins under maiden Bid Round of Open Acreages Licensing Policy wererecently awarded after a gap of 6 years.  Earlier in 2016, Government had launched Discovered Small Fields Bid Round-I which was a sterling success with 30 contract areas being awarded to 20 companies. The successful completion of DSF Round-I and OALP-I has given us immense confidence, and the second round of DSF and OALP are being launched. Describing this as an unparalleled opportunity, Shri Pradhan said DSF II includes 60 discoveries with an estimated in-place reserve of over 195 Million Metric Tons of Oil and Oil Equivalent Gas.  OALP Bid Round II includes 14 Blocks with a total area of 29,233 Square Kilometer. 

 

Shri Pradhan said that the Government has also brought out various others policy reformsincluding such as Coal Bed Methane policy, incentivize Enhanced Recovery for augmenting production of oil and gas from matured fields, exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbon from all fields. He said that a state of the art National Data Repository has been set up which is a database of all the geo-scientific data of hydrocarbon resources in the country.  National Data Repository is equipped with cutting edge technology and provides ready access to interested companies. 


 

The Minister said that India accords high priority to promoting a gas based and clean economy. Currently natural gas forms a relatively small share of our energy mix. Gas infrastructure projects of over 8 billion US dollars are under implementation across the country. We aim to increase share of natural gas in energy mix from current 6.5% to 15% by 2022. Going forward, we intend to create a robust natural gas trading hub. The process to formalise the concept has already been initiated by our Government.

Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL)signed today a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Abu Dhabi with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to explore the possibility of storing ADNOC crude oil at ISPRL’s underground oil storage facility at Padur in Karnataka, which has a 2.5 million tonne capacity. Under the MoU, ADNOC is expected to store crude in compartments at Padur. 

The MoU with ISPRL, an Indian government-owned company mandated to store crude oil for emergency needs, follows the arrival, on November 4, of the final shipment of the initial delivery of ADNOC crude to be stored in another ISPRL underground facility at Mangalore, also in Karnataka, which will store 5.86 million barrels of ADNOC crude oil. 

 



 

The MoU was signed by Abdulla Salem Al Dhaheri, Director of Marketing, Sales and Trading at ADNOC and Mr. HPS Ahuja CEO & MD ISPRL on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC). The signing was witnessed by H.E. Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of State and ADNOC Group CEO, and Shri. Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Government of India. 

 



 

On the occasion, H.E. Dr Al Jaber said “India is an important oil market and this agreement underscores the strategic energy partnership between the UAE and India that leverages the UAE and ADNOC’s expertise and oil resources. It is our firm hope that we will be able to convert this framework agreement into a new mutually beneficial partnership that will create opportunities for ADNOC to increase deliveries of high quality crude oil to India's expanding energy market and helping India meet its growing energy demand and safeguard its energy security.” 

ADNOC is the only foreign oil and gas company, so far, to invest by way of crude oil in India’s strategic petroleum reserves program. 

Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said “This Memorandum of Understanding will allow ISPRL to explore, with ADNOC, opportunities related to the possible storage of ADNOC crude at Padur, which would help to significantly strengthen the country’s strategic petroleum reserves. This agreement reflects the strong bonds of cooperation between India and the UAE and provides a foundation for strengthening and expanding our strategic energy relationship.” 

ISPRL has already built 5.33 million tonnes of underground storage capacity at three locations - Visakhapatnam (1.33 million tonnes), Mangalore (1.5 million tonnes) and Padur (2.5 million tonnes), that can meet around 9.5 days of the country’s oil needs as per consumption data of last financial year. The government of India, in June 2018,announced the creation of two new reserves, a 4 million tonnes storage facility at Chandikhol in the eastern state of Odisha and an additional 2.5 million-tonne facility at Padur. 

The existing and newly announced strategic reserve facilities put together will provide around 21 days of emergency coverage for India’s crude oil requirements.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of India joining as Member of Advanced Motor Fuels Technology Collaboration Programme (AMF TCP)under International Energy Agency (IEA) on 9thMay, 2018.  AMF TCP works under the framework of International Energy Agency (IEA) to which India has ""Association"" status since 30thMarch, 2017.

 

Details:

 

The primary goal of joining AMF TCP by Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoP&NG) is to facilitate the market introduction of Advanced motor fuels/ Alternate fuels with an aim to bring down emissions and achieve higher fuel efficiency in transport sector. AMF TCP also provides an opportunity for fuel analysis, identifying new/ alternate fuels for deployment in transport sector and allied R&D activities for reduction in emissions in fuel intensive sectors.

 

The R&D work in AMF TCP is carried out within individual projects called ""Annex"". Over the years, more than 50 Annexes have been initiated in AMF TCP and a number of fuels have been covered in previous Annexes such as reformulatedfuels (gasoline & diesel), biofuels (ethanol, biodiesel etc.), synthetic fuels (methanol, Fischer- Tropsch, DME etc.) and gaseous fuels. R&D Institutions of Public sector Oil Marketing companies and Automobile Testing Agencies such as ARAI, CIRT, ICAT etc. have State-of-the-art facilities and resources will also be a contributor to the Annex(s) participated by MoP&NG.

 

Prime Minister at UrjaSangam, 2015 had directed to reduce the import in energy sector by at least 10% by 2022.  Subsequently, MoP&NG has come up with a detailed action plan wherein Biofuels, Advanced/ alternate fuels and fuel efficiency play a major role. Association with AMF TCP will help MoP&NG in furthering its efforts in identification & deployment of suitable fuels for transport sector in respect of higher efficiency and lesser emissions.

 

Government of India has recently notified National Policy on Biofuels-2018 which focusses on giving impetus to R&D in field of advanced biofuels such as 2G Ethanol, Bio-CNG, biomethanol, Drop-in fuels, DME etc. These advanced fuels can be produced from various kind of wastes such as crop residues, Municipal solid waste, Industrial waste, waste gases, Food waste, plastic etc. Though some of these advanced biofuels have successfully been deployed in few countries, India is still awaiting its deployment in transport sector. These advanced fuels are presently in their early stages of development in our Country and necessitate extensive R&D for making these fuels a viable option for meeting our energy needs. Association with AMF will help MoP&NG in identifying advanced biofuels suitable for deployment in transport sector in near future. In such cases, experience of member countries in deploying advanced biofuels will be an additional benefit for MoP&NG.

 

The benefits of participation in AMF TCP are shared costs and pooled technical resources. The duplication of efforts is avoided and national Research and Development capabilities are strengthened. There is an information exchange about best practices, network of researchers and linking research with practical implementation. After becoming member, India will initiate R&D in other areas of its interest in advanced biofuels and other motor fuels in view of their crucial role in substituting fossil fuel imports.

 

Background:

 

AMF TCP is an international platform for co-operation among countries to promote cleaner and more energy efficient fuels & vehicle technologies. The activities of AMF TCP relate to R&D, deployment and dissemination of Advanced Motor Fuels and looks upon the transport fuel issues in a systemic way taking into account the production, distribution and end use related aspects.

 

Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Government of India has joined AMF TCP as its 16th member on 9th May, 2018. The other member Countries of AMF TCP are USA, China, Japan, Canada, Chile, Israel, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Spain, Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Thailand.

                          The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the filling of Padur Strategic Petroleum Reserves(SPR) at Padur, Karnataka by overseas National Oil Companies (NOCs). The SPR facility at Padur is an underground rock cavern with a total capacity of 2.5 million metric tonnes (MMT) having four compartments of 0.625 MMT each. The filling of the SPR under PPP model is being undertaken to reduce budgetary support of Government of India. 

 

          The Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd. (ISPRL) has constructed and commissioned underground rock caverns for storage of total 5.33 MMT of crude oil at three locations namely Vishakhapatnam (1.33 MMT), Mangalore (1.5 MMT) and Padur (2.5 MMT). The total 5.33 MMT capacity under Phase-I of the SPR programme is currently estimated to supply approximately 9.5 days of India’s crude requirement according to the consumption data for FY 2017-18. Government has given ‘in principle’ approval in June 2018 for establishing additional 6.5 MMT SPR facilities at Chandikhol in Odisha and Padur in Karnataka, which is expected to augment India’s energy security by 11.5 days according the consumption data for FY 2017-18.

                “8 States have achieved 100% saturation in household electrification under Saubhagya namely Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Bihar, J&K, Mizoram, Sikkim, Telangana and West Bengal. Thus total 15 States in the countrynow have 100 % household electrification.” said Shri RK Singh, Union Minister of State (IC) for Power and Renewable Energy. Shri Singh was speaking to media after the ‘Review, Planning & Monitoring (RPM) Meeting with States and State Power Utilities’ here today. 

Saubhagya – ‘Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana’ was launched in September, 2017 with the objective to provide access to electricity to all the remaining households in the country.The Minister informed that as many as 2.1 crore connections have been released under Saubhagya so far.

“Many more State like Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh etc. are left with small number of un-electrified households and expected to achieve saturation any time.” said the Minister adding that with the present pace of electrification, Nation is expected to achieve 100% saturation in the country by 31st December, 2018.

The Minister further said, “Achievement of 100% household electrification in the country would be a major milestone in the direction to achieve 24x7 power for all. The Government is committed to ensure 24x7 access to electricity for all by 31st March 2019.”

In order to ensure that no un-electrified household is left in the States which have already achieved 100% household electrification, they have been requested to take up campaign to publicise the achievement all across the areas, so that anyone left out for any reasons may avail electricity connection under Saubhagya. 

Award Scheme under Saubhagya:

For creating healthy competition amongst various DISCOMs/Power Departments of States,     an award scheme has been instituted with awards of more than Rs 300crore to be won by States/Discoms. The first DISCOM/Power Departments to complete 100% household electrification will be felicitated with cash award of Rs. 50 Lakh for the employees and Rs.100 crore grant to be spent for distribution infrastructure. For the purpose of award, States have been divided into 3 categories and award would be given in each of these categories.

The States completing 100% household electrification by 31st Dec. 2018 will also receive additional grant of 15% of the project cost (5% for special category States) sanctioned under Saubhagya.

Benefits to the Citizen:

 

Electricity in households has brought new light in their lives. Electrification has direct positive impact on the quality of all aspects of daily life, especially to the women and children.

With deeper penetration of electricity network, significant improvement is expected in delivery of other essential services like education, health, communication etc. and thereby more opportunities for economic activities leading to employment generation, increase in income and poverty alleviation.

                 “Energy efficiency saves the environment and makes businesses more competitive. While India needs to grow but we need to grow responsibly and the Government has taken several measures in this regard.” said Shri R K Singh, Union Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy. The Minister was speaking at the inaugural of the International Symposium to Promote Innovation & Research in Energy Efficiency (INSPIRE 2018) here today. This is the second edition of INSPIRE and is being organised by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) and World Bank. The three-day symposium will focus on enhancing grid management, e-Mobility, financial instruments and technologies for energy efficiency in India.

 

The Minister further said, “Innovations in the field of energy efficiency are critical to meet our GHG (green house gases) emission targets and the Government has taken several initiatives in this regard”. He also gave away awards to four pathbreaking innovations in clean energy and energy efficiency as part of #InnovateToINSPIRE, a first-of-its-kind energy innovation challenge.

 

The #InnovateToINSPIRE challenge was organized by EESL and World resources Institute (WRI) between 21 August, 2018 and 12 October, 2018 in the run-up to INSPIRE 2018. The challenge invited participants to submit sustainable and scalable solutions to seven specific challenges spanning grid management, e-Mobility, energy efficient technologies and financial instruments. From 94 entries, four winners were selected by an eminent jury comprised of Indian and international experts in the field of energy. The winning entries received an award of Rs. 5 lakhs, each, along with mentoring and guidance from EESL to help them bring their solutions to market.

 

To support investments in new, innovative and scalable business models, EESL and Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed an agreement for a Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant of USD 13 million to establish an Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund (EERF). EERF aims to expand and sustain investments in the energy efficiency market in India, build market diversification, and scale up existing technologies.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Ajay Bhalla, Secretary, Power said that India’s energy efficiency efforts were being lauded world over. He also said that innovation challenge was a very good idea to promote energy efficiency.

Shri Rajeev Sharma, Chairman, EESL said, “Innovation is the most important enabler for resolving environmental problems while reducing costs.”

During INSPIRE 2018, EESL and GAIL, a wholly owned subsidiary of GAIL (India) Limited signed a MoU to develop natural gas based cogeneration and trigeneration projects in Commercial & Industrial Sectors in India. This MoU is set to benefit industries such as Hotels, Hospitals, Airports, Commercial Malls, Commercial/Government Buildings, Integrated Residential Complexes, Educational Institutions, Data Center, among others, with the advantages of Combined Heat & Power technology.

INSPIRE 2018 has been organised in collaboration with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), The Energy & Resources Institute (TERI), Asian Development Bank (ADB), the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), and the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI). The event is bringing together policy-makers, influencers, innovators, thought leaders, researchers, leading energy-efficient companies, government agencies, business leaders and other stakeholders to deliberate on key energy policies, market transformation strategies, and sustainable business models that will help leverage the full potential of energy efficiency and bring its multiple co-benefits to the fore.

The event was attended by senior officials from the Ministry of Power, EESL, Dr. Junaid K. Ahmad, Country Director, The World Bank (WB); Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director, Asian Development Bank (ADB).

                Prompt action taken by POWERGRID has brought back the valley’s power to normalcy which was affected by the heavy snowfall in the late evening of 3rd November, 2018 and morning of 4th November, 2018. The 1600 MW normal load of power in J&K is being fulfilled in the state presently.

 

Heavy snowfall in areas of Jammu and Kashmir threw the normal life out of gear in the state as people suffered immensely due to power breakdown in the valley.

Both POWERGRID transmission lines namely 400 kV Double Circuit New Wanpoh-Kishenpur and 400 kV Double Circuit New Wanpoh-Wagoora tripped in the morning of 4th November, 2018. As soon as the fault was noticed, quick action was taken by POWERGRID immediately and all POWERGRID lines were restored within a span of about half an hour. 

 

During the snowfall, three JK-PDD lines namely 132 kV Mir Bazar-Kulgam, 132 kV Mir Bazar-Lisser, 132 kV Lassipora-Shopian were also affected due to failure of towers. The local level restoration of transmission lines is being done by JK-PDD and POWERGRID jointly. POWERGRID is providing all required support along with expert manpower for quick restoration by deploying Emergency Restoration System (ERS). Power is now available in the valley and affected JK-PDD transmission lines are being restored proactively.

                Running of freight trains in a block through Convoy Movement by creating coaching free corridors has been a major initiative undertaken since September, 2018, for improving freight throughput, especially on the coal carrying routes. Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal has been closely following up on the implementation of this initiative.

This innovative way of running freight traffic has been successfully implemented on Korba-Bilaspur-Anupur-New Katni-Agasod/Bina-Jhansi-Kota routes, Ghaziabad-Allahabad-Pt. Deen Dayal Upadyaya Junction routes and Bilaspur-Jharsuguda-Rourkela sections.  This convoy system was also tried on the Asansol-Jhajha-Barauni section (251.65 kms) on 3rd/4th November, 2018 which was successful. 

In order to maximize throughput during the coaching free corridors, detailed planning of loads, locomotives and crews is being done.  Senior officers are deputed in the control offices to monitor the planning, ordering and running of freight trains in the convoy.  Traffic inspectors and loco inspectors are deputed to foot-plate in the locomotives of the freight trains to ensure no time loss takes place in the clearance of block sections. 

Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of Railways and Coal chairing a review meeting of the senior officers of Railway Board and Zonal Railways on this innovative Freight Convoy Initiative applauded the all out efforts put in by Railway Officers and staff in successful implementation of this movement. He further said that successful endeavors should be made to expand the Freight Capacity of Indian Railways without compromising the overall passenger movement and maintenance requirements. 

The increase in  freight throughput across identified key sections /interchange points of SECR, WCR, NCR, ECR and ER during the days of freight convoy system has been as under:-

Thus, both in the loaded direction and in the empties direction there was significant increase in freight trains and throughput.

At present, ECR, ER, NCR, SECR, SER and WCR are running freight Convoys in some corridors. Other Zonal Railways will also take up running of freight corridors on their routes based on requirements. It is felt that, there is huge potential for increasing freight throughput across all Zonal Railways by introduction of freight Convoy System for 2 or 3 times a week.  This would help in improving mobility of rakes required for coal loading as well as other commodities.

                On 2nd November’ 2018, simultaneous raids against e-ticket touting were conducted in more than 100 cities throughout the Indian Railways on ‘All India’ basis.

Acting on various sources, a detailed analysis of booking pattern of railway reserved e-tickets was done by the Security Directorate, Railway Board. RPF examined minutely various modus operandi being used by touting element to procure and sell e-tickets unauthorisedly through Personal User Ids.

Accordingly, out of more than total 5 crore users, a list of most suspected personal user IDs was prepared at Railway Board, New Delhi. This congenial list of suspected users were, then shared with Zonal Heads of RPF (IG-cum-PCSCs) through a secret communication to maintain element of surprise in the entire operation (Code Name – Operation Storm).

Detailed instructions of the Director General/RPF were also conveyed regarding thorough verification of credentials & activities of all suspects at ground level well in advance of the proposed raid.

Though, the investigation is still going, information received so far is as under:-


	185 Touts, indulged in touting activities since long, arrested & prosecuted. During the nation-wide raid, maximum (40) touts were arrested over Western Railways followed by Eastern Railway (32).
	1875 future journey e-tickets worth 35.68 lakh forfeited.
	One illegal software was also detected in Mumbai.
	1268 Personal User IDs, which were being used to carry out touting activities, sent to IRCTC for deactivating them immediately.
	166 cases under section 143 of the Railways Act’ 1989 have been registered at various RPF Posts and taken up for investigation. Persons found involved in abetment of touting activities, will also be taken up appropriately as per extant legal provisions.


Keeping in view the ongoing festival season, a drive against touting element is already going on since 7th October’ 2018. During this drive (Upto 2nd November’2018), total 891 touts have so far been arrested with the recovery of future journey tickets worth Rs. 1.50 crore and total tickets worth Rs. 5.75 crore. 

The drive and investigation of cases is still going on. Team RPF is committed to take strong & sustained action against touting elements in future also.

                The unfortunate incident of run over by a train at Amritsar leading to several deaths and injuries has become a matter of great public discourse especially raising concerns regarding safety of persons trespassing on railway tracks. Shri Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Hon’ble MP from Amritsar met Hon’ble Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal and personally handed over his letter dated 23.10.2018 and requested for an inquiry by Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) in this incident. Ministry of Railways has considered this request and other facts, circumstances and legal provisions. As per law, in such cases, it is not mandatory to conduct inquiry by Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety (CCRS), but it is not impermissible either. In past, CRS inquiry was conducted in an incident of run over of persons on railway tracks. Though, prima facie, Railways does not appear to be responsible in this incident, issue of inquiry by an independent and technically competent authority not reporting to Ministry of Railways was considered and request was made to CCRS to conduct an inquiry in this matter. Considering this, Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety (CCRS), Lucknow has ordered statutory inquiry into this incident.

                Ministry of Railways has introduced Unreserved Mobile Ticketing with a view to promote three C’s- Cashless transactions (Digital payment), Contact less ticketing (no need to physically visit the point of sale) and Customer convenience and experience. As a big leap, booking of unreserved tickets on all non-suburban sections across all Zonal Railways has been made available from 1st November to enable seamless booking of unreserved tickets all over Indian Railways which will obviate the need for passengers to wait in queues for purchasing the tickets.

A pilot project for booking of unreserved tickets through mobile phone was commenced in December, 2014 on select stations on Central Railway to provide customers the convenience of booking of unreserved tickets without having to stand in queues.  

Gradually, unreserved Mobile ticketing was extended to all suburban sections in metropolitan cities of Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata and Secunderabad between 2015 and 2017 along with the facility of paperless ticketing.  The facility of booking unreserved tickets, including season tickets and also platform tickets is available through the ‘UTSONMOBILE’ app available for Android, IOS and Windows phones.  

The process of ticket booking involves downloading the application and registration by furnishing the requisite details. After successful registration, the user is given user-ID and password through which the user can log-in and book ticket through this application within the ticketing area and outside the Geo-fenced area (geofenced area is station premises and train route within which ticket cannot be booked.  Ticketing area is outside the geofenced area as defined in the application).  Initially, the payment could be made only through R-Wallet. Subsequently, the facility of making payment through all types of digital modes i.e. debit card, credit card, net-banking, UPI and other e-wallets has been introduced through payment aggregators viz. Paytm, Mobikwik and Freecharge, in line with Government’s directives to promote all digital modes of payments.  The daily average number of passengers booking tickets through this app has increased from approximately 5400 in year 2015 to 4.70 lakh in October, 2018.  

The UTSONMOBILE was also introduced on Non-Suburban sections in 2015 initially on Delhi-Palwal section of Northern Railway which was subsequently extended to other non-suburban sections of Northern, South Central, Southern, South Western, East Coast, South East Central and South Eastern Railways.  

Benefits of the App: 


	 
	Mobile Ticketing shall promote 3C’s- Cashless transactions, Contact less ticketing and Customer convenience. 
	Seamless booking of unreserved tickets all over Indian Railways.

                Union Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Chemical & Fertilizers Shri Mansukh Mandaviya has said that major initiatives have been taken in the transport sector for the benefit of citizens. Speaking in New Delhi today, he said, by increasing the Axle load of trucks by 20 to 25 per cent, their load carrying capacity has increased phenomenally. It has not only added to the income of transporters, but has also resulted in lesser pollution.

The Minister said, in view of modern technology in automobiles, fitness test requirement for commercial vehicle has been changed. In place of the earlier provision of yearly tests, now they need to get it done every two years. Another major step is total exclusion of new commercial vehicles from mandatory fitness tests. He said, this has resulted in fewer visits to RTOs, saving time and money.

Shri Mandaviya said, the transporters are now free to paint their trucks in the colour of their choice, instead of the mandatory brown colour. They can now utilize this space for advertisements, etc further adding to their income. This will also bring cleanliness in trucks, he said. Further, all commercial vehicles are required to be kept completely covered to avoid pollution from dust etc.

The Minister said, mandatory fixing of fastags in all new vehicles and transport vehicles has started showing saving in time – as they do not need to stop at toll plazas, and money – as they get 5% rebate. Tracking of vehicles is now easy, and the drivers do not need to carry cash for payments etc. The system is proving beneficial for toll operators, with better collection of toll and reduced pollution.

                Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu will lay the foundation stone for the construction of Dera Baba Nanak - Kartarpur Sahib road Corridor (upto international border ) at a function in village Mann in Gurdaspur district of Punjab on Monday, the 26th of November, 2018.

 

Union Minister for Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Food Processing Smt. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Capt. Amrinder Singh, Chief Minister of Punjab will be present on the occasion.

 

Guru Nanak Dev ji had assembled the Sikh community at Kartarpur and lived there for 18 years till 1539. The Gurudwara Darbar Sahib is built where Guru Nanak Dev Ji took his last breath. 

 

To mark Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s 550th birth anniversary in 2019, the Government of India decided on 22nd Nov 2018 to build the Kartarpur road Corridor upto the international border between India and Pakistan as an integrated development project. The Corridor will let Sikh pilgrims visit the iconic Gurudwara Darbar Sahib at  Kartarpur  on the banks of river Ravi in Pakistan.

 

India and Pakistan had announced on 15th Nov 2018 that they will build Corridors on their respective sides to let Sikh pilgrims visit the holy shrine without visa and to help them walk across and come back without having to secure a visa. 

 

The Indian side of Corridor starts from Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district and extends upto International border between India and Pakistan. The project corridor is to be developed by National Highways Authority of India and will be  funded by Government of India. The project corridor is 4 lane with service road and all other appropriate amenities for pilgrims intending to visit Gurudwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur in Pakistan. 

 

This corridor will be a historical landmark between India and Pakistan and will also boost tourism as more pilgrims would visit the holy shrine throughout the year between two countries.

                CSIR-Central Road Research Institute has organized a two-day international conference titled “Pavements and Computational Approaches” from 16-17 November 2018, at its premises in New Delhi. The objective of the conference is to deliberate upon advancements in pavement technology and road infrastructure engineering across the world, with special emphasis to the requirements of developing countries. Experts will discuss issues related to design and construction of pavements, material characterization, computational analysis and modelling. Deliberations during the conference are likely to bring out new thoughts on technology up-gradation and its successful implementation in the field. 

Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation has said in a video message that the mission of the Road Transport & highways Ministry is to build high quality roads at low costs. He called upon the experts at the conference to be ready to experiment with innovative technology, make all possible use of indigenous raw material including waste material, and promote pre-cast technology. He said the thrust of technological innovation should be on reducing costs and time for completion of projects without any compromise on quality.  

The ageing infrastructure, road congestion, growth in heavy vehicle traffic, and insufficient maintenance have rendered the road transport inefficient in developing countries. Major challenges to the road network require a clear focus on enhanced pavement design, construction, performance evaluation, management and preservation for developing long-lasting, low-maintenance pavements. Within this milieu, enhanced and optimized solutions to the current problems have a key role in developing and preserving the road infrastructure. Dedicated R&D efforts are needed in the theme areas such as development of smart materials, innovative design and maintenance technologies, improved data analysis approaches for pavement performance and management, improvements in material behaviour characterization, use of soft computing tools for analysis and modelling of pavements. 

The conference is being attended by nearly 250 delegates including young researchers, entrepreneurs, academicians and field engineers. There will be more than 45 technical presentations by the researchers/ engineers highlighting their work in different themes of the conference. The conference would be an ideal platform for sharing of ideas and networking with professionals and researchers from different countries and regions.

                Union Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Chemical & Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh Mandaviya has expressed confidence over the successful implementation of the BhoomiRashi Portal in Land Acquisition process for roads and highways sector in the country. Speaking in New Delhi today Shri Mandaviya said that digitalization in India is reaching new heights under the able leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, and the Bhoomi-Rashi portal of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways is an excellent testimony to this success.  The portal allows for totally digital and paper-less processing of land acquisition cases, and has resulted in transparent, quick, corruption-free and error-free handling of land acquisition cases.It has alsomade the possible real-time tracking of activities and generation of reports relating to land acquisition. 

 

Shri Mandaviyainformed that revenue records of about 7 lakh villages across the country have been integrated in the portal. He said, this digital change has drastically reduced the time taken for issuance of land acquisition notifications from 3-6 months to 1-2 weeks. The Minister informed that while during the past two years, about a thousand land acquisition notifications could be issued every year, over 1700 notifications have already been issued by the Ministry in the first seven months of this financial year. 

 

Shri Mandaviya further said that the process has also brought transparency in the system. Earlier the approved compensation amount used to be parked with the CALA (Competent Authority for Land Acquisition) but with BhoomiRashi portal this amount directly transferred into the account of the person concerned, through Public Financial Management System which is an integral part of the portal. In addition to this, the process is also environment friendly since there is no physical movement of files – all work is done digitally.  Shri Mandaviya said the BhoomiRashi portal is truly a success story of Digital India.

                Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation will attend a Road Show on the second bundle of Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) in Mumbai on the 15th of this month. The event will be organized by National Highways Development Authority (NHAI) at 10.30 AM in Hotel Hyatt Regency, Sahar Airport Road, Mumbai. The objective of the Road Show is to invite prospective investors to be a part of the TOT projects. NHAI has done successful Road Shows in New Delhi, New York and Toronto in August and September this year. 

TOT is a model for monetizing operational National Highways projects. The investor makes a lump sum payment in return for long term toll collection rights backed by a sound tolling system. The concession period is 30 years. Upto 49 % divestment is allowed till two years of the concession period. Upto 10 % change isn ownership is allowed after two years. The investor is de-risked from undertaking any construction. If required, NHAI will conduct capacity augmentation at its own cost. 

The first TOT bundle of 9 projects, totalling approximately 681 KM of roads in two states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, was awarded in 2018. Huge interest was shown by foreign investors. TOT Bundle-I was awarded to Macquarie for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the Authority’s estimate.National Highways Authority of India did a financial closure of this  project,  with the India chief of Macquarie handing over a cheque for Rs 9,681.5 crore to Shri Nitin Gadkari on 29th August 2018 in New Delhi

The second bundle of over 586 kms is now offered spread over four States – Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Bihar. The offer has 12 toll plazas across four highways.

TOT Bundle II

The stretches offered are operational highways with a proven tolling history of at least 2 years

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has said that Varanasi and the whole country are witness to the fulfilment of a dream today. Expressing happiness at the way next generation transport infrastructure has grown in the last four years he said, airports in remote areas, train network expanding to the north eastern parts of the country and a grand network of roads even in rural areas is now the identity of his government.

The Prime Minister was speaking in Varanasi at two events to launch a series of national highways, inland waterways and sewerage infrastructure projects in the city today. Dedicating the inland waterways multi modal terminal on river Ganga to the nation he said the project will reconnect us to our glorious past, and link Eastern Uttar Pradesh to the North Eastern parts of the country. He also said that the modern road between Babatpur airport and Varanasi will attract tourists from all parts of the country. The Ring Road built at a cost of Rs 760 crore will ease the traffic in the city. He said, connectivity not only improves opportunities, it also strengthens the belief and confidence of the people.

Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Road Transport & Highways and Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari said that work is on for ensuring enough draught in River Ganga from its origin in Gangotri to its last point in Gangasagar in West Bengal. He said, during the forthcoming Kumbh, ferries will run between Varanasi and Prayagraj. Shri Gadkari said, as many as 268 water cleaning projects worth a thousand crore rupees are being undertaken in the country. In a recent examination of water quality at 80 places on Ganga, water was found pure at 55 sites. He expressed hope that these efforts will bear fruit and by coming March, 70 to 80 per cent Ganga will become pure.

The Prime Minister dedicated to the nation, two important national highways in Varanasi, having a total length of 34 kilometres and constructed at a cost of Rs 1571.95 crore. The 16.55 km Varanasi Ring Road Phase-I has been completed at a cost of Rs 759.36 crore, while the work of four-laning and construction of 17.25 km Babatput-Varanasi road on NH-56 has cost Rs 812.59 crore. The Babatpur Airport highway links Varanasi to the airport and goes on to Jaunpur, Sultanpur and Lucknow. With a flyover at Harhua and an ROB at Tarna, the road will reduce the travel time from Varanasi to the airport. This will prove a big relief to the people of Varanasi and to tourists and other visitors to the city.

The Ring Road, with two ROBs and a flyover, will provide a way for traffic on NH 56 (Lucknow-Varanasi), NH 233 (Azamgarh-Varanasi), NH 29 (Gorakhpur-Varanasi ) and Ayodhya – Varanasi highways to bypass Varanasi city, thereby reducing traffic congestion in the city. This will reduce travel time, fuel usage and pollution in the area. The Ring Road will provide easier and more convenient access to Sarnath, an important site for Buddhist pilgrimage. These projects will also provide increased employment opportunities, development of small and medium industries and give a boost to economic development in the area.

The Prime Minister also dedicated to the nation an inland waterways terminal on river Ganga in Varanasi. This is the first of the four multi modal terminals being constructed on NW-I (River Ganga) as part of the World Bank aided Jal Marg Vikas project of the Inland Waterways Authority of India. The other three terminals are under construction at Sahibganj, Haldia and Gazipur. The project would enable commercial navigation of vessels with capacity of 1500-2,000 DWT on river Ganga. PM also received the country’s first container consignment to be sent on an inland waterways vessel. This consignment containing cargo of the food and beverage company Pepsico set sail from Kolkata in the last week of October.

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi also dedicated to the nation three sewage infrastructure projects costing Rs 425.41 crore for the city of Varanasi and laid the foundation stone for another project. The first is a 140 MLD Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at Dinapur built at a cost of Rs 235.53 Crore. The project includes 10 years’ Operation & Maintenance agreement. The second project includes three sewage pumping stations at Chaukaghat (140 MLD), Phulwaria (7.6 MLD) and Saraiya (3.7 MLD). The total cost for the three pumping stations was Rs 34.01. The third project is the construction of 28 km long relieving trunk sewer, rising mains and interceptor sewers along Varuna & Assi at a cost of Rs 155.87 Crore.

PM laid the foundation stone for Sewerage Management Scheme for Ramnagar. This will include a 10 MLD STP and intercepting and diverting 4 drains. The sewerage projects will result in increasing the sewage treatment capacity in the city from 102 MLD to 242 MLD. The long term O&M provision will ensure that the STP is not only created but is being operated and maintained properly. These projects will result in reducing the pollution of the river Ganga.

These project along with 2 other ongoing projects of 120 MLD at Goitha and 50 MLD STP at Ramana will take the sewage treatment capacity in the city to 412 MLD, which will be adequate for the sewage treatment requirements till year 2035.

Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that the country needs futuristic technology for developing its transport sector. He stressed upon the need to cut down congestion and resultant pollution in cities. Reiterating his commitment for promoting transport innovations that are pollution free and cost effective, he said that ropeways, cable cars, funicular railways can be very useful means of transport for hilly and difficult terrains and as last mile connectivity options in congested cities. He said these transport options would also be very useful for tier two cities and hoped these would motivate people to shift from personal to public transport.

Shri Gadkari was speaking in New Delhi today at the MoU signing between WAPCOS and Doppelmayr for providing end-to-end solutions for passenger ropeway projects. WAPCOS is a leading engineering consultancy organisation of the Government of India, which has grown into an Indian multinational with projects in over 45 countries across the world. Doppelmayr, Austria are the world’s largest ropeway manufacturers with cutting-edge ropeway technologies. It has set up more than 15,000 ropeway installations across the world.  

The MoU includes the entire gamut of preparing feasibility studies, detailed project reports, construction, equipment supply, operation and maintenance, etc. It will enable development of ropeway projects in various states using globally accepted standards for passenger safety and reliability. These projects will not only reduce traffic congestion and pollution, but will also contribute towards development of tourism destinations and provide impetus to employment generation in the country.

Shri Gadkari said, this is a historical day as it will change the face of urban transport in the country. Cable cars and ropeways have already proven to be successful in Bolivia, Vietnam, Switzerland and many other countries. He said, the government is exploring the use of new kinds of vehicles like hybrid aeroboats that combine land, water and aviation technology and can run on land, water and air at speeds greater than 80 km per hour. The Minister informed that ten National Waterways including Ganga are being developed for transport. It will soon be possible to carry goods from Varanasi right up to Bangladesh and the North Eastern states of our country on waterways.  

 

Shri Nitin Gadkari again called for the use of alternate fuels in transport sector. He said, by use of methanol, ethanol and electric sources, the country can make huge savings on petroleum imports.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has reiterated the Government’s commitment for promoting transport innovations that are pollution free and cost effective, and bring about import substitution. Underscoring the need to cut down congestion and resultant pollution in cities, he expressed hope that the government’s vision and efforts for building a safe and efficient public transport system in the country would motivate people to shift from personal to public transport. 

Shri Gadkari was speaking at an event in New Delhi today, where he released India’s first Ease of Mobility Index 2018. The Index offers a source of information to aid transit agencies and urban planners to make informed decisions and align solutions with the preference of commuters. The report has been prepared by Ola Mobility Institute - Ola’s research and social innovation arm.

The Minister informed that the government is exploring the use of new kinds of vehicles like hybrid aeroboats that combine land, water and aviation technology and can run on land, water and air at speeds greater than 80 km per hour. He said the government is looking at the possibility of using these boats during Kumbh Mela next year and on Yamuna for a visit to Taj Mahal from Delhi.

Shri Gadkari also informed that the government is also looking at the possibility of using aerial transport systems like ropeways, pods etc, especially for hilly terrains and as a last mile connectivity option in congested cities.

Further emphasizing the need for public transport Shri Gadkari said that the government will soon start a campaign to promote the use of bicycles. He said the new expressways are being built with provisions for cycle tracks. Electric cycles will soon be in use. He called upon the taxi aggregators to consider using bicycles for transporting single passengers. Shri Gadkari also expressed happiness that after the Government brought in the taxi aggregators guidelines, the number of shared taxis has risen greatly and is likely to cross the one crore mark in a few years.

Shri Nitin Gadkari further advocated the use of alternate fuels in this sector. He said, by use of methanol, ethanol and electric sources, the country can save huge sums on petroleum imports. Also, people in backward areas can find an additional source of income by opting to generate bio-gas from local sources in a big way. He promised governmental support to such people by way of imparting education and training for adopting the new technology. 

The Ease of Moving Index, 2018 has found that overall, 80 per cent of citizens believe that the transport ecosystem has improved over the last five years. 60 per cent of respondents report using public modes of commute, signalling that integrating modes of first and last mile connectivity with mass transport could lead to improved usage. In fact, 72 per cent of the respondents believe that this integration could lead to an improved public transport ecosystem. A majority of Indians are willing to adopt electric mobility and are in agreement that electrification will reshape the transportation segment. 75 per cent of respondents believe that electric vehicles could replace conventional vehicles by 2030. Additionally, results indicate that urban mobility is going digital with 55 per cent of commuters who use public transport owning smart cards, and over 40 per cent transact digitally while using public transport including Intermediary Public Transport.

                A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the partnership between Department of Biotechnology and Cancer Research UK for the India-UK India-UK Cancer Research Initiative was signed today in New Delhi.The India-UK Cancer Research Initiative is a collaborative 5-year bilateral research initiative by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science & Technology, India and Cancer Research UK (CRUK) that will focus on affordable approaches to cancer. Both CRUK and DBT will invest £5m each in this 5-year pilot, and seek further investment from other potential funding partners.

The India-UK Cancer Research Initiative will identify a core set of research challenges that address issues of affordability, prevention and care of cancer by bringing together leading Indian and UK experts across clinical research, demographic research, new technologies and physical sciences. The initiative will provide funding to develop new research alliances and undertake impactful research to enable significant progress against cancer outcomes.

This is a follow up of the joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of India and UK during the visit of Prime Minister of India,Shri Narendra Modi to UK on April 18, 2018. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had then stated, “As thriving democracies, we share a desire to work closely together and with all who share our objective to support a rules-based international order that upholds agreed international norms, global peace and stability. Together the UK and India are a force for good in an uncertain world. We are sharing our experience and knowledge to tackle global challenges. India’s Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Cancer Research UK propose to launch a £10 million bilateral research initiative which will focus on low cost approaches to cancer treatment.”

Speaking at the launch of this initiative, Secretary, DBT ,Dr. Renu Swarup, said , “Cancer is a global epidemic that requires radically new approaches through inter-disciplinary and multi-national efforts. The India-UK Cancer Research Initiative will provide a catalysing platform for scientists and researchers in the UK and India to co-create solutions for affordable cancer care that improve cancer outcomes around the globe. At DBT our priority is to apply science to solving complex challenges that benefit all humanity and we are glad to be partnering with CRUK to support research across all stages of cancer from prevention to cure to addres the formidable challenge of cancer.” 

Nick Grant, Cancer Research UK’s executive director of international partnerships, on the occasion said that no country escapes the impact of cancer, with millions around the world diagnosed with the disease every year and we need to bring together the brightest scientific minds across the world, breaking down barriers to address the challenge of cancer globally.

The India-UK Cancer Research Initiative was launched today at the Inaugural Researchers’ Summit, which is being held in New Delhi from November 14th to November 16th, 2018. The summit will facilitate knowledge sharing and communication among scientists, researchers, epidemiologists, clinicians, public health professionals and industry in the field of oncology.

The research phases of the India-UK Cancer Research Initiative will be overseen by a board of advisors comprising five cancer experts each from India and UK. Prof. David Hunter of the University of Oxford and Dr. CS Pramesh of the Tata Memorial Hospital will serve respectively as Chair and Co-chair of the India-UK Cancer Research Initiative’s Advisory Panel. 

The India-UK Cancer Research Initiative provides an opportunity to tackle the global epidemic of cancer by opening new pathways for international knowledge exchange and research base. The research outcomes of this initiative will aid cancer prevention, control and management in the long term. The joint investment by both countries in this initiative is a testament to the emerging consensus that solutions to affordable cancer care lie in building strategic and evidence-based research partnerships that benefit the global cancer community.

                The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) under the Ministry of Science and Technology, in collaboration with the Wellcome Trust ,to support a three-tier fellowship programme on biomedical research at post-doctoral level,  celebrated 10 years of their joint partnership in an event in New Delhi today. The Wellcome Trust is an independent charity funding research to improve human and animal health. Established in 1936 and with an endowment of around £15 billion, it is the largest non-governmental source of funds for biomedical research in the United Kingdom. The aim of setting up the fellowship jointly with Wellcome Trust was to create a system comparable to the best in the world, taking India on the path of becoming a leader in key areas of life sciences and biomedical research. 

 

Speaking on the occasion President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind said that as the partnership between the Department of Biotechnology and the Wellcome Trust completes its first decade, this is an opportune moment for the India Alliance to draft its priorities for the next phase. Today, through science and technology, humans wield unimaginable power over the future of our planet. We therefore have a responsibility like never before. And scientists, particularly bio-scientists, are our soldiers and generals in the battle to safeguard our planet, our species and our future.

 

The President suggested four frontlines in this battle. He said that the first is the environment. Our air, water and soil must be cleaned. While we do so, we must mitigate the consequences on human and livestock health. The second frontline is that of lifestyle diseases. Diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases are on the rise. The third frontline is infectious disease. While we take on known infectious diseases, lesser-known ones threaten to expand. The final frontline is diseases of the brain. Factors that include urban stress and a significant elderly population have left India facing a mental health epidemic. Preventive measures, relevant to our genetics and our lifestyle, are in the realm of theory, waiting to be discovered. We must discover these if our people are to age well, with full mental capacities.

 

Union Science and Technology Minister ,Dr. Harsh Vardhan while congratulating the partnership emphasized the need for added incentive for biomedical research and creating opportunities that encourage more clinicians to carry out research. The Union Minister said that he was happy to note that the DBT Wellcome Trust partnership was addressing this issue in a major way.

 

Other dignitaries who were present at the event including Principal Scientific Adviser to the Govt. Of India, Prof. K. VijayRaghavan, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, Dr. Renu Swaroop and Director, Wellcome Trust, Dr Jeremy Farrar, expressed hope that the partnership in its next phase with increased vigour, will look to set up mechanisms to strengthen veterinary research , develop mechanisms to engage with Universities around the country to better equip researchers there to apply and receive competitive funding for their research, look for more effectively administering collaborative research Grants that aim to solve important scientific problems through an interdisciplinary approach among other things.

 

The current programme is being delivered by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), a public trust registered as the DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance.  The Trust receives equal contribution from both DBT and WT for the running the fellowship grant scheme. The joint commitment of DBT and WT has been up to UK £16 million each year (£8 million each), amounting to a total of UK £160 million / INR 1296 crore over a 10-year period. The scheme was announced in 2008. Fellowships are available across the full spectrum of biomedical research (human and veterinary) - from fundamental molecular and cellular studies through to clinical and public health research. Research projects can be based in the laboratory, the clinic or the field and may involve experimental, theoretical approaches as well as translational approaches

 

In the past 10 years, the alliance has awarded 320 fellowships to researchers in 93 institutions across 34 Indian cities. More than 900 PhDs, postdoctoral scientists, undergraduates and research technicians trained in the laboratories of India Alliance Fellows. Nearly 2500 researchers were trained in Science Communication workshops and more than 900 PhDs, postdoctoral scientists, undergraduates and research technicians were trained in the laboratories of India Alliance Fellows. Facilitating “Brain Gain” nearly 68% awardees are from India while the rest are from overseas.

                The Global Cooling Prize, an international competition to incentivize the development of a residential cooling technology that will have at least five times (5x) less climate impact than the standard Room Air Conditioning (RAC) was announced at the inaugural session of the two day Global Cooling Innovation Summit in New Delhi today.  

The prize is supported by Mission Innovation, the Government of India through the Department of Science and Technology and its partner organizations namely Ministry of Power, Bureau of Energy Efficiency, and Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change and will be administered by a coalition of leading research institutes—Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), Conservation X Labs, the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE), and CEPT University. The coalition will drive and support incubation, commercialization, and ultimately mass adoption of the breakthrough technology, starting in India and expanding to other countries around the world. A winning technology could prevent up to 100 gigatons (GT) of CO2-equivalent emissions by 2050, and put the world on a pathway to mitigate up to 0.5˚C of warming by 2100.

Inaugurating the Global Cooling Innovation Summit, Union Science & Technology Minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan said, “The increasingly hotter climates make it imperative for the Governments to provide thermal comfort for health and well being of its citizens.  Moreover, this comfort has to be provided in an environmentally benign way.  Balancing these objectives is extremely delicate and challenging. In view of huge cooling demand likely to be generated, incremental improvements are not likely to yield desired results.  It is in this context that scientific and technological community needs to be challenged to rise up to the occasion by providing breakthrough disruptive innovations.”

Congratulating the architects of Global Cooling Prize and all its partners, the Union Minister stressed that the Government would ensure that funding for clean energy innovations is further ramped up and an eco-system of public-private-partnership offering value to both in the domain of clean energy is created.

Speaking at the inauguration, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, Dr.  K. VijayRaghavan said that a unique feature of Global Cooling Prize is that it presents pragmatic models for private sector engagement in clean energy research and development.  “This is exactly what Mission Innovation was set-up to deliver 3 years ago at the Paris Climate Summit - new collaborations between governments, innovators and the private sector to unleash innovation in climate critical technologies”, said Secretary DBT, Dr. Renu Swaroop.

John Loughhead Vice-Chair, Mission Innovation Steering Committee and Iain Campbell, Senior Fellow at Rocky Mountain Institute also present at the inauguration expressed delight at the launch of the Global Cooling Prize and congratulated the Government of India for its leadership

Over US$3 million will be awarded in prize money over the course of the two-year competition. Up to 10 short-listed competing technologies will be awarded up to US$200,000 each in intermediate prizes to support the design and prototype development of their innovative residential cooling technology designs. The winning technology will be awarded at least US$1 million to support its incubation and early-stage commercialization. 

There are currently 1.2 billion room air conditioning units in service around the world. It is estimated that the number of units will increase to at least 4.5 billion by 2050. India alone will see over 1 billion air conditioning deployed in the market by 2050. The energy consumption associated with comfort cooling represents one of the largest end-use risks to the climate, putting the most vulnerable populations at risk.

                Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation has said that India endorses the growth of the Blue Economy in a sustainable, inclusive and people centred manner through the framework of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). He said the Blue Economy remains a critical aspect of India’s economic development agenda, and more than 95% of our trade is being carried on by sea. The Minister was speaking at the Sustainable Blue Economy Conference in Nairobi today.  Kenya is hosting the two day conference with Canada and Japan as co-hosts. 

Emphasizing the importance that India lays on developing its maritime resources Shri Gadkari said that our National Vision in this regard is clearly articulated in the term “SAGAR”- Security and Growth for All in the Region coined by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He said that Prime Minister says that the Blue Chakra of India’s national flag represents the potential of the Blue Economy, and gave assurance that the Ministry of Shipping, Government of India is committed to realising its full potential.

Shri Gadkari talked about the government’s ambitious Sagarmala Programme and how it is poised to revolutionize maritime logistics and port led developments in India. He said the programme has identified 600 plus projects entailing a huge investment of $120 billion (around Rs 8 lakh crore) by 2020. This in turn would save India $6 billion per annum in logistics costs besides creating 10 million new jobs and boosting port capacity by 800 Million Metric Tonne per Annum (MMTPA) to an overall 3500 MMTPA. Coastal Economic Zones (CEZs) are being developed with a proposed investment of $ 150 Million per location under the programme. These will become a microcosm of the blue economy, with the growth of industries and townships that depend on the sea and contribute to global trade through sea connectivity. He further informed that the programme is also focussing on the development of coastal communities and people through skill gap analysis, skill development centres to train coastal communities in the sustainable use of ocean resources, modern fishing techniques and coastal tourism. An investment of $1.10 Bn is planned across various coastal districts in India for this purpose. In addition to this, several green initiatives are also being taken in the coastal regions like 31 MW of captive solar power generation being planned at various ports,installation of oil spill response facilities and study to identify ways to re-use waste water at ports.

Talking about the important role of the private sector for sustainable growth Shri Gadkari said the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), took lead in 2016-2017 by establishing a taskforce to develop a business model on India’s engagement in the blue economy sector.

Shri Gadkari also held discussions with Mr James Wainaina Macharia, the Kenyan Cabinet Secretary (Minister) Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development, during which he offered India’s cooperation to Kenya for ship-building, vessels for coast guard, fishing trawlers. He invited the Kenyan Minister to visit India and see the expertise of Cochin Shipyard Ltd in building ships, which would be required by the newly established Coast Guard of Kenya, and also fishing trawlers for deep sea fishing.

Shri Gadkari further highlighted the development of electric cars and vehicles in India which could have market in Kenya. He also offered to encourage Indian car manufacturers to set up assembly plants in Kenya for the African market. 

The Kenyan Minister offered cooperation to India for activating ship building in Kenya. He further suggested that the bilateral cooperation could extend beyond blue economy to other areas. He highlighted the existing medical tourism from his country to India and said enhancing direct flights would encourage this business for mutual benefit. He further suggested that given the strength of two wheeler manufacturing in India, and the big market for it in Kenya and rest of Africa, this could be a good investment opportunity for Indian companies.

The Kenyan Minister said he looked forward to visiting India. Official level meetings are to be organised between the two countries to prepare an agenda for Minister level meeting later in India.

                Union Minister for Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has said that Blue Economy is very crucial for India’s economic development. The Minister left for Nairobi today to attend the Sustainable Blue Economy Conference.  The conference is being organized by Kenya, with Canada and Japan as co-hosts. Shri Gadkari will address the conference tomorrow. 

Shri Gadkari said India has a strategic location in the Indian Ocean region, and on this basis, it endorses the growth of the Blue Economy in a sustainable, inclusive and people centred manner through the framework of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). He said, India is developing its maritime infrastructure as well as its inland waterways and coastal shipping through the launch of the ambitious “Sagarmala Programme” which will revolutionize maritime logistics and port led developments in the country. He further  said that India’s  national vision about the sector is clearly articulated in the term “SAGAR”- Security and Growth for All in the Region coined by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

India’s ambitious Sagarmala programme has identified 600 plus projects entailing huge investment of around Rs 8 lakh crore (120 billion dollars) by the year 2020. This will save the country nearly six billion dollars per annum in logistics costs besides creating 10 million new jobs and boosting port capacity by 800 Million Metric Tonne per Annum (MMTPA) to an overall 3500 MMTPA. The Minister said, Coastal Economic Zones (CEZs) are being developed under Sagarmala with a proposed investment of 150 Million dollars per location. He said, the CEZs will become a microcosm of the blue economy wherein industries and townships that depend on the sea and contribute to global trade through sea connectivity are envisaged.

                Union Minister for Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari will inaugurate two floating restaurants under the ongoing water front development work of Mumbai Port in Mumbai tomorrow. He will participate in the Bhoomi Poojan ceremony of Mumbai Port Trust’s new Eastern Water Front. The Minister will also launch the Access Control & RFID System as well as development of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). Shri Gadkari will also begin the invitation of tenders for Mumbai-Elephanta Ropeway and a Super Specialty Hospital at the Port.

 

The two Floating Restaurants have the capacity to accommodate 475 persons each. Licenses have been awarded for three floating restaurants – two at the sea off Gateway of India and one at the sea off Girgaum Chowpatty.  These will be available for family functions, corporate or specialized events, public meets, etc. The restaurants have been registered with Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) for safety and security. Sea-worthiness, life-saving appliances and fire fighting equipment have been surveyed and tested. The restaurants  carry 500 life-jackets and 24 life-rafts and buoyant apparatus, and are equipped with 2 VHF, 1 Radar, eco-sounder, GPS and AIS for monitoring ship movements.

 

The Mumbai-Elephanta Ropeway will be the world's longest ropeway over sea - approximately 8 kms - with all the necessary infrastructure at both the terminal ends. It will be built at a height of 50 to 125 metres above the sea level on European standards with state of art features. Total travel time will be 16 minutes from one end to the other. Around 36 gondolas can be deployed on the ropeway at a time. The Project has been envisaged at a cost Rs.800 crores, and will be completed by August, 2022.

The 600-bedded Super Specialty Hospital will provide improved health facilities to 75000 port employees and dependents and 1.3 crore population in the catchment area by converting the present port hospital into World-class Super Specialty hospital on PPP basis. Cost of the project will be Rs 693 Crores.

Mumbai Port Trust’s new Eastern Water Front will have an iconic building as its seaside terminal, a domestic cruise terminal, a skating rink, Ro Pax, seaside restaurant and walkway, amphitheatre and marina.

The Access Control System (Indoor & Outdoor) for visitors, employees and vehicles is designed and programmed to retrieve visitor information.  Visitor and Vehicle Management System will be in place with online/office visitor and vehicle registration. RFID enabled, multi-purpose cards are configured to track visitors and vehicles, attendance recording, identity card, etc.

 

For development of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), M/s Tech Mahindra have been engaged for adoption of information technology within port operations to reduce turnaround time. It is aimed at removing paper-based workflows currently in the system to increase efficiency, common reporting and monitoring to make cost and budget control easy, and unification of computerized operations from staggered mode to an integrated functioning.

                The Directorate General of Shipping has proposed the establishment of a Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) off the south-west coast of India to prevent collision incidents between merchant vessels and fishing vessels off the coast of Kerala.  This proposal has been drawn taking into consideration past collision incidents off the Indian coast, traffic patterns of merchant vessels for past years, and optimum sea routes, in consonance with the current traffic flow, including simplification of traffic in converging areas off the coast of Kerala.  The proposal has also considered aspects pertaining to the safety of navigation, maritime security and the separation of opposing streams of traffic to reduce incidents of collision in Indian waters.

 

Stakeholder consultations are in progress for establishing the Traffic Separation Scheme – TSS in the south-west coast.  The proposed TSS lanes are currently under consideration, and will be located at a distance of about 90 nautical miles west of Mangalore in Karnataka, with the lanes leading in a south-easterly direction to the southernmost tip of India and ending about 40 nautical miles off south of Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu.  The average distance from the coast is about 50 nautical miles.

 

The proposal will be put on the DGS website before finalization, and will also be sent to stakeholders. The promulgation of TSS on the south-west coast of India is expected to shift the density of merchant traffic away from the coast and merchant ship traffic will become more concentrated in the established TSS.  This is expected to result in more sea room for fishing vessels to operate safely and will, therefore, be beneficial to the fishing industry.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will dedicate to the nation the newly constructed    Multi Modal Terminal on River Ganga at Varanasi on Monday, the 12th of November, 2018. This is the first of the three Multi Modal Terminals and two Inter Modal Terminals  being constructed on the river. The MMTs are being built as part of the Government’s Jal Marg Vikas project that aims to develop the stretch of River Ganga between Varanasi to Haldi for navigation of large vessels upto1500-2000 tonnes weight, by maintaining a drought of 2-3 metres in this stretch of the river and setting up other systems required for safe navigation.  The objective is to promote inland waterways as a cheaper and more environment friendly means of transport, especially for cargo movement. Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) is the project Implementing Agency

 

The Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) is being implemented on the Haldia-Varanasi stretch of National Waterway-1 (NW-1) with the technical assistance and investment support of the World Bank, at an estimated cost of Rs. 5,369.18 crores (USD 800 million, of which USD 375 is IBRD loan) on a 50:50 sharing basis between Government of India and the World Bank. The project entails construction of 3 multimodal terminals (Varanasi, Sahibganj and Haldia); 2 intermodal terminals; 5 Roll On – Roll Off (Ro-Ro) terminal pairs; new navigation lock at Farakka; assured depth dredging; integrated vessel repair & maintenance facility, Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), River Information System (RIS), river training & river conservancy works. 

 

Salient features of Varanasi Mutli-Modal Terminal (MMT) are as follows

 


	First Multi-Modal Terminal on National Waterway -1.
	Land: 33.34 hectares.
	Cost of Phase-I of MMT: Rs. 206.84 cr.
	Terminal capacity: 1.26 MPTA
	Start date of the project: June, 2016
	Completion date of the project: November 2018


The following are the main ingredients of the project, which are ready for operations:


	Jetty: Length 200 m x Width 42 m with berthing and mooring facility.
	02  Mobile Harbour Cranes
	Approach Road 
	Internal Road 
	Stone Pitching Works and bank protection
	Shell structure of ancillary buildings, worker amenity building ready


 

Operation, management and further development of the Multi Modal Terminal is proposed to be entrusted to an Operator on PPP model. Selection of the PPP Operator through an International Competitive Bidding is at advanced stage and expected to be completed by December 2018.

 

The project of multi-modal terminal and proposed Freight Village at Varanasi are expected to generate 500 direct employment and more than 2000 indirect employment opportunities.

 

Prime Minister will also receive India’s first container vessel that sailed from Kolkata on 30th October 2018, carrying cargo belonging to PEPSICO (India) from Kolkata to Varanasi. Container movement on an inland waterway in India is being done for the first time post-independence. The IWAI vessel, MV RABINDRANATH TAGORE is transporting 16 containers equivalent to 16 truckloads of food and snacks and is expected to reach Varanasi on 11th November 2018. It will make its return journey with fertilizers from IFFCO.

 

In a separate event the same day, Prime Minister will also inaugurate two National Highways projects – the Babatpur-Varanasi Airport road and Varanasi Ring Road. In addition to this, he will also inaugurate some sewerage projects in the city and lay foundation stone for a project  underNamamiGange programme of National Mission for Clean Ganga.

As per the World Bank report 2019 on Ease of Doing Business, India has taken a huge leap of 23 ranks from 100 in 2017-18 to 77 in 2018-19 indicating it is continuing its steady shift towards global standards. One of the key indices which has contributed immensely toward this growth is ‘Trading across borders’ which shows an impressive improvement from 146 rank last year to 80th rank this year.

The Ministry of Shipping has been taking initiatives to improve the parameter of ‘Trading across border’ as 92% of India’s Export- Import trade by volume is handled at ports. 

The report mentions that this is mainly due to India’s continued reform agenda, which has made it the top-ranked economy in the region. Upgradation of port infrastructure, Improvement of processes, and digitization of document submission has substantially reduced Export/Import cargo handling time at ports which has significantly contributed towards improving the trading across border parameter and India’s impressive growth in the World Bank’s report. The World Bank has recognized India as one of the top improvers for the year.

According to the report, under the Border Compliance Criterion relevant to the Port Sector the Cost to Export has come down from $ 382.4 to $251.6. Similarly, the Cost to Import has come down from $ 543.2 to $ 331. 

 

“Focused efforts at improving the export/import cargo handling at major ports has contributed to improving the Ease of Doing Business in India and thus will help in economic growth & more jobs opportunities for the youth.”,said Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Shipping, Road Transport & Highways and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation. 

The Government has initiated a series of steps to make India’s EXIM logistics more competitive in terms of time and cost. A series of studies to bench mark the performance of Indian Major Ports with their international counterparts has been undertaken and steps to increase the capacity and productivity to global standards have been initiated. Specifically 114 initiatives which were identified have been undertaken. 

“The focus has been on development of port infrastructure and capacity enhancement, improvement in last mile connectivity and development of multi-modal hubs to promote EXIM while reducing logistics cost and time. Under Sagarmala, port-led-development initiative of the Govt, 266 port modernization projects with an investment of more than Rs 1.45 lakh Crore has been identified for implementation over next 10 years.”saidthe Minister.

80 projects worth Rs. 13,701Cr have been completed and projects worth 2.39 lakh Crore are under implementation. 

“In order to enhance last mile connectivity, 211 road-rail projects worth Rs 250,907 Crore have been identified under Sagarmala.15 multimodal logistic parks with an investment of Rs3,989 will help in improving efficiency in freight movement under the programme”, the minister added.

With more than 5 % average growth at major ports over last 4 years, the Ministry of Shipping, has taken several steps to improve their operational efficiencies through policy and procedural changes and mechanization. 

As a result, key efficiency parameters have improved considerably. The Average Turnaround Time has reduced from 82 hrs to 64 hrs in 2017-18. The Average Output Per Ship Berth day has increased from 14,583Tonnes in 2016-17 and to 14,912 Tonnes in 2017-18. The traffic at major ports increased to 6794.7 lakh tonnes during 2017-18 over 6483.98 lakh tonnesduring 2016-17.  

Transfer of conventional activities to digital platforms, use of technology for moving cargo and simplification of processes have been done topromote business and facilitate ease of doing business. Steps taken include the following:

 


	Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)system installed in 11 Major Ports to enhance security, remove bottlenecks for seamless movement of traffic across Port gates. The RFID system automatically identifies the trucks and drivers without the need to stop at the port gates for manual checking.
	DMICDC's Logistics Databank system (LDB) for tracking & tracing movement of EXIM container in the Major Ports thereby enabling the consigners and consignees to track the movement of the Containers from portal.
	Direct Port Delivery (DPD) and Direct Port Entry (DPE) enable direct movement of containers from factories / port without intermediate handling requirement, thus saving cost & time 
	
		Direct Port Delivery of Import containers increased from 3% in November 2016 to 40.62% in July, 2018. The DPD importers are benefited by savings in cost ofupto Rs.15,000/ and average serving in delivery time of 5 days.
		The percentage of Direct Port Entry of Export containers increased from 60% in April 2017 to 82.66 in July, 2018. 
	
	
	Installation of drive-through Container Scanners to save time  at Major Ports
	Reducing paper work- Issuance of e- Delivery orders, e-invoice and e-payment across all the Major Ports. Digitalization of processes has considerably reduced the processing time. 
	Upgradation of the Centralized Web Based-Port Community System (PCS) to provide global visibility and access to the central database to all its stakeholders through internet based interfaces

                Union Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship & Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has said that the Government has brought about a paradigm shift in the national healthcare. Addressing the 15th Health Summit organized by CII here today, he said that an entrepreneurial model is being created by tapping the talent, energy and resources outside the Government system to provide affordable, accessible and sustainable healthcare. The Minister said that Ayushman Bharat, popularly known as Modicare, is the biggest health care system being implemented by the State which will provide health facilities to almost half the country’s population.  He said that an ecosystem is being created to provide for more doctors, para-medicos, health infrastructure, etc. He said that this has given big boost to the health industry, as India is also becoming a favourite destination for overseas patients, particularly from Africa, Asia and Latin America, and the sector is becoming a service exporter. Sh Pradhan said that there have been formal agreements with Japan and UAE for providing skilled manpower in the healthcare sector, as Indian workforce has the qualities of sensitivity, compassion and responsibility.

The Minister said that that Health Care Council, set up by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, is aggressively pushing to provide trained manpower. The Government has fulfilled the demand for setting up a statutory body for Allied and Other healthcare services. Sh Pradhan said that Indian pharmaceutical industry is already a global player and is in a big league. He said that India can be alaboratory for affordable healthcare industry. He called upon all the stakeholders to contribute in the efforts.

There are about 1 billion i.e. about 15% of the world population persons with disabilities. Majority of this population live in developing countries with low ICT development indexes. Because of this information divide, persons with disabilities are being excluded from society suffering inequality and poverty.The Global IT Challenge was initially designed to enhance the information utilisation skill of youths with disabilities (in the category of visual disability, hearing disability, locomotor disability and developmental disorder) and to encourage their social participation.The event started in the year 1992 in Korea. Subsequently it expanded to the neighbouring countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region and since 2011 it has become a global event.

In 2011 the event was held in Hanoi, Vietnam followed by Incheon (South Korea in 2012) Bangkok, Thailand in 2013, Busan, South Korea in 2014, Jakarta, Indonesia in 2015, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China in 2016 and Hanoi, Vietnam in 2017.

                Base year of National Accounts is periodically revised to account for the structural changes that have taken place in the economy over time and to depict a better picture of the economy through macro-economic aggregates like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), National Income, consumption expenditure and other related aggregates and indicators. This enables users to assess performance of the economy in real terms by estimating the macro-economic aggregates at the prices of the selected year, known as “base year”. The estimates at the prevailing prices of the current year are termed as “at current prices”, while those prepared at base year prices are termed as “at constant prices”. Comparison of the estimates at constant prices, i.e. “in real terms”, over the years gives a measure of “real growth”. After introduction of the new series of National Accounts (Base 2011-12), back-series estimates of National Accounts Statistics (NAS) are compiled and released for the years preceding the new base year for completeness and comparability with old base data sets. The present release gives a snapshot of domestic product, capital formation (at industry/item level) and other macro-economic aggregates till the year 2004- 05, as per the new series of NAS with base year 2011-12.

                            Steel Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh today visited the Alloy Steel Plant (ASP) in Durgapur. After a review of the performance of ASP, the Minister said that ASP is now showing improved performance both in physical and financial terms. Chaudhary Birender Singh also said that the plant is geared up to make net profit from next year.

            ASP has a diverse product portfolio of over 400 grades critical in end-use by strategic sectors like, defence, railways, automobiles, power plants, heavy engineering and manufacturing industries, including steel plants.ASP was set up in 1965 under Hindustan Steel Limited, now SAIL,to ensure India’s self-reliance in alloy and special steels production. 

            The Steel Minister also visited the Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP). He said DSP's commensurate growth plan has been duly considered in tune with the National Steel Policy of making 300 MT steel by 2030-31, and SAIL's plan to enhance steel production to 50 MT. He said SAIL needs to be more profitable and retain its leadership position in the market.Apart from the plant issues Chaudhary Birender Singh also spoke about development in the township and the necessity for providing better medical facilities at the DSP Main hospital.

            Durgapur steel plant was set up in the late fifties with an initial production capacity of 1 million tonne per annum (MTPA) crude steel which was progressively increased to 1.8 MTPA during the last modernization in the nineties. DSP is currently implementing its Modernisation & Expansion Plan (Phase-I) with the main objectives of conversion of available semis into value added rolled products. The capacity of DSP will increase in hot metal to 2.40 MTPA, crude steel to 2.20 MTPA and saleable steel to 2.12 MTPA after completion of Phase -I.      

            Steel Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh visited the Salem Steel Plantyesterday and reviewed its performance. He discussed with officials the ways and means of making the plant profitable as it hasbeen a loss making plant for the last 10 years with around Rs 200 crores loss per year. Losses have been reduced this year and may come down by more than 20%. 

            Chairman, SAIL and Joint Secretary, Steel accompanied the Minister during the visits to the three plants at Salem, Tamil Nadu and Durgapur, West Bengal.

          Efforts made by the Ministry of Steel have ensured placement of orders for domestic iron and steel to the tune of Rs. 8129 crore from June 2017 to October 2018. Ministry of Railways, ONGC, GAIL, EIL and HPCL have placed orders with domestic iron and steel manufactures for various categories of rails, pipe and tubes. These products were earlier imported but are now being procured from domestic producers. Discussions are on with Ministry of Railways to increase consumption of rails manufactured indigenously either through SAIL or other domestic manufactures. Efforts are also being made to on-board sectors like Defence and CPWD so that use of steel products manufactured in India grows. 

          

          In order to give preference to domestically manufactured iron and steel products (DMI&SP) in Government procurement, Ministry of Steel promulgated a Policy, which was notified on 8th May 2017.  To ensure that the Policy is implemented in letter and spirit, a Standing Committee under the Ministry of Steel chaired by Secretary Steel has been constituted to oversee its implementation.  A Grievance Committee has also been constituted to carry out grievance redressal which may arise while implementing the DMI&SP Policy.   

          The Ministry of Steel organized a Conclave in Bhubaneswar in October this year for domestic manufacturers of capital goods meant for the steel sector.  In this Conclave MoUsworth Rs.39400 crore were signed between foreign capital goods manufacturers and technology providers with Indian capital goods manufacturers and steel producers.  This will result in the manufacturing of capital goods for the steel sector within the country in the next 4 years.  This is a major shot in the arm for the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government of India.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to expand the scope of mandatory packaging norms under the Jute Packaging Material (JPM) Act, 1987 as follows: 


	The CCEA approved that 100% of the food grains and 20% of the sugar shall be mandatorily packed in diversified jute bags. The decision to pack sugar in diversified jute bags will give an impetus to the diversification of the jute industry. 
	Initially 10% of the indents of jute bags for packing foodgrains would be placed through reverse auction on the Gem portal. This will gradually usher in a regime of price discovery.


 

Impact:


	The decision will give a fillip to the development of jute sector; increasing the quality and productivity of raw jute, diversification of jute sector and also boosting and sustaining demand for jute product.
	This is important considering the fact that nearly 3.7 lakh workers and several lakh farm families are dependent for their livelihood on the jute sectors, the government has been making concerted efforts. 
	The jute industry is predominantly dependent on Government sector which purchases jute bags of value of more than Rs. 6,500 crore every year for packing foodgrains. This is done in order to sustain the core demand for the jute sector and to support the livelihood of the workers and farmers dependent on the sector.
	The decision will benefit farmers and workers located in the Eastern and North Eastern regions of the country particularly in the states of West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya and Tripura.


 

Measures by the Government to support the Jute Sector:


	In order to improve the productivity and quality of raw jute through a carefully designed intervention, called the Jute ICARE, the Government has been supporting close to one lakh jute farmers by disseminating improved agronomic practices such as line sowing using seed drills, weed management by using wheel-hoeing and nail-weeders, distribution of quality certified seeds and also providing microbial assisted retting. These interventions have resulted in enhancing the quality and productivity of raw jute and increasing income of jute farmers by Rs. 10,000 per hectare.


 


	In this connection, to support jute farmers, Jute Corporation of India (JCI) has been given a grant of Rs. 100 crore for 2 years starting from 2018-19 to enable JCI to conduct MSP operations and ensure price stabilization in the jute sector.


 


	With a view to support diversification of jute sector, the National Jute Board has collaborated with National Institute of Design and a Jute Design Cell has been opened at Gandhinagar. Further, promotion of Jute Geo Textiles and Agro-Textiles has been taken up with the State Governments particularly those in the North Eastern region and also with departments such as Ministry of Road Transport and Ministry of Water Resources.


 


	With a view to boost demand in the jute sector, Government of India has imposed Definitive Anti-Dumping Duty on import of jute goods from Bangladesh and Nepal with effect from 5th January, 2017. As a result of these measures, 13 Twine mills in Andhra Pradesh had resumed operation, benefitting 20,000 workers. Further, imposition of Definitive Anti-Dumping Duty has provided scope for an additional demand of 2 lakh MT of jute goods in the domestic market for the Indian jute industry.


 


	With a view to promoting transparency in jute sector, Jute SMART, an e-govt initiative was launched in December, 2016, providing an integrated platform for procurement of B-Twill sacking by Government agencies. Further, the JCI is transferring 100% funds to jute farmers online for jute procurement under MSP and commercial operations.

The Commission reviewed the reports submitted by Ministry of Home Affairs and Andaman & Nicobar Administration on the incident. The Additional Secretary, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, apprised the Commission regarding the background of a decision of the Ministry to relax Restricted Area Permit for 30 islands in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  He also informed that a five Member Committee under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Tribal Welfare) of the A&N Administration has been constituted by Lt. Governor of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands - 


	to review the institutional mechanism to prevent the landing of the  foreign national in the North Sentinel Island; and
	to suggest measures to prevent such incidents in future.


The Committee will submit its report within 30 days.            

The Chairperson, NCST expressed that following the unfortunate incident, the vulnerability of Sentinelese tribes in North Sentinel Island has increased many fold, and any aggressive steps to recover the body will adversely disturb the peace and tranquility in the island.

                The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes has expressed serious concern over the news report regarding one US National feared killed by protected tribe in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Calling this incident as unfortunate, the Commission has sought immediate report from Ministry of Home Affairs as well as Andaman and Nicobar Administration.

On 13th July, 2018 based on the complaint received from Prof. Vishwajit Pandya, the Commission had sought information from the Ministry of Home Affairs and Andaman and Nicobar Islands regarding relaxation of the Restricted Area Permit (RAP) for foreign nationals and tourism development in 29 islands of Andaman & Nicobar Islands. The report of Ministry of Home Affairs as well as Andaman & Nicobar Islands is yet to be received.

The Commission had held a two day Conference on 27th and 28th June, 2018 to discuss critical issues concerning Particularly Vulnerable Tribes Groups (PVTGs) of Andaman & Nicobar Islands. The recommendations of the two day conference have been adopted by the Commission in its 107th meeting held recently. The commission had advised the Government to be ultra-sensitive to the vulnerability of the PVTGs in Andaman & Nicobar Islands and any attempt for tourism development etc, in these islands, which can create unwarranted and dramatic cultural changes for PVTGs, should be looked into and stopped forthwith.                       

Chairperson, NCST, Dr. Nand Kumar Sai has also written a letter to the Union Home Minister on 8th August, 2018, requesting him to safeguard the interests of tribals under Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Regulations in this regard.

                National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) is planning to set up a Ganga Exhibition and a Ganga Museum as an instrument for public outreach, depicting the river’s history and mythology, its importance for the livelihood of a huge population, as well as efforts for Ganga Rejuvenation. 

Expert from India and the European Union are meeting for two days on 29th & 30th November, 2018 to hold an International Workshop on “Developing a Ganga Museum Concept: Exchanging Experiences and Ideas between India and Europe” along with GIZ India as a part of Indo German Development Co-operation to exchange ideas and experiences regarding various aspects of the proposed museum, knowledge centre and exhibition. 

Delivering the keynote address, Secretary Ministry of Water Resources River Developing and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri UP Singh said that the Ganga Museum should reflect all the aspects of the river like it’s mythological and spiritual significance, efforts to rejuvenate the river, economic activities going on along its banks and its biodiversity and aquatic life including fishes, turtles, dolphins etc. He hoped that ideas of international experts will enrich the concept of Ganga Museum. 

 

Director General, NMCG Shri R.R.Mishra said that NMCG has been working towards the possibility for the establishment of a Ganga Museum. Identification of an appropriate location will be the essence of the project. People are connected with Ganga in different ways as pilgrims, as tourists and as beneficiaries of economic activities around it. Everybody should feel connected with the river. He said the Ganga Museum should be designed in such a way as to increase the connect and motivation to keep the river clean as a continuous process. 

 

About 35 international and Indian museum experts as well representatives of Ministries of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Art, Culture and Youth and Wildlife Institute of India are participating in the workshop. The ideas thrown up in the workshop will be compiled in a manual that will be used as a basis to further implement the necessary steps to set up a Ganga Museum and Exhibition.

                The Executive Committee (EC) of the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has approved ten projects worth Rs 1573.28 crore. In a meeting held yesterday in the presence of Union Minister forWater Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Road Transport and Highwaysand Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkari and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, , it was decided that a comprehensive solution needed to be worked out to address Yamuna’s pollution issues in Agra. The project for Rehabilitation / Renovation of Agra Sewerage Scheme (Interception & Diversion Works) has been conceived at a total cost of Rs. 857.26 crore including O&M cost for 15 years. 

The major components of the project include tapping of 61 nalas/drains, construction of 3 Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP’s) of total capacity 166 MLD, construction of 10 decentralized STPs of 9.38 MLD and renovation of 2 existing STPs, laying of rising main of 17.61 km, renovation of Sewage Pumping Station (SPS), renovation of STPs renovation of interception work, upgradation of STPs (for chlorination), and operation & maintenance for 15 years. These projects are expected to drastically reduce pollution load from Agra city into the river Yamuna, helping to save the Taj Mahal and leading to improvement of river water quality, ground water quality and overall aesthetics of the area. 

Interception & Diversion works (I&D) and Sewage Treatment Plant at Kasganj were also approved by the Executive Committee at a cost of Rs. 76.73 crore. The project envisages construction of 2 I&D structures, network laying of the length of 2.8 KM and 15 MLD capacity STP. The cost of the project includes O&M for 15 years.  Presently, there is no sewerage system in Kasganj, the wastewater is discharged into open drains that finally meet River Kali and contribute to pollution of the river. Under this project, all drains meeting Kali river will be tapped and the wastewater shall be carried out through pumping/Gravity flow to the proposed STP for treatment. 

Interception & Diversion works (I&D) and Sewage Treatment Plant at Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh were approved by EC at a total project cost of Rs.64.76 plus O&M costs for 15 years and includes construction of 7 MLD new STP, Upgradation of existing 5 MLD WSP to 10 MLD aerated lagoon STP, 6 I&D structures for drains, an 8 Km Network. Sultanpur is located on the banks of Gomti River and the waste of the town is conveyed through six drains in the town. These drains outfall into Gomti River resulting in pollution in the River. It is therefore necessary that the drains are Intercepted/ Diverted, treatment of Sewage/Sludge and effluent with permissible limits discharged into Gomti River. 

The EC approved projects worth Rs. 328.52 crore in Chhapra, Fatuha, Bakhtiyarpur and Khagaria in Bihar.  Chhapra I&D and STP Project was also given the go ahead. The total cost of Rs. 236.15 Crore includes STP – 32 MLD,3 1 I&D structures for drains, Intercepting Sewer, 5 New IPS. The proposal intends to develop an Interception & Diversion and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) of 32 MLD (in 2 modules of 16 MLD each) capacity at Chhapra town at the site of the old STP, for the treatment of the sewage generated from Chhapra town which currently finds its way into river Ghaghra and Ganga. On implementation of the project the discharge of untreated sewage will be avoided from Chhapra Town into the River.

Fatuha I&D and STP Project has been approved at a total cost of Rs.35.49 Crore and includes a 7 MLD STP, 19 I&D structures for drains etc for the treatment of the sewage generated from Fatuha town which currently finds its way into river Ganga. The proposed STP project includes re-use of treated waste water for irrigation purpose. On implementation the project will lead to reduced pollution load into the river Ganga. 

Bakhtiyarpur I&D and STP Project was approved at a total cost of Rs.35.88 Crore and includes a 10 MLD STP, 6 I&D structures for drains etc. Presently, the sewage generated from Bakhtiyapur town finds its way into river Ganga. Once the project is completed untreated sewage will no longer flow directly into the river Ganga. 

Khagaria I&D and STP Project has been approved at a total project cost of Rs. 21 Crore including of 15 years O&M. Khagaria is the headquarters of Khagaria district situated in Bihar part of Munger division of Bihar. The town is situated along the banks of river Burhi Gandak which joins river Ganga down stream of Khagaria. The project involves developing an Interception & Diversion and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) of 4.5 MLD capacity at Khagaria town, for the treatment of the sewage generated from Khagaria town which currently finds its way into river Ganga through Burhi Gandak river. It is envisaged that treated water from the STP will be used to develop a water body and public space in the town 

I&D works including pumping stations and STPs under Burdwan Municipality, in West-Bengal has been approved at a total project cost of Rs.234.31and includes 50 MLD STP, 19 KM Network,1 Main Pumping Station (MPS). Burdwan, is the headquarter of Purba Bardhaman district. From the standpoint of river Ganga pollution, Burdwan is not located immediately by the bank of River Ganga. Yet, untreated wastewater from this town makes its way to the river through Banka River and ultimately contributes to the pollution load in River Ganga.

There is no centralized sewerage system in the town and is currently facing serious sanitation problems. The entire wastewater from the upper and lower part of the municipal town flows into Banka River through surface drains. 38 main outfalls have been identified. Therefore, all the outfalls to Banka River must be Intercepted and Diverted to proposed lift stations (LS), MPS and the proposed Sewage Treatment Plant (STP).

Sewerage scheme for Zone-II and III of Paonta Town, Himachal Pradesh was approved at a total project cost of Rs.11.57 crore and includes new 1.72 MLD STP, Minor repair & filter in existing 0.44 MLD STP (Extended Aeration) and 1.0 MLD (Extended Aeration), 30 KLD Septage Handling unit. Paonta Town, home to the renowned Paonta Sahib Gurudwara, is situated on the banks of the river Yamuna. The river is the boundary between the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The Paonta Sahib city is divided into 11 wards. The scheme is envisaged in three zones.

                National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) organized a brainstorming session on World GIS Day 2018 in New Delhi yesterday, with the theme ‘G-Governance of Namami Gange programme through Geospatial Technology’. The objective of the session was to share the knowledge on use and application of geospatial technology for monitoring and management of various activities being undertaken under Namami Gange Programme, and  also provide feedback on the current use of this technology with reference to Ganga Basin. The brainstorming session brought together decision makers, technocrats and implementing agencies for an engaging discussion.

Speaking on the occasion Shri U.P Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation said that the lack of reliable data is the biggest challenge in the water sector. Geospatial technology can give vital information about the river basin for better monitoring, planning and feedback about programmes for river cleaning and rejuvenation, he said.   

Geographical Information System (GIS) technology is widely used in river basin management. The Namami Gange programme has high priority for research and evidence based decision making, and has special place for the use of new technology including Geospatial technology. NMCG is already executing a number of research projects based on Geospatial technology. 

In his opening remarks, Shri. Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, DG, NMCG said “The use of GIS technologies has improved our ground level understanding of the Ganga River Basin and we have been able to evolve evidence based policies and develop projects that are bringing about tremendous changes at the ground level. The GIS cell of NMCG has brought about paradigm shift in visualisation of all crucial spatial and non spatial information of Ganga basin as it is a robust, scalable and standards-based dissemination framework. GIS mapping becomes extremely important at NMCG to achieve its objective of effective abatement of pollution in river Ganga because of its limitless potential.” 

NMCG has signed an MoU with National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) in the  use of geospatial technology in June 2015. They have developed Bhuvan Ganga Geoportal and Bhuvan Ganga Mobile Application .  

Bhuvan Ganga Geoportal is available for water quality monitoring, hydrological monitoring, geomorphological monitoring, bio-resources monitoring, and comprehensive geospatial database. Speaking on the occasion Shri Santanu Chowdhury,Director, National Remote Sensing Centre said that the  Bhuvan Ganga mobile application is a user-friendly application to enable user/public to collect and report information on various pollution sources that affect water quality of River Ganga. The mobile application has provision to collect information regarding urban sewage, semi-urban/rural sewage, natural drains/nallas, industrial waste water, solid waste disposal or any other pollution source. The application is available for download from the Bhuvan Ganga web portal as well as Google Play store.

Speaking on the occasion Surveyor General of India Lt.General Girish Kumar VSM informed that the use of Drones and vehicles with cameras have captured 360 degree panoramic views of the Kumb Mela areas, which have also helped in identifying polluted Nalas joining the river Ganga.  Lt.General. Girish Kumar also talked about the Sahyog Mobile App which will improve content with the help of citizens. NMCG has also collaborated with Survey of India to facilitate the Ganga rejuvenation task by using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology for mapping the Ganga basin in high resolution generating Digital Elevation Models (DEM). These models will provide valuable information for use not only in making urban river plans, but also for identifying the baseline of river flood plains and regulating them for their restoration and preservation.  This technology enables identification of entire topography of an area making it easy for policy makers to analyse the available data and improve decision-making process.  Critical pollution hotspots are also easily identified through this technology. In addition, the high resolution GIS enabled data will help in regulating the proposed protected and regulatory zones along the banks of river.

IIT Kanpur is executing a project on  ‘Reconstructing the Ganga of the Past from Corona archival imagery’ Deliverables of Corona project would be to make all processed Corona images available for upload on public portal such as Bhuvan, develop an Atlas of the Ganga River showing a comparison between 1960s and the present, establish the reference condition of the Ganga river and quantify the changes in morphological characteristics and land-use/land-cover within the Ganga valley between 1960s and present, propose a policy document on ‘desirable’ land-use within the Ganga valley, capacity building for Corona image processing through training workshops including development of a working manual. 

Another project under execution is on ‘Generation of Digital Elevation Model/ Digital Terrain Model using suitable sensors on airborne platform for a corridor along the main stem of River Ganga’ by Survey of India. Deliverables of mapping would be Digital Elevation Model/ Digital Terrain Model (The bare earth model has vertical accuracy better than 50 cm), contour of 1.0 m, ortho-photos (25 cm Ground sampling distance or better), GIS ready dataset, outlet/vent of sewerage and other discharge from all dwelling units, industrial, commercial and all type of other institutions mapping from the sources outlet to the public drainage network, the entire public network integrated with the present project mapping, crematoria, ghats, solid waste disposal sites, STP/ETP/CETP etc for defined project area of interest.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will dedicate to the nation three sewage infrastructure projects costing Rs 425.41 Crorefor the city of Varanasi and lay the foundation stone for another project next week,  on 12.11.18. 

Among the projects to be inaugurated, the first is a 140 MLD Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at Dinapur built at a cost of Rs 235.53 Crore. The project includes  10 years Operation & Maintenance agreement. 

The second project includes three sewage pumping stations at Chaukaghat (140 MLD), Phulwaria (7.6 MLD) and Saraiya (3.7 MLD). The total cost for the three pumping stations was Rs 34.01. 

The third project is the construction of 28 km long relieving trunk sewer, rising mains and interceptor sewers along Varuna & Assi at a cost of Rs 155.87 Crore. 

PM will lay the foundation stone for Sewerage Management Scheme for Ramnagar at a cost of Rs 72.91 Crore. This will include a10 MLD STP and interceting and diverting 4 drains. 

The sewerage projects being inaugurated will result in increasing the sewage treatment capacity in the city from 102 MLD to 242 MLD. The long term O&M provision will ensure that the STP is not only created but is being operated and maintained properly. These projects will  result in treatment of 140 MLD the sewage before getting released in the river thereby reducing the pollution of the river Ganga. 

These project along with 2 other ongoing projects of 120 MLD at Goitha and 50 MLD STP at Ramana will take the sewage treatment capacity in the city to 412 MLD,  which will be adequate for the sewage treatment requirements till year 2035. 

There is no sewage treatment facility in the Ramnagar town. The Ramnagar project for which the foundation stone is being laid will  intercept the 4 main drains of Ramnagar town. The intercepted wastewater will be  treated at the proposed 10 MLD STP. This will prevent  pollution of river Ganga from drains in Ramnagar.

                National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) in partnership with HCL Foundation and German development agency GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit) organized “Bal Ganga Mela” at HCL’s Noida campus on sunday, November 4, 2018. More than 500 children from HCL Foundation-supported government schools in Noida, bridge centres, Power of One community champions and scholars participated in the mela. The day is symbolic as it marks the declaration of Ganga as the National River of India in 2008 and is dedicated to raising awareness about rejuvenating the holy river and teaching children to become environmentally aware and responsible citizens. 

The Bal Ganga Mela was inaugurated by Shri U. P. Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation in the presence of Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, Director General, NMCG, Ms. Nidhi Pundhir, Director, CSR, and Head, HCL Foundation, Ms. Martina Burkard, Programme Director, GIZ (Support for Ganga Rejuvenation) and Mr. Anil Kumar Singh, Chief Development Officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. The Mela was organized with the objective to create awareness among school children on the importance of water in general and rivers in particular, so that they understand the importance of unpolluted, clean water and water security. Also, to foster respect for the natural environment and motivate children to become ambassadors of change, who influence and motivate others towards river rejuvenation and water conservation.

The participating children engaged in day-long activities that included Water Quality Testing, Waste Segregation, Interactive Games, Street Play, Rangoli, Painting, Quiz Competition and Movie Screening.The Bal Mela offered outdoor engaging and participatory activities for children, aimed to motivate the participants to become ‘stewards’ of the Ganga and water in general within their schools as well as in their families and communities. The hands-on and interactive activities had clear underlying messages that are relevant to their daily lives with reference to Ganga rejuvenation and water conservation. 

NMCG is committed towards afforestation and conservation of the Ganga Basin’s ecosystem and its indigenous flora and fauna. To scale up the momentum in this direction, NMCG also signed an MoU with the HCL Foundation to work on tributaries of Ganga, - Hindon and Yamuna  and increase  forest cover in parts of UP and Uttarakhand.  The two organizations will work for 

• Sensitization/awareness programs on Forest and Environment Conservation.

• Urban and peri urban afforestation under the urban forest model of HCL Foundation- “Foundation   Upvan.

• Mass afforestation on Government allotted land and creation of Urban Forests in partnership with the HCL Foundation and District Administration.

• Ensure plantation success rate of 60 to 70% at the end of 10 years from the date of signing of the MoU between both the parties.

                The National Mission for Clean Ganga partnered with UN Habitat to organize a policy dialogue- ‘Urban Cafe: River for Habitat’ in New Delhi on the occasion of World Cities Day 2018 yesterday. Experts in the sector got together to discuss the deep association that rivers have with various aspects of human civilization – our cities, our economy and various facets of our  daily lives, the challenges to maintaining  healthy river ecosystems and ways  to deal with the same. 

Addressing the inaugural session Shri U.P Singh Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation expressed concern about people’s weakening connect with rivers in the modern times and the bad health of many of our rivers. He said that no untreated sewage of industrial effluent should be allowed to flow into rivers, there should be no dumping of solid waste on flood plains, there should be a focus on increasing water usage efficiency in agriculture and reducing extraction of ground water. This will lead to better river health. 

Speaking on the occasion DG, NMCG, Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra detailed the measures being taken by his organization for cleaning Ganga. He said, “Today, the challenge we face is urbanization vis.a.vis rivers. A survey carried out on the main-stem of Ganga has identified 97 towns contributing to sewage/industrial pollution in the river”. Elaborating on the measures taken by NMCG, to address these issues, Shri Mishra said that innovations such as One City One Operator, Hybrid Annuity Model, 15 year Operations & Maintenance of sewerage infrastructure projects have been introduced. He also talked about the Urban River Management Plan developed by the Consortium of 7 IITs and emphasized that the connect between river and people is essential since the community needs to be involved as stakeholders to monitor the health of the river. Other issues that he pointed out as vital in this regard include managing  flood plain encroachments, developing city-specific urban management plan, valuation of river services in economic terms, preserving biodiversity in Ganga, maintaining groundwater recharge, NMCG’s collaboration and convergence with all stakeholders and engaging public participation.

In his key note address Shri  Sanjeev Sanyal,  Principal Economic Advisor, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance said that in order to protect our flood plains we need to find environmentally sensitive ways of using them to build a connect with the people living around them.  

Mr. Yuri Afanasiev, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Representative in India said, “Water is to this century, what oil was to the 20th century”. All over the world, our ancestors have referred to rivers such as the Nile, the Danube, the Rhine, the Volga, the Ganga as the ‘Mother’. Talking about NMCG, he said, “NMCG’s integrated approach involving different Ministries needs to be emulated by other river management authorities in India”.

Also speaking at the inaugural session Shri Hitesh Vaidya, Country Manager, UN-Habitat India said that we must find ways to turn challenges into solutions and solutions into opportunities

Shri Partha Mukhopadhyay, Senior Fellow, Centre for Policy Research, Mr. Rene Van Berkel from UNIDO, Prof. Brijgopal, National Institute of Ecology, Dr. Alok K. Sikka, Prof. Vinod Tare from IIT Kanpur, Shri Chetan Vaidya, Former Director SPA, Delhi, Shri Shiv Das Meena from Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs,  Shri Victor Shinde, National Institute of Urban Affairs, Dr. Rakesh Kumar, NEERI Shri Abhay Mishra, Writer Journalist, Shri Manu Bhatnagar, INTACH, Ms. Martina Burkard, GIZ. , Dr. Niladri Dasgupta, Wildlife Institute of India and Shri Suresh Babu, from WWF-India were the expert panelists for the various sessions. 

The panelists emphasized on the intrinsic relationship between river and economy which has to be a win-win situation for both. River and river basins should be seen as ‘national capital or asset’. They also stressed on developing an Urban River Plan from where the river enters the city and where it exits. Emphasizing the importance of ghats, the experts further noted that not only do ghats connect river to the people but also promote safety of the river and people. The experts further stressed upon advocacy and resolve combined with public participation as vital elements for restoring our river ecosystems.

                The National Festival for Children of Child Care Institutions (CCIs)- “Hausla 2018” of the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) was inaugurated by the Secretary, Shri Rakesh Srivastava, today in New Delhi. The inter-Child Care Institution festival is witnessing participation of more than 600 Children drawn from CCIs from 18 states in the various events like painting competition, athletics meet, football, chess competition and speech writing as part of the Festival.

Speaking at the 4 dayEvent, from 26 to 29th November 2018,Secretary MWCD said that the idea behind the entire event is to provide a national platform for the children from CCIs across India to showcase their talent, to make them realise the hidden talent they possess and to help take it  forward in their life. He said that this event would  instil  confidence in them to achieve greater heights in life. He also resolved to make the event like Hausla even stronger. He also said that the event shall inspire children of Child Care Institutions so that they can reach the National Stage for expressing their capabilities. The theme for the event is “Child Safety”.

Children will be participating in various events like Debate, painting competition, athletics meet, football, chess competition and Safe Neighborhood Day. CIF and NIPCCD will be assisting the Ministry in organizing the events.  

The details of the proposed events are as follows:­


	Painting Competition on 26th November 2018: The creative talent in children is infinite and amazing, so much so that even the entire universe may seem like a small canvas to them. A creative activity like painting also helps in the development of the brain of a child. Expressing themselves through painting allows children to take part in an activity that is fun and fulfilling. It encourages them to look at situations with an open & creative mind. With this background in consideration, a painting competition is being organized by the Ministry of Women and Child Development on 26th November, 2018 for children from all the Child Care Institutions across the country at NIPCCD.  The paintings will be judged by a panel of three judges. 


 


	Debate Competition on 26th November,2018: In today’s competitive space where excellence is a cliché, it is wise to make children aware as well as ready for the outer world. Perhaps, there are ways in which children compete and succeed. But individual expression has become very limited. Today’s children are largely engrossed in technology, leaving behind the real interaction. This is why it is necessary to encourage children into participating in activities like debates which shall have a long-term impression on a child’s self-expression. In this regard, a debate competition is being organized by the Ministry of Women and Child Development on 26th November, 2018 at NIPCCD. The children shall be judged by a panel of three judges.


3.  Athletics Meet, Chess Competition and Football Matches on 28-29 November 2018: Through play, children explore, invent and create. They also develop social skills, learn to express their emotions, and gain confidence about their own capabilities. The Ministry is organizing athletics meet (100 meters race, 200 m race, 100 x 4 meter relay race, long jump, high jump), chess competition and football matches for boys and girls from CCIs. The events will be organized at JawaharLal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi. 

To encourage children, prominent sportsperson might also be invited on 28th November 2018 (morning) to inaugurate sports meet along with Secretary, WCD. 

4.  Safe Neighborhood Project Day on 27th November 2018: It is not just the home environment that influences a child; the neighborhood in which he/she lives does too. A close-knit neighborhood can provide a sense of belonging, safety, and support. Feeling safe in the neighborhood is important for mental health and overall well-being and is linked to lower rates of mental illness, greater social interaction, and neighborhood trust. This activity is aimed to empower and inspire children to voice their opinions on what they perceive as Safety in a Neighborhood. The children will make models, do role-play, theatre, skit, sing, dance etc. on the subject. The children shall be judged by a panel of judges from MWCD.

The Concluding Ceremony on 29th November 2018: The four-day long celebration will culminate through the concluding ceremony which will be organized on 29th November (evening) at Siri Fort Auditorium, HauzKhas, New Delhi. The event will include a cultural programme by the children of CCIs, presentation of Best State Team Award based on performance during Hausla 2018 and Prize distribution to all winners of each individual event by Hon’ble Minister, WCD.

Complaints can be registered on SHe-Box, an effort of the government to provide a single window access to every woman, irrespective of her work status, whether working in organised or unorganised, private or public sector, to facilitate the registration of complaint related to sexual harassment. Any woman facing sexual harassment at workplace can register her complaint through this portal. Once a complaint is submitted to ‘SHe-Box’ http://shebox.nic.in/, it will be directly sent to the authority concerned having jurisdiction to take action in the matter.  

            A Handbook and Training Module on the SH Act has also been published by the Ministry to provide information about the provisions of the Act in an easy-to-use practical manner. (Available here:  http://www.wcd.nic.in/act/2314 ) The private organizations are encouraged to customize the Training Module as per their extant service rules and disciplinary procedures prescribed therein.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development has linked SHe-Box, the online portal to report complaints of Sexual Harassment at Workplace, to all the Central Ministries, Departments and 653 districts across 33 States/Union Territories. For prompt disposal of complaints on SHe-Box, each case goes directly to the central/ state authority concerned having jurisdiction to take action in the matter. Cases on She-Box can be monitored by the complainants and Ministry WCD, reducing the time taken in case disposal. Till November 20, 2018, as many as 321 complaints have been registered with 'SHe-Box' out of which 120 are related to central ministries/departments, 58 are from state governments and 143 are from private companies.  

Elaborating on the portal, Smt. Gandhi said, ""SHe-Box portal is an effort to provide speedy remedy to women facing sexual harassment at workplace. With the linking of the portal to central and state governments, once a complaint is submitted to the portal, it will be directly sent to the section of the employer concerned. Through this portal, WCD as well as the complainant, can monitor the progress of the inquiry. This is a proactive step taken by the WCD Ministry in the wake of the worldwide campaign #MeToo, where women have related their experience of facing sexual harassment and abuse at workplace."" 

 

SHe-Box, which was launched by WCD Minister Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi last year, offers the facility of making online complaints of sexual harassment at workplace to all women employees in the country including government and private employees. Those who have already filed a written complaint with the concerned Internal Complaint Committee (ICC) or Local Complaint Committee (LCC) constituted under the Sexual Harassment Act are also eligible to file their complaint through this portal.

The portal can be accessed at the following link: http://shebox.nic.in/

The Ministry has also published a Handbook and Training Module on the SH Act to provide information about the provisions of the Act in easy to use practical manner. The private organizations are encouraged to customize the Training Module as per their extant service rules and disciplinary procedures prescribed therein.

                The 5th edition of the 10-day “Women of India National Organic Festival 2018” organised by the Ministry of Women & Child Development culminated on the night of Sunday, 4th November, at the expansive grounds of Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, Janpath Road. Over the 10 days, women farmers and entrepreneurs from across the country, participated with vast variety of organic products ranging from food and fabrics to wellness and personal care participated in this festival, which is an annual affair.

 

This year, the total sales by the women farmers and entrepreneurs who came from 26 States, were a record of over Rs. 2.75 crore, up from Rs. 1.84 crore in last year’s edition that was organised at Dilli Haat, INA, New Delhi. The festival is expected to have had footfalls of nearly 12 lakh. The success of the Organic Festival has added to the joy of the women farmers from diverse as well as far off corners of the country, such as Majuli, Kangra, Leh, Palakkad, Chikkmaglur, Yavatmal, Dimapur and Almora, among others. Participants had the opportunity to travel and stay in Delhi free of cost for the entire duration of the Festival while enjoying the experience of selling their wholesome goods to Delhiites, who thronged the lawns of IGNCA, not only on weekends, but also on weekdays. This year saw the grand debut of the Food Court and Vegan Food, which were very well received by all visitors.

 

The Women of India National Organic Festival 2018 was inaugurated on 26th October 2018, at IGNCA, Janpath Road by the Union Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, who has been instrumental in creating the only festival of its kind in India. She also did her Diwali gifts’ shopping from the organic festival, an example followed by several people who made return trips to IGNCA, to make their gift basket unique.

 

The Festival, which was held from 26th October to 4th November, saw a regular stream of people from diverse walks of life on all days, giving immense encouragement to the earnest efforts of all the participants. The main objective of the Festival has always been to support and encourage women and women-led groups that promote organic farming, thus supporting their local community’s economy, creating jobs and keeping farmers thriving, in addition to spreading proper awareness about the benefits of organic products.

 

“The response has been overwhelming,” said Ms. Anamika, an entrepreneur from Mumbai, whose stall had bamboo toothbrushes and steel straws, which were “a hot favourite, even among the youngsters”. While she spoke about creating awareness among people, the encouraging response at the Festival was “the best thing possible”. Ms Sarabjit Kaur, a farmer from Punjab who came for the Organic Festival for the first time registered her happiness at being in Delhi. “This is the first time I’ve come here and am heartened by the positive response our multi-grain products received. I’d like to thank the Ministry of Women and Child Development for giving us this opportunity,” she said. Ms Aparna of AIM for Seva from Tamil Nadu, said she didn’t anticipate the amount of sales at this year’s festival, which she credits to the rising awareness among people. Her stall stored 30 different varieties of organic, indigenous and heritage rice from the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Manipur, Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal. “The Chakhao Poireiton [rice from Manipur] and Gobindobhog [rice from West Bengal] were completely sold out, and we’re glad for this response,” she says.

 

The participants of Women of India National Organic Festival 2018 also had the opportunity to enroll themselves in Mahila-E-Haat, which is an online marketing portal set up by the Ministry of Women & Child Development, to meet the aspirations and needs of women entrepreneurs. This unique e-platform exponentially strengthens the socio-economic empowerment of women beyond the Festival. The Women of India National Organic Festival is an annual affair and serves as a platform to celebrate and promote women farmers and entrepreneurs from different corners of India.

                The NITI Aayog today organized a day-long dialogue on “Health System for A New India: Building Blocks”, with national and international academia, practitioners, Indian policymakers and other stakeholders of the healthcare ecosystem. 

The dialogue was the first in the series of NITI Aayog’s “Development Dialogues” that aims to facilitate multisectoral conversations on India’s developmental issues, which constitute a part of the country’s 15 Year Vision document. 

The inaugural session was chaired by Dr Vinod Paul, Member, NITI Aayog and included the participation of Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, MsPreeti Sudan, Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Shri Alok Kumar, Adviser, NITI Aayog. Dr. SuwitWibulpolprasert, Global Health Advisor, Government of Thailand gave the keynote address detailing Thailand’s four-decade journey towards Universal Health Coverage.

“This dialogue is a sign that Health has taken center-stage of the policy narrative. We must move towards breaking silos between various stakeholders in the health space, remove fragmentation between various initiatives, and ensure convergence between various ministries and also between Centre and States. POSHAN Abhiyan and Ayushman Bharat can be an innovative model to view integrated health systems”, said Dr Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog, addressing the closing plenary of the dialogue. 

The dialogue focused on strengthening and further building on the existing blocks for Health Systems for a New India and prioritized four critical health systems issues for discussion and debate. These included expanding resources for health through pooling existing funds; expanding the role of the government as a strategic purchaser from both public and private providers to improve quality of healthcare services; provision of equitable and integrated services; and leveraging technology as an enabler and aggregator.   

The dialogue also deliberated convergence of fragmented building blocks of financing and service provision, with each reinforcing the other, and moving from programmatic or schematic approaches to a systemsapproach to healthcare.

The roll-out of the ambitious Ayushman Bharat was also hailed as a good opportunity to bring in systems thinking and de-fragmenting the various building blocks of healthcare systematically over time. Further, strengthening governance, policy and regulatory frameworks and institutions were deemed key to ensuring systemic transformation of the health sector for a new India. 

There was broad consensus that the development of a health system for India can lead to the growth of a healthy and globally competitive healthcare insuranceand health service provision industry and more importantly, improved consumer experience and citizen trust in the healthcare system. Dr Paul emphasized that trust in the system will be key for building an efficient health system for a new India, which is inclusive, integrative and indigenous.

As Mr Kant stated in the inaugural plenary, it is time to bring the patient to the centre of the health care narrative and the time has come to evolve a world-class health system which is transformative and uniquely Indian. 

It is estimated that if the required decisions in terms of creating a functioning Health system are taken, then it shall reduce adult deaths by up to 16% by 2030, thereby increasing economic growth up to 32%. 

It is also estimated that breaking programmatic silos and integration of various schemes within a systems approach will lead to reduction in avoidable out-of-pocket expenses to about 45%of total health spending by 2030, preventing at least 1.5 millionadditional households to go below the poverty line due to illness and unaffordable health care.

The discussions were guided by analysis undertaken by well-known international experts from multilateral organisations, along with over 25 national and international experts from over six countries and 150 participants representing government, private sector, insurance companies, third party administrators, research and academia.

The analysis and insights highlight that investments in strengthening and building on the current mixed health system will reap social and economic dividend for India.

                Organised in collaboration with Singapore Cooperation Enterprise & TF International

NITI Aayog organized todaythe Second Phase of Urban Management Programme on ‘Water Recycling and Reuse’.in collaboration with the Singapore Cooperation Enterprise & TF Internationalat India Habitat Centre in the capital today.  CEO, NITI Aayog, Amitabh Kant,Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation,ParameswaranIyer, along with High Commissioner of Singapore to India Lim ThuanKuan, CEO, Singapore Cooperation Enterprise, Kong WyMun, and CE of Temasek Foundation International,Benedict Cheong were present on this occasion.

Highlighting the importance of this capacity building programme on management of water,particularly its recycling & reuse, as crucial for future urban planning and policy, Amitabh Kant said that attaining high rates of economic growth for India will directly be a function of the sustainable use of water. He mentioned that NITI’s Composite Water Management Index, launched earlier this year, is a step toward increasing awareness and promoting best practises in water management throughout the country.

Delivering the Inaugural Address, ParameswaranIyer hailed the workshop as timely and spoke of the need for effective cooperation between the centre and state in water management. He emphasised need for all stakeholders to take ownership of water as a natural resource to ensure sustainable use of water. He emphasised the need to take steps to address solid and liquid waste management in 4000 Census Towns and peri-urban areas. 

In order to develop recycled water as part of sustainable and diverse water portfolio, NITI Aayog has enteredinto a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Singapore Cooperation Enterprise - Temasek Foundation International to launch the Second Phase of Urban Management Programme on ‘Water Recycling and Reuse’.

Eight States/UTs -Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Puducherry and West Bengalwere selected for the capacity building workshops through a Challenge Method. The participants of the workshops included the senior officials from Municipal and parastatal bodies of these eight States/UTs.

The programme launch was also attended by senior officials from the Central and State Governments, and representatives from the academia and think-tanks. The programme launch also showcased the best practices in the urban water sector in India besides discussing the challenges. 

The capacity building programme featured experience sharing by consultants from Singapore, who were associated in the successful transformation of the urban waterscape over the last four decades. The broader capacity building engagement with SCE also includes a series of interactive workshops, advisory sessions and an expository visit to Singapore.

Background:

India is experiencing rapid urbanisation. The urban population has gone up from 29 crore in 2001 to 37.7 crore in 2011. Due to rapid urbanisation, water demand in urban areas is increasing rapidly.The water situation in metropolitan cities is particularly exacerbating, where the people in such cities face acute water shortage. Changing climate and its impact on temporal and spatial variability of rainfall, is a further deterrent to timely and sufficient availability of water resources. 

In this backdrop, concerted efforts have been made by the Government of India to implement rainwater harnessing schemes for groundwater improvement, however, there is an urgent need for water portfolio diversification through introducing alternate sustainable water sources. 

The recycle and reuse of water presents itself as a potential solution for ensuring assured water supply in the Cities, on a sustainable basis.  Recycling and reuse has been widely practised in Singapore, where every drop of water is recycled for reuse. Such an approach not only reduces pressure on other water sources, but also offers a sustainable solution for water resources management.  

While the AMRUT scheme drives the cities to undertake water supplies on a business model, yet the water source augmentation remains a challenge for ensuring assured water supply through the future. Nearly 30% of urban water supply and 70% of rural water supply in the country comes from groundwater, which is depleting day by day.

                NITI Aayog, the premier think tank of the Government of India, partnered with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to host a South Asian regional conference at PravasiBharatiya Kendra in the capital today to discuss the key issues, perspectives and the way forward in the Urban Infrastructure. 

The two day conference on “Urban Infrastructure: New Approaches to Public & Private Partnerships and Municipal Finance Innovations”, being held on November 15-16, was inaugurated by CEO, NITI Aayog, Amitabh Kant, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of FinanceSubhash Chandra Garg. UN Resident Coordinator in India,YuriAfanasiev, Country Director, ADB India Kenichi Yokoyama, and Director & Head, UNESCAP S&SW Office, Dr Nagesh Kumar were present on this occasion.

Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs), Shri Hardeep Singh Puri addressed the closing session on Day One of the Conference and received the rapporteurs' presentations, summarising best practices related to new approaches to PPP & Municipal Financing. 

In the inaugural address, CEO NITI Aayog, Amitabh Kant emphasized upon the need to ensure adequate return on investments in infrastructure through properly structured Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and de-risking of projects. He  said that  it is required to evolve unique models and systems of urban planning which are creative, innovative and sustainable, and suited for South Asian countries.  

Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Subhash Chandra Garg emphasised on the need to decentralised urbanisation, with porous boundaries between urban & rural areas as the key to sustainable urbanisation. He said that the future areas of growth & development are infrastructure & digitalised delivery of goods & services.

Considering the quantum deficit in infrastructure implementation today vis-à-vis the demand, it is extremely imperative to focus on newer means of implementing and financing urban infrastructure. In India alone, until 2040, estimated investments of around $4.5 trillion are required in the infrastructure space. With respect to urban needs, the population in South Asia is expected to grow by around 250 million till 2030, while that in India is expected to reach around 590 million during the same period. 

There are an estimated 98 million people who reside in the slums of Indian cities and are disproportionately deprived of access to basic services and infrastructure. These gaps must be addressed, so that the cities grow equitably and in an environmentally responsible way. 

Background:

The South Asian regional conference is a first of its kind, with participation from across the South Asian region including leaders from the government, industry, research organizations, academia, think tanks and civil society. The Conference aims to review overall issues and assess the sustainability of PPPs and urban finance in South Asia, specifically India, while broadening the knowledge base and engaging on international best practices. Components of the Conference include keynote and breakout sessions, panel discussions, presentation and a variety of stakeholder consultations.

Countries need to explore innovative models to implement infrastructure projects. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been one such option that enables governments to optimally share the risks associated with a project’s life cycle. However, for making government procurement more dynamic, it is imperative to focus on wider options. Furthermore, to implement urban infrastructure in India, a deeper deliberation is required on the means of democratising the governance at the city level with a view towards providing greater operational and fiscal autonomy to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). These challenges and the emerging opportunities necessitate focusing on the institutional environment to improve the delivery of sustainable urban infrastructure and services and evaluating alternatives for long term, predictable financing.

                NITI Aayog’s Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) and UNICEF India, have come together this Children’s Day, to provide an open platform to young children of India, to contribute towards sustainable development.

Celebrating innovation on the occasion of the National Children’s Day, the UNICEF – Atal Tinkering Labs Young Champions Awards were announced today by Dr Rajiv Kumar,Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog and Mr. Yuri Afanasiev, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in India. Mr Ramanathan Ramanan, Mission Director of AIM and Ms Laura SiegristFouché, Chief of Operations at UNICEF were also present.

The awards were presented to the top six most innovative solutions from across the country, which were shortlisted through the Atal Tinkering Marathon.

On October 2 last year, AIM’s Atal Tinkering Labs (ATL) had launched a six month long nationwide challenge called the Atal Tinkering Marathon, across six different thematic areas, namely, clean energy, water resources, waste management, healthcare, smart mobility and agri-technology. 

The objective was to encourage students to observe community problems and develop innovative solutions. From over 650 innovations received, Top 30 innovations were identified from 20 different States and Union territories from across India. 

These Top 30 teams were awarded with several prizes including a three month-long ATL Student Innovator Program in partnership with industry and start-up incubators, where students were trained on business and entrepreneurship skills. The partners included start-up incubators: C-CAMP, Aartech, Amrita TBI, TREC-STEP and industry representatives: Learning Links Foundation, Intel India and Stratasys India.

These Top 30 innovations are symbolic of a larger movement which is taking root in every school, in every district across India. 

As part of a long-term partnership, during the Children’s Day Week, from today to the World Children’s Day on 20 November, AIM and UNICEF seek to drive extensive forward and backward linkages within the stakeholders in India, to create a paradigm shift in the student mindset and prepare them to become young innovators and entrepreneurs.

AIM and UNICEF have also launched a 72 hour Tinkering Hackathon from 14 to 17 November so that children can come up with innovative solutions for challenges faced by them in school, especially pertaining to quality of education and safety in schools.The winners of the Hackathon will be announced on 20 November, World Children’s Day.

After detailed presentations and in-depth discussions, both sides affirmed their commitment for a more inclusive and truly global world order, with multilateralism as the preferred way forward.

 

Emphasis was also laid on innovation and digital economy and it was observed that India and China are poised to become global leaders in digital innovation with rising number of tech startups operating in various sectors. On electric mobility, with India envisioning to move towards EVs and ZEVs by 2030, as also showcased by the Global Mobility Summit recently organized by NITI Aayog, avenues for collaboration via joint research and development, public and private investment were discussed. 

 

Both sides also agreed to examine various trade sector related issues, and the need for enhanced policy coordination to facilitate investments.

 

It was also agreed that NITI Aayog and DRC will undertake joint research in the areas of WTO reforms and urbanization, which would be presented in the next Dialogue.

                Procurement, based on the principles of fairness, transparency and public interest, will protect the revenues of the State and make sure that they are used for optimal purpose, said the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Shri Arun Jaitley. Shri Jaitley was delivering the Keynote Address at the National Conference on Public Procurement & Competition Law in New Delhi today.

The Finance Minister, Shri Jaitley, in his Keynote Address, further said that the competition regulator was created to ensure effective competition so that consumer interest could be protected. While talking about the roadmap for future, he stated that India needs to look at global models and visualise how to deal with emerging situations. Shri Jaitley stated that public procurement being a very large part of the country’s GDP, the State is entitled to have the best price and quality and this also applies to all Statutory Institutions. The Finance Minister, Shri Jaitley said that there are areas in which tender bids can be global while in some areas, domestic development is desirable, especially in case of the service sector in which the effective competition needs to be build within the country itself. He said that with expansion of the economy, India's market expansion is going to have exponential growth and therefore, the role of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) as a Regulator will also expand with time. Size of the Service Sector, Industry and Manufacturing Sector will also increase, he added.

Earlier, CCI Chairperson, Shri Sudhir Mital stressed on the importance of building a culture of competition in Public Procurement Systems in India. He said that Free, Fair and Effective Procurement can reduce cost of delivery, free resources and make surpluses available, make the PSUs more competitive and allow the Public Sector to grow. He emphasised on the need for having a Pro-Competitive Procurement Systems that can reduce the scope of anti-competitive behaviour by the bidders. He also announced that the CCI is in process of Designing a Diagnostic Tool for public procurement agencies that would facilitate detection of bid rigging in public procurement as well as help design tenders which would promote fair competition. He also mentioned of a digital cartel detection software that the CCI is developing, following the international best practices.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Injeti Srinivas, Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs stated that given the sheer volume of public procurement in GDP, which accounts for more than 26% of GDP i.e. equivalent to around Rs. 28 lakh crore, it has a significant influence on the economy’s performance. He said that Competitive Procurement could result in cost saving to the extent of around 20-30% that could have long term impact on the economy. He added that there is a need to redesign the current PPP model to bring in efficiency and promote competition. He concluded by saying that competition is the single largest force for growth in a market economy.

In his address, Mr. Junaid Kamal Ahmad, World Bank’s India Country Director announced that contracting with the Government will be one of the new indicators to be considered by the World Bank in the next round of their Ease of Doing Business ranking. He stressed that improving competition in Public Procurement and e-procurement would facilitate market participation, expand business opportunities for a larger number of players and reduce their processing cost. He stated that India has adopted best global practices in Government e-marketplace which could be emulated by other developing nations.

IICA Director General and CEO, Dr. Sameer Sharma concluded the Session by giving a brief summary of the points made by the speakers followed by a vote of thanks.
