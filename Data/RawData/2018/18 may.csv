                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the Sadhu Vaswani International School in Pune today (May 30, 2018).

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Sadhu Vaswani, the iconic spiritual figure the Sadhu Vaswani International School is named after, was one among our most remarkable nation builders. He taught us to combine the values of our ancient civilisation with the techniques of the modern age.  His mission has been carried forward by his disciple, Dada J.P. Vaswani, who has dedicated every moment to the cause of humanity. 

 

The President said the city of Pune has been a centre of education for Maharashtra and for the country. The story of modern India owes much to the educational, reformist and progressive ideas that have flowed from this city, and for which our nation is truly appreciative. He noted that it was in Pune that in 1848 Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and Savitribai Phule opened what is believed to have been the first modern school in India exclusively for girls. In their determined efforts to fight caste and gender discrimination and work for the weaker sections, Jyotiba and Savitribai Phule made education their chief weapon, as did other reformers from Pune.

 

The President said that values-based education helps promote ethics in society. Our freedom fighters and leaders placed emphasis on education – and on discourse that was informed by knowledge, wisdom and learning. Each one of them placed emphasis on a culture of discussion rather than of dispute – and of addressing disagreements while being mindful of the other person’s dignity. 

 

The President said that in school, a child is taught history and geography, language and literature, mathematics and science. In class X and in class XII, children are examined in these and other subjects. They are given marks and grades. While not discounting the importance of such subjects, he drew attention to lessons that a child imbibes in school that may not be formally tested in a board examination. These are the lessons of culture, character, compassion and courage. And of coping with change in a society and a world evolving more rapidly than perhaps ever before. 

 

The President said that a child who imbibes these lessons and internalises these values will always be sensitive to the world outside, and to those who may be less privileged. Such a child will never forget to contribute to society, in whichever way he or she can. 

 

Earlier in the day, the President unveiled the statue of Matoshree Ramabai Bhimrao Ambedkar at the Matoshree Ramabai Bhimrao Ambedkar Garden in Pune. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President underlined Matoshree Ramabai Bhimrao Ambedkar’s contribution to the life and career of her husband Dr B R Ambedkar.  He said that her supportive role and courage through difficult times helped Dr Ambedkar evolve into a distinguished and renowned scholar and public figure. This was a role Dr Ambedkar himself acknowledged. 

 

The President said that his life with Ramabai no doubt influenced Dr Ambedkar’s thinking and made him an advocate of women’s rights. It led him to fight for economic equality for women and to ensure that the Constitution gave them equal political rights from the outset. In this, Dr Ambedkar made certain that India was different from many other democracies, which did not give women these rights at an early stage. 

 

The President said that Matoshree Ramabai Bhimrao Ambedkar herself contributed immensely to battling and effacing the practice of untouchability and strived for social equality for all. She remains an ideal for all Indians.

                I am happy to be here for the formal opening of the Sadhu Vaswani International School in Pradhikaran, Pune. I have been told that the school has been functional since 2012 but the entire building and structure has only recently been completed. As such the dedication is taking place today.

 

The school draws from a great legacy. Sadhu Vaswani, the iconic spiritual figure it is named after, was one among our most remarkable nation builders. He taught us to combine the values of our ancient civilisation with the techniques of the modern age.  

 

Sadhu Vaswani’s mission has been carried forward by his disciple, the much respected Dada J.P. Vaswani. I first had the pleasure of meeting him at an event in Mumbai in 2016, when I was Governor of Bihar. It was immediately clear to me that he is a very impressive personality and a deep thinker. The year 2018 is a special year. In a few months, Dada J.P. Vaswani will be celebrating his 100th birthday. For 79 of these 100 years, since he renounced worldly attachments at the young age of 21, Dada J.P. Vaswani has dedicated every moment to the cause of humanity. He has been an ambassador of Indian tradition and culture on countless platforms, within the country and abroad, including at the United Nations.

 

I understand that in his younger days Dada J.P. Vaswani was a brilliant student. He was a university topper in physics and his thesis on the Scattering of X-rays by Solids was assessed by none other than Sir C.V. Raman, the first Indian scientist to win the Nobel Prize. Yet, Dada J.P. Vaswani thought nothing of sacrificing a promising academic career to immerse himself in spiritual learning, in welfare, in caring for the underprivileged and even for defenceless animals. One of the methods he has chosen is to light the lamp of education. The setting up of Sadhu Vaswani Schools in different locations of the country is a part of his journey.  

 

This is a commendable achievement. And this is the rich and purposeful legacy that strengthens the very foundations of the school.

 

Ladies and Gentlemen and Dear Children

Your school is doubly blessed. It draws motivation from not just Sadhu Vaswani and Dada J.P. Vaswani – but also from the inspiring history of Pune. The city of Pune has been a centre of education for Maharashtra and for the country. The story of modern India owes much to the educational, reformist and progressive ideas that have flowed from this city, and for which our nation is truly appreciative.

 

It was in this city that in 1848 Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and Savitribai Phule opened what is believed to have been the first modern school in India exclusively for girls. In their determined efforts to fight caste and gender discrimination and work for the weaker sections, Jyotiba and Savitribai Phule made education their chief weapon.

 

They were not alone. It was in Pune that Justice M.G. Ranade and others set up the Maharashtra Girls Education Society in the 19th century. In 1860, the heroic freedom fighter Vasudev Balwant Phadke was among those who founded the Maharashtra Education Society. Bal Gangadhar Tilak and his colleagues established the Deccan Education Society. And later Gopal Krishna Gokhale was instrumental in the creation of the Servants of India Society.

 

Many of these initiatives and educational institutions are still with us and are still going strong. In Maharashtra and in other states, they are responsible for schools and colleges that prepare our children and our younger generation for service to the nation and for service to society. 

 

The Chief Architect of our Constitution, Dr B.R. Ambedkar, had a long relationship with Pune. He too stressed the importance of education as an instrument for social change and for building a just and egalitarian society. I am happy to learn that the government of Maharashtra has begun to celebrate November 7 as “Students’ Day”. This was the day, way back in the year 1900, when Babasaheb Ambedkar enrolled in a school in Satara, and began his lifelong pursuit of academic excellence.

 

Values-based education helps promote ethics in society. And I can think of no better example as an upholder of values in our public life than Shri Lal Krishna Advani, who we are honoured to have here with us today.

 

Ladies and Gentlemen and Dear Children 

The names and examples I cited earlier represent a gamut of our country’s achievers and the spirit of our nation building project. These were people who struggled for our freedom from colonial rule, and for an India free of caste, gender and other forms of discrimination – for an India that could put right and redress both historical wrongs and contemporary inequities. Each one of them placed emphasis on education – and on discourse that was informed by knowledge, wisdom and learning. Each one of them placed emphasis on a culture of discussion rather than of dispute – and of addressing disagreements while being mindful of the other person’s dignity. 

 

This is the true attribute of an educated society. And this is the benchmark by which we measure Pune’s intellectual vibrancy and reputation as a centre of scholarship. Above all, this is the context in which the Sadhu Vaswani International School is carving out its space in this city.

 

Education also has another aspect – of moulding young minds. After birth, a child is nurtured by those around him or her. Early learning takes place from family members, who provide love and affection, and shape instinct. Thereafter begins the child’s longest journey in learning – for about 15 years in school. Teachers don’t just impart knowledge of individual subjects. They sculpt the child’s very identity. A child’s habits, values, thoughts, strengths, resilience, determination, dreams and actions are all influenced by the school environment.

 

In school, a child is taught history and geography, language and literature, mathematics and science. In class X and in class XII, children are examined in these and other subjects. They are given marks and grades. While not discounting the importance of such subjects, I would draw your attention to lessons that a child imbibes in school that may not be formally tested in a board examination. These are the lessons of culture, character, compassion and courage. And of coping with change in a society and a world evolving more rapidly than perhaps ever before. 

 

A child who imbibes these lessons and internalises these values will always be sensitive to the world outside, and to those who may be less privileged. Such a child will never forget to contribute to society, in whichever way he or she can. Such a child can only be reared in a school that is marked by open windows, and not by closed doors. Blessed by the presence of Dada J.P. Vaswani, I am confident that the Sadhu Vaswani International School will be just such a school. I am confident that it will serve the community here in Pune as well as our country in nurturing ideal citizens of tomorrow. 

 

With those words I wish the school, I wish the children studying there and I wish teachers and others associated with the school the very best.

 

      Thank you

      Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, reviewed the passing out parade of the 134th course of the National Defence Academy, this morning (May 30, 2018) in Khadakwasla, near Pune.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that he was delighted to review the passing out parade at the NDA. As the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, this was a moment of immense satisfaction for him. The Armed Forces are a symbol of excellence and dedication for the entire country. This parade comprises cadets from all parts of India and from a variety of communities. Its harmony speaks for our essential unity as much as for our pluralism as a society.

The President said that a soldier or an officer in uniform, irrespective of whether he or she is from the Army, the Navy or the Air Force, evokes admiration and trust everywhere in the country. If a fellow citizen sees a member of the Armed Forces at a railway station or a market or at any other place, there is an immediate emotion of pride and reassurance. This is due to the unparalleled and unquestioning service to the nation in times of war and peace, on the border or within the country during a natural calamity. The Armed Forces represent the best of the Indian ethos.

The President said that the NDA is more than just a training facility. It is the crucible of valour and bravery. It has inculcated a resolve and a spirit of national service in generations of cadets and generations of officers. It is because of this heritage that in December 1978 President Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy conferred the President’s Colours on the NDA.

Addressing the cadets, the President said that the Armed Forces are not merely about doing a job – they are about answering a calling. And this is a calling for a rare breed of human beings. Today, the cadets have become role models for our young people, guarantors of our peace and prosperity, and guardians of our nation. He expressed confidence that the graduating cadets would prove worthy successors to the unflinching and fearless officers who have preceded them.

He expressed confidence that the graduating cadets would prove worthy successors to the unflinching and fearless officers who have preceded them.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the annual convocation of the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University in Surat, Gujarat, today (May 29, 2018). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President noted that the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University is named after renowned Gujarati literary figure Narmadashankar Dave or Veer Narmad, who was not only a poet and writer but also a social reformer. Veer Narmad was a nation builder who shaped Gujarati and Indian identity and worked for female empowerment, widow remarriage and similar causes.

The President said the region of ​​south Gujarat is an economic engine for the state. And within this region, Surat makes a significant contribution. The textiles and diamond industries are special to Surat and attract workers from across the country. That is why the city is sometimes called “mini India”. As the leading educational institution here, the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University bears an important responsibility. The large tribal student population that the University serves also adds to its salience.

The President said the objective of education should be to nurture freedom of thought and innovation within the student community, besides building capacities for a professional career. Education should also teach us to respect sentiments of others as well work for the welfare of society. 

Earlier in the day, the President attended a function in Surat to felicitate family members of cadaver organ donors. The function was organised by the NGO Donate Life. Addressing the gathering, the President called for motivating people for organ donation as a service to humanity.

Later in the day, the President presented the ‘Santokbaa Humanitarian Award’, given by the SRK Foundation, to Dr Kiran Kumar, former Chairman, ISRO, and Shri KailashSatyarthi, Nobel Laureate. Speaking on the occasion, the President said he was happy to note that the business community in Surat, which was well known across the world, was supportive of philanthropic and social welfare efforts. He appreciated Shri GovindDholakia of SRK Exports for taking forward this tradition and instituting the awards.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed a civic reception hosted for him by the Government of Himachal Pradesh in Shimla today (May 22, 2018). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President praised Himachal Pradesh as an important centre for culture, tourism and the spiritual tradition in our country. He was happy to note that the state government has inaugurated the ‘Nai Rahen, Nai Manzilen’ scheme to expand the opportunities for tourism in the state. He also noted that several other steps were being taken to promote tourism, including through the ‘Swadesh Darshan Programme’.

Praising Himachal Pradesh as the land of brave war heroes such as Major Somnath Sharma and Captain Vikram Batra, both of whom were awarded the Param Vir Chakra posthumously, the President said perhaps every village in the state contributes to the armed forces. He said that the number of former servicemen in the state was estimated at over 110,000.

The President appreciated Himachal Pradesh’s success in literacy and education, women's empowerment, sanitation, rural infrastructure, social indices, horticulture, hydroelectricity and other areas. He said the state offered a developmental model for other states in the Himalayan region.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 9th convocation of the Dr Y. S. Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry today (May 21, 2018) in Solan, Himachal Pradesh.  

Speaking on the occasion, the President noted that the Dr Y. S.  Parmar University has the distinction of being the first Horticultural University in Asia. He said that research in horticulture and forestry has a special significance for farmers in mountainous regions such as in Himachal Pradesh. Over the past three decades, the Dr Y. S.  Parmar University has contributed significantly to the advance of horticulture and forestry in the state.

The President congratulated students of the University for choosing to pursue their education in the agricultural sector. This sector, he is said, is associated with the prosperity of farmers, the rural community and the entire country. He said he considered each student and teacher of this University to be a technically-equipped friend and partner of the farmers of Himachal Pradesh as well as other parts of our country.

Addressing the graduating students, the President said that the goal of their education should not be limited to simply getting a job. They can start their own enterprises by using their skills and learning. There is immense potential in the field of fruit and vegetable processing. With their knowledge and enterprise, graduates of the University could help consumers in the country and abroad get better food products and help farmers get better value for their produce. He urged the students to take advantage of various schemes and initiatives of the Union and state governments to set up their businesses in the agriculture sector.

	I am happy to be here today for the seventh convocation of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali. Though a young institution, IISER, as it is popularly known, is an extremely important centre of higher education and research in our country. This Institute has quickly become one of northern India’s foremost destinations for students and faculty interested in the pursuit of scientific advance. It is well on its way to fulfilling its mandate of promoting and providing facilities for basic science research and integrating these with the needs of India and of our wider society.


 


	Your location in Mohali is itself telling. It allows you to serve the talented young people of, as well become part of, the Chandigarh-Mohali-Panchkula metropolitan area. This is one of the most exciting and promising urban agglomerations in our country. In parallel, IISER Mohali is also drawing inspiration from the rich tradition of basic and applied scientific research in Punjab. This legacy goes back to the period before Independence, when Punjab was one of India’s earliest centres of scientific knowledge production and training. 


 


	This legacy also provides us some excellent examples of how collaboration between scientific researchers and technologists on the one side, and the larger developmental process on the other, contributed to nation building. We cannot forget the technologists who did the groundwork for large projects such as the Bhakra Nangal Project. Again, it was agricultural scientists and universities in Punjab that provided the basis for enhanced food productivity and for the Green Revolution. And today Mohali is a hub for the knowledge economy, for Information Technology, biotechnology and bioinformatics and related fields. It is critical therefore that we see IISER as not just a standalone institution but as the fulcrum of an entire ecosystem. That is how this institution must grow and develop.


 


	A convocation ceremony is a milestone and a moment of renewal for any educational institution. For the students who are graduating today, it is especially memorable. You are leaving IISER and entering a world buzzing with opportunities. I congratulate all of you and I also congratulate your professors – who have equipped you for this occasion. This is a day to cherish and show gratitude to your parents and families, who have helped you through this process. And you must not forget the rest of society – fellow citizens, hardworking taxpayers, government agencies, and so many other stakeholders – who have supported your alma mater and contributed to your education.


 


	As you leave this Institute and build your professional careers, do remember all those who have, whether directly or indirectly, stood by you. And in your own way, in whichever manner you choose, please do give back to society, especially to those who are less privileged.


 


	Going through the list of the 152 students who are graduating today – getting undergraduate and master’s degrees or PhDs, as the case may be – I find that 66 are girl students. That is a little over 40 per cent. However both the gold medals for academic performance have gone to girl students. And three of the four awards for academic excellence have been won by girl students. It is my privilege to travel to convocations across the country. I find this commendable performance of our young women, of our society’s daughters, to be something of a national trend. They are consistently outscoring their male counterparts. This is a step forward in the cause of gender equity and in making India a developed society. I congratulate the girl students here as well as the broader IISER Mohali community for this achievement.  


 

Ladies and Gentlemen, and dear students


	The purpose of scientific research is threefold. First, science and technology must continue to play a role in nation building. As our nation evolves and as our society changes, our needs too are transformed. Yet, science and technology will always be required to find answers to developmental questions. Today, the questions before us range from battling climate change to provide low-cost but effective healthcare solutions. And from helping our farmers overcome productivity and water-scarcity challenges to building sustainable cities and houses that are socially inclusive and provide a life of dignity to the last family in the last mohalla. The IISER network must immerse itself in these tasks.


 


	Second, science and technology have a symbiotic relationship with business and industry. Product invention and process innovation; converting the learning of the lab into commercially viable products; using technology to promote efficiency, enterprise and employment – there is so much science and commerce can do together. The combination of research institutions, technology start-ups incubated in campuses, and a knowledge-based business culture can be transformational. Silicon Valley in California and Bengaluru in India are two examples of this. IISER must strive to play a similar role in Mohali and the neighbouring cities. 


 


	Punjab has a long history of technocrats who ventured into successful businesses. Those who are graduating today too should consider the path of entrepreneurship – and of becoming job and wealth creators as so many great scientists and technologists have done.


 


	Third, institutions of scientific education and research are important in themselves for blue-sky innovation and for expanding the frontiers of knowledge. This is the fundamental and to my mind most critical value of scientific research. It is to keep alive the instinct of curiosity that is at the root of our civilisation. As the history of science tells us, this route requires patience. But it can lead to unexpected and dramatic leaps in human imagination. 


 


	I would urge those graduating today, as well as others studying at IISER Mohali, to keep these three motivations in mind as they climb higher. In their own way, these three motivations of science and research will help you to serve our fellow citizens, to serve our society and country, and to serve the larger cause of humanity. As you go forth to explore new avenues and new worlds, I wish you the very best.


 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

	I am happy to be here to present the National Geoscience Awards for the year 2017. I extend my congratulations to the recipients of the Awards for their excellence in different fields of geoscience. You have truly helped us understand our country and map our resources better, and you have contributed to our socio-economic development and to the nation building process.


 


	This set of Awards was originally instituted in 1966 by the Union Ministry of Mines as the National Mineral Awards. In 2009, the ambit was expanded to the National Geoscience Awards, in recognition of the larger role played by technologists and researchers in this domain. These Awards take forward a rich legacy of exploring and mining of resources in India. This is a legacy that goes back thousands of years, to the earliest days of our civilisation. 


 


	In the modern era, the Geological Survey of India, the leading geoscientific survey organisation in the country, was founded in 1851. It was the world’s second such survey organisation. And its pioneering efforts have run in parallel with the march of science and technology in contemporary India. 


 

 


	There have been several landmarks on this march. In the 19th century, such efforts led to the discovery of oil in Assam. The conceptualisation of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana land – to which the Indian land mass once belonged – owed much to geological studies in India. The discovery of new minerals in India as well as geotechnical studies carried out as part of the preparation for large dams and multipurpose projects also added to our wealth of knowledge. 


 


	Today, the implications of geosciences are not limited to just prospecting mines. Whether it is to build railway lines or communication corridors; make assessments for river linking projects or investigate natural hazards such as earthquakes and landslides; manage our coasts and deserts in a time of climate change; or add value to agriculture and help develop new urban centres – the applications of geosciences are extremely diverse and extremely useful. 


 


	India is one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. Our GDP as well as our larger developmental process is set to accelerate over the coming decades. The mining and mineral sector is poised to grow as a result of this expansion of the economy. At the same time, it will also be a driver of economic expansion. As we build more cities and houses and commercial centres, and create state-of-the-art infrastructure, our use of key resources will rise. As is well known, India’s per capita consumption of many resources and commodities is still very low by global standards and there is room to grow. This will require high-quality research initiatives for sustainable, ecologically-friendly resource generation – and meaningful investment in technological innovation in the mining sector.


 


	That is why reforms in the mining sector have been pushed by the government over the past four years. These reforms, including amendments to existing laws and establishing a more equitable system of royalties, are starting to show results. A number of mineral blocks are being explored. Steps taken by the Ministry of Mines have led to identification of promising mineral blocks in states for auction. These measures will go a long way in enhancing the financial health of our states – and allow them to spread the benefits from mining of resources. Eventually, it is local communities that must benefit from the discovery, extraction and development of mineral resources. 


 


	We must be mindful of the human side of mining. Many of our mineral resources are found in regions that have been the home of tribal communities for generations. It is important that these communities are part of the prosperity that the mining economy creates. Rehabilitation and resettlement of our tribal brothers and sisters, where these may be necessary, must be done in a sensitive and satisfactory manner. 


 


	Similarly, the mining process itself must incorporate the best available safety and health mechanisms for mining workers as well as for their families, who often stay in close proximity to mining sites. The environmental impact of mining and resource extraction and processing should be minimised to the degree possible. If this requires using technologies that add to extraction costs, then we cannot shy away from that. India must mine more – but India must also mine better and in a sustainable manner.


 


	In this context, I am glad that some of the Award winners today are being recognised for new discoveries of deposits that will add to the mineral resources of the country. We must also be alive to the potential of our offshore resource base. Exploration by our marine geoscientists must be encouraged and pursued with renewed vigour. We have a long coastline and a sizeable marine zone that holds many treasures. So far we have scratched the surface. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen


	Social expectations from our geoscientific community have increased significantly in recent years. With their deep understanding of landform dynamics, geoscientists have an important role to play in enhancing agricultural productivity and farmer incomes; in providing a bedrock to the Smart Cities initiative; and in helping our fellow citizens fight the challenge of water scarcity, which has emerged as a pressing problem.


 


	All this places a great responsibility on the shoulders of our talented and hardworking geoscientists. I am confident that the standards you have set yourselves – and the standards that have been honoured today – will be a launch-pad for even greater accomplishments. I am optimistic that you will continue to deploy your knowledge and technical skills in the service of our country and our people.


 


	I have been told that in March 2020, less than two years from now, India will host the 36th International Geological Congress. This is the biggest geological conference in the world and all relevant stakeholders and institutions will need to pool their resources to make it a memorable occasion. I wish you the very best as you make plans for this grand event. Please use it as a stage to showcase India’s appreciable progress in geoscience. And please use the approach of that event as an inspiration to achieve even great glory for yourselves, for geoscience as a discipline – and for our nation.


 

     Thank you

     Jai Hind!

	I am very happy to be amongst you all today, at this iconic national institution. The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre reflects the vision, efforts and foresight of Dr Homi Jehangir Bhabha and I am glad to have got a glimpse of the pioneering work that all of you do. I am more aware today about your work in the field of nuclear science and technology and I am happy that I inaugurated some of the facilities of Department of Atomic Energy today. 


 


	India is recognised as one of the leading nations in the use of nuclear technologies across multiple disciplines ranging from energy to agriculture and from medicine to waste management. However, the journey towards excelling in this cutting edge domain of science and technology started here at BARC, almost six decades ago. Since then, Department of Atomic Energy has grown to become a multidisciplinary organisation with facilities spread across the nation. All of you present here, and so many of your illustrious predecessors, are the leaders who have ensured that the vision of Department of Atomic Energy has become a reality and that too despite long periods of time marked by denial of technology from other nations. The whole world today acknowledges the self-reliant nature of India’s nuclear establishment.


 


	I just referred to the vision of the Department of Atomic Energy as enumerated in its Citizen’s Charter. That vision calls for empowering the nation through technology, creation of wealth and providing better quality of life to the citizens. And, this is to be achieved by making the nation energy independent, by contributing to provision of sufficient, safe and nutritious food and better health care to our people through development and deployment of nuclear and radiation technologies and their applications.


 


	At times, such vision statements only remain as lofty ideas having no connection to the actual work done by an organisation. I am pleased to say that in your case, your work bears a true testimony to your declared vision. We are proud of your achievements in the domain of nuclear energy across the entire nuclear fuel cycle including the exploration and mining of uranium, conversion to fuel and the production of power in nuclear reactors. Now all of you must work to achieve the goal of establishing a robust nuclear energy program based on using our vast thorium deposits.  


 


	What is less known to the common people, is the work that all of you do for using nuclear technology in the areas of healthcare, food and agriculture, water resources management and environmental protection. Research in nuclear medicine is widely used both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. I am told that in the cancer hospitals associated with the Department of Atomic Energy thousands of cancer patients benefit from the applications developed by you. Also, a large number of medical centres are using the radioisotope products supplied by the Department of Atomic Energy both for diagnostics and treatment of patients. I am happy that one of the facilities that I inaugurated today is the Multi-leaf Collimator System developed by BARC. This system will enhance the effectiveness of treatment of tumours.


 


	Research in nuclear science has also benefited our food processing and agriculture sector and thus directly benefited our farmers. Your work has helped develop 43 mutant crop varieties that are more efficient and productive. Again, I am happy to have inaugurated one of these today - a mutant variety of DUBRAJ rice that has a shorter maturation cycle and hence requires fewer resources. Applications of nuclear science have helped to increase the shelf life of fruits such as mangoes, papaya, and lichi. This has helped to reduce wastage and post-harvest losses, boosted farm exports and enhanced income of farmers. These are only some examples of how your work benefits these sectors, and the list of your work in this area is indeed a long one. 


 


	There are other areas too in which your contribution helps the agenda for national development. You have developed technologies that have helped in purification of water, radiation treatment of municipal waste generated in cities and its conversion to organic manure, conversion of kitchen bio-waste into bio-gas for cooking purposes. Faster adoption of these technologies by different public and private agencies and speeding-up the diffusion of these applications must become a priority area. You must forge more and more collaborations with relevant others to make the slogan of ‘Lab to Land’ a vivid reality. I also compliment you for your initiatives that have direct relevance to the defence and security of our nation and the effectiveness of our armed forces.


 


	While your achievements are commendable, there is no room for complacency. Nation Building is a long-term and never-ending process and we have lot of challenges to overcome. We must aspire to make the life of the poorest person better, to make sure that he or she can lead a life of dignity. It is only then that we can rightfully take some rest and feel a sense of satisfaction. The Department of Atomic Energy too has an important responsibility in our national development. The government has set out an ambitious agenda of enhancing power generation through nuclear sources and it is for you to make that possible. Similarly, you must continue to develop newer applications which can help us deal with challenges such as pollution and climate change, wastage of farm produce, water shortage, fighting disease, management of waste, and so on.


 


	 We have some of the best scientific minds in this gathering and your minds must use the power and potential of science to solve the problems of the country and contribute towards realising economic growth along with social justice and equity. All of you are fortunate that you have the capacity to make a difference to the lives of our people and to make our nation truly prosperous and secure. 


 


	To conclude, I wish each of you the very best for your future endeavours. May you continue to do the good work with bountiful energy and the best of health.


 

Thank You       

Jai Hind!

	I am happy to be here for the inauguration of the Fourth Global Exhibition on Services. I warmly welcome the approximately 500 international delegates who, I am told, have come to this Exhibition from about 100 countries. I also commend the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of the Government of India and the Government of Maharashtra, as well as their partners, the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Services Export Promotion Council, for this initiative. I am confident it will promote the Indian services domain and enlarge and deepen India’s engagement with the global services sector. The launch of 12 Champion Sectors is a bold new step that will contribute to both India’s economy and the global economy, and will create jobs.


 


	We live in an India with a competitive and growing national economy. We also live in an India with many competitive and growing state economies. Given this, I must appreciate the decision of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Fadnavis, to co-host this event. Maharashtra is one of our country’s economic and investment engines. It has a strong manufacturing base and has complemented this with an accelerating services sector. 


 


	The services sector represents a vibrant and expanding component of the global economy. Today, services dominates in terms of employment, value addition, productivity and innovation. The pace of technology is intensifying the contribution of services in other sectors – including agriculture, infrastructure and manufacturing. It would not be an exaggeration to say that services forms the backbone of the 21st century global economy.


 


	In India, the services sector contributes 61 per cent in gross value added. With its young population, large talent pool and comfort with technology, India has natural advantages in the sector and is set to become even more of a provider of services to the world. India’s global services exports stood at 3.4 per cent in 2016. I am given to understand that the target is a 4.2 per cent share of global services by 2022. And frankly that is only the tip of the iceberg.


 


	With the rapid expansion of its economy, India represents an attractive opportunity for global investors and businesses. In the past four years, the average GDP growth rate has been an impressive 6.9 per cent. For 2018-19, the International Monetary Fund has forecast a growth rate of 7.4 per cent for India. The services sector boom is a key driver. 


 


	By 2025, only seven years from now, India hopes to double the size of its GDP to US$ 5 trillion. Of this, I am told, the services sector could be a US$ 3 trillion contributor. And of that number, the government estimates that the Internet economy, incorporating e-commerce and other applications, could be as high as US$ 1 trillion. This is a pointer to the increasing integration of services and technology. And in turn that combination is changing the way in which we live and work, communicate and create and educate and entertain.


 


	We are experiencing the age of the Digital Economy and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The synergy of technology and services is unfolding before our eyes. The early Industrial Age and the traditional manufacturing economy created jobs in factories, and encouraged entrepreneurship in the form of ancillary units and workshops. Today, we are looking at small but exciting start-ups in the services space. Technology has emerged as an enormous enabler and allowed local services companies to go national or even global.


 


	In India, which is the third largest centre of start-ups in the world, this has thrown up a generation of young entrepreneurs, of men and women with hunger and ambition. Government programmes such as Start-up India and the Mudra Yojana, which has provided capital to 120 million grassroots businesses, have seeded a culture of entrepreneurship, largely in services. I am confident that some of these start-ups will grow into giants in the years and decades to come. A billion mobile phone users; 500 million citizens on the Internet; and a determined push for financial inclusion using technology as well as for digital payments have collectively deepened India’s services story.


 


	Such measures have unleashed creative and commercial energies. They have also empowered people. And most of all, they have re-emphasised how India is both a large supplier to as well as a huge market for global services sector businesses. I invite you to join us on this pulsating journey.


 


	The government of India is doing its best to make this journey smoother. In the past four years, it has eased foreign investment regulations in several sectors, including in services such as insurance, retail, aviation and banking. As you know, India is among the largest recipients of FDI inflows. Services like financial services, business and professional services, and R&D, among others, have accounted for 57 per cent of cumulative FDI inflows since April 2000. In the first half of 2017-18, I am told they accounted for almost two-thirds of FDI inflows. These numbers are telling.


 


	In the past four years, the government of India has accomplished a number of crucial reforms. The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in July 2017 converted India into a single market, with both goods and services placed on the same tax platform. This in itself has imparted a new momentum to the economy. 


 


	On Ease of Doing Business, the Government has taken major steps, with the participation of state governments, as part of the Business Reform Action Plan. Starting a business and obtaining permits, as well as trading across borders, have become easier. This has enabled India to jump 42 spots, in the past three years, in the World Bank Ease of Business rankings. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has made it simpler for exit of businesses. And the national Intellectual Property Rights policy aims at strengthening the IPR regime in line with global best practices. Such measures will be of immense benefit to players in the services sector.


 


	The launch of the 12 Champion Services scheme comes with this preparation and background. The list of 12 includes business areas with potential for drawing global attention and investment, as well as boosting growth and employment. It also aims to optimise India’s skills and knowledge resources. I wish the Champion Services scheme, I wish the 40 knowledge sessions and 22 focus sectors of this Exhibition, and I wish all the delegates the very best. May you have a productive and enriching set of engagements here in Mumbai, and may you meet an India buzzing with ideas and opportunities!


 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed a civic reception hosted for him in Jaipur, Rajasthan, by the state government today (May 13, 2018). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the people of Rajasthan have a strong attachment to their homeland, language and human values. In spite of severe challenges over the years, including challenges thrown by nature, the people of Rajasthan have persevered in their quest for social and economic development. They have also enriched their lives with the vibrancy and colours of a great culture, including fairs and festivals, art and literature.

The President appreciated the Government of Rajasthan for launching the ‘Bhairon Singh Shekhawat Antyodaya Employment Scheme’ and the ‘Sunder Singh Bhandari EBC Self-Employment Scheme’, named after two illustrious public figures from Rajasthan. He stated that the loan waiver for SCs, STs and other deprived communities – a third scheme launched today – too is a tribute to the principles and ideals of these personalities. He expressed confidence that the people of Rajasthan will benefit from these schemes as well as from other welfare initiatives of the Government of India and the Government of Rajasthan.

The President was happy to note that four cities of Rajasthan - Jaipur, Udaipur, Kota and Ajmer – are part of the Smart Cities initiative of the Government of India. He said it was a remarkable coincidence that three centuries ago Jaipur had been designed and built as perhaps the first planned city of modern India. He added that this ability to draw inspiration from one’s heritage for social and economic advance has helped Rajasthan create impressive opportunities in tourism. The state has carved a special place for itself on the global tourism map.

The President was happy that efforts were being made to further develop the potential of tourism in Rajasthan and was confident these efforts would generate more jobs and employment opportunities for young people in the state.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the International Nurses Day Celebrations organised by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in New Delhi today (May 12, 2018). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that International Nurses Day is an occasion for the entire nursing community to remember Florence Nightingale and renew their commitment to her ideals. Florence Nightingale had established nursing as a service to humanity. She motivated nurses to follow the path of dedication, commitment and compassion. 

The President noted that at present, there are 1.7 nurses per 1,000 people in India, but the world average is 2.5 nurses. He stated that in the past few years, the number of institutions for nursing education has increased. As a result, the number of registered nurses and other health workers had crossed 27 lakh till March 2017. But this number is not sufficient because the need for nurses is growing. 

The President said that the nursing community has a vital role in keeping our country healthy. A nurse who is helping a patient, in a remote village, in fighting a serious illness is a nation-builder. The nursing community serves the people with devotion and commitment and the entire nation is grateful for this.

	I am happy to be here for the 20th National Technology Day, which is the anniversary of a landmark moment for our country. It was on this day two decades ago that the Pokhran nuclear tests took place and demonstrated India’s capacity as a nuclear weapons state as well as a mature and responsible technology power, capable of harnessing sensitive knowledge. 



	The Pokhran tests of May 1998 were a demonstration of both scientific capacity and political will. India’s nuclear programme was built brick by brick in a period of technology denial. Yet, our scientists and our technologists persevered and took our country to greater heights. In 1998, the government of the day took the bold decision to go ahead with the tests – and reposition India on the global stage. Those tests had a far-reaching impact on how the world came to see India – and on our foreign policy, our strategic relations and eventually our international technological collaborations. 



	That is why today we remember my predecessor as President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who led the dedicated scientific team that made preparations for the Pokhran tests. We also remember the leadership and courage of our then Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 



	National Technology Day is much more than the anniversary of a historical event. Like technology itself, it is a pathway to the future. Today we celebrate the achievements of some of our best scientists and innovators, and their success in shaping technology into usable, commercial products and processes that change the lives of people. My congratulations to all those present here, and particularly to the Award winners! 



	The achievements that we have applauded today range from a vaccine that will help defeat rotavirus, which is a leading cause of diarrhoeal deaths among children, to a low-cost but high-performing diagnostic machine for kidney and other non-communicable illnesses. Among those who have won technology start-up awards, there are companies that have demonstrated advance in wireless communication, in drug delivery for cancer patients, and in medical tests that help fight the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance. We have also seen the launch of a charger for lithium ion batteries, and been introduced to a host of other technological innovations.



	These new technologies have three attributes in common. First, they offer solutions that are necessary in the Indian context, and contribute to the social and economic needs of our people. Second, they achieve all this at competitive price points. Third, and this to my mind is the most critical, they don’t compromise on quality. 



	This emphasis on quality in our innovation and technology endeavours is non-negotiable. There was a time when we tended to confuse frugal and low-cost innovation with jugaad – small, incremental change or essentially a cut-and-paste approach to technology. As a society, we have and we must continue to overcome that mindset. Today’s award winners are examples of how we are moving ahead with daring, with risk-taking ability and with ingenuity – how we are making genuine leaps of imagination and of innovation. Beyond the products and processes, it is this new energy among our technology incubators that is refreshing.



	After Independence, India began to climb the value chain in technology production in the areas of space and, as I mentioned earlier, atomic energy. Today, we have expanded to best-in-class capacities in communication technology, IT, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. This has changed perceptions about our country and helped both our people and our economy. In the past year itself, we have had stand-out achievements such as the launch of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System - 1L. We are also making preparations for the Chandrayaan-2 mission to the moon. India has a formidable reputation in the drugs and vaccines value chain. And in the manufacture of medical devices and diagnostic machines, I am optimistic we will replicate our success in generic drugs.



	Now we have to explore new frontiers. The government has proposed to establish Centres of Excellence to train young technologists in robotics, artificial intelligence, digital manufacture, Big Data Analytics, quantum communication, and in the Internet of Things. The government is also pursuing demonstration and deployment of successful technology solutions for clean energy options and for meeting the challenge of water availability. These are 21st century challenges – and they require 21st century answers. Such answers will be provided by our young technologists in this audience.


Ladies and Gentlemen


	Technology and innovation have cross-cutting implications. All of our national programmes – such as Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Start-up India, Stand-up India, Ayushman Bharat, enhancing agricultural productivity and farm incomes, and others – require a force multiplier in the form of technology. Our attempt to build affordable housing for all our people and to provide universal energy access calls for a force multiplier in the form of technology. Our effort to fight pollution, whether in the air of our cities or the water of our rivers, needs a force multiplier in the form of technology. Our goal is a technology society and our means to that goal too will incorporate technology. Technology is our destiny.



	Technology is destiny, but technology must also be equity. Its fruits must be accessible to all. Finance and resources should be available to all technologists who may wish to turn entrepreneurs – and to migrate from the lab room to the shop floor. Above all, gender equity must be integrated with technology production and technology sharing. We need more of our daughters and more of our country’s young women to enter the technology and innovation space. Those who are already working here are doing a remarkable job, but their numbers need to improve. And improve urgently.



	With those words, and with the confidence that the almost magical synthesis of curiosity and experiment, of science and innovation, and of technology and change, is set to revolutionise India, I wish you all the best for your future endeavours.


 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, visited Siachen Base Camp today (May 10, 2018) and addressed the soldiers posted there. He also visited the Kumar Post. President Kovind is the second President of India to visit Siachen. The previous visit was undertaken by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in April 2004. This makes President Kovind the first President to travel to Siachen in 14 years.

Addressing the soldiers today, President Kovind said that as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and as the President of India, he has come among them carrying the gratitude of the entire country. The President noted that Siachen is the world’s highest battlefield and it is difficult to live even a normal life in the extreme climate. In such a situation, it is extraordinary for soldiers to stay in a state of constant mobilisation and combat readiness. Their determination and dedication is worthy of the highest praise – and their allegiance to the defence of India is an ideal for all our fellow citizens.

The bravery and valour of soldiers deployed in Siachen over the past 34 years, the President said, has given every Indian the confidence that our borders are safe and secure. The President said he had come to Siachen to iterate to the troops posted here that all citizens of India and the Government of India were always with them and supportive of their families.

The President also paid his respects at the Siachen War Memorial, which is a symbol of the sacrifice of 11,000 soldiers and officers who have been martyred since the Indian Army began Operation Meghdoot on the Siachen Glacier on April 13, 1984.

Addressing the officers trainees, the President said their work and responsibilities sit at the defining edge of “good governance” in the country. Therefore, they have to maintain the highest standard of ethics, accountability and transparency at all times in their respective fields. They have equally critical role to play in implementation of government schemes and projects.

 

The President said that the mantra of our Government is “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance”. At the same time, there is rising expectation among our citizens for greater efficiency in public service delivery today. The task at hand for civil servants is demanding. But with greater integration of technology in their work, be it new IT platforms, payment gateways or the endless possibilities of cyberspace, they can achieve the desired results. Reforming our accounting, budget and audit systems and constantly updating them in line with global best practices must also be high on their agenda.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 160th convocation of the University of Madras today (May 5, 2018) in Chennai.  

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that from the middle of the 19th century, the University of Madras has been a cornerstone of our nation building project. It is among the institutions responsible for the strong foundations of education, intellectual advance and knowledge production in India, particularly in the south of our country. He noted that in the region it is popularly referred to as the “Mother of Universities”. 

The President said that the expression “change with continuity” is often used and sometimes overused. But in few institutions is it as meaningful as at the University of Madras. One of the hallmarks of this University has been its ability to incorporate change even while keeping basic values intact. This attribute has helped it stay contemporary and relevant to emerging needs of students and of society. The range of courses and subjects offered here symbolises this – and spans the traditional liberal arts to 21st century disciplines.

The President said that the University of Madras has both benefited from and contributed to a tradition of scholarship that is central to Tamil Nadu’s identity. Even ordinary families in the state emphasise the value of education. This has had a direct impact on social development indices and on the economy. Tamil Nadu has a proud culture of research and innovation – whether in the pure sciences or in medicine – and of engineering and manufacturing. It has a well-regarded IT sector and a growing digital economy. These are complemented by excellence in the humanities. It is no surprise that the Tamil language is among the most ancient in the world. Centuries before many others, it was exploring the literature and philosophy of learning.

The President said that the ability to pursue education as an end in itself as well as to help fill gaps in day-to-day lives of our fellow citizens is commendable. In this context the people of Tamil Nadu, and institutions such as the University of Madras, are a model for our country. Inevitably, it is to institutions such as these that we turn for direction and leadership at the beginning of the 21st century. Universities such as University of Madras are expected to be our navigators on this journey. Institutions in Tamil Nadu have shown commendable agility in nurturing an ecosystem that helps engineers and other qualified young people to become entrepreneurs and job creators. This is the route to the future and this is the pathway for the youth of our country.

Later in day, the President also graced the 42nd convocation of the Guru Nanak College and inaugurated the Guru Amar Das Block and Shaheed Baba Deep Singh Auditorium of Guru Nanak College in Velachery, Chennai. 

Addressing the gathering, the President was happy to note that the Guru Nanak Educational Society, the non-profit organisation that runs the College, is supported by 250 Sikh families living in Chennai. He said that despite the small size of the community, they are contributing to the state and to society, and doing so in the field of education which is commendable. He stated that the Guru Nanak College is taking forward a long and rich history of engagement between Punjab and the Sikh community, and Tamil Nadu. This history goes back to the period when Guru Nanak Dev, who was one of our greatest spiritual leaders and nation builders, visited Tamil Nadu as part of his journey to southern India. It is believed that he spent a few days in the holy town of Rameswaram. 

The President said it was worth remembering that over 100 years ago, the family of the late A.G. Ram Singh migrated from Amritsar to Chennai. Ram Singh became one of the pioneering cricketers of our country and mentored many local players here in this city. Later two of his sons, A.G. Milkha Singh and A.G. Kripal Singh, played for India. At one time it used to be said that the leading cricket family of Tamil Nadu was a Sikh family. That sense of oneness, that unity in diversity, makes our country special. 

The President was also happy to note that the gurudwara within the Guru Nanak College campus has a langar kitchen which provides a free meal to about 700 students daily. He stated that Tamil Nadu is the state that gave India the idea of the midday meal programme in schools. But a midday meal at the college level is unique. 

Earlier in the morning, the President paid tributes to Giani Zail Singh, former President of India on his birth anniversary in front of his portrait in Raj Bhavan, Chennai.

	I am happy to be in Vellore for this event to mark the Centenary of Medical Education at the Christian Medical College. I congratulate the institution, which is ranked third among all medical colleges in India as per the Ministry of Human Resource Development, government of India. I also convey my best wishes to the students and faculty members of CMC Vellore, both past and present, as well as the doctors, researchers and administrators. Your institution and its achievements are a matter of pride for the entire country.


 


	Completing 100 years is an occasion to both look back and take fresh guard. In this, CMC must take inspiration from the values and the idealism of its founder. In the early 20th century, shortly after graduating from Cornell University in the United States, Ida Sophia Scudder returned to India. This was the country where several generations of her family had lived and served. This was the country where medicine became her mission.


 


	India was under colonial rule then and most people lived in tough conditions. Health indices were very poor. Average life expectancy was just about 24 years. One person died every minute of tuberculosis. One in four babies died in the first year. Cholera, smallpox and polio – several epidemics and diseases were rampant. Independence was still a dream. It was in such an India that Ida Sophia Scudder devoted her life to healthcare. In 1918, she set up a medical school that was initially open only to women. From 1947, both girls and boys began to study here. 


 


	India has come a long way since then. Revolutions in our economy, in agriculture and in technology have changed how we act, think and live. Inevitably, our health outcomes have also improved. Average life expectancy is now above 68 years. Diseases such as polio and smallpox, which once claimed so many lives, have been defeated. Our immunisation programme is gaining strength. The government has launched Mission Indradhanush primarily to target hard-to-access areas and ensure all children benefit from immunisation.


 


	Primary and secondary healthcare facilities have undergone a change for the better. In this context it must be said the state of Tamil Nadu has exceptional health indicators and remains a model for our country. Institutions such as CMC Vellore have contributed to this deserved reputation.


 


	Public health is a global public good and a basic human right. Despite the strides we have taken as a country, there remain regional, rural-urban and gender and community imbalances in terms of health provision. Without adequately addressing these, we cannot rest. Without adequately addressing these, the mission of CMC will not be complete.


 


	As societies evolve, economies develop and population patterns change, countries go through epidemiological transitions. India too is experiencing such a transition. It is marked by three challenges in disease control. And we have to manage all three simultaneously.


 

 


	First, India has to reduce maternal and infant mortality as well as communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, vector-borne diseases such as malaria, water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoeal diseases, and vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and tetanus. Second, India has to find an answer to the rise in non-communicable or lifestyle diseases – like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and many cancers. And finally we need to develop systems to detect and cope with new and re-emerging infectious diseases like HIV, avian flu and H1N1 influenza. In a globalised world, with people travelling in and out of our country in larger and larger numbers, a few small cases can very quickly scale up into a large outbreak.


 


	This three-pronged challenge calls for interventions across the continuum of care. It calls for prevention of disease, promotion of good health practices and treatment and cure in case of an illness. The impact of a health problem is cross-cutting – it affects a variety of sectors. The meeting of this challenge should also follow a multi-stakeholder approach. Government and civil society, private and public health care providers, charitable and economic institutions all have a role and a stake.


 


	The National Health Mission, the National Health Policy and the Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme are alive to this broad-based approach. In their essence, they aim to ensure that nobody is deprived of healthcare due to the absence of financial or similar resources. The principles that must guide our philosophy of public health are equity and efficiency, quality and quantity, and access and affordability. Healthcare is above all else a service. Yes, it is also a business – but there is no greater business than saving a life. I am sure the CMC community will agree.


 


	One of the principles that I referred to earlier is the principle of quantity – of filling the gap in healthcare professionals in our country. There is urgent need to do this, and to reform medical education so as to create room for more colleges and more medical graduates. Science and technology are most commonly applied to our benefit by engineers and doctors. In India we have 1.47 million undergraduate engineering seats, but only 67,352 undergraduate medical seats. And about 20 per cent of those seats were added in the past four years. As a country and a system, we need to address this gap quickly.


 

Ladies and Gentlemen


	CMC Vellore has a justifiable reputation for excellence. India’s first re-constructive surgery on leprosy patients was carried out here, and so was the first successful open heart surgery and the first kidney transplant. These are only some of your many achievements. A range of research takes place at CMC. Recent research on the rotavirus vaccine, hepatitis, malnutrition, bio-engineering and stem cells underlines your commitment to research that is relevant to India’s health needs. 


 


	I have been told that the medical education programme here combines professional expertise with social relevance and ethical practice. I understand clinical training in your hospital is complemented by placements in villages and underserved areas. This is commendable. Please keep it up. Doctors need a sharp mind – but much more than that, they need a warm heart. And CMC Vellore must continue to train doctors and nurses with warm hearts. 


 

     May this be your mission for the next 100 years and more!

     Thank you

     Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the centenary celebrations of the Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore today (May 4, 2018).   

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that public health is a global public good and a basic human right. Despite the strides we have taken as a country, there remain regional, rural-urban and gender and community imbalances in terms of health provision. Without adequately addressing these, we cannot rest. 

The President said that as societies evolve, economies develop and population patterns change, countries go through epidemiological transitions. India too is experiencing such a transition. It is marked by three challenges in disease control. And we have to manage all three simultaneously. First, India has to reduce maternal and infant mortality as well as communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, vector-borne diseases such as malaria, water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoeal diseases, and vaccine-preventable like measles and tetanus. Second, India has to find an answer to the rise in non-communicable or lifestyle diseases – like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and many cancers. And finally we need to develop systems to detect and cope with new and re-emerging infectious diseases like HIV, avian flu and H1N1 influenza. In a globalised world, with people travelling in and out of our country in larger and larger numbers, a few small cases can very quickly scale up into a large outbreak.

The President said that this three-pronged challenge calls for interventions across the continuum of care. It calls for prevention of disease, promotion of good health practices and treatment and cure in case of an illness. The impact of a health problem is cross-cutting – it affects a variety of sectors. The meeting of this challenge should also follow a multi-stakeholder approach. Government and civil society, private and public health care providers, charitable and economic institutions all have a role and a stake.

Referring the shortage of manpower in the healthcare system, the President said that there is urgent need for filling the gap in healthcare professionals in our country, and to reform medical education so as to create room for more colleges and more medical graduates. Science and technology are most commonly applied to our benefit by engineers and doctors. In India we have 1.47 million undergraduate engineering seats, but only 67,352 undergraduate medical seats. And about 20 per cent of those seats were added in the past four years. As a country and a system, we need to address this gap quickly.

The President said that doctors need a sharp mind – but much more than that, they need a warm heart. He urged CMC Vellore to continue to train doctors and nurses with warm hearts.

Later in the day, the President will also inaugurate the Kidney Transplant Unit and Cardiac Unit of the Sri Narayni Hospital and Research Centre, Vellore.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the 65th National Film Awards today (May 3, 2018) in New Delhi. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that our films both represent and contribute to the diversity that is India’s biggest strength. In their narrative our films inspire us to stay true to the ideals of our civilisation and of our shared society. They educate and they entertain. They also hold a mirror to the social challenges that we still have to overcome. And they do this in a language that is universal.

 

The President said that films are made in a variety of languages in India, from Bhojpuri to Tamil, Marathi to Malayalam to several others. And yet cinema is a language in itself. Hindi cinema has probably done more than any other institution to popularise Hindi as a language across the country. One doesn’t have to be a Bengali to appreciate the humanism and the nuance of a Satyajit Ray or a Ritwik Ghatak. We need not know Telugu to be mesmerised by the epic of “Bahubali”. And let us not forget that A.R. Rahman – who has won the National Award again – made an early impression even among those who did not understand the Tamil words of the songs, but were nevertheless enchanted by his music.

 

The President said that cinema is culture and cinema is also commerce. The Indian film industry is among the largest in the world, with about 1,500 films a year. It is an expression of Indian soft power and has a trans-continental footprint. Our films are watched and appreciated in Japan and Egypt, China and the United States, Russia and Australia and so many far-off countries. Films are one of our foremost cultural exports and an important device for connecting the global Indian community to the rhythms of life back home.

 

The President said that we are living in exciting and transformational times for cinema and for the wider entertainment economy. Technology has changed the way films are made as well as the way they are consumed. With the advent of low-cost data and smart phones and tablets, there is a clear shift in viewership patterns. The Indian film industry is adapting to these changes and he was sure it would continue to devise strategies to convert challenges into opportunities. Filmmakers could also find that the economics and the delivery of niche productions will become increasingly feasible. Hopefully this will encourage them to raise the bar.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, chaired the first meeting of the National Committee for the Commemoration of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (May 2, 2018). The Committee has a total of 125 members, including 116 from India and encompasses the President (as chair), the Vice-President, Prime Minister, Union Ministers, former Prime Ministers, Chief Ministers, senior MPs and political leaders from across party lines, and eminent Gandhians, social thinkers and activists representing a cross-section of Indian society and regional diversity. The Committee also has nine international members, including two former Secretaries General of the United Nations – Mr Kofi Annan and Mr Ban Ki-moon – and Nobel laureates Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and former US Vice-President Al Gore. Today’s meeting was attended by 82 members of the Committee, including two from abroad. [Lists of Committee members and of those who attended are attached.

The meeting began with introductory remarks by the Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh, who said that the focus of the Commemoration should be to present Gandhian values and principles both to the people and through the people in a contemporary idiom. He then invited the President of India to address the meeting.

In his speech, President Kovind stressed that Mahatma Gandhi does not belong to India alone. He remains one of India’s greatest gifts to humankind and his name finds resonance across the continents. Mahatma Gandhi was the most influential Indian of the 20th century. He was the inspiration for our largely non-violent, inclusive and democratic freedom struggle. He remains the ethical benchmark against which we test public men and women, political ideas and government policies, and the hopes and wishes of our country and our people. His legacy is so rich and so wide that we cannot do justice to it if we were to meet for a few days, let alone a few hours.

The President said that the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi is more than a celebration of a great life and a remembrance of history. Gandhiji himself would have wanted it to be a moment of renewal, of making a fresh commitment to the goals of a just, honest and fair society – at home and abroad. The Mahatma is our past, he is our present and he is also our future. So many of the themes and ideas he spoke and wrote of – some of them far ahead of their time – are even more relevant today.The President said that when we work for an India free of caste and religious prejudice, we invoke Gandhiji. When we strive towards Swachh Bharat, and a cleaner and more hygienic India, we invoke Gandhiji. When we speak of the rights of women and children and of civil liberties of small and disadvantaged groups, we invoke Gandhiji. When we talk of the health and well-being of the Indian farmer and the Indian village, we invoke Gandhiji. When we strive for energy access for the last village and the last home, we invoke Gandhiji. When we build capacities in solar and renewable energy, we invoke Gandhiji. When we battle climate change and promote green, eco-friendly living, we invoke Gandhiji. And what is sustainable development if not an expansion of Gandhiji’s simple mantra: “The earth has enough for everyone’s need but not for everyone’s greed.”

 

The President said that it is for this reason that the 150th Birth Anniversary Commemoration has world-wide meaning. Let us elevate this to a global celebration, using platforms such as the United Nations and other multilateral organisations. The focus should not just be on events, but on tangible, actionable legacies that will make a difference to the lives of ordinary people – wherever they may be.

The President then called upon those present to share their ideas and suggestions on how we may commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

Following the President’s address, several Committee members, including Union Ministers, Chief Ministers and others, made suggestions on how the Commemoration – which will run from October 2, 2018 to October 2, 2020 – could be planned. Suggestions ranged from welfare programmes and specific measures to help farmers, to travelling exhibitions and creating infrastructure and linkages in specific locations and states associated with Mahatma Gandhi.

Since it would not be feasible for the entire National Committee to be convened frequently, the meeting resolved to set up a smaller Executive Committee, headed by the Prime Minister, to take forward the commemoration of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.

Encapsulating the sense of the meeting, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, thanked various members of the Committee for their constructive suggestions and recommendations. He said it is important that this occasion be celebrated in a manner that ensures Mahatma Gandhi continues to be an inspiration for future generations. Globally as well, this occasion should serve to increase awareness about Gandhiji, he said.

The Prime Minister stressed that all programmes associated with this celebration should be designed around the theme of “Karyanjali” - or “Gandhi in action”. He expressed happiness that the suggestions received today were mostly action-oriented. The Prime Minister said that Mahatma Gandhi and his teachings are timeless. He said that Mahatma Gandhi can become a mechanism for people around the world to understand India. He felt that solutions to several contemporary problems could be found by following the path shown by Mahatma Gandhi.

The Prime Minister emphasised the need to use technology in the celebrations, so that the whole world can take note and participate. He called for the celebrations to move beyond government events and take the shape of a mass movement - or Jan Bhagidaari. He also urged all state governments to have similar consultations and draw plans at the state level.

	I welcome you all to Rashtrapati Bhavan for the 4th Visitor’s Awards and the Meet of the Vice-Chancellors of Central Universities. Today’s meeting with you all shall take forward an exercise that began in January this year when Vice-Chancellors of 17 of the new universities amongst you, had met here. 


 


	Education is a subject I am personally passionate about. It is education that holds the key for the development of our nation and our people. All of you are in the profession of imparting higher education as well as conducting research, and thus play an important role in the making of a modern India. 


 


	To begin with, let me first congratulate the winners of the Visitor’s Awards, 2018. These Awards recognise the outstanding contribution, single-minded devotion and painstaking work put in by the award winners in the pursuit of knowledge. All of you are true achievers and I am sure that your success will inspire other researchers in the central university system to take up meaningful projects in their respective fields.


 


	Research and Innovation is the bedrock of advancing knowledge, and knowledge alone holds the key to finding solutions to the problems we face in our world, nation and society. It is sometimes not understood that research is a demanding profession and a researcher is almost always riding a roller coaster. Pursuing research demands constant determination from the researcher as well as full institutional support. Research is not a 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. job and thus our approach towards supporting and promoting a research culture cannot be a pedantic one.


 


	We have to emphasise the merits of research and teaching profession in our society at large. This profession offers unique benefits that no other career offers – freedom to ideate and to test and spread those ideas through research and teaching, freedom to make your work schedules, and may I say perhaps freedom from having a 24 by 7 boss too. To use the language of researchers, I believe that no other career has a bigger impact factor. Our researchers create knowledge and our teachers create a civilised, well-educated society. 


 


	It is due to this appreciation about the importance of research that the meeting with Vice-Chancellors today focuses on issues universities are facing in the promotion of research and innovation. And it is for this very reason that Minister for HRD, Shri Prakash Javadekar and Minister of State, Dr Satya Pal Singh along with officials from the Ministry are present here today. To help you on issues concerning research and innovation, Principal Scientific Advisor, Professor K. Vijay Raghavan is also present. I am sure that their presence will make today’s deliberations much more meaningful. 


 


	There is no doubt that government has a responsibility to promote and support research and innovation in our centres of education. However, there is a specific responsibility that lies with the researchers too. That responsibility is to marry research and innovation to the needs of our country and people. Research and innovation can play an important role in lifting our people out of poverty, ensuring their health and well-being or attaining food and energy security. Researchers and innovators can help develop solutions to the problems we experience on a daily basis – from pollution of our air and water to the traffic jams in our rapidly expanding cities. Universities can also develop mechanisms to support innovation by ordinary people and help such grassroots innovators to further refine their work.  


 


	 I am happy that recipients of the Visitor’s Awards this year truly meet the specific responsibility of researchers that I have referred to. Prof. Sanjay K. Jain’s work on the development of a drug delivery system has the potential to make cancer treatment more effective and affordable. The research of Prof. Ashis Kumar Mukherjee on the molecular complexicity of the snake venom could also lead to the development of a new drug. Prof. Ashwani Pareek’s work towards the development of Stress Tolerant Rice has the potential to enhance the income of rice farmers. The research and publication work of Prof. Pramod K. Nayar in the field of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences covers several socially relevant areas including poetry for the under-privileged. It is gratifying to note that good quality research, which serves the larger purpose of national development, is taking place in our central universities. 


 

Ladies and Gentlemen,


	Our central universities are the pride of our higher education system. They have contributed immensely to nation building and continue to do so. The goal of our central universities should be to constantly grow and upgrade themselves as per the best of global standards. It is here that all of you as Vice-Chancellors have to provide leadership. 


 


	As an immediate goal you should strive to become the best in the country and compete with each other in a healthy way. Thereafter, work towards competing with the world’s best. Our central universities should be nurture and provide researchers and students every opportunity to excel in their research work and academic projects. 


 


	Universities are public institutions powered with the energy and dynamism of our youth. You must use this energy to engage with the communities near to your campuses as also with the government of the state that hosts you. Encourage your students to take up socially oriented ventures through NSS or other clubs. Those universities which are located in backward regions have a special responsibility of working with communities around them. Incorporating community-oriented initiatives in your academic programs will further expand the horizon of your students and prepare them well for life ahead. You should also engage purposefully with the respective state governments and its different institutions on projects of mutual interest. 


 


	 Once again, I congratulate the winners of the Visitor’s Awards 2018 and wish you all the best for your future endeavours. I also look forward to having meaningful deliberations with the Vice-Chancellors present here in the next session.


 

Thank you,

Jai Hind!

	Today, we heard Vice-Chancellors of 24 central universities present here on issues concerning promotion of research and innovation in your campuses. This meeting was convened by me to understand, discuss and, where possible, to find quick solutions to the problems faced by you with regards to your initiatives and plans focussed on research and innovation. 


 


	From the deliberations today, it appears that the universities are making noteworthy contributions to research in different fields ranging from basic science to humanities. However, as we have heard, there are areas in which you are facing challenges. We need to acknowledge those challenges and then address them through a conscious, clear and systematic approach. 


 


	In many cases, these challenges cannot be resolved by the universities alone and they need institutional and long term support of the Government. In this regard, I appreciate the presence of the Minister for HRD, as well as the Minister of State and other officers from the Ministry. I also thank the Ministry of Science and Technology and the University Grants Commission for their contribution in today’s meeting. Be it issues concerning funding of research, setting up of top-class labs or incubation centres, facilitation for filing patents or other issues, I am sure that the Ministers as well as the concerned officials have noted them all and would follow up on those through concrete actions. 


 


	However, a lot of possible improvements lie fully within your own grasp. As Vice-Chancellors of these universities, it is for you to design and impose a regimen that will ensure that our universities continue to improve and provide meaningful education for nation building. Simple steps like strictly adhering to your Academic Calendar for admissions, conduct of classes, examinations, declaration of results and awarding of degrees at convocations and so on, can be the starting point on the journey towards excellence.From the presentations made earlier, I find that in most of the cases you are regular till the stage of university results but get slow when the stage for holding convocation arrives. In my view, your one year academic calendar is incomplete till convocation is held and degrees are distributed. It is important that all of you hold your convocations regularly and on time.


 


	It is observed that filling up of faculty vacancies is a challenge faced by many of you. This is a common issue faced by several of our higher education institutes and we need to find lasting solutions to address it. 


 


	There are somesteps that you can take to address the shortage of faculty in your universities. For instance, you can develop a robust visiting faculty program, use online teaching tools, re-employ retired professors. Also, planning for vacancies well in advance can help. Besides, the ability of each university to attract talent also depends upon its own reputation and quality. So compete to become the best among your peersand your success at hiring and retaining talent will automatically improve. 


 


	You must embrace technology in a big way to augment yourresearch and teachingresources as well as your reach beyond your physical campuses.All of you must invest in Massive Open Online Courses (or MOOC) to enhance your capacities. Through adoption of technology you can minimise your carbon footprint. For instance, you can drastically reduce use of paper by digitising your class calendars, notes, examinations, and assignments.


 


	Universities should play a leading role in addressing the specific challenges faced by our nation. Many of these challenges require creative and innovative solutions. It is your paramount duty to ensure that your campuses emerge as spaces that nurture free expression and ideas, where experimentation is encouraged and failure is not ridiculed but is seen as learning. In addition, universities should become the conduits for exposing students to the problems faced by our people, our nation,cities,towns and villages. 


 


	Through such exposure coupled with a push towards creative and innovative thinking, universities can prepare its students to take up research and innovation projects contributing to national development. For instance, while doing ‘Basic Research’ in science is important, so too is doing ‘Applied Research’ that can solve real-life specific problems, say of our farmers.And while theory lectures in classroom are important for students, so too are field projects in nearby villages and towns.We need to introspect whether we are doing enough in this regard. All of you should make a conscious effort to integrate community-oriented projects as part of your curriculum. 


 


	Today, we have discussed problems but we have also made some progress in identifying the way forward. I am sure the Ministry of HRD, led by the Minister, Shri Prakash Javadekar, will make all efforts to resolve these problems in a time-bound manner. I propose that in approximately six months, perhaps in December, we meet again to review progress.


 


	With those words, I would like to thank you for participating in the discussions with full honesty. I could sense that all of you are highly motivated to makeyour universities institutions of excellence. I wish you and wish your universitiesall the best for the future.


 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today said that the committee he had set up to review and revisit the Rules of Procedure and Business of Rajya Sabha for smooth functioning of the House is likely to submit its interim report next month. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the book ‘Straight Talk’ authored by the Member of Rajya Sabha, Shri Abhishek Manu Singhvi, here today. The former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

Referring to the suggestion made by Dr. Singhvi in the book for automatic suspension of allowances for law makers per day or per hour lost due to disruptions, he expressed the hope that the suggestion would be considered by the committee.

 

The Vice President said “we need to ponder if our legislatures are sending out the right message to the people who have lot of expectations from our legislatures, the temples of democracy. The ruling and opposition parties divide that is becoming increasingly manifest in our legislatures does not inspire confidence in the people”. 

 

In Indian parliamentary democracy, political parties have an important role to play, adding that Politics should not be the be all and end all of political activities. He said that it should be the vehicle for transformation of India towards a New and Better India.

 

The Vice President called for a new political approach based on ‘Less Fission (division) and more Fusion’. He said there should be enlightened and meaningful debates in the Parliament and Legislatures. 

 

Arguing for smooth functioning of Parliament, the Vice President called on ruling and opposition parties to discharge specific responsibilities. Governments and ruling parties of the day must push legislative proposals and the opposition must ensure the best possible scrutiny, he added.

 

Saying that Political parties are at the best only rivals and not enemies the Vice President said that rivals contend with each other based on certain norms, conventions and agreed principles while enemies seek to destroy each other. The Vice President said that he expects all the parties to be guided by this distinction.

 

The Vice President said that law makers should be elected based on four Cs-- Capacity, Caliber, Character and Conduct and not on the basis of the other four Cs-- Caste, Community, Cash and Criminal Prowess.

 

Agreeing with another suggestion in the book for  fast track courts for election related cases, he said that special tribunals or courts need to be set up dispose of election petitions within six months. Government and Parliament should seriously think on this issue.

 

The Vice President said that it was important to realize the new and better India of the dream of every Indian. Every Indian has a dream and every citizen has an aspiration. This makes our country an “Aspirational India”, he said and added that Dr. Singhvi’s dreams of a Better India and the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is targeting a New India.

 

He said the themes and sub-themes addressed in the book are timeless and transcend politics, political parties, governments and current events. “They raise conceptual issues and matters of everlasting importance for the nation at large”, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“Respected former Prime Minister Dr.Manmohan Singh ji, the man of this evening Shri Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Member of Rajya Sabha, distinguished invitees, friends from the media, Brothers and Sisters!

 

It is a matter of pleasure for me spending some quality time with such a galaxy of intellectuals and informed people this evening. I am particularly glad to be associated with the release of the book ‘Straight Talk’ which is a compilation of articles written by Shri Abhishek Manu Singhvi, over the last five years, on a host of issues.

 

I would only be stating the obvious when I say that Shri Abhishek is one of the leading lawyers of the country besides making a mark in the fields of politics, parliamentary debates, writing etc. He is a genuine and accomplished multi-tasker who is also among the small breed of select and privileged ones who have successfully courted politics. 

 

I have been watching him for a couple of decades now. I am impressed with his clarity of thought, ability of articulation, sense of balance and the power of his pen. As Chairman of Rajya Sabha, I am happy that he is a Member of the House of Elders. Well done Abhishek ji and keep it up. 

 

He has moved on from ‘Candid Corner’ five years ago to ‘Straight Talk’ now. Candid Corner was a similar collection of his writings for which forward was also written by Dr.Manmohan Singh ji.

 

With his latest collection of writings, Abhishek seeks to talk straight urging the readers to dream and dream big, the canvass of this being ‘India of My Dreams’. It is not soft dreams he suggests but hard dreams based on hard facts about the India on the rise. He advocates moving away from the romantic India famous for it’s soft powers like the spirituality, traditions, history, our value systems, bollywood, the cuisine, culture, languages, the smells and sounds of India etc.

 

Shri Singhvi asserts in this book with a certain strength of convictions and hope of realizing  a better India in the near future and I quote “We need to dream hard as India emerges to be close to being the third largest economy of the world with the fastest growing telecom sector, expanding global footprints of Indian companies etc.” He argues for a Better India by harnessing it’s full potential so that our country occupies the place it richly deserves. 

 

All the 63 articles are thoughtfully categorized under seven chapters titled attractively like Good Governance, Society Today, Reforming Judiciary, Facing Terrorism, The Nuclear issue, Trends in the Media and Some Heroes and Icons. Well informed and erudite that he is, Shri Singhvi evidentially captures India’s strengths, capabilities, contradictions, synergies, mindsets, our glorious past and a few small things that were neglected over the years and which could have made a big difference to realize a better India. 

 

In his own words in the Introduction to the ‘Straight Talk’, Shri Singhvi says and I quote “The object and the intent, the approach and technique – be it critical, laudatory, hortatory (exhorting), cynical, analytical, argumentative or comparative- is always the same: to nudge this great country closer and closer to the India of my dreams”.  And his dream is a Better India. 

 

Now, we need to know what are the challenges to make a Better India? Abhishek ji lists eight of them. These are : Lifting about 300 million Indians out of absolute poverty, Environmental degradation, Strengthening India’s liberal democracy and Health issues like HIV/AIDS epidemic. These four have been taken from Edward Luce’s book ‘In spite of the Gods’. And then he added four more viz., Universalisation of primary and secondary education with a sense of India and a sense of values and philosophy of India, Corruption, Judicial Reforms and Electoral Reforms.  Who can question or disagree  with this scheme of challenges for a Better India? None can I am sure. 

 

Friends !

 

Any book would be meaningful only if it has some concrete suggestions to make for action that could bring about a difference. On this count also, Shri Singhvi does well. I can’t claim to have read the whole book.  But I did go through the introduction and some other select articles. from these flow the following nine important suggestions relating to functioning of legislatures, judiciary, elections, media,  promoting excellence etc:

 

1. Automatic suspension of allowances for law makers per day or per hour, lost due to disruptions, combined with suspension of named members for a prolonged period without revocation based on misplaced benevolence. 

 

I am happy that this suggestion echoed my concern over the virulently aggressive disruption of proceedings. I have set up a Committee to review and revisit the Rules of Procedure and Business of Rajya Sabha for enabling smooth functioning of the House. This Committee has started work and an Interim Report is likely to be submitted next month. I hope this suggestion of Shri Singhvi will be considered by the Committee. 

 

2. Amending the law to see that Whip does not  apply to legislative voting and at the time of introduction of Bills so that bipartisan legislative proposals can be made that have a chance of becoming law.

 

Shri Singhvi’s argument is that this encourages flexibility in voting and legislative creativity since proposing laws is now in the sole domain of governments.

3. Government losing vote in the House on any legislation should not be treated as having lost the confidence of the House. Confidence of the House in the Government should be tested only through specific No Confidence Motions. 

 

This suggestion is in line with the recommendation of giving liberty to MPs  on voting on Bills.  

 

4. Disqualifying law makers with criminal antecedents at the stage of framing of charges by the Courts

This makes sense in the context of growing concern over rising number of law makers with criminal record. I have been saying for long that law makers should be elected based on four Cs i.e. Capacity, Caliber, Character and Conduct and not based on the other four Cs i.e. Caste, Community, Cash and Criminal Prowess. 

 

5. Announcing the successor Judge a month before a Judge retires.

 

Being a part of the system, Shri  Singhvi clinically analyzed the reasons for huge pendency of cases and made this suggestion worthy of serious consideration.

 

6. Mandatory Judicial Impact assessment of all legislations.

 

This recommendation is perhaps meant to assess the potential of litigation flowing from any legislation so that government’s can be more careful while drafting legislative proposals. 

 

7. Fast Track Courts for election related cases.

 

This makes sense  in the context of inordinate delay in deciding such cases by which a law maker meriting disqualification would have completed the term availing all benefits. The statutory provision of deciding election cases in six months is followed more in violation now. 

 

8. New Ministry of Excellence

 

Voicing concern over excellence being considered as an elitist concept for long in our context, this has been suggested to instiutionalise, internalize and make operational excellence at all levels. There is also a call to start movement of excellence. This impacts the quality of our vast human resources and efficiency of production. 

 

 9. Legislative intervention to  ensure level playing field and unbiased news and reporting by media.

 

I am sure all including the friends from media would be interested in this. This suggestion has been made in the context of ‘Tyranny of TRPs (Television Rating Points)’ with subjectivity and noise dominating the TV space with truth, individuals and institutions becoming victims in the process. 

 

Besides such specific suggestions, the learned Shri Abhishek Manu Singhvi has made some observations which are equally important for public debate.

 

Regarding judiciary, he writes and I quote “Judicial activism, in the sense of excessive judicial interference in the working of a democratic polity, is a basic and undeniable truth in India. Judicial overreach is a living reality, making lament formal and protest ornamental. From the monkey to the dog menace, from corruption to cleaning up cities and rivers, from the comic to the divine and from the useful to the banal, India has all varieties of Judicial activism on offer”. 

 

In the context of strict separation of power in our Constitutional scheme of things, this wide spread concern needs to engage the minds of the people who are the patrons of our cherished democracy. Shri Singhvi has quoted a few instances of judicial overreach in his ‘Straight Talk. 

 

Other major concerns voiced by Shri Singhvi include the rising money power in elections and our legislatures becoming more and more hereditary.

 

In the context of complaints by the losers against Electronic Voting Machine (EVMs), this ‘Straight Talk’ has this to say, “Despite periodic taunts and criticism of EVM, there is a near unanimity that it yields a remarkably accurate and virtually unassailable results.”

 

Friends !

 

These specific suggestions and other comments of the author on the functioning of various institutions of our polity needs to be  widely discussed for the much needed transformation towards a Better India. 

 

Shri Singhvi dreams of a Better India. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is targeting a New India. The underlying concerns and intent are the same. Every Indian has a dream and every citizen has an aspiration. This makes our country Aspirational India. 

 

The principal issue is realizing this New and Better India of the dream of every Indian. In our parliamentary democracy, political parties have an important role to play. Politics should not be the be all and end all of political activities. It should be transformation of India towards a New and Better India. 

 

We need to ponder if our legislatures are sending out the right message to  the people who have lot of expectations from our legislatures, the  temples of democracy. ‘The ruling and opposition parties divide that is becoming increasingly manifest in our legislatures does not inspire confidence in the people. 

 

The ruling and opposition parties have specific responsibilities to discharge. While the governments and ruling parties of the day seek to push legislative proposals, the opposition is mandated with ensuring the best possible scrutiny. At the end of the day, the best possible legislations should follow which further the aspirations of the people.  This can be realized without both loosing their respective identities. This calls for a new political approach based on ‘Less Fission (division) and more Fusion’. Incidentally, this is a title of one of the articles in Singhvi’s ‘Straight Talk’.  

 

Political parties are at the best only rivals and not enemies. Rivals contend with each other based on certain norms, conventions and agreed principles while enemies seek to destroy each other. I expect all the parties to be guided by this distinction.

 

The themes and sub-themes addressed in the book are timeless and transcend politics, political parties, governments and current events. They raise conceptual issues and matters of everlasting importance for the nation at large. 

 

Shri Singhvi’s anguish in this book about India being described as a major soft power than a hard power and an iron fist in a velvet glove comes out clear. We all share this anguish. Let us take India to its right orbit. This mission is on and we shall be there. 

 

In the end, 

 

Mr.Abhishek Manu Singhvi, in this Council of informed members who have the ability to further amplify the message that you seek to give out, I admit your motion for an informed debate on Better India.

 

Thank you all for patient hearing.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Dr. Ambedkar’s thoughts and teachings are relevant forever. He was visiting Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial and Dr. Ambedkar International Centre, here today, which were constructed as part of the Panch Theerth Memorials as a tribute to the revered social reformer and the architect of the Indian Constitution. The Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thaawar Chand Gehlot, the Minister of State for Social Justice & Empowerment, Shri Vijay Sampla and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.   

The Vice President spent considerable time at the National Memorial, which houses the museum containing 27 exhibits on the life and work of Dr. Ambedkar. The museum has LED walls for screening short films on Dr. Ambedkar. It also has a robotic device which emulates lifelike characteristics of Dr. Ambedkar and repeats the speech he had made in the Constituent Assembly on 25th July, 1949.

Later, the Vice President visited Dr. Ambedkar International Centre and went around the auditoria and a big library. 

Interacting with the staff at both the places, he paid glowing tributes to Dr. Ambedkar. He lauded the Government for constructing the memorials in the form of Panch Theerthas at his birthplace at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, place in London where he had stayed while studying in the UK, Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur, Mahaparivathan Sthal in Delhi and Chaitya Bhoomi in Mumbai. 

Describing the memorials as a befitting homage to a great son of India, he said that he was fortunate to have visited all the five places.   

Observing that the depiction of life Dr. Ambdekar at the museum was wonderful, he said “it is a beautiful museum dutifully done to keep the memory of the great son of this great country”. He said the project was initiated when he was the urban Development Minister and it was a dream come true for him to see the “beautiful museum”. The Museum must be visited by every Indian youth, he added. He said the museum was the best place to understand the life, teachings and preaching of Dr. Babasaheb.

After visiting the auditoria and the library at Dr. Ambedkar International Centre, the Vice President said that he was highly impressed with the architecture of the building, located at Janpath. He said the entire literature relating to Dr. Babasaheb should be made available at the library. He suggested to the authorities to regularly hold national and international seminars on Dr. Ambedkar.    

He said Dr. Babasaheb was not only an outstanding intellectual, but was also a great social reformer, philosopher and humanist, who strove all through his life to dismantle caste barriers. His thoughts are eternal and relevant for all times.  

He said the nation would be always grateful for his stellar contribution in drafting the constitution. He was one of the builders of modern India and his vision contributed towards the formulation of water and industrial policies in the country. He was the pioneer in giving proper direction and guidance to the nation after independence.

He complimented the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi and Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thawar Chand Gehlot and others for building the memorials which will be important places for younger generation to carry out research and understand the contributions made by Dr. Ambedkar. The Vice President said “the younger generation should know about his life and philosophy as also the struggles he had undergone”. 

The Vice President complimented the architects and appreciated the monolith sculpture of Lord Budhha Statue inside Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the role and contribution of a teacher in the formation of a nation is immense and praiseworthy. He was addressing the gathering after presenting the Malti Gyan Peeth Puraskar to 15 teachers from Government Schools from Punjab, who have shown excellence in teaching, in New Delhi today. The Union Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, the Minister of State for Rural Development, Shri Ram Kripal Yadav and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that Teachers have been given respect and honour in our culture. He further said that the word 'guru' means 'source of light' and the duty of the teacher is not only to educate the students, but also to make them enriched. They not only have to fill the word knowledge in the minds of students, but also to teach the ethics, commitment, selflessness and even the lesson of awareness, he added.

The Vice President said that in today's changing environment, when education is being more commercialized, it is necessary for teachers to give more emphasis in the formation of their character besides providing education to the students. He quoted Mahatma Gandhi as saying ""If there is no good character from education, then there is no value for education for such knowledge. 

The Vice President said that usage of mother tongue is very important in the education. He further said that mother tongue is the most accessible and simple language for any person. In mother tongue we can express our views more easily and more affectively, he added.

The Vice President said that the downfall in female literacy rate has a direct impact on India's growth, because it affects every area of development. If women remain uneducated, then it will have a direct and negative impact on the efforts made to control the country's growing population, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address in Hindi: 

“मुझे यह जानकर अत्यंत प्रसन्नता हुई है कि शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में गुणवत्ता को प्रोत्साहित करने के लिए मोहिन्दर सिंह सिंघल एजुकेशन एंड रिसर्च सोसाइटी सराहनीय कार्य कर रही है। इसी क्रम में विविध विषयों में पारंगत पंजाब के सरकारी स्कूलों में कार्यरत 15 शिक्षकों को मालती ज्ञानपीठ पुरस्कार से सम्मानित किया जा रहा है। मालती ज्ञानपीठ पुरस्कार  समारोह के सुअवसर पर आप सभी के बीच उपस्थित होकर मुझे बेहद प्रसन्नता हो रही है।

मैं श्री मनोज सिंघल, मोहिंदर सिंह सिंघल एजुकेशन एंड रिसर्च सोसायटी के अध्यक्ष को बधाई देता हूँ जिन्होंने इस पुरस्कार को अपनी माताजी के नाम पर स्थापित कर पंजाब के ग्रामीण इलाकों में शिक्षण कार्य को प्रोत्साहित किया। इसके साथ-साथ मैं पंजाब सरकार के प्रयासों की भी सराहना करना चाहूंगा जो अपनी सुनियोजित चयन प्रक्रिया से इन सुयोग्य अध्यापकों का चयन करती है।

एक अग्रणी उद्योगपति होने के नाते आप समाज के प्रति जिस प्रकार से अपना कर्तव्य  निभा रहे हैं, दूसरे लोगों के लिए भी प्रेरणादायक है। मैं समझता हूँ कि शिक्षा के प्रचार-प्रसार को गुणवत्ता के साथ आगे बढ़ाने के लिए हर नागरिक को प्रयत्नशील रहना चाहिए क्योंकि हर पहल शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में एक मील का पत्थर साबित होती है।

अध्यापकों को सम्मान सवरूप एक लाख की राशि व प्रशस्ति पत्र तथा एक  robe of honour दिया जा रहा है। इस प्रकार के सम्मान से नि:संदेह ही सरकारी स्कूल के अध्यापक प्रोत्साहित होते हैं तथा  शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में  और अधिक कार्य करने के लिए न सिर्फ स्वयं प्रेरित होते हैं, बल्कि अन्य शिक्षकों के लिए भी प्रेरणा बनते हैं। अपने-अपने विषय में पारंगत जिन शिक्षकों को मालती ज्ञानपीठ पुरसकार से सम्मानित किया जा रहा है उनको मेरी हार्दिक बधाई एवं शुभकामनाएँ।

यह गर्व की बात है कि मालती ज्ञानपीठ पुरस्कार जिसे कि वर्ष 2013 में स्थापित किया गया, उससे अब तक शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में  सराहनीय योगदान देने के लिए पंजाब राज्य के 80 अध्यापकों  को सम्मानित किया जा चुका है।

श्री मालती मोहिन्दर सिंघल एक शिक्षाविद् हैं और कन्याओं की शिक्षा की प्रबल पक्षधर हैं। उनका बालिकाओं एवं महिलाओं को शिक्षित,  स्वावलंबी एवं सशक्त बनाने की दिशा में किया गया महत्वपूर्ण योगदान सर्वविदित है। उनके द्वारा उठाया गया यह कदम निश्चय ही सराहनीय, अभिनन्दनीय तथा अनुकरणीय है। यह कार्यक्रम माताजी के जन्म-दिवस को सार्थकता एवं गरिमा प्रदान करता है। पूज्य माताजी के 97वें जन्मदिवस के शुभ अवसर पर इन शिक्षकों को सम्मानित करना मेरे लिए निसन्देह सौभाग्य की बात है। 

मित्रों, हमारी संस्कृति में शिक्षकों को आदर और सम्मान दिया गया है।  'गुरु' शब्द का अर्थ ही 'प्रकाश का स्रोत' है। एक राष्ट्र को बनाने में शिक्षक का जितना सहयोग एवं योगदान है, उतना शायद किसी और का हो ही नहीं सकता। एक राष्ट्र को उन्नति के चरम शिखर पर ले जाते हैं उसके राजनेता, डॉक्टर, इंजीनियर, उद्योगपति, लेखक, अभिनेता, खिलाड़ी आदि और परोक्ष रूप से इन सबको बनाने वाला एक शिक्षक ही होता है।

शिक्षक देश के निर्माण में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाते हैं। आप राष्ट्र की भावी पीढ़ी के निर्माण का महान कार्य करते हैं। शिक्षक का कर्तव्य छात्रों को केवल शिक्षित करना ही नहीं है, अपितु उन्हें संस्कारी भी बनाना है। उनके अंदर केवल शब्द ज्ञान ही नहीं भरना है बल्कि उसे नैतिकता, कर्तव्य परायणता, सजगता का पाठ भी पढ़ाना अत्यंत आवश्यक होता है। । अच्छे शिक्षक के इन्हीं गुणों की प्रशंसा करते हुए भारत के प्रथम उपराष्ट्रपति और राज्य सभा के सभापति डॉ. एस. राधाकृष्णन, ने कहा था, ""देश की सर्वोत्तम प्रतिभाओं को शिक्षक होना चाहिए।""

आज के बदलते परिवेश में जब शिक्षा का अधिक व्यवसायीकरण हो रहा है, ऐसी स्थिति में  यह आवश्यक है कि शिक्षकों को विद्यार्थियों को शिक्षा प्रदान करने के अलावा उनके चरित्र निर्माण में भी अधिक बल देना होगा। महात्मा गांधी ने भी कहा है, ""यदि शिक्षा से अच्छे चरित्र का निर्माण नहीं हो पाता है तो ऐसी अक्षर ज्ञान कराने वाली शिक्षा का कोई मूल्य नहीं है।

'वास्तविक शिक्षा' का उद्देश्य छात्रों का समग्र विकास होना चाहिए जिसमें रोजगार पाने तथा स्वरोजगार उत्पन्न करने के अलावा, शैक्षिक उत्कृष्टता, कौशल विकास, शारीरिक क्षमता और चरित्र निर्माण पर समान रूप से जोर देना चाहिए। 

मित्रों, आज के युग को तकनीकी युग माना गया है जिससे जीवन के विभिन्न क्षेत्रों में प्रौद्योगिकी, विशेष रूप से सूचना तकनीक का अधिकाधिक प्रयोग होने लगा है। कई शिक्षण संस्थानों में भी इसका प्रभावी तरीके से इस्तेमाल हो रहा है। इसके अधिक प्रयोग को हमें बढ़ावा देना चाहिए ताकि हम अपनी ज्ञान अर्जन प्रक्रिया को बेहतर बना सकें। 

मित्रों, स्वतंत्रता प्राप्ति के बाद देश में शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में काफी विस्तार हुआ है जिसके कारण देश ने कई क्षेत्रों में प्रगति की है। आज देश के 95 प्रतिशत बच्चे स्कूल जाते हैं |साक्षरता दर में भी निरंतर सुधार हुआ है जो 1947 में केवल 18 प्रतिशत थी, आज वह बढ़कर करीब 80 प्रतिशत हो गई है। जहाँ शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में ये उपलब्धियाँ हमारे लिए गर्व की बात है, वहीं हमारा उद्देश्य यह भी रहना चाहिए कि देश में 100 प्रतिशत साक्षरता हो और प्रत्येक बच्चा स्कूल जा सके। 

मित्रों, आज शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में हमारे सामने कई चुनौतियाँ हैं, जिसमें मुख्य रूप से शिक्षा और शिक्षण में गुणवत्ता की कमी, विद्यार्थियों के सीखने के स्तर में गिरावट, छात्रों द्वारा बीच में शिक्षा छोड़ देना, इत्यादि। इसकी जिम्मेदारी केवल शिक्षकों की ही नहीं है, अपितु माता-पिता, सामाजिक संगठन, नागरिक, और लोक प्रतिनिधि आदि सबकी एक सामूहिक जिम्मेदारी है कि हम इन चुनौतियों का किस तरह से सफलतापूर्वक समाधान कर सकते हैं। आप जैसी शिक्षण संस्थाएं इस समस्या का सकारात्मक हल निकाल सकते हैं।

मित्रों, आज हम शिक्षा की बात कर रहे हैं तो मुझे मातृभाषा की महत्ता याद आ रही है। मातृभाषा किसी भी व्यक्ति के लिए सबसे सुलभ और सरल भाषा होती है। मातृभाषा में हम अपने विचारों को अधिक आसानी और स्वाभाविक तरीके से अभिव्यक्त कर सकते हैं। इसलिए मैं हर मंच से यह कहता हूँ कि मातृभाषा का प्रयोग अन्य भाषाओं के साथ-साथ निरंतर होना चाहिए ताकि हम ऐसी पीढ़ी का निर्माण कर सकें जो अपनी मातृभाषा में सोचती हो, बोलती हो और लिखती हो। गांधी जी ने भी शिक्षा को समाज के सांस्कृतिक परिवेश से जोड़ने पर बल दिया। भाषा और भाव भी संस्कृति से जुड़े हैं। अत: आवश्यक है कि शिक्षा को सुगम बनाने के लिए मातृभाषा को प्रोत्साहित किया जाए। अन्य भाषाओं को एक विषय के रूप में पढ़ाया जा सकता है, परंतु प्रारंभिक शिक्षा के माध्यम के रूप में मातृभाषा अधिक प्रभावी होगी। 

हमारी इस युवा पीढ़ी का आधा हिस्सा हमारी बेटियाँ हैं। यह देखा गया है कि अगर उनको सही शिक्षा एवं अवसर प्रदान किए जाएं तो उन्होंने हर क्षेत्र में अपनी एक विशिष्ट पहचान बनाई है और देश का नाम रौशन किया है। बदलते भारत की पहचान बनकर उभर रही हमारी बेटियाँ राष्ट्र निर्माण की प्रक्रिया में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभा रही हैं। अपनी बेटियों को शिक्षा और वह भी गुणवत्तापूर्ण शिक्षा प्रदान कराना हमारे समाज की बड़ी चुनौतियों में से एक है। इस दिशा में सरकार द्वारा लड़कियों को बचाने तथा शिक्षित करने के लिए कई महत्वपूर्ण कदम उठाये गये हैं। इनमें से मुख्य रूप से ""बेटी बचाओ - बेटी पढ़ाओ"" अभियान है। इस अभियान से समाज का बेटियों और महिलाओं के प्रति दृष्टिकोण बदला है और एक अनुकूल वातावरण बना है। 

महिला साक्षारता दर में कमी का सीधा अर्थ है भारत का धीमा विकास, क्योंकि यह विकास के हर क्षेत्र को प्रभावित करती है। अगर महिलाएं अशिक्षित रहेगी तो देश की बढ़ती जनसंख्या नियंत्रण के लिए किये गये प्रयासों पर इसका प्रत्यक्ष और नकारात्मक प्रभाव पड़ेगा। 

मित्रों, एक समय भारत 'विश्व गुरु' के रूप में जाना जाता था, जहाँ ज्ञान की तलाश में विश्व की कई जगहों से लोग हमारे प्राचीन शिक्षण संस्थाओं जैसे नालंदा और तक्षशिला विश्वविद्यालयों में आते थे। आज जब हम एक विश्व शक्ति के रूप में उभरने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं तो यह आवश्यक है कि हम पुन: 'विश्व गुरु' उत्कृष्ट शिक्षा केंद्र के रूप में अपना स्थान बनायें। यह तभी संभव हो सकता है जब हम शिक्षा को एक पवित्र मिशन के रूप में लेंगे जिससे इक्कीसवीं सदी में सभी बच्चों को आवश्यक ज्ञान, और कौशल प्राप्त हो और उनमें लोकतंत्र, समता, स्वतंत्रता, न्याय, धर्म निरपेक्षता, मानवाधिकारों और मानवीय गरिमा के प्रति सम्मान, दूसरे के कल्याण की चिंता जैसे गुणों से शिक्षित करें। 

मैं उन अध्यापकों, जिनको आज सम्मानित किया जा रहा है और जिन पर सही शिक्षा और कौशल समर्थ नागरिक तैयार करने की जिम्मेदारी है, को नमन करता हूँ। देश में शिक्षा की तस्वीर को बदलने के लिए यह आवश्यक है कि शिक्षकों में  अपेक्षित योग्यता, आत्मविश्वास और समर्पण का भाव हो। 

मैं इस अवसर पर पूज्य माताजी के जन्म दिवस पर उनकी सुख-शांति और दीर्घायु की कामना करता हूँ। मैं सभी पुरस्कृत शिक्षकों को पुन: बधाई देता हूँ और सभी शिक्षकों से आह्वान करता हूँ कि शिक्षा के अभियान में अपना महत्वपूर्ण योगदान देकर समाज को सही दिशा दें और जिस कार्य को आप राष्ट्र और समाज के उत्थान के लिए कर रहे हैं, उसे अधिक विनम्रता और जोश के साथ करते रहें। इस आयोजन से जुड़े सभी महानुभावों को मैं बधाई देता हूँ।

जय हिंद!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we need adequate representation to women in Parliament and State Legislatures. Releasing a Hindi book titled “Bharat Rajneeti Ke 50 Shikhar Mahilayen” authored by Dr. Asshwine Shastri, he emphasized on the need for political and economic empowerment women, and said that they should be given equal opportunities in all fields. The Vice Chairperson on National Commission for Scheduled Tribes, Ms. Anusuia Uikey, the former Minister for Trourism, Jammu and Kashmir, Smt. Priya Sethi and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

The Vice President said that the world over it has been recognized that representation of women in legislatures would help in resolving complex and sensitive socio-economic matters. 

 

Pointing out that all political parties had agreed for providing reservation for women in the Parliament and Legislatures, he wondered why they were not moving forward on the issue. 

 

Saying that economic empowerment of women was as important as their political empowerment, he said equal rights on parental property must be extended to women.   

 

Expressing concern over the growing atrocities on women, he said any atrocity should not be politicalised.  He also called for change of mindset among the people to prevent atrocities. It is not enough if we have a mere Bill, and said that there should be political will and administrative skill to kill the evil.  

 

Observing that India had the tradition of respecting women from ancient times, he pointed out those women had occupied positions of power in scriptures.  Large number of women had played a key role during India’s Independence movement and in various fields in post-independent India- from sports to politics and economics.   

 

The Vice President lauded the author for bringing out a book on the achievement of fifty women political leaders of the country. It will not only be useful as a reference book, but will also give inspiration to the younger generation, he added. 

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address in Hindi:

 

“सबसे पहले मैं नवभारत टाइम्स के वरिष्ठ बुद्धिजीवी पत्रकार डॉ0 अश्विनी शास्त्री जी को भारतीय राजनीति में महिलाओं की भूमिका पर आधारित ""भारतीय राजनीति की 50 शिखर महिलायें"" नामक पुस्तक की रचना के लिए बधाई देता हूँ। लगभग तीन सौ पृष्ठों की इस पुस्तक को पाठकों तक पहुँचाने के लिए उन्होंने दो साल तक बहुत परिश्रम किया है। देश की 50 महत्वपूर्ण राजनीतिक महिलाओं से साक्षात्कार, उनके जीवन संघर्ष, और राजनीति में आई चुनौतियों और देश के विकास में उनके योगदान का विवरण प्रस्तुत किया है। वास्तव में यह अपनी तरह का अनूठा प्रयोग है। 

 

अश्विनी शास्त्री जी भारतीय संस्कृति की गहरी समझ रखते हैं। वे पत्रकारिता से  लंबे समय से जुड़े हुए हैं और एक बहुमुखी लेखक हैं। अपनी विलक्षण प्रतिभा के द्वारा उन्होंने देश-विदेश में अपने बौद्धिक और सांस्कृतिक ज्ञान की छाप छोड़ी है।

 

विश्वभर में आज यह महसूस किया जा रहा है कि विधायी निकायों (Legislatures) में पुरुषों और महिलाओं के संतुलित प्रतिनिधित्व से जटिल सामाजिक-आर्थिक समस्याओं को प्रभावी तरीके से हल किया जा सकता है। महात्मा गांधी ने 1930 में कहा था कि  यदि भारत की भावी विधायिका में पर्याप्त संख्या में महिलाएँ नहीं हुईं तो वे इसका बहिष्कार कर देंगे। हमारी  आज़ादी की लड़ाई  ने महिलाओं को राजनीतिक और सार्वजनिक  जीवन में अपनी भूमिका निभाने का अवसर दिया  और सभी स्तरों  -  स्थानीय, प्रांतीय और राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर बड़ी संख्या में महिला नेता और कार्यकर्ता उभर कर सामने आईं।

 

बहनों और भाइयों, प्राचीन काल से ही हमारे समाज और राजनीति में महिलाओं की एक विशिष्ट भूमिका रही है। आधुनिक भारत की लोकतांत्रिक राजनीति में भी महिलाओं की भूमिका विस्तृत हुई है। सरोजिनी नायडु, जैसी महिलाएँ राजनीति में अन्य महिलाओं के लिए प्रेरणा स्रोत रहीं हैं। इसी वजह से इनके बाद वाली पीढ़ी में महिला राजनीतिज्ञों की संख्या काफी तेजी से बढ़ी है।

 

भारत की आजादी के बाद राजनीति में महिलाओं ने अहम भूमिका निभाई है। हमारे गणतंत्र के राष्ट्रपति जैसे उच्च पद से लेकर स्थानीय निकायों तक, महिलाओं ने हर स्तर पर लोकतांत्रिक प्रक्रिया में भागीदारी की है। 

 

इसमें कोई संदेह नहीं है कि आज भी आबादी के हिसाब से महिलाओं की राजनीति में भागीदारी उतनी नहीं है, जितनी होनी चाहिए। वर्तमान में संसद के दोनों सदनों में कुल मिलाकर 94 (65 लोक सभा व 29 राज्य सभा) महिला सांसद हैं, जो कि कुल सदस्यता का लगभग 12% है। राज्यों की विधान सभाओं में महिलाओं का प्रतिनधित्व तो और भी चिंताजनक है। 

 

बहनों और भाइयों, 21वीं सदी की महिलायें प्रेम, दया, करुणा की देवी होने के साथ-साथ स्वतंत्र, महत्वाकांक्षी और स्वाभिमानी नागरिक भी हैं। अपनी इन्हीं क्षमताओं के कारण और सही अवसर मिलने पर महिलाएँ हर क्षेत्र में आगे बढ़ रही हैं। राजनीति का क्षेत्र हो, विदेशों में देश का प्रतिनिधिघ्त्व करना हो, न्याय पालिका हो, नौकरशाही हो, खेल हो, सेना या सुरक्षा हो, साहित्य कला हो, व्यापार हो, विज्ञान एवं शिक्षा का क्षेत्र, भारतीय नारी ने हर क्षेत्र में नए कीर्तिमान स्थापित किए हैं। मौजूदा दौर की नारी हर क्षेत्र में आगे हैं। हमारे कई महत्वपूर्ण संस्थानों और विभागों में महिलाओं की  नेतृत्व क्षमता को सभी ने सराहा है। हमारे देश के दो महत्वपूर्ण मंत्रालयों - रक्षा और विदेश की जिम्मेदारी भी महिलाओं ने ही संभाल रखी है। हाल के वर्षों में कई राज्यों की मुख्यमंत्री भी महिलाएँ रही हैं। कई राजनैतिक दलों का नेतृत्व भी महिलाओं के हाथ में रहा है। 

 

हमारे राष्ट्रीय जीवन में कई महिलाएँ हैं जिन्होंने प्रत्यक्ष या परोक्ष रूप से भारतीय राजनीति को  प्रभावित किया है और अपनी एक अमिट छाप छोड़ी है। भारतीय राजनीतिक व्यवस्था पुरुषों और महिलाओं को समान शक्तियां और भूमिका देती है। लगभग 15 वर्षों तक देश की प्रधान मंत्री रहीं श्रीमती इंदिरा गांधी, भारत की पहली महिला राष्ट्रपति श्रीमती प्रतिभा पाटिल, विदेश मंत्री श्रीमती सुषमा स्वराज, लोकसभा की पूर्व व वर्तमान अध्यक्ष श्रीमती मीरा कुमार और श्रीमती सुमित्रा महाजन, रक्षा मंत्री श्रीमती निर्मला सीतारमण, केंद्रीय मंत्री श्रीमती स्मृति ईरानी, पूर्व कांग्रेस अध्यक्षा श्रीमती सोनिया गांधी, राजस्थान की  मुख्यमंत्री श्रीमती वसुंधरा राजे सिंधिया, पश्चिम बंगाल की मुख्यमंत्री सुश्री ममता बनर्जी, जम्मू और कश्मीर की मुख्यमंत्री महबूबा मुफ्ती, दिल्ली की पूर्व मुख्यमंत्री श्रीमती शीला दीक्षित जी, तमिल नाडु के पूर्व मुख्यमंत्री स्वर्गगीय श्री जय ललिता जी ऐसे नाम हैं जिन्हें किसी भी परिचय की आवश्यकता नहीं है। इन्होंने आधुनिक भारत की राजनीति में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभायी है, और सिद्ध किया है कि कितनी कुशलता और कुशाग्रता के साथ ये घर और शासन को एक संतुलन के साथ संभाल सकती हैं। 

 

मित्रों, जैसा कि विदित है कि स्थानीय निकायों में महिलाओं को 33% आरक्षण दिया गया था। पहले लोगों को महिलाओं की राजनैतिक और शासकीय क्षमता को लेकर संदेह थे। परंतु  गत 25 वर्षों में महिलाओं ने इन संदेहों को निराधार सिद्ध कर दिया है। इन संस्थाओं में महिलाओं ने अपनी नेतृत्व क्षमता को साबित किया है। इसीलिए कई राज्यों में महिलाओं के आरक्षण की सीमा 33% से बढ़ाकर 50% कर दी गई है।

 

मैं आज इस पुस्तक के विमोचन के अवसर पर यह उल्लेख करना चाहूँगा कि आज देश भर में महिला सशक्तिकरण जमीनी स्तर पर साकार होता दिख रहा है। बाबा साहब भीमराव अंबेडकर का कथन कि 'मैं किसी समुदाय की प्रगति, महिलाओं ने जो प्रगति की है, उससे मापता हूँ' आज सत्य प्रतीत होता है। महिलाएं हमारे प्रगतिशील समाज की अभिन्न कड़ी हैं और देश के विकास में पुरुषों के बराबर की भागीदारी कर रही हैं। इसलिए महिलाओं को राजनीति में भी आगे आना होगा, क्योंकि लोकतंत्र को मजबूत करने में महिलाओं की भूमिका अहम है। वर्तमान में जब भारत और पूरे विश्व में राजनीति में लिंगानुपात असंतुलन को ठीक करने के समर्थन में अनुकूल माहौल बन रहा है, ऐसे में यह आवश्यक है कि विधान सभाओं तथा लोकसभा में महिलाओं का बेहतर प्रतिनधित्व हो। इस संदर्भ में 2010 में राज्य सभा में विधान सभाओं तथा लोकसभा में महिलाओं के लिए 33% आरक्षण के बाबत विधेयक पास किया गया था। मुझे आशा है‍ कि आने वाले समय में सभी राजनैतिक दल महिलाओं के संसद और विधान सभाओं में बेहतर प्रतिनिधित्व के लिए भरसक प्रयास करेंगे और इस विषय को प्राथमिकता देंगे ताकि आनेवाले समय में लोक सभा और विधान सभाओं में महिलाओं के राजनैतिक सशक्तिकरण का मार्ग प्रशस्त हो सके।

 

आज एक ओर हम महिलाओं के राजनैतिक सशक्तिकरण के लिए प्रयास कर रहे हैं वहीं दूसरी ओर हाल की कुछ खेदजनक घटनाएँ उनके सामाजिक सशक्तिकरण पर गंभीर प्रश्नचिह्न लगाती हैं। सरकार और समाज को ऐसे खेदजनक अपवादों का सशक्त प्रतिवाद करना होगा जिससे महिलाओं के राजनैतिक और सामाजिक सशक्तिकरण का मार्ग प्रशस्त हो सके।

 

मुझे पूर्ण विश्वास है कि भारतीय राजनीति में महिलाओं की भूमिका पर भविष्य में किए जानेवाले शोध कार्यों के लिए यह पुस्तक अमूल्य संदर्भ सूत्र सिद्ध होगी। मुझे आशा है कि जनप्रतिनिधियों, नीति निर्माताओं, सामाजिक और राजनैतिक कार्यकर्ताओं, शोध छात्रों के लिए भी यह पुस्तक सहायक एवं उपयोगी साबित होगी। यह पुस्तक समय प्रबंधन सीखने के लिए बहुत ही महत्वपूर्ण है। पुस्तक में भारतीय राजनीति में अपना बहुमूल्य योगदान देने वाली महिला राजनीतिज्ञों ने विस्तार से बताया है कि किस प्रकार समय का प्रबंधन कर उन्होंने परिवार, समाज और देश की सेवा के लिए समय निकाला। 

 

एक बार फिर इस महत्वपूर्ण प्रकाशन के लिए मैं  डॉ. अश्विनी के साथ-साथ इस पुस्तक के संयोजन एवं प्रकाशन आदि से जुड़े सभी महानुभावों को बधाई देता हूँ।

 

जय हिंद!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that peace was prerequisite for progress and attention could not be paid to developmental activities if there was tension on border.

 Addressing scientists, students and staff of the Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (IIIM) at Jammu today, the Vice President said that there should be zero tolerance on matters of national security and unity. He said India wants good relations with all and said that a neighboring country must give up its policy of supporting, aiding and abetting terror.

The Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri N.N. Vohra, the Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Prime Minister’s Office, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, the Deputy Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri Kavinder Gupta and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that both science and religion are the tools in the hands of the people in their quest for prosperity and internal peace. Scientific advancements illuminate our understanding of the universe, where as the religion provides answers to the unexplored universe, he added.

The Vice President said that the issues of ‘mind and soul’ and the relentless internal unrest and lack of internal peace constitute this vast unexplored universe. It is the religion which provides some answers to these raging issues, he added.

Saying that the process of questioning and seeking solutions lies at the heart of research, the Vice President said that human progress is not possible without the quest for deeper understanding of the world around. Research and innovation make us grow and they transform the world we inhabit, he added.

The Vice President said that posing relevant questions and seeking answers must be a way of life. He said that children and young adults must be encouraged to ask questions and search for answers. Quality of research is an important indicator of the quality of an educational system and said that it also determines the pace of a country's development.

Paying tributes to the first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru on his death anniversary, he said the former Prime Minister felt that integration of science and technology with national planning was necessary to improve the socio-economic conditions of the teeming millions of people of our country.

He also recalled the contribution of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, who was the first Vice President of CSIR. He said that CSIR has also instituted a special fellowship as a tribute namely, ""DR. SHYAMA PRASAD MUKHERJEE (SPM) FELLOWSHIP"" to commemorate the birth centenary in 2000, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“Human civilization has evolved over many millenniums by asking questions and seeking answers. This process of questioning and seeking solutions lies at the heart of research. Without this quest for deeper understanding of the world around us, no human progress is possible. Research and innovation make us grow. They transform the world we inhabit.

In fact, this attitude of researching must become integral to our education system. Children and young adults must be encouraged to ask questions and search for answers. The Indian word for education is ""Vidya"".

This means, literally, ""knowing what it is"". Please note that the emphasis is on ""knowing"" not on being ""taught"" what it is. The learners must become active explorers, researchers who try to find out the truth.

The quality of research is an important indicator of the quality of an educational system.

The quality of research in a country's resource institutions determines the pace of a country's development.   Posing relevant questions and seeking answers must be a way of life.

If we want to transform our country into a knowledge economy, into a country that harnesses the power of knowledge to transform people's lives, we must focus more sharply on research. Research is the springboard of human progress. It is the launch pad for a nation's development trajectory. But research must be translated into development.

An integrated approach to healthcare issues is at the core of our approach, putting to effective use all systems of medicine for the benefit of the people. Indian is very strong in various systems of medicine, which are now being acknowledged as effective alternatives to allopaty.

Talking of this integrated approach, I am reminded of the contributions of our first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to laying foundations of science and technology in our country. We have observed his Death Anniversary yesterday. I pay my tributes to him.

Nehru strongly felt that integration of science and technology with national planning was necessary to improve the socio-economic conditions of the teeming millions of people of our country.

Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, wasthe first Vice-President of CSIR in the Independent India.

CSIR has also instituted a special fellowship as a tribute namely, ""DR. SHYAMA PRASAD MUKHERJEE (SPM) FELLOWSHIP"" to commemorate the birth centenary year (2000).

Every religion is a body of values and moral prescriptions for its followers to abide by. In the absence of this ‘disciplining force’ and ‘code of conduct’, it would be difficult to enforce ‘social order’ on such a larger scale.

Scientific advancements in their wake have brought certain challenges to human kind like nuclear warfare, biological weapons, other means of mass destruction and serious issues of pollution and climate change. But this is no ground to discard science and scientific quest.

Scientific advancements may illuminate our understanding of the universe. But it is the religion which provides answers to the unexplored universe. The issues of ‘mind and soul’ and the relentless internal unrest and lack of internal peace constitute this vast unexplored universe. It is the religion which provides some answers to these raging issues.

Nehru’s outlook may make him ‘agnostic’ and some may even call him an ‘atheist’. While I pay my tributes to Nehru for promoting the cause of science and scientific spirit, I beg to differ him in the matters of religion and its utility for humanity.

I feel that both science and religion are the tools in the hands of the people in their quest for prosperity and internal peace.

                                                                                 

I am indeed delighted to visit the Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine and interact with scientists, students, staff of this institution and eminent citizens from Jammu region.

I am pleased to learn that this is one of the oldest scientific institutions in our country. Set up in 1941, it has been playing a leading role in promoting scientific and economic growth of our country. In fact, was the first translational institute of drug development from natural resources established in the country as Drug Research Laboratory (DRL) under the aegis of Jammu & Kashmir Government. Col. Sir Ram Nath Chopra who was instrumental in conceptualizing DRL as a research and manufacturing unit, was its founder head.

I am told that the research undertaken by DRL was liberally supported by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Based on the research output of DRL, the manufacturing section was developed into an independent commercial unit.

I am glad to note that as a research laboratory, DRL was the first to give the concept of captive cultivation. It was also the first institute to isolate active principals from indigenous medicinal plants and work on pharmacological activity in lab animals. I am told that it carried out detailed clinical studies on important Indian medicinal plants in connection with hypertension, skin disorders and GI disorders.

As we all know, science has played a major role in the growth of our great nation and the remarkable achievements in the areas of affordable medicine, food security, milk production, space, atomic energy and Information Technology, among others, are a testimony to this fact. India is amongst the leading nations in space and IT. It is pertinent to mention here that the founder of this Institute, Sir Ram Nath Chopra played a major role in formulation of Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules of Independent India. He was instrumental in creating an integrated medicine discipline to bring the knowledge of Ayurveda and other traditional systems of medicines to modern medicine, thereby ensuring global recognition to this ancient Indian knowledge.

 

After India attained independence, DRL was formally taken over by CSIR in December, 1957 and renamed as Regional Research Laboratory.

I am happy to note that the laboratory had widened its research initiatives which included Biological Sciences, Chemical Sciences and Technological sciences (Food, Fur & Wool, Surface Coating and Paper cellulose pulp). I am aware that the mandate of Institute was redefined and its name changed to Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (IIIM) in 2007, keeping in view its core strength in natural products based drug discovery,

Various achievements of erstwhile RRL over the past many years are commendable like introduction of mint in India in 1958. Currently this crop is under cultivation in 2 lakh hectares with an annual turnover of Rs. 4000 crores. The other laudable initiatives include introduction of Hops in India to meet the demand of domestic brewery industry; introduction of lavender and rose as high value commercial crops in Jammu & Kashmir in an area of 300 hectares thereby creating employment for more than 9000 people.

I am told that through scientific validation of traditional ayurvedic medicines, the laboratory has developed drugs namely, Risorine (Anti TB), Sallaki (Rheumatoid  Arthritis), LIVZON &Liv-1 (hepatoprotective) and Imminex (Immuno-modulator) etc. Also fermentation technologies developed by the Institute were transferred to a number of industries for the production of gluconate salts, bio-fertilizers and bio control agents. 

I am very pleased to learn that the Institute along with other CSIR labs has taken up three major national initiatives--Aroma Mission: This mission aims to bring more than 5000 hectares of additional area under captive cultivation of aromatic cash crops particularly targeting rain-fed /degraded land across the country. It also seeks to provide technical and infrastructure support for distillation and value-addition to farmers/growers all over the country, apart from enabling effective buy-back mechanisms to assure remunerative prices to the farmers/growers.

I am happy that it envisages to provide value-addition to essential oils and aroma ingredients for their integration in global trade and economy. 

I am equally pleased to know that the Phytopharma Mission aims at developing plant-based medicines using Ayurveda concepts and positioning Ayurveda medicines, including high-valued, endangered and threatened medicinal plant species, through multi-target approach and pharmacology network.

The third mission, Sickle cell Anemia Mission aims at drug discovery and development of new pre-clinical candidates for Sickle cell Anemia using indigenous plants.

I am pleased to note that Institute is also playing a major role in supporting drug regulatory system of India. The availability of WHO compliant cGMP plant for extraction and formulation of herbal medicines, NABL accredited Quality control & Quality assurance facility, Drug Testing Laboratory, GLP standard animal house, recognition of IIIM as Central Drug Lab for Botanicals & Phytopharmaceutical drugs by DCG(I) and referral lab by FASSI provides the right kind of ecosystem for this.

I am glad that the Institute has started a Technology Business Incubator with the objective of creating jobs and entrepreneurship development for the youth of Jammu and Kashmir and create the right eco-system for startup companies by utilizing the rich bio resources of J&K. I am happy to note that a number of startups within the IIIM campus are currently incubating under this initiative, which is being supported by the Department of Science &Technology.

It is heartening to know that Institute has very robust drug pipeline in the areas of Oncology, Arthritis, Liver protection, Tuberculosis, Alzheimer’s and Peptic ulcers I am also glad that it is helping the J & K science and Technology department in establishing Industrial Bio-tech parks in this beautiful State.

We must be willing to have dialogue with Pakistan but it must give up policy of supporting, aiding, abetting, training terror. Zero tolerance on matters of National security and unity.

Pakistan must honour the commitment of mot allowing its territory to be used for training terror.

Peace is prerequisite for progress. If we have tension at border we cannot pay attention on developmental activities. Benefits of developmental activities worth one lakh crore being spent by the Centre/State must reach people.

Finally, before concluding, I would like you to bestow more attention on diabetes and on diseases such as malaria, chikungunya and dengue so that a large number of people get benefited from your research on drug discovery.

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that it is not possible to ensure the quality of life without electricity. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the new building of UP Electricity Regulatory Commission, in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh today. The Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Ram Naik, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, the Minister for Energy, Uttar Pradesh, Pt. Shrikant Sharma, the Minister of State for Energy, Uttar Pradesh, Shri Swatantra Dev Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

The Vice President complemented the authorities for constructing an energy efficient building and called it a model for other government and commercial buildings that are moving in the direction of energy conservation and energy saving. Our economy and lifestyle are dependent of electricity, he added.

 

The Vice President said that people must make efficient and effective use of electricity as it is not renewable. He also called on people to explore the possibility of new and renewable energy sources. If electricity is to be given to every household, then it will have to be made so cheap that neither the consumer will be burdened, he added.  

 

The Vice President called for a relook into the way electricity has been viewed. He further said that it is time that one also considers regulating the demand for electricity apart from focusing on energy supply like production and distribution. 

 

The Vice President said that source of energy-resources are limited and we should bring basic improvements in our lifestyle and make the environment energy efficient. Commission can play an important role in determining the criteria for efficiency in the power sector and Demand Side Management (DSM), he added. 

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address in Hindi:

""उत्तर प्रदेश की विकास यात्रा के इस महत्वपूर्ण प्रतीक विद्युत नियामक आयोग ने नए भवन के लोकार्पण  करने के लिए मुझे आपके बीच आने पर अत्यंत हर्ष का अनुभव हो रहा है। मुझे आमंत्रित करने के लिए आपको हार्दिक धन्यवाद देता हूँ।

राज्य सभा के सभापति के रूप में मुझे विशेष हर्ष है कि राज्य सभा के वर्तमान महासचिव श्री देश दीपक वर्मा जी ने, इस आयोग के अध्यक्ष के रूप में जिस एनर्जी एफिशिएंट भवन की परिकल्पना की थी व उसे मूर्त स्वरूप दिया था, उसे प्रदेश की जनता को अर्पित करने का सौभाग्य मुझे मिला है। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि विद्युत नियामक आयोग के अध्यक्ष के रूप में उनके अनुभव का लाभ हमें संसद परिसर की ऊर्जा दक्षता बढ़ाने में काम आएगा।

 

मुझे ज्ञात हुआ है कि आज इस महत्वपूर्ण संस्था के जिस नवनिर्मित भवन का लोकार्पण हो रहा है इसकी आधारशिला माननीय राज्यपाल श्री राम नाईक द्वारा 29 सितंबर, 2014 को रखी गई थी। उत्तर प्रदेश राज्य के इस पहले ऊर्जा-दक्ष (Energy Efficient) सरकारी भवन निर्माण में कई अनूठे ऊर्जा-दक्ष उपायों को शामिल किया गया है जैसे कि सामान्य ईटों के स्थान पर Autoclaved Aerated Concreate Blocks का प्रयोग, दीवारों से बेहतर तापावरोधन के लिए XPS System और खिड़कियों पर Double Glazed Unit Glass, पूरी प्रकाश व्यवस्था हेतु LED लाइट, Airconditioning के लिए Variable Refrigerant Volume (VRV) System, विद्युत के किफायती उपयोग के लिए Occupancy Sensors तथा लिफ्ट के संचालन से ऊर्जा उत्पादन हेतु Regenerative Lifts आदि। भवन की ऊर्जा आपूर्ति उसके छत पर लगाये गये 70 KW के सौर ऊर्जा संयंत्र  से होगी। भवन में वर्षा जल संचयन (Rain Water Harvesting) की व्यवस्था भी की गई है। चूंकि यह उत्तर प्रदेश का पहला हरित ऊर्जा भवन है जो ऊर्जा संरक्षण भवन संहिता (Energy Conservation Building Code) का अनुपालन करता है, यू.एस.एड. ने इन प्रयासों को मान्यता प्रदान की है और ऊर्जा दक्षता ब्यूरो, भारत सरकार के माध्यम से 65 लाख रूपये का विशेष अंशदान इस परियोजना हेतु प्रदान किया है। Energy Efficiency के माध्यम से ऊर्जा संरक्षण की दिशा में व बिजली के व्यय में बचत की दिशा में यह भवन अन्य सरकारी और वाणिज्यिक इमारतों के लिए एक मॉडल साबित होगा, ऐसी मेरी आशा है।

मित्रों, यदि कोई एक विचार या खोज, आधुनिकता को परिभाषित कर सकती है तो वह है ''विद्युत''। हमारी आधुनिक अर्थव्यवस्था और जीवनशैली पूरी तरह से बिजली पर निर्भर है। बिजली के बिना आज जीवन की गुणवत्ता सुनिश्चित करना संभव नहीं है।

मित्रों, यह चिंता का विषय रहा है कि आज़ादी के कई दशकों बाद तक भी, देश की बड़ी आबादी को बिजली उपलब्ध नहीं थी। आधुनिक जीवन की इस महत्वपूर्ण आवश्यकता से आबादी का एक बड़ा भाग लंबे समय तक वंचित रहा है। किसी भी देश के विकास का मापदंड उस देश में प्रति व्यक्ति ऊर्जा की खपत भी होती है। पूरे विश्व मे ऊर्जा की खपत का औसत 2600 यूनिट प्रतिवर्ष प्रति व्यक्ति है, वहीं भारत में यह खपत मात्र 880 यूनिट है जो विश्व के औसत का लगभग एक तिहाई है। मैं समझता हूँ कि देश के विकास के लिए विद्युत का देश की आबादी के हर भाग तक पहुँचना बहुत आवश्यक है।

मुझे संतोष है कि इस दिशा में व 100% ग्रामीण विद्युतीकरण हेतु महत्वपूर्ण प्रयास शुरु हो चुके है। 100% ग्रामीण विद्युतीकरण का जो लक्ष्य 2009 तक पूर्ण हो जाना चाहिए था, वह अंतत: 29 अप्रैल, 2018  को पूर्ण हुआ। आज हम देश में 100% गाँवों का विद्युतिकरण कर चुके हैं। नि:संदेह यह एक बड़ी उपलब्धि है। World Bank  की रिपोर्ट में भारत के तीव्र विद्युतीकरण अभियान की सराहना की गयी है। इस रिपोर्ट के अनुसार 85% घरों में बिजली पहुँचाई जा चुकी है। सरकार का प्रयास है कि दिसंबर 2018 तक देश के हर घर तक बिजली पहुँचे। भारत सरकार 2022 तक सभी को '24X7 Power for All' लक्ष्य पर समर्पित रूप से काम कर रही है।

पूर्व में उत्तर प्रदेश जैसे बड़े राज्यों में विद्युतीकरण की स्थिति संतोषजनक नहीं रही है। मुझे संतोष है कि अक्तूबर 2017 के बाद विद्युतीकरण के अभियान में प्रदेश में बहुत तेजी आयी है। पहले जहाँ  प्रतिमाह 10 हजार से भी कम घरों को विद्युत कनेक्शन दिया जाता था, वह अब प्रति माह 5 लाख से ऊपर  पहुँच गया है। आप इस वर्ष  3.81 लाख घरों तक बिजली पहुँचाने का जो भागीरथ प्रयास कर रहे हैं -- उसमें सफल हों, यह मेरी शुभकामना है। आप प्रदेश के अनुसूचित जाति/जनजाति बहुल 6 लाख गावों में पूर्ण विद्युतीकरण करने का भी प्रयास कर रहे हैं।

मुझे ज्ञात हुआ है कि राज्य सरकार ने भी केंद्र के साथ '24X7 Power For All' संबंधित समझौता किया है।इसके लिए मैं प्रदेश के उद्यमी मुख्य मंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ जी को बधाई देता हूँ।

आपके प्रयासों में चुनौतियाँ भी हैं। यह चुनौती मात्र आपूर्ति की नही है वरन् ट्रांसमिशन व डिस्ट्रीब्यूशन की भी है।  बिजली की आपूर्ति अबाधित और निरंतर रहे, इसे भी सुनिश्चित करना होगा। साथ ही, आपूर्ति की जाने वाली बिजली में वोल्टेज fluctuation नहीं होना चाहिए। मुझे विश्वास है कि प्रदेश सरकार विद्युतीकरण के रास्ते में आनेवाली चुनौतियों के प्रति सजग है। और इस दिशा में पर्याप्त बजटीय संसाधन और नीतिगत निर्णय लिए गए हैं। आपके प्रयास सफल हों, मेरी शुभकामना है।

मित्रो, हमें यह भी ध्यान रखना होगा कि विद्युत अक्षय संसाधन नहीं है। विद्युत क्षेत्र का अपना एक अर्थतंत्र है। विद्युत क्षेत्र का एक वित्तीय आयाम भी है जिसे बहुत समय तक नजरअंदाज नहीं किया जा सकता। अगर हर घर तक बिजली पहुँचानी है तो उसे इतना सस्ता भी बनाना होगा जिससे न तो उपभोक्ता पर अतिरिक्त भार पड़े और साथ ही बिजली उत्पादक तथा वितरक कंपनी की आवश्यक लागत भी वसूल हो जाए।

प्रदेश के लोगों को सस्ती और निर्बाध विद्युत उपलब्ध कराने, उपभोक्ताओं के हितों का संरक्षण करने के साथ विद्युत क्षेत्र की दक्षता तथा इसके अर्थतंत्र में स्थायित्व एवं पारदर्शी प्रामाणिकता लाने में विद्युत नियामक आयोग एक महत्वपूर्ण संस्था है। मुझे हर्ष है कि उत्तर प्रदेश विद्युत नियामक आयोग ने इस दिशा में पिछले कुछ वर्षों में एक महत्वपूर्ण रोल निभाया है। मुझे बताया गया है कि roof top solar lighting में नेट मीटरिंग व Minigrid/Microgrid रेगूलेशन बनाने वाला यह भारत का पहला आयोग रहा है।

मित्रों, ऊर्जा के क्षेत्र में अभी तक हम सिर्फ ऊर्जा आपूर्ति पर ही बल दे रहे हैं जैसे उत्पादन और वितरण। अब समय की आवश्यकता है कि हम बिजली की मांग को भी संयमित (Regulate) करने पर विचार करें। ऊर्जा के स्रोत-संसाधन सीमित हैं। अत: हम अपनी जीवनशैली में मूलभूत सुधार लायें और परिवेश को ऊर्जा दक्ष (Energy Efficient) बनाएं। विद्युत क्षेत्र में दक्षता के मानदंड तय करने में व Demand Side Management (DSM) में यह आयोग महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभा सकता है।

भारत सरकार ने 2022 तक '24X7 Power for All' तथा सबको घर उपलब्ध कराने का जो लक्ष्य रखा है, उस लक्ष्य के आधार पर 2030 तक बिजली की कुल मांग का लगभग 37% घरेलू उपभोक्ता द्वारा प्रयोग किया जायेगा। अत: आवश्यक है कि आवासीय इमारतों को भी ऊर्जा-दक्ष बनाने के लिए दिशानिर्देश विकसित किए जायें और इन्हें लागू करने के लिए एक निगरानी प्रणाली (compliance system) बनायी जाय। इसके साथ ही, बिजली के उपकरण बनाने वाली कंपनियाँ, भी ऊर्जा-दक्षता के मानदंडों को अपनाने में सजग रहें।

मित्रों, जैसा कि आपको मालूम है कि ऊर्जा-दक्षता  'स्मार्ट सिटी' परियोजना में भी अंतर्निहित है। 'स्मार्ट सिटी' परियोजना के तहत, Green Building निर्माण तकनीक, भवन निर्माण सामग्री तथा उपकरणों को महत्व दिया गया है। ऊर्जा-दक्षता की दिशा में अन्य देशों द्वारा अपनाई जा रही Best Practices का अध्ययन कर, इस क्षेत्र के सभी Stakeholders से व्यापक विचार-विमर्श करके, ऊर्जा-दक्षता के मानदंडों  को उत्तरोत्तर विकसित किया जा रहा है। यह भवन इसका एक उदाहरण है।

लंबे समय तक बिजली पर Cross- Subsidy देने के बजाय ऊर्जा-दक्ष उपकरणों पर subsidy देना बेहतर विकल्प है। बिजली की निर्बाध और सस्ती आपूर्ति कृषि और कृषकों के हित में अत्यन्त महत्वपूर्ण है। हर सरकार को इस दिशा में अथक प्रयास जारी रखने चाहिएं।

आज उत्तर प्रदेश विद्युत नियामक आयोग के इस   ऊर्जा-दक्ष भवन का लोकार्पण करते हुए, मैं अपेक्षा करूंगा कि उत्तरोत्तर सरकारी भवनों और वाणिज्यिक इमारतों को ऊर्जा-दक्ष मानकों के अनुसार बनाया जाय। संभव है कि प्रारंभ में लागत अधिक हो परंतु आप पायेंगे कि दीर्घकालीन लागत कम होगी। इससे Carbon Footprint को भी सीमित किया जा सकता है।

मैं यह भी अपेक्षा करूंगा कि ऊर्जा के पांरपरिक स्रोतों के अलावा वैकल्पिक ऊर्जा के स्रोतों को भी विकसित किया जाए। मुझे ज्ञात हुआ है कि उत्तर प्रदेश विद्युत नियामक आयोग ने इस विषय में कई रेगुलेशन जारी किए हैं। आवश्यकता इस बात कि है कि उनका अनुपालन करते हुए ज्यादा से ज्यादा लोगों को ऊर्जा संरक्षण एवं सौर ऊर्जा को अपनाने के लिए प्रेरित किया जाए।

राज्य सरकार और विद्युत नियामक आयोग को इस नयी उपलब्धि के लिए शुभकामनाएं देते हुए, मुझे अपने मध्य आमंत्रित करने के लिए आपको पुन: हार्दिक धन्यवाद देता हूँ। राज्य के सभी नागरिकों को निर्बाध और सस्ती बिजली उपलब्ध  कराने के संकल्प में आप सफल हों, इस शुभेच्छा के साथ मैं अपने वक्तव्य को विराम देता हूँ।

जय हिंद!""

                                Vice President of India Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu today urged the Indian diplomats to ensure ‘effective diplomacy’ in the context of multipolar and fast changing order of international relations to protect national interests. He spoke for about half an hour on ‘’India and the World” when a group of 41 officers of Indian Foreign Service (IFS)  of 2017 batch called on him at his residence.

                Shri Naidu urged the young diplomats who are going to take up assignments in different countries after training “ To be alert and quick on the grasp to properly calibrate India’s position in the multipolar and ever changing world affairs and effectively leverage India’s core civilizational values and ethos and modern strengths of democracy, economic and other capabilities for collective good. Pro-active and effective diplomacy for advancing national interests in the challenging global environment is the need of the hour”.

                Responding to queries from the young diplomats, Shri Naidu acknowledged that for too long, the capacities of and opportunities offered by  India have not been properly articulated in the leading and other centres of the world. He said that over the last four years, concerted efforts were being made to address the perception deficit and present India in right perspective across the world, with Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi himself leading the charge. He said “Prime Minister is the number one Ambassador of India and you should supplement his efforts by amplifying his vision in different parts of the world”.

                Referring to the growing global interest in India, Shri Naidu said “Whatever happens in India these days attracts global interest as we seek to speak for our strengths, our aspirations and the role we can play in furtherance of peace and prosperity for all. You need not be on the defensive. Secularism and peace are in the DNA of our nation. We stand by the principle of One Nation, One Country and One People. Hold your head high and speak for the New India in the making. Project India’s role in today’s world, commensurate with her economic power and it’s ambitions and aspirations within and outside the country”.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that social service promotes integration and helps in cementing bonds between people. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the commemorative postage stamp on the International Association of Lions Clubs, here today. He stressed on the need to promote sanitation and Skills development among the youth.

 

Complementing the International Association of Lions Clubs providing succor to the poor and needy across the world, the Vice President said that the values of humanism, charity, philanthropy, compassion for fellow human beings and all living creatures are more relevant today than at any other time.  

 

The Vice President said that every individual must be alive to the needs of the society and the community he is living in and try to extend a helping hand. Nothing gives greater satisfaction and joy than extending a helping hand to those in distress, he added.

 

The Vice President called on oganisations to supplement the efforts of the governments in eliminating poverty, illiteracy and other social evils like dowry system, gender discrimination and atrocities against women and weaker sections. He further said that nothing gives greater satisfaction and joy than extending a helping hand to those in distress.  Let us become God’s instrument and distribute fortune to the poor and needy he added, quoting the Rig Veda. 

 

The Vice President highlighted the need to promote character education, drug awareness and service learning in a caring, safe, participatory environment to allow students to develop 21st Century life skills and complemented Lions Quest initiative of the club for doing the same.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address: 

 

""It is my proud privilege to be here for the release of a Commemorative Postage Stamp on The International Association of Lions Clubs.

 

The Department of Posts issues Commemorative Postage Stamps on Institutions that have a national or International stature or have made national/international contribution.

 

The International Association of Lions Clubs was founded in 1917 to bring succour to the poor and needy across the world. The organization with its motto ‘’We Serve” truly epitomizes the spirit social service. Here. I would like to recall the words of the Father of The Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, who had said :“What the vast mass of mankind does for self or at best for family, a social servant does for general good”.

 

The saying ‘’serving mankind is like serving God” no doubt sounds clichéd. But the values of humanism, charity, philanthropy, compassion for fellow human beings and all living creatures are more relevant today than at any other time. I commend the yeoman services being rendered by the International Association of Lions Clubs with its band of volunteers across 210 countries in the world,

 

Nothing gives greater satisfaction and joy than extending a helping hand to those in distress. “Let us become God’s instrument and distribute fortune to the poor and needy” says the Rig Veda.  Every individual must be alive to the needs of the society and the community he is living in and try to extend a helping hand. I would like to once again recall the words of  Mahatma Gandhi, who had said: “ The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others”.

 

Sisters and brothers, it should be remembered that social service promotes integration and helps in cementing bonds between people. 

 

There is a need for various social service organisations and socially-conscientious citizens to supplement the efforts of the governments at the Centre and in various States in eliminating poverty, illiteracy and other social evils like dowry system, gender discrimination and atrocities against women and weaker sections. Promoting sanitation and Skills development among the youth are other important activities that need to be promoted by all types of organisations. 

           

I am told that the International Association of Lions Clubs, which is headquartered at Chicago, USA is serving through 46,000 clubs in 210 countries. In the last 100 years, the strength of its volunteer members has grown to over 1.4 million.      I am happy to note that the organization celebrated its Centennial in 2017 and,  as a special Centennial Service Challenge, Lions Clubs International (LCI) has undertaken to serve 100 million people worldwide-- 25 million each in the four key areas of Sight, Environment, Youth and Hunger.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

I am aware that prevention and eradication of blindness has been a signature activity of the Lions worldwide. I am told that Lions Clubs International Foundation (LCIF) – the charitable arm of LCI-- has awarded more than USD 901 million as grants worldwide – for restoring sight, supporting youth, disaster relief and other humanitarian issues.

           

The Lions movement came to India in 1956, with the formation of the first two clubs at Mumbai & Delhi. The movement has enjoyed steady growth over the years and today, in just 60 years, India constitutes the second largest body of Lions in the world, with nearly 25,0000 members serving through 6400 clubs in every nook and corner of the country.

 

I am happy to note that Lions in the next three years will screen 25 lakh patients for vision disorders, perform nearly 100,000 cataract surgeries and treat over 20,000 people for other sight conditions.

 

I am glad that through its Lions Quest initiative has taken up a comprehensive youth development program for social and emotional learning. It seeks to promote character education, drug awareness and service learning in a caring, safe, participatory environment and allows students to develop 21st Century life skills. 

 

There is virtually no sphere of social service left untouched by this organization and the multifarious service activities being conducted pan India benefit lakhs of poor and needy people. Hospitals and medical Centres, schools, orphanages, institutions for the specially challenged, old age homes, blood banks and dialysis centres are being run by the Lions Clubs.

 

I am also happy to note that Lions Clubs International was recently chosen as one of the Brand Ambassadors for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan of the Government of India.

 

The Centennial Slogan- “WHERE THERE’S A NEED, THERE’S A LION” aptly summarizes the culture, work and social contribution of this organization.

 

It gives me immense pleasure to release a Commemorative Postage Stamp on “The International Association of Lions Clubs”.

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that education must aim at holistic development of an individual by imbuing the right qualities of head and heart. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Academic & Seminar Complex and laying the foundation stone for Students and Research Scholars’ Hostel at Mizoram University, in Aizawl, Mizoram today. The Governor of Mizoram, Lt. Gen. (Retd.) Nirbhay Sharma, the Finance Minister of Mizoram, Shri. Pu Lalsawta and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that better infrastructure creates better conditions for quality learning to take place. He further said that it is a necessary catalyst for improving the quality in any educational institution. This campus with its infrastructure and lively environment will be a congenial place for youngsters to pursue academic ambitions and realize their dreams, he added.

The Vice President said that education must prepare the students of today to take on the challenges of tomorrow. It must not only equip them with the latest knowledge but also impart the required skill sets to enable them to be successful in their chosen fields, he added.

The Vice President advised the students also to consider becoming entrepreneurs, job givers and not merely job seekers. He further said that they have a number of alternative career paths and choose the one that they feel passionate about and work to build up their skill set accordingly. Education is for enhancement of our competence, for empowerment, for enlightenment and for employment and enhancing our employability, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am indeed extremely pleased to join you all at the inauguration of the Academic and Seminar Complex and laying of the foundation stone for Students and Research Scholars’ Hostel in this beautiful campus of Mizoram University.

Better infrastructure creates better conditions for quality learning to take place. It is a necessary catalyst for improving the quality in any educational institution. I am, therefore, pleased that these new buildings are being inaugurated and for another set of buildings, foundation has been laid. 

Mizoram University, I am hopeful, will make use of these facilities and emerge as one of the leading institutions in the country. 

I strongly believe that it will become an important centre of education and research not only for the students of Mizoram, but for all those living in the North East India.  This campus with its infrastructure and lively environment will be a congenial place for youngsters to pursue academic ambitions and realize their dreams. 

I am pleased to see that the University has made tremendous efforts in promoting academics in the fields of Science, Arts, Commerce, and Engineering. 

I am aware that Mizoram University with two campuses is striving hard to provide quality education to the people of Mizoram with 32 affiliated colleges in the state of Mizoram. I am told that Mizoram University was ranked 81th under the ‘University Ranking’ by NIRF, MHRD.. There is lot of scope for improvement and I am sure the University’s ranking will improve in the coming   years. 

I am happy to note that Mizoram University, located amid scenic hills, is home to regenerating tropical wet evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, including a protected forested water catchment reserve in the north and a small biodiversity park. You are truly blessed to have such wonderful natural surroundings.

I am also happy to note that major energy needs of the campus are met through solar power.

Sisters and Brothers, 

Education must prepare the students of today to take on the challenges of tomorrow. It must not only equip them with the latest knowledge but also impart the required skill sets to enable them to be successful in their chosen fields. Education must aim at holistic development of an individual by imbuing the right qualities of head and heart. 

Education is for enhancement of our competence, for empowerment, for enlightenment and for employment and enhancing our employability.

Education must lay the foundation for a strong character with uncompromising integrity, ethical values and inclusive outlook. It is imperative for today’s youngsters to be the torchbearers of a New India that will take its rightful place in the comity of nations. 

The biggest strength of our country is the human resource capital—today about 65 per cent of the population is below the age of 35 years. We need to fully tap this human resource potential to make India a leading economic power in the world. For that to happen, institutions like Mizoram University must play a pivotal role and reorient their syllabi as also the teaching methods.

Dear students, 

India has made rapid strides in various fields since attaining Independence. Yet the country is still grappling with problems like poverty, illiteracy, atrocities on women and weaker sections, religious fundamentalism and terrorism. We have to collectively strive to eradicate various problems hampering the progress of the country.  

Students are the future citizens of the country.  In this globalized, highly competitive era, possessing a graduation or post-graduation degree is not enough and one needs to undergo job-oriented training. The universities in collaboration with the industries must initiate training programmes that are in tune with the demands of the market. On its part, the government has launched a massive Skill India programme to provide employment avenues to lakhs of youth across India. 

As a matter of fact, the employers are facing difficulty in finding recruits with requisite competencies. Hence, skills training helps develop job-related competencies to enable the candidates excel in their career.  The students must utilize various opportunities provided by the Government of India particularly for improvement of skills, through various skill development courses. Depending on the type of career or profession you choose, specific skills and abilities have to be acquired, apart from possessing a sound knowledge required for the job.

Dear Students,

You should also consider becoming entrepreneurs, job givers and not merely job seekers. You have a number of alternative career paths. Choose the one that you feel passionate about and work to build up your skillset accordingly.

Sisters and brothers,

I am glad that this University is focusing on research and there are quite a few researchers in the audience today. Research and teaching are two main functions of any University. It is important that we must improve the quality of both these. We should  focus on relevant research so that we find practical solutions to contemporary problems.

I am very happy to note that Mizoram University has introduced several MOOC courses, job oriented certificate and diploma courses, and skill development courses for training of students.   

Sisters and brothers,

As the country’s economy moves on to a higher trajectory, more and more opportunities will open up for the youth. In fact, a news report recently stated that a study by a global executive search firm had forecast that India will be the only major economy with potential for talent surplus by 2030.

With the Union Government’s Look East and Act East policy, a lot many opportunities will most likely open up. Please try to keep yourself aware of emerging opportunities and seize them- first to enhance your knowledge and later to access career opportunities.

My suggestion to all of you is not to tread on beaten paths. Be creative, innovative and explore unchartered territories for making a mark in your career. Finally, I would like to recall the advice given by former President A P J Abdul Kalam—dream big and work hard to achieve your goals. There is no substitute to hard word, dedication and perseverance. Remember that there are no short cuts either to success.  

In fact, Dr. Kalam and Prime Minister, Shri Narendrabhai Modi are the best examples of how an ordinary citizen through hard work and dedication can rise to occupy the highest positions in the country. Both of them coming from very humble backgrounds are a source of inspiration to all Indians.

Dear students, our country has a rich civilizational history and culture, which has survived through the ages. It is important for all you to remain connected with our culture, traditions, heritage, customs and ethos, irrespective of time and place. With the campus located in such exquisite natural surroundings, I am sure all of you are aware of the importance to co-exist with the nature. Live with nature and promote culture for a better future. 

I hope that the Mizoram University will emphasize these aspects and achieve the objectives of the University by imparting quality education and training to students. 

My best wishes to students, scholars, faculty and employees of the University for a great future ahead.

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that enhanced focus on connectivity along with greater economic integration of our North East with ASEAN is crucial for the long-term progress, stability and better quality of life for all in the Northeastern region. He was addressing the Convocation of Tripura University, in Agartala, Tripura today. The Governor of Tripura, Prof. Tathagata Roy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that  the North-Eastern region is endowed with abundant natural resources, but difficult terrain, dispersed habitations, poor connectivity and inadequate infrastructure have been obstacles in realizing its true potential. The Union Government is keen to facilitate border trade between our North Eastern States and our neighbouring countries by setting up more border trade points and border haats, he added. 

Highlighting the investment potential of resource rich Northeastern states, the Vice President called on Union and State Governments to work hand-in-hand. 

Stressing on the need to improve Connectivity to bring North East region into the mainstream, the Vice President said that such a move would promote tourism, business and people-to-people contact. Corridors of connectivity should be converted into corridors of economic growth, he added. 

The Vice President called on all Northeastern states to  work on Joint Ventures and collaborate in areas of core competence such as horticulture, floriculture, traditional medicine, etc with  ASEAN countries. It will open up new opportunities of employment and self employment to the youth of this region, he added. 

The Vice President said that education must bring out the best in each one of us. He further said that one must ensure that education system inculcates the strongest ethical and moral values and fosters the spirit of excellence. Education must also promote inclusive outlook, tolerance and compassion, he added. 

Reminding the students about Mahatma Gandhiji's views on education, the Vice President said that  Literacy is not the end of education not even the beginning. It is one of the means whereby man and women can be educated. Literacy in itself is no education, he added.

“An education which does not teach us to discriminate between good and bad, to assimilate the one and eschew the other, is a misnomer”, he said, quoting Mahatma Gandhi. 

The Vice President asked the graduating students to shape a system that will respond to the learning needs of the young population. He further said that we shouldn’t settle for anything but the best and you must seize these new found opportunities for growth and development. You must think and act innovatively and creatively to make a mark in life and never hesitate to take risks and explore unchartered territories, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am indeed delighted to deliver the 11th Convocation address of Tripura University. It is not only a landmark event for the students, who are passing out from the portals of this institution, but is an equally important occasion for the faculty, who have taught and  guided the young minds to face future challenges of a new world.

I am glad that this institution set up on 2 October, 1987 has given itself the motto “pursuit of excellence” and over the years has been making rapid strides to achieve higher benchmarks.

The quest for excellence is a constant, perennial quest. It is an effort that gives hope and optimism. It is an exciting journey that makes each new day a novel, rejuvenating experience. 

Imagination and innovation are at the heart of this relentless journey. It is an educational process that focuses on continuous learning and accessing knowledge from all over the globe.

It is fallacious to think that a person’s education is complete or ends with the acquisition of graduation or post-graduation certificates.

Dear students, 

Your University was established on the birth anniversary of the father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhiji who had defined education in the following words:

“By education I mean an all-round drawing out of the best in child and man—body, mind and spirit. Literacy is not the end of education not even the beginning. It is one of the means whereby man and women can be educated. Literacy in itself is no education”. 

As Gandhiji had envisaged, education must bring out the best in each one of us. It is time for us to pause for a second and ask whether it is happening. It is time for us to do serious introspection. At a time when we are seeing all-round dilution of education standards and values, we have to ensure that education system inculcates the strongest ethical and moral values and fosters the spirit of excellence. Education must also promote inclusive outlook, tolerance and compassion. Gandhiji had also said: “An education which does not teach us to discriminate between good and bad, to assimilate the one and eschew the other, is a misnomer”.

The quest for excellence you have inscribed as a motto finds an echo not only in the writings of Gandhiji but also in the thought of another great Indian thinker, Swami Vivekananda, who had said: “Education is the manifestation of the perfection already existing in man”. Education is meant to empower the individual through enlightenment and knowledge, smoothen the rough edges and develop the person into a better and holistic human being. 

Dear students, today is a momentous occasion for all you as it heralds a new beginning. As you step out of the portals of this institution in pursuit of further studies or employment, everything may not pan out as planned and you might face unexpected difficulties or obstacles. One should not get despondent or crestfallen by temporary setbacks and must pursue one’s goals with dedication and passion.  Aim high and dream big as the former President A P J Abdul Kalam always used to exhort.

In fact, the late President has proved to all of us that one can reach the highest position in the country through hard work, dedication, honesty and perseverance, irrespective of humble beginnings. This is true also of our Prime Minister, Shri Narendrabhai Modi.

Sisters and brothers,

As Nelson Mandela had said “education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world”.  Education is the instrument of transformation for building a knowledge-based society of conscientious citizens. 

I am delighted to note that your state has one of the highest literacy rates in the country. You must now move on to make good quality elementary education and higher education opportunities available to all. You must shape a system that will respond to the learning needs of the young population. We shouldn’t settle for anything but the best.

Sisters and brothers, 

India has emerged as the fastest growing large economy after averaging an 8.3 per cent growth between 2003 and 2011. It is projected to touch 9 per cent by 2022 as a result of various reforms like demonetization and introduction of GST. The biggest challenge is to tap the huge human resource potential as about 65 per cent of the population is below 35 years of age.

With the economy expected to perform well, it will open many new avenues for the youth in the country. What is needed now is to achieve synergies of action. Various educational institutions and universities must tie-up with the local industries to impart vocational skills in different trades to students. Such collaborations will not only help the universities to update their curricula in tune with the demands of the industry but also enable the students to secure employment or become entrepreneurs.

You would be happy to note the Government is not only looking eastward but is also taking the necessary steps to have an undivided focus on connectivity-physical and digital. There is a distinct opportunity for greater economic integration of the north east region with the country’s eastern neighborhood. Consequently, there is likely to be a number of new opportunities that would emerge in the near future.

 Dear students, you must seize these new found opportunities for growth and development. You must think and act innovatively and creatively to make a mark in life. Never hesitate to take risks and explore unchartered territories. As Swami Vivekananda had said, “Take risks in your life. If you win, you can lead, if you lose, you can guide”. Always adopt a positive attitude without worrying about the future and become the directors of your destiny.

Sisters and brothers,

You and I are living in a world that is fast changing. The way we live, the way we work and the way we learn are all changing. 

Technological changes have democratized education.

Geography is no longer a barrier. 

Even if you are in an isolated part of India, you can access the latest information and take courses from leading Universities in the world.  

Let us make use of all the opportunities that come our way. Let us create new pathways where none exist today with an attitude that our ancient sages had approached life years ago. Let us say and actually keep welcoming noble thoughts from all over the world. 

However, let us also remember the great heritage we have and build on all that is good in it.

As the father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi had said: “I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any”.

I congratulate all our dear students and research scholars who have well deserved the emblems of an institutional recognition of success on this auspicious day. At the same time, I congratulate all the parents and teachers assembled here, without whose dedicated caring attitude, these promising faces, our future nation-builders, would not have been able to achieve what they have done.

My dear students, you are the future architects of our great nation. These are exciting times when India is rising up in all spheres of human endeavor. There are innumerable opportunities waiting to be discovered. Remember that in this interconnected world, there are no boundaries for knowledge acquisition. There are no limitations of applying this knowledge to spur your own growth and the development of the country.  

As I wrap up my speech on this auspicious occasion of the 11th Convocation of Tripura University, I appeal to you all to keep up the innovative spirit, the spirit that makes us dream, and the spirit that makes us strive to achieve our dreams. As Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had said, we should move towards that kind of a new India where “tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection”.

I congratulate all of you once again for all the success you have achieved till now and hope that the years to come will be even brighter.  

 

JAI HIND!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that there is an immense investment potential in the Northeastern region and ASEAN countries should not be allowed to miss that opportunity. He was addressing the 2nd Convocation of National Institute of Technology, in Dimapur, Nagaland today. The Governor of Nagaland, Shri Padmanabha Acharya and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that Nagaland, a state, rich in its traditional heritage is growing fast and setting up of NIT is an indication of the growing importance of this region. The real strength of any academic institute lies in maintaining high standards of excellence through its teaching and top quality research, he added. 

The Vice President said that North-Eastern region is endowed with abundant natural resources, but difficult terrain, dispersed habitations, poor connectivity and inadequate infrastructure have been obstacles in realizing its true potential. He further said that improving connectivity is most important to bring the North East region into the mainstream and air connectivity is also vital for promoting tourism, business and people-to-people contact. We strongly believe that the corridors of connectivity should be converted into corridors of economic growth with a symbiotic market model of development, he added.

The Vice President quoted as stated by Nelson Mandela, former President of South Africa: ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world"". 

The Vice President said that the knowledge and technical skills acquired by the students will form the main pillars of their professional career. But the life skills acquired by them and the values of ethics, morality, integrity and compassion are equally important in navigating through the challenges and contributing to building an inclusive New India, he added.

The Vice President advised the students to remember that their education does not end with the acquisition of a degree or by securing employment. He further said that learning is a life-long process and education is meant to enlighten them, develop them into a holistic individual, strengthen their character and inculcate the qualities required to face any challenging situation with a sense of equanimity. Their character is formed by the manner in which they surmount the challenges and they will experience highs and lows of life, but never lose sight of the goals they set for themselves, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I deem it a matter of privilege and honor to inaugurate the First Convocation of the newly established National Institute of Technology in Nagaland. It is indeed a major milestone in the history of technical education in Nagaland. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the entire NIT family for inviting me as the Chief Guest for the First Convocation.

I am very pleased to be here to join you in celebrating this wonderful occasion. 

Nagaland, a state, rich in its traditional heritage is growing fast. The setting up of NIT is an indication of the growing importance of this region.

Apart from NIT, I am glad that an Institute of Communication & Information Technology (ICIT) was established by the Government of India at Mokokchung with the assistance of World Bank. I am told that ICIT is also offering skill development courses and organizes Technology Transfer Programmes for the Rural Community. The institute must constantly upgrade the skills of the youth by offering new courses in tune with the demands of the local industries. I am told that the School of Engineering and Technology started by Nagaland University, is offering degree level programmes in Engineering including Management.

I admire the natural beauty of NIT's location and I am sure that this will become one of the leading centres of technical education in the country.Admittedly, it is doing appreciably well in catering to educational needs of students in Nagaland and the neighboring states.

I foresee that NIT Nagaland, being a technical Institute of national importance, will play a significant role in filling the industrial gap in Nagaland, by bringing industries, the corporate sector and technocrats from other parts of our country to Nagaland for its societal growth and uplift. I am sure, the students passing out from the portals of NIT will not only be well qualified engineers, but many of them will also become successful entrepreneurs in their chosen fields.

Students from this State and other North-Eastern states should take full advantage of this institute in acquiring world class technical education.

I am pleased to know of the efforts of this institute in reserving home state quota completely for the Naga students. I wish NIT Nagaland to grow and succeed in all its efforts and reach the greatest heights. 

The real strength of any academic institute lies in maintaining high standards of excellence through its teaching and top quality research. This can be achieved only through dedication, discipline and determination of the faculty and students. There should not be any compromise on quality of teaching and research.

I would like to extend my congratulations to all the graduates on the completion of your education here. You all should be proud of your accomplishments. Seeing all of you today, looking lively and energetic, I wish to remind you that this is a big moment in your lives. I know that   you all must be excited and eager to enter into a new world. 

The knowledge and technical skills acquired by you will form the main pillars of your professional career. But the life skills acquired by you and the values of ethics, morality, integrity and compassion are equally important in navigating through the challenges and contributing to building an inclusive New India.

Sisters and brothers, the country is on the threshold of emerging as one of the leading economies in the world in the coming years. The country’s economy is projected to grow at 7.3 per cent or 7.4 per cent in 2019 by different global agencies. With 65 per cent of the people below the age of 35 years, the country needs to tap and convert this huge human resource capital into a demographic dividend and spur the economic growth.

In fact, a recent news report mentioned that a study by a global executive search firm forecast a talent deficit of 85 million workers by 2030 across developing and developed economies. It said that India was the only major economy with potential for talent surplus by 2030 and might even challenge America’s position in technology, media and telecommunications sector. So dear students, you will have plenty of opportunities as the country’s economy garners further momentum in the coming years.         

I am sure that all of you will make the best use of your skills and talents to serve the society and the country. As stated by Nelson Mandela, former President of South Africa, ""education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world"". Be the change agents for ushering in a better future for every citizen of the country.

Dear students, remember that your education does not end with the acquisition of a degree or by securing employment. Learning is a life-long process. Education is meant to enlighten you, develop you into a holistic individual, strengthen your character and inculcate the qualities required to face any challenging situation with a sense of equanimity. 

You are going to commence a new chapter. First and foremost requirement is to set clear-cut goals. Second is to strive relentlessly to achieve those goals. Anything can be achieved through hard work, perseverance and by adopting the right attitude. Your character is formed by the manner in which you surmount the challenges. You will experience highs and lows of life, but never lose sight of the goals you set for yourselves.

Success largely depends largely upon the ability to execute efficiently any task on hand. 

Graduation day is a bit like looking into a kaleidoscope. It is full of pictures jumbled together—images from the past and those envisioning the future.

You are now armed with one of the most important tools needed to forge your path ahead. It is not the degree itself that counts — it is about what you have learnt along the way and what you intend to do with the education you have received in your journey till today. Be true to yourself and remain committed to the values of honesty and integrity.  

Today you have achieved a milestone in your career. Remember that it was made possible by the wonderful support of your families and the encouragement of your teachers. I would like you all to acknowledge and appreciate the support of all those who made it happen. 

North-Eastern region is endowed with abundant natural resources, but difficult terrain, dispersed habitations, poor connectivity and inadequate infrastructure have been obstacles in realizing its true potential. There is an immense investment potential in the Northeastern region and ASEAN countries should not be allowed to miss that opportunity. In this, the Central and State Governments will have to work hand-in-hand. Improving Connectivity is most important to bring the North East region into the mainstream. Air connectivity is also vital for promoting tourism, business and people-to-people contact.

We strongly believe that the corridors of connectivity should be converted into corridors of economic growth with a symbiotic market model of development.

Finally, I would like to congratulate you all on your success and wish an extremely satisfying and successful career to each one of you. 

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Southern parts of the country are prone to multiple disaster challenges -  hence require the NIDM Centre to help these states build infrastructure to tackle disasters. He was addressing the gathering after laying foundation stone for National Institute of Disaster Management, in Kondapavuluru, Andhra Pradesh today. The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju, the Minister for Law & Justice, Andhra Pradesh, Shri Kollu Ravindra and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that India needs a disaster resilient infrastructure and provide life-line services to the most vulnerable communities. He further said that events of natural disasters are on the rise, and India is the most affected region. We have witnessed wide spread natural calamities in the past ranging from floods to earthquakes, landslides and cyclones like super cyclone of 1999, Gujarat earth quake 2001, South Indian Tsunami in 2004, Mumbai Flood 2005, Kashmir earthquake of 2005, Kosi flood in 2008, Sikkim earthquake of 2011, Phailin and Hud Hud in 2013 and 2014, he added.

The Vice President said that nearly 59% of India’s land area is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity. Over 40 million hectares (12% of land), is prone to floods, about 5700 kms coast line is cyclone prone and exposed to tsunamis and storm surges, 2% of land is landslide prone, and 68% of India’s arable land is affected by droughts, he added.

The Vice President said that flooding in the cities and the towns is a recent phenomenon caused by indiscriminate encroachment of water ways, inadequate drainage system and lack of maintenance of the drainage infrastructure. He further said that these disasters do not only disrupt people’s lives and directly affect the disaster-hit areas, but they also jeopardize the entire society and economy of the country. In fact, one single disaster can overwhelm the GNP of the country, he added.

The Vice President said that since 90 percent of the disaster-affected populations are in Asia, it is indeed important for the population to be informed of potential disaster threats. He further said that they should also be equipped with sufficient knowledge and skills to protect their lives and properties. Though we have been actively pursuing a paradigm shift in disaster management from a relief centric approach in the past to a holistic one, that encompasses preparedness, prevention, mitigation and risk reduction much needs to be done in the context of resilient infrastructure and life-line services to the most vulnerable communities, he added.

The Vice President said that as Disaster Management approach is a multi-disciplinary process, the Ministry of Home Affairs has been mandated to play role of coordination as the Administrative Ministry.  He further said that the success of early warning and preparedness was demonstrated during the recent cyclones ‘Phailin’ ‘Hudhud’ in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh respectively. Warning messages, including coordinates of the impending cyclone’s location and intensity, were communicated prior to the landfall, he added.

The Vice President said that India is a party to the Sendai framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-30), which has now  provided us a more practical and useful document with people-centered preventive approach to disaster risk. This would contribute to the reduction of disaster risks and strengthen resilience of the poor and the most vulnerable, e added.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we must not neglect classical Indian art forms. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the revival ceremony of ancient Dance Drama “Ashtapadiyattam” which is “Gita Govindam” written by 12th century poet Jayadeva, in Guruvayur, Kerala today. The Governor of Kerala, Justice (Retd) P. Sathasivam and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that while the country has preserved and nurtured our illustrious artistic heritage, unfortunately, certain classical Indian art forms remain in a state of neglect and slowly fading. We must not allow this unfortunate situation to persist and our cultural roots sustain us, make our lives richer and make our society more humane and civilized, he added.

The Vice President said that reviving “Ashtapadiyattam” is like unearthing the buried treasure and it is like watering a plant that is fast losing its vitality. He hoped that this dance drama is revived in all its pristine glory, as Jayadeva would have wanted it, giving full justice to the costumes, the music and the mudras as used in the original performance, he added.

Calling Gita Govindam a remarkable piece of literature, the Vice President complemented Sri Guruvayurappan Dharmakala Samuchayam Trust headed by Metro Man Shri E. Sreedharan.

The Vice President said that we continue to revive and foster ancient art forms so that we may enrich the quality of our lives and the lives of the people of the world by sharing the infinitely ennobling, harmonizing and blissful universal vision of our country. He further said that Gita Govindam’s unusually wide appeal comes from the story of Sri Krishna and his love for Radha. The story of Sri Krishna has a deep resonance in the Indian hearts and the composition is so lyrical and melodious that it is eminently suitable for various adaptations by musicians and dancers, he added.

The Vice President said that philosophy, spirituality, fine arts and literature are a part of the same quest. The quest for a deeper meaning of life, quest for zest in a routinized mundane existence, and quest for achieving greater creative heights of imaginative expression and artistic creations, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

“I am happy to be with all of you at this event that is dedicated to revival of the much acclaimed “Ashtapadiyattam”- a dance drama based on “Gita Govindam” believed to have been composed by Jayadeva in the 12th century.

Indian thought has been holistic from time immemorial. 

In India performing arts like music and dance as well as the visual arts like painting and sculpture are sublime expressions of a whole range of human emotions we call Nava Rasas. 

Through the creation of a work of art, the artist strives to evoke a state of pure joy or bliss or Ananda. 

This state of “Ananda” refines our inner beings and makes us better human beings, makes us more “cultured”, makes us more of “feeling” individuals. 

What is remarkable about the Indian cultural heritage is its richly interwoven texture. 

Philosophy, spirituality, fine arts and literature are a part of the same quest. The quest for a deeper meaning of life, quest for zest in a routinized mundane existence, and quest for achieving greater creative heights of imaginative expression and artistic creations.

Art has traditionally been considered as the best medium for expressing and experiencing devotion. 

Indian fine arts have, therefore, a very strong religious and spiritual base and devotional content. 

Indian sages have conceptualized the  Creator of the Universe as a cosmic dancer, the Nataraja,

“Whose bodily movement is the entire Universe
Whose speech is the language of the Universe
Whose ornaments are the moon and the stars
Him, we worship as the pure , serene, Lord Shiva!”

This is the first stanza that every classical Indian dancer recites and enacts at the beginning of any dance performance.

 

Bharatha Muni’s Natya Shastra, composed around the 2nd century BC,is therefore, often called the Panchama Veda or the fifth Veda equating it with the four Vedas.

Sisters and brothers,

While we have preserved and nurtured our illustrious artistic heritage, there are, unfortunately, certain classical Indian art forms that remain in a state of neglect and are slowly fading.

We must not allow this unfortunate situation to persist.

Our cultural roots sustain us, make our lives richer and make our society more humane and civilized.

When I heard that the “Ashtapadiyattam” a dance drama based on “Gita Govindam” dance  was being revived, I was extremely happy. It is like unearthing the buried treasure. It is like watering a plant that is fast losing its vitality.

This art form, a poignant rendition of the love between Lord Krishna and Radha, written by 12th century poet Jayadeva is a remarkable piece of literature that has been adapted in various parts of our country and integrated into different dance forms like Manipuri, Mohiniattam, Odissi and Kuchipudi. It became an essential element of Sri Chaitanya’s movement in Bengal, inspired Yakshagana dances and became the genesis of an entire genre of music called “Sopana sangeetham” as Jayadeva’s ashtapadis were sung on temple stairs. Very few compositions have united India so effortlessly as this composition.

Although Jayadeva originally composed his ashtapadis in Sanskrit, his work enthralled the length and breadth of our country. He received rare applause from the Bengali population. He came to be considered the founding father and one amongst the pioneers of Bengali literature. With time, the recital of the ashtapadis gained widespread popularity in temples across the country, including the state of Kerala.

Gita Govindam’s unusually wide appeal comes from the story of Sri Krishna and his love for Radha. The story of Sri Krishna has a deep resonance in the Indian hearts. Along with Ramayana, the Bhagavatham and the Mahabharata have become a part of our cultural capital and form the basis for many of our collective national consciousness and shared values.

The composition is so lyrical and melodious that it is eminently suitable for various adaptations by musicians and dancers.

The theme of love and the range of emotions displayed by the two main characters – Sri Krishna and Radha- are very engaging for  a wide variety of diverse audiences. 

It is also worth noting that the composition is also sung in temples by Bhagavathars as a completely devotional composition. 

The mundane love gets transformed into a devotional prayer. 

The love between Sri Krishna and Radha becomes an allegory for the longing of the human beings for a vision of the divine form and spiritual bliss. It becomes a sublimation of the ordinary emotions of two human beings.

Sisters and brothers,

It is no wonder, therefore, that this composition became so popular all over India.

The performance of the Gita Govinda at Puri Jagannath by the Mahatis and later by the Goutipas was significant in the development of Odissi. The dance form was so well revered at the time that the Mahatis who performed the dance were prohibited to perform any other form of dance. It was believed that Lord Jagannath particularly enjoyed renditions and dance performances of the Gita Govinda that He liked to listen to them before sleep. 

The Gita Govindam soon became the central theme of many traditional Indian dance forms. The importance that Jayadeva attributed to the composition of his Gitas is evident from how he has carefully laid down the ragas and thalas for his gitas.

Jayadeva’s Gita Govindam classic encompasses a unique mix of classical literature, classical music and classical dance. 

For these reasons, the Gita Govinda has made significant impacts on the performance arts in India and has spread across India. Although the ‘Ashtapadiyattam’ in its original form is no longer in existence, it can be found in various parts of India in various forms- like Mohiniattamand Kathakaliin Kerala,Bharatanatyam in Tamil Nadu,Kuchipudi in Andhra Pradesh, Manipuri in Manipur and Odissi in Orissa. Each of these regions developed its own way of articulating Jayadeva’s classic in the form of dance. It is hence imperative that this invaluable classic be handed down to posterity.

Sri Guruvayurappan Dharmakala Trust deserves all praise for taking up this mission. With the divine blessings of Lord Krishna who is the embodiment of all the 64 arts in the world as well as the grace of Puri’s Lord Jagannath who heard this classic composition first, we are indeed fortunate to be in the holy precincts of another abode of Lord Krishna in Guruvayur to revive a tradition that was nearly lost.

Sisters and brothers,

It gives me immense pleasure and honour to be amidst the devotees of Lord Guruvayurappan today and witness with each one of you the ‘Ashtapadiyattam’. I am glad to be able to get the blessings of Sri Krishna and Guruvayurappan in this God’s own country where Adi Shankara started his spiritual journey and where immortal hymn of “Narayaneeyam” continues to  lend a healing touch to ailing humanity. 

I hope that this dance drama is revived in all its pristine glory, as Jayadeva would have wanted it, giving full justice to the costumes, the music and the mudras as used in the original performance. 

I hope we continue to revive  and foster ancient art forms so that we may enrich the quality of our lives and the lives of the people of the world by sharing the infinitely ennobling, harmonizing  and blissful  universal vision of our country.

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that along with “gross national income”, we must focus on how science and technology can foster greater “happiness” and better quality of life as well as harmonious inclusive societies. He was addressing the gathering after conferring Adi Shankara Young Scientist Awards 2018 at the Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering & Technology, in Kochi, Kerala today. The Governor of Kerala, Justice (Retd) P. Sathasivam and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

The Vice President said that the Adi Shankara Young Scientist Awards 2018 is an eloquent testimony to the inquisitiveness, ingenuity, and innovative initiative inherent in our young India. He further said that this is what gives us hope and optimism that India will be able to regain its rightful place in the comity of nations. Advancement of human knowledge has occurred in our country because of the “spirit of enquiry”, the ability to question, the ability to research and the ability to arrive at the truth, he added.

 

The Vice President mentioned three qualities to achieve excellence: First is the willingness to learn from each and every person, institution and learning resource we can access; The second is the ability to probe, analyse and synthesize; The third quality is to search for a completely out of the box solution that answers the problem at hand.

 

The Vice President said that Adi Shankara was not only a great philosopher but an extraordinary poet. He expounded the “Advaita” philosophy as per which, human beings can become divine through knowledge and the ultimate goal is to experience the Sat-chit-Ananda, the state of bliss consciousness that emanates from truth and higher consciousness, he added. 

 

The Vice President said that knowledge must lead us to become wise and we must have the wisdom to use the knowledge we acquire for improving our lives. He further said that ultimately, it is the Ananda we are all seeking and this is what we are talking about when we talk of “gross national happiness”. We should draw inspiration from the best in the Indian tradition, remove the deadwood that has also been accumulated over many years and revitalize our country, he added.

 

The Vice President said that we should not be insular but be ever receptive and we should not only be proud of good ideas that we have inherited but also be willing to listen to wise words from others. He further said that we should shun complacency, we should abhor mediocrity, we should set our sights higher and a new India beckons all of us. We should and can make it happen, he added.

 

The Vice President congratulated the Award winners and said that these kind of Awards become a part of our education system where, in each of our millions of classrooms of our country, scientific temper is fostered and creativity is carefully nurtured and therein lies the future of our country.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

 

“I am happy to be here with all of you today at a special event that celebrates the achievements of some exceptionally talented youngsters.

 

I am happy to learn of the Shankara ASIANET NEWS Young Scientists Award, a six-level-mentored evaluation-based competition launched in 2016. I congratulate the winners of this competition and also those who competed in it. 

 

It is indeed very heartening that nearly 300 teams consisting of students from six countries and twelve states in India participated in this competition. I congratulate the top 3 Performing Teams who have won a 10-day trip to NASA and Silicon Valley in the US. 

 

This award is an eloquent testimony to the inquisitiveness, ingenuity, and innovative initiative inherent in our young India. 

 

This is what gives us hope and optimism that India will be able to regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.

 

Nearly two thirds of our country’s population is below the age of 35 years. If the youth of our country can acquire the right mix of knowledge, skills and attitudes required for the 21st century world, the dividends to our country’s growth and development can be enormous. 

 

I have decided to come to this Institute today because you seem to respect the best traditions of the past and are at the same time forward looking and proactive.

 

Indian history is replete with a number of scientists, mathematicians, physicians, chemists, metallurgists, surgeons, astronomers and a number of innovators who have significantly advanced human knowledge. One recalls a number of such illustrious names likeAryabhata, Pingala, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara, Varahamihira, Charaka and Sushrutha.India gave the concept of “zero” and the “binary system” to the world. We knew how to make steel alloys and smelt zinc. Our ancient surgeons could conduct many complicated surgeries including plastic surgery and cataract surgery.

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

Advancement of human knowledge has occurred in our country because of the “spirit of enquiry”, the ability to question, the ability to research and the ability to arrive at the truth. 

 

This requires three qualities.

 

First is the willingness to learn from each and every person, institution and learning resource we can access. That is what the ancient Indian sages had advised us: “Let noble thoughts come to us from all over the globe”.

 

The second is the ability to probe, analyse and synthesize. We should sharpen our skills to analyse, think rationally, logically and be able to segregate fact from fiction. At the same time, we should be able to put different pieces of information together and synthesize diverse facts into a coherent idea. 

 

The third quality is to search for a completely out of the box solution that answers the problem at hand. Innovations enable us to “leap frog”, take the giant leaps rather grow in a linear, sequential mode.

 

I am sure this Institute provides the congenial atmosphere required for inculcating these qualities in the students and there is the facilitative faculty that is willing to go the extra mile to shape young minds and hearts in the best possible manner.

 

Your Institute is named after one of the most brilliant philosophers the world has ever known. Adi Shankara was not only a great philosopher but an extraordinary poet. He expounded the “Advaita” philosophy as per which, human beings can become divine through knowledge and the ultimate goal is to experience the Sat- chit- Ananda, the state of bliss consciousness that emanates from truth and higher consciousness.  

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

That has been the constant message of India. Knowledge must lead us to become wise. We must have the wisdom to use the knowledge we acquire for improving our lives on this planet. 

 

Ultimately, it is the Ananda we are all seeking. This is what we are talking about when we talk of “gross national happiness”. Along with “gross national income”, we must focus on how science and technology can foster greater “happiness” and better quality of life as well as harmonious inclusive societies.

 

I think we should draw inspiration from the best in the Indian tradition, remove the deadwood that has also been accumulated over many years and revitalize our country.

 

We should not be insular but be ever receptive.

 

We should not only be proud of good ideas that we have inherited but also be willing to listen to wise words from others.

 

We should shun complacency. We should abhor mediocrity. We should set our sights higher. A new India beckons all of us. We should and can make it happen. 

 

Let me conclude with a favourite quotation I love to recall very often as to what our father of the nation, Gandhiji had said:

 

“I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any”

 

I once again congratulate the Principal and staff of this institution for conducting this excellent event and giving a big boost to creative energies of our young students. 

 

I fervently hope that these kind of events become a part of our education system where, in each of our millions of classrooms of our country, scientific temper is fostered and creativity is carefully nurtured. Therein lies the future of our country. 

 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has suggested to the Central and various State Governments to increase investments in agriculture and allied sectors to make farming viable and attractive. He was interacting with Scientists, Faculty Members and Research Fellows at the National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management (MANAGE), in Hyderabad today. The Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Mohammad Mahmood Ali and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that there is a need to make agriculture sustainable, viable and attractive by creating required infrastructure, providing timely credit and value addition to farm produce. The central government’s e-NAM project is the way forward for proper marketing, he added.

The Vice President said that providing information to farmers on the demand for their produce in advance was essential to prevent distress sale. He further said that providing affordable and reasonable credit to farmers is also equally important. Loan waiver was not a permanent solution as it would not help in creating long-term sustainable activity, he added.

The Vice President advised the extension officials to create greater awareness among the farming community on the crop insurance scheme. He also said that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) should be leveraged more effectively for the benefit of farmers. He also added that information should be disseminated to the farmers in the local languages.

The Vice President also wanted institutions like MANAGE to educate the farmers on the need to diversify crops to overcome challenges of climate change and sustain their incomes. Stressing the importance of spending time in the fields by the extension officials and researchers, he said it should be made mandatory for agricultural graduates and post graduates to spend time with farmers before completion of their courses.

Pointing to the increasing challenges posed by climate change, the Vice President advised MANAGE to promote climate-smart agriculture. He stressed the need for home-grown food security to create surplus food stocks and meet the requirements of burgeoning population. He also emphasized on the importance of better coordination between various institutions related to agriculture.

The Vice President urged people to live with nature and promote culture for a better future. Earlier the Vice President visited the Knowledge Incubation Center, Urban Greening stalls, Photo Exhibition, interacted with Agriprenuers and the trainees of Input Dealers Course, released a “Handbook on Important Insect Pests and Diseases of Major Crops in India” and also launched Youtube channel of MANAGE.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am extremely happy to participate in today’s interaction with all of you and learn a little more about the excellent work being done by your institution MANAGE. 

It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that this institute is developing the capacity of middle level and senior level extension officers of agriculture and allied departments to act as extension managers and deliver the scientific messages effectively to farmers so that they can increase production and productivity to make their living better from the farm sector.   

I am glad to note that MANAGE as an apex institute in the country has a number of accomplishments. It has fulfilled its role as a technical arm to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare for policy interventions and reforms. 

I have noted that the institute in its early days focused on the concepts like Management in Agricultural Extension System, Farming Systems Approach, Farming Situation Based Extension, Farmer to Farmer Extension and Gender mainstreaming, among others. 

I am happy to know that Institute drafted the guidelines for National Watershed Development program for the Ministry of Rural Development, which brought name and fame to the institute.  It has pioneered in starting Post Graduate Diploma in Management (Agri Business Management) which received an excellent response from leading Indian and multinational Agribusiness companies in placement.  

I am told that this institute also played a key role along with ICAR in the Innovations in Technology Dissemination component of the National Agricultural Technology Project (NATP).  As an implementing agency, it is responsible for providing an extension model “ATMA”– Agricultural Technology Management Management --  for an integrated extension delivery system at the district level which at later stage scaled up to all the 630 districts in the country under the Extension Reforms Scheme. 

I am happy that the institute has implemented Agri-Clinics and Agri- Business Centers Scheme of Government of India to provide extension services to the farmers through technically trained agricultural graduates at the village level. 

If you glance through the extension services in the country-- right from Community Development programme which was started on October 2nd, 1952, Intensive Agriculture Development Program, Command Area Development Program, Intensive Area Development Program and then the Green Revolution—all of them focused on food security and played a major role in the country attaining self-sufficiency in food grain production (1975).  Then, the government introduced the World Bank assisted Training & Visit (T&V) System which focussed on Management Concept in Agricultural Extension System. 

I have always held that agriculture sector needs a great deal of attention because a majority of Indians still rely on agriculture and allied occupations in the rural areas for their livelihood. We have a situation today where despite phenomenal increase in food production (270 million Tonnes), farmers are not able to get adequate returns from their investment. Agriculture remains an unattractive vocation to many families. We must change this situation.

Agrarian distress is mainly due to high costs of inputs, small and tenant farmers, production loss, instability in yields, low prices, climate change, droughts, rainfed cultivation, poor irrigation and debts. I appreciate that MANAGE has done a study on agrarian distress and established that integrating livestock with farming prevents farmers’ suicides.

For agriculture to become sustainable, remunerative and profitable,  I feel that extension should focus on the following:


	Climate change: Climate change is posing increasing challenge to Indian agriculture. It has been estimated that extreme weather events are costing India 1.5 per cent of its GDP annually and is projected to impact agricultural productivity with increasing severity from 2020 to the end of the century. Agricultural extension can play a crucial role in increasing awareness by training knowledge intermediaries at grassroots level. Working with farmers to increase awareness on climate change is crucial to bring about changes in age old practices in order to promote climate-smart agriculture. I am sure MANAGE will play a key role in training knowledge intermediaries on “Extension for Climate Smart Agriculture” and make required technologies accessible.
	Nutritional Security: Since the Green Revolution, agriculture has mostly moved to mono-cropping, which has severely impacted the existence of agro-diversity in the villages. Food habits have also been impacted as a result. Nutrition security is important at grassroots level to increase development index and agricultural extension can effectively integrate nutrition related information to provide wholesome knowledge and develop a knowledge-intensive rural society. MANAGE again can play an important role by conducting research on nutrition security, transferring the evidence based knowledge for policy advocacy and train extension professionals to address nutrition related issues.
	Agri-Startup Ecosystem: Investment in technology is a necessity for agricultural development. Technology start-ups in agriculture have a lot to provide to Indian agriculture in terms of innovation, employment, and income. 
	I am told that MANAGE, with its Knowledge Incubation Centre, has already started investing in agricultural startups that provide a wide range of unique services to the population engaged in agricultural activities – both urban and rural. It will not only benefit the farmers but also build up a startup ecosystem and develop entrepreneurial culture in rural societies.
	Urban Agriculture: With increasing pressure of urban population, pollution, and food security, urban agriculture can be a boon to agricultural development and economically backward communities in urban areas. I am told that MANAGE has already identified few low cost good practices in urban farming. Identifying more across the country and promoting them through extension machinery can change the urban landscape of agriculture.
	Public and Private Extension Services: With increasing stakeholders in agriculture, public extension system needs to play an expanded role too as regulator, negotiator, facilitator, and more. But along with the increased role, public extension system also should integrate issues like environmental awareness, health and nutrition, general awareness of e Governance, among others,  to build up sustainable agricultural communities. MANAGE, with its apex role in agriculture, especially capacity development, can lead the change through its programmes and activities.
	Strengthening Extension Service Institutions: Major extension service institutes in the country are Extension Education Institutes (EEIs), State Agricultural Management and Extension Training Institutes (SAMETIs), Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), and State departments. But there is very little connect between these extension service institutions and national NGOs, private corporates in agriculture, and other stakeholder. I am told that MANAGE, through its different programmes has been acting as a facilitator in bridging the gaps but further initiatives are required as well to increase the interactions and convergence between various stakeholders for shared experience and better initiatives. 
	Market led extension: The ultimate aim for agricultural development is to give better income to the farmers and market forms the most important component for making production remunerative. Proper regulation of markets across the country, dedicated marketing cells in every departments in agricultural sector, monitoring of price fluctuations, and ensuring minimum support prices to farmers are of imminent need. Initiatives like Electronic National Agriculture Market (eNAM) are important steps in the right directions to help the farmers make informed choices.
	New Models of Extension: Around the world, many interesting extension models like 4H Clubs in US, AMUL in India have created major changes in agricultural sector. But the most important element of those models has been their congruency with local needs. Replications in different context can have rather undesirable outcomes. Also, with location specificity and local needs, local level implementations also count as has been the experience of ATMA model in India. For example, the biodiversity and natural resources along with its demographics makes North East India a hot bed of opportunities. But because of those specific factors, the models that work well in rest of India might not be very effective there. Hence, extension models, to be successful, need to be locally relevant and address local needs rather than blindly imitating successful models from elsewhere. Proper policy support based on research evidence may help bring out those models successfully. 


In order to address these key areas, I think that the most critical need is to establish a dialogue with farmers and provide them with knowledge and material resources to increase their incomes. 

I would urge each of you to think further on possible solutions to the challenges in agriculture sector and come up with solutions that will impact the farmers lives positively and increase their incomes.

I wish you all the best in your endeavours.

Jai Kisan! Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Swachh Bharat is a prerequisite for establishing a Swasth Bharat. He was addressing the Convocation of Lady Hardinge Medical College, here today. The Minister of State for Health & Family Welfare, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, the Minister of State for Health & Family Welfare, Smt. Anupriya Patel and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

The Vice President said that the job of faculty members does not end by merely imparting medical knowledge and skills but entails a more onerous responsibility of moulding the young minds into conscientious citizens with uncompromising integrity, high moral and ethical standards. It is said that a person, who plans for a year, sows grains, the one who plans for 10 years, plants fruit-bearing trees, and the one who plans for generations, develops human beings!, he added. 

 

The Vice President said that it is time for all public health experts, healthcare professionals, local bodies and communities to join hands in promoting hygiene and sanitation in a big way to build a Swachh Bharat, a prerequisite for establishing a Swasth Bharat. He further said that lack of adequate medical facilities in the rural areas and the acute shortage of doctors and para-medical personnel across the country is a challenge. We need human resource in the health sector - whether it is a medical college or the paramedical staff, the country needs them in large numbers, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the Doctors are considered next to God in our country and it is the cardinal responsibility of all those entering the medical profession to uphold the trust and confidence of the patients, who seek treatment from them. He advised the Doctors to maintain the highest standards of ethics and integrity at every stage. I am sure that all the students of the Lady Hardinge Medical College will carry on the legacy of this prestigious institute and contribute towards building a healthy India, he added.

 

The Vice President said that in the classical Indian thought the doctors are revered as gods Vaidyo Naarayano Harihi. It is the ability to listen, ability to diagnose the problem and the ability to heal that imparts this divine touch to the noble profession you all are engaged in, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am extremely delighted to be a part of this convocation ceremony of the prestigious Lady Hardinge Medical College, which was established more than 100 years ago. I convey my greetings and best wishes to all the graduates, post graduates, their parents and teachers on this momentous occasion. 

In the classical Indian thought the doctors are revered as gods “Vaidyo Naarayano Harihi ”. It is the ability to listen, ability to diagnose the problem and the ability to heal that imparts this divine touch to the noble profession you all are engaged in. Training of young professionals in the sciences and art of medicine is one of the most sacred duties one can ever perform. You are not only imparting knowledge and helping students imbibe skills but you are also facilitating the internalization of a set of values. Patience, understanding, empathy, soothing expression and skilful assessment are crucial for a successful career in medicine. These attitudes and behavioural traits need nurturing, they have to be ‘modelled’ by seniors and have to be ‘lived’ by students. The health of our country is being moulded in the medical institutions like yours.

Dear faculty members, your job does not end by merely imparting medical knowledge and skills but entails a more onerous responsibility of moulding the young minds into conscientious citizens with uncompromising integrity, high moral and ethical standards. This is all the more important in the present times when the image of the medical profession has been dented by the perception that it has become highly commercialised.

Since attaining Independence, India has made great strides in various fields from producing enough food to feed more than 1.3 billion people to becoming one of the leading space faring nations. However, the country is still facing many problems like poverty, illiteracy, atrocities against women and terrorism, to name a few. Today, the people of the country need to once again unite to overcome various challenges and build a New India. 

With about 65 per cent of the population below 35 years, we need to fully tap this demographic capital in various fields to fast track the progress of the country.

It is said that a person, who plans for a year, sows grains, the one who plans for 10 years, plants fruit-bearing trees, and the one who plans for generations, develops human beings! Colleges like Lady Hardinge Medical College have been striving to develop good doctors and good human beings, so that through education and culture, a nation of strong men and women is built and generations can reap its benefits! 

Sisters and brothers, today the nation’s health sector is a cause for concern. We are facing the twin burdens of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Although polio, tetanus and small pox were successfully eliminated, diseases like TB, malaria, chikangunya and dengue are still prevalent. Also lot more efforts are needed to further bring down IMR and MMR indices across the country. It is time for all public health experts, healthcare professionals, local bodies and communities to join hands in promoting hygiene and sanitation in a big way to build a “Swachh Bharat”, a prerequisite for establishing a “Swasth Bharat”.   

Other major concerns that need to be addressed by the government and other stakeholders are the lack of adequate medical facilities in the rural areas and the acute shortage of doctors and para-medical personnel across the country. We need human resource in the health sector--whether it is a medical college or the paramedical staff, the country needs them in large numbers. 

One of the ways to overcome shortage of doctors, particularly in rural areas is to make it mandatory for MBBS graduates to serve in rural areas before granting the first promotion to them. 

The private sector must not only supplement the efforts of the government in bridging the urban-rural divide in the health sector, but must adopt a more humane and philanthropic approach and ensure that healthcare is affordable and accessible.

Sisters and Brothers, India is lagging behind several countries in research output. Medical colleges like yours must accord highest priority to this aspect. In fact, translational research is of utmost importance in the medical field so that that people get benefited. Dear students, you must remember that not many have had the benefit of such privileged education like yours. You therefore have a greater responsibility in building a healthy India. Knowledge and modern technology are your instruments to advance medical sciences and prevent diseases. 

Doctors are considered next to God in our country and it is the cardinal responsibility of all those entering the medical profession to uphold the trust and confidence of the patients, who seek treatment from them. 

As regards affordability of medical care, it is a fact that medical costs are mostly met by out-of-pocket expenses by the people. For many poor and middle class families, hospitalization means disposing of family silver and getting into debt trap. 

In a laudable initiative, the government has started Ayushman Bharat – National Health Protection scheme to provide universal health care to 500 million poor and vulnerable people. I am happy that several State Governments too have designed their own health insurance schemes so that the poor and needy sections are not denied access to medical treatment.

Dear students, as you step out of the portals of this prestigious institution, remember that you are a member of a noble profession and always remain committed to upholding the Hippocratic Oath. 

Maintain the highest standards of ethics and integrity at every stage. I am sure that all the students of the Lady Hardinge Medical College will carry on the legacy of this prestigious institute and contribute towards building a healthy India. 

I wish you all a happy, healthy and blessed life ahead!

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M.

He was addressing the gathering after releasing two books - ‘A Treatise on Cleanliness’ and ‘Waste Management, an Introduction’, authored by Shri Rajat Bhargava, here today. 

 

The Vice President said that it is apt that the author has chosen these subjects at an appropriate time when India is journeying through a phase of growth and development. He further said that cleanliness is next only to godliness. Cleanliness and waste management are not only linked to hygiene but management of resources as well, he added.

 

The Vice President said that there is a need to build awareness about the importance of a self-sustaining system of waste disposal and minimizing waste production. He further said that innovative methods to dispose of residential, commercial and manufacturing waste need to be implemented across the country. A wide spectrum of issues surrounds the implementation of waste disposal and thus, it is a great initiative to bring out a treatise on solid and liquid waste management, he added.

 

The Vice President said that waste treatment and disposal produces significant green-house gas (GHG) emissions, notably methane, which is contributing significantly to global warming. He further said that we need to continue to introduce clean technologies and build awareness about the impact of our practices on the environment. This will lead to sustainable development, and aid in achieving millennium development goals, he added.

 

The Vice President said that ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s ambitious project to make India a clean country. It brought about a much-needed change in the way we approach waste management, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

 

“It gives me immense pleasure to release two books written by Shri Rajat Bhargava - ‘A Treatise on Cleanliness’ and ‘Waste Management, an Introduction’.

It is apt that the author has chosen these subjects at an appropriate time when India is journeying through a phase of growth and development.

It is said cleanliness is next only to godliness. Cleanliness and waste management are not only linked to hygiene but management of resources as well. In the light of this, the book assumes significance. I am happy to note that the book will come in handy for students and researchers as well.

While cleanliness gives us a practical assurance of hygiene and disease prevention, it also creates a sense of social well-being and good mental health.

There is a need to build awareness about the importance of a self-sustaining system of waste disposal and minimizing waste production. Clinical and sanitized methods to dispose of residential, commercial and manufacturing waste need to be widely talked about and implemented across the country.

A wide spectrum of issues surrounds the implementation of waste disposal. Thus, it is a great initiative to bring out a treatise on solid and liquid waste management.

On a global scale, waste management is still evolving. Approximately 330 million metric tonnes of waste was generated in 2003, and has exponentially increased in the last 15 years. Fast rates of development, growth in population and the increase in industrial activity, are all contributing factors.

Excess waste disposal and unorganized waste management largely takes place in poorer economic zones, deprived of education and sanitation. It is very important to adopt a holistic approach to waste management.

Modern Day waste materials are hazardous to mankind and can cause various diseases including cancers. Toxic waste materials can contaminate surface water, groundwater, soil and air which cause problems for humans, other species, and ecosystems.

Waste treatment and disposal produces significant green-house gas (GHG) emissions, notably methane, which is contributing significantly to global warming. I am sure that we will continue to introduce clean technologies and build awareness about the impact of our practices on the environment. This will lead to sustainable development, and aid in achieving millennium development goals. Two areas which I would like to highlight are Municipal waste and growing impact of e-wastes.

‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’, Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s ambitious project to make India a clean country. It brought about a much-needed change in the way we approach waste management. 

As you are aware India is the fastest growing economy. However, with growth come potential dangers of production of more waste. There is thus need for effective waste management. 

We need to effectively follow 3 R’s for waste control ---   Reduce, Recycle & Reuse.Along with 3Rs we need to take focus on resource efficiency for promoting sustainability. 

As regards waste management, various technologies are evolving to protect us from stinking gases to producing energy from waste.

Every citizen must fulfil his/her responsibility towards protecting environment. In sum total, we should gravitate towards a “zero waste “policy.

Talking about Municipal waste

India needs to increase landfill area, even as it looks to overhauling its municipal solid waste management system. India generates about 62 million tonnes of municipal trash every year. 

Ten million tonnes of garbage is generated in just six metropolitan cities--Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Kolkata. The landfills of these cities are already overflowing with no space to accommodate fresh waste.

According to an expert at the Centre of Science and Environment, instead of constructing new landfill sites, we should be looking into innovative methods to dispose and recycle its waste. I am happy that the Government has taken lead in establishing waste to energy projects on priority.

I strongly feel that segregation of waste should occur at the colony or neighbourhood level, when the waste is collected.

Environmental hazards of emissions of gases are also a concern and these need to be tackled appropriately. Nearly 20% of methane gas emissions in India are caused by landfills.

High levels of nickel, zinc, arsenic, lead, chromium and other metals in the solid waste at landfills in metro cities can contaminate ground water and create health hazards.            I strongly feel that as a country we should process everything and dump only the residue in the landfill.

Rapid changes in technology and obsolescence have resulted in a fast-growing surplus of electronic waste around the globe. Technical solutions are available, but in most cases a legal framework, a collection, logistics, and other services need to be implemented before a technical solution can be applied. I am happy to note that the Government has put an e-waste policy in place.

An estimated 50 million tons of e-waste are produced each year. The USA discards 30 million computers each year and 100 million phones are disposed of in Europe each year. It is estimated that only 15-20% of e-waste is recycled, the rest of these electronics go directly into landfills and incinerators.

GLOBAL TRADE ISSUES

I feel that the developing countries have become toxic dump yards of e-waste and we should guard against that. 

Lot of people argue that lower environmental and labour standards, cheap labour, and the relatively high value of recovered raw materials leads to a transfer of pollution-generating activities, such as smelting of copper wire to developing countries like China, Malaysia, India, Kenya, and various African countries, Electronic waste is being sent to these countries for processing. Many surplus laptops are routed to developing nations as “dumping grounds for e-waste”.

We need to protect against these. It is pertinent to remove the rich-poor divide in cleanliness as the country is poised to become ODF by 2nd October 2019.

I am happy that Dr. Bhargava has covered not only the technical uses but also highlighted the social issues related to cleanliness and waste management.    He has managed to cover a wide gamut of issues related to hazardous, toxic, bio-medical waste as well as cleaning of rivers in his publication.

The books have a special importance and cover a host of topics. I wish the publications and the author a great success in his endeavour. 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that cities are the drivers of economic growth and all sections of people living in the cities need to be provided with adequate housing and other essential amenities. He was addressing the gathering after laying foundation stone for the World Trade Center at Nauroji Nagar and redevelopment of Netaji Nagar General Pool Residential Accommodation Colony, here today. The Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs (I/C), Shri Hardeep Singh Puri and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that it is a matter of pride and satisfaction for him to be a part of the foundation stone laying ceremony of the projects which were conceptualised and took shape when he was the Housing and Urban Affairs Minister.

The Vice President said that besides providing housing to all citizens, there is a need to create good infrastructure to cater to the needs of the burgeoning population. We must also ensure that the development is sustainable by protecting our environment and resources, he added.

The Vice President said that there is a need to build green buildings and promote energy efficient and smart mobility solutions for optimum utilization of scarce resources and spaces.  There is also a need to promote the concept of green and energy efficient buildings in a big way and create greater awareness among the citizens, he added.

The Vice President said that the projects initiated today are aimed at providing better quality of life to citizens and spur economic growth. Cities are the drivers of economic growth and all sections of people living in the cities need to be provided with adequate housing and other essential amenities, he added.

Saying that India is witnessing urban renaissance following the launch of Smart Cities Mission, the Vice President said that apart from improving quality of life, Smart Cities also seek to provide clean and sustainable environment.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am very happy to be here today to lay the foundation stone for the World Trade Center at Nauroji Nagar and redevelopment of Netaji Nagar General Pool Residential Accommodation Colony. It is a matter of pride and satisfaction for me to be a part of the foundation stone laying ceremony of the projects which were conceptualised and took shape when I was the Housing and Urban Affairs Minister.

These projects are a part of the project for redevelopment of seven GPRA colonies (Sarojini Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Mohammedpur, Kasturba Nagar, Sriniwaspuri and Thyagaraj Nagar) being undertaken by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs through NBCC and CPWD.  

Sisters and brothers, India is witnessing rapid urbanisation.  About 31.7 per cent of the country’s population lived in urban areas in 2011. It is projected that over 50 per cent of the country’s people will be living in cities and towns by 2050. It is projected that the urban population will cross 80 crores by 2050.  This means cities and suburbs will undergo significant transformation and there will be lot of pressure on housing. 

Besides providing housing to all citizens, we will need more roads, bridges, highways, round-the-clock electricity, adequate water supply, waste disposable systems, office and retail spaces, rapid transportation, airports, sea ports and other infrastructure to cater to the needs of the burgeoning population. The challenges are huge and need to be overcome if we have to sustain rapid economic growth of close to 7 or 7.5 per cent per year on a continuous basis.

At the same time, we must ensure that the development is sustainable by protecting our environment and resources.  So, we need to build green buildings and promote energy efficient and smart mobility solutions for optimum utilization of scarce resources and spaces.  The planning of the Government is geared towards achieving these objectives and any future urban planning will have to be based on these considerations. There is also a need to promote the concept of green and energy efficient buildings in a big way and create greater awareness among the citizens.

Talking specifically of Delhi in the context of today’s function, it is well known that there is an acute shortage of Government housing and office space in the National Capital Region (NCR). This has created a long list of Government officials waiting for their turn for allotment of a house.

The Master Plan for Delhi (MPD)-2021, encourages redevelopment of old residential areas with a view to utilizing the existing land resources in the most efficient manner to meet the growing demand for built up space. I am happy to inform that during my tenure in the Ministry, we resolved to work towards addressing the issues of government housing along with social infrastructure and mixed land use for optimum utilisation of land and other resources with a visionary approach. Today’s function symbolizes this single-minded devotion and long term planning.  

The Government approval for the redevelopment of seven GPRA Colonies in Delhi was accorded on 5th July 2016 at an estimated cost of Rs. 32,835 Crore which includes operation and maintenance cost for 30 years. 

NBCC is the implementing agency for Redevelopment of Sarojini Nagar, Nauroji Nagar and Netaji Nagar, while CPWD is the implementing agency for Redevelopment of Kasturba Nagar, Thyagraj Nagar, Sriniwaspuri and Mohammadpur. 

Redevelopment envisages integration of the infrastructure of the surrounding areas. The Project will be financed through sale of Commercial Built-up Area (BUA). The Project will incorporate smart city features including in-house Solid/Liquid Waste Management facility, Rain Water Harvesting, Solar Energy and Green Building norms.

The World Trade Center in Nauroji Nagar to be developed by NBCC India Limited will be major land mark in the evolving skyline of the city of Delhi.  NBCC has obtained the accreditation of “World Trade Center” for this project.  The World Trade Center’s Association will stimulate trade and investment opportunities for commercial property developers, economic development agencies, and international businesses that are looking to connect globally and prosper locally. Nauroji Nagar would be developed as a state-of-the-art commercial hub in a plot area of 25 acres with all modern facilities and beautifully designed façade with a pleasing landscape. The project will be built at a cost of Rs. 2,694 crore and will have 12 towers of G+9 structure, apart from another commercial block and school building. It will be constructed as an integrated business hub.   It will be constructed on the concept of zero waste. Solid waste / waste water will be treated in-house and reused.  The recycled water will be used for horticultural purposes also.  

The redevelopment of GPRA colony Netaji Nagar will be another big and significant project of Delhi. This project has been taken up for the redevelopment of one of the old government colonies into residential and general pool office accommodation along with accompanying social infrastructure.  When completed, it will have 4,855 dwelling units with 70% open area comprising 90 towers.   The project will be constructed at a cost of Rs. 5,466 crore including O&M.  It will have zero discharge into the sewerage system and a sewage treatment plant will also be constructed.  Treated water will be used for horticulture and other purposes. 

Finally, I would like to emphasize that the projects initiated today are aimed at providing better quality of life to citizens and spur economic growth. Cities are the drivers of economic growth and all sections of people living in the cities need to be provided with adequate housing and other essential amenities. In fact, India is witnessing urban renaissance following the launch of Smart Cities Mission, which seeks to transform cities into Centers of economic activities. Apart from improving quality of life, Smart Cities also seek to provide clean and sustainable environment. 

I once again take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, Secretary and all officers of the Ministry and the team of NBCC led by its Managing Director for launching one of the most ambitious and state of the art urban projects in Delhi and offer my best wishes to all of you for its early completion and dedication to the people of Delhi.

 

JAI HIND!”

Following is the text of Vice President's address in Hindi:

 

""आज माखनलाल चतुर्वेदी राष्ट्रीय पत्रकारिता एवं संचार विश्वविद्यालय के तीसरे दीक्षांत समारोह में शामिल होकर मुझे अपार हर्ष एवं गहरा आत्मिक संतोष मिल रहा है।

इस विश्वविद्यालय ने अपने 27 वर्षों की यात्रा में देश को बेजोड़ पत्रकार, कंप्यूटर प्रोफेशनल, प्रबंधक और सैंकेडों विकास संचारकर्ता दिए हैं। कुलाधिपति होने के नाते मुझे गहरा संतोष है कि मीडिया शिक्षा की दृष्टि से यह विश्वविद्यालय सर्वोच्च विश्वविद्यालयों में गिना जाने लगा है।

यह विश्वविद्यालय जिनके नाम पर स्थापित है, ऐसे पंडित माखनलाल चतुर्वेदी हमारे प्रेरणा महापुरुष हैं, जिन्होंने पत्रकारिता को ऊंचे आदर्शों पर चलना सिखाया और पत्रकारिता को राजनैतिक सामाजिक एवं आर्थिक आजादी पाने का शब्द-अस्त्र बनाया।

उनकी महान कविता “मुझे तोड लेना वनमाली” ने देशवासियों में राष्ट्रवादिता के जज्बे को ऐसा उभारा कि यह कविता देश के साहित्य में अमर हो गयी। माखनलाल जी पत्रकारिता में इतनी ओजस्विता और स्वाभिमान था कि उसने समाज के नैतिक और चेतना के विकास में गहरा योगदान दिया पर इसके बदले में माखनलाल जी ने बड़े-बड़े पुरस्कारों तक को ठुकराया। इस मायने में उन्होंने पत्रकारिता के ऊंचे आदर्शों और पत्रकारिता के दर्शन की बुनियाद रखी। आज मुझे बहुत खुशी हो रही है कि विश्वविद्यालय के छात्र पत्रकारिता, संचार और कंप्यूटर अनुप्रयोग में डिग्री पाकर समाज में अपना योगदान देने की शुरूआत करने जा रहे हैं।

आज का दौर बहुत महत्व का है। देश में बदलाव की हवा बह रही है और युवा शक्ति आगे बढ़कर भारतवर्ष के विकास में अपना गहरा योगदान दे रही है। ऐसी परिस्थितियों में जब देश मजबूत कदमों से तरक्की कर रहा है और पूरे देश में सामाजिक जागरण भी पूरे गौरव से हो रहा है, आज संचारकर्मियों की भूमिका बेहद महत्वपूर्ण हो जाती है।

आप विद्यार्थीगण नए भारतवर्ष के निर्माण में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभायेंगे। मीडिया का काम, देश के विकास को गति देना है और मीडिया हमारे लोकतंत्र का मजबूत स्तंभ है। जैसा कि उच्चतम न्यायालय ने एक मामले में कहा है कि ""एक तरफ़ा सूचना, अनुचित सूचना, ग़लत सूचना और सूचना न देना, सभी सामान रूप से, एक अनभिज्ञ नागरिक वर्ग पैदा करते हैं, जिससे लोकतंत्र एक तमाशा बनकर रह जाता है। ""(As the Supreme Court said in a case, “one-sided information, disninformation, misinformation and non-information, all equally create an uninformed citizenry which makes democracy a farce.”)

 

आपने विश्वविद्यालय में पढ़ाई के दौरान जो ज्ञान और हुनर हासिल किया है, अब इसे समाज की जरूरतों के हिसाब से हकीकत में उतारना है।

सूचना क्रांति का महत्वपूर्ण वाहक यह विश्वविद्यालय रहा है। हिंदी भाषी प्रांतों की सबसे बड़ी चुनौती थी, डिजिटल क्रांति को सुदूर गांवों तक ले जाने की। विश्वविद्यालय ने मध्यप्रदेश में डिजिटल क्रांति को गांव-गांव तक ले जाकर साकार किया है और मध्य प्रदेश को e-governance में देश का सिरमौर माना जाने लगा है, विश्वविद्यालय ने e-governance के लिए काबिल प्रोफेशनल मुहैया कराये हैं।

देश के आज हर प्रतिष्ठित मीडिया प्रतिष्ठान में विश्वविद्यालय के विद्यार्थीगण आपको महत्वपूर्ण भूमिकाओं में दिखाई पड़ेंगे और वे अपना कार्य सामाजिक जिम्मेदारी से करते हैं। विश्वविद्यालय ने मीडिया शिक्षा के नये क्षेत्रों में नवाचार किए हैं। मल्टीमीडिया, ऐनिमेशन, ग्राफिक्स और प्रिंटिंग एवं पैकेजिंग क्षेत्रों में विश्वविद्यालय ने मीडिया शिक्षा में नई शुरूआत कर, एशिया में पहले मीडिया विश्वविद्यालय होने के गौरव को बढ़ाया है।

मुझे बहुत खुशी है कि विश्वविद्यालय ने हमारे प्राचीन ज्ञान को आधुनिक समय में जीवन-शैली में जोड़ने के लिये अनेक शोध पीठों की स्थापना की है। इसमें महर्षि अरविंद, स्वामी विवेकानंद, पतंजलि और भृर्तहरि जैसे ऋषियों पर कार्य हो सका। विश्वविद्यालय ने प्रदीर्घ योगदान वाले प्रकाशन इन महापुरुषों के अवदान पर निकाले हैं।

विश्वविद्यालय मीडिया को ध्यान में रखकर पत्रिकाएं, रिसर्च जर्नल्स निकालता है जिससे मीडिया शोध भी विकसित हो रहा है।

विश्वविद्यालय पड़ोसी देश पाकिस्तान के मीडिया का अध्ययन करने के लिए एक पत्रिका निकालता है, जिससे पाकिस्तान के मीडिया चरित्र को समझने में मदद मिलती है।

मुझे बड़ी प्रसन्नता है कि विश्वविद्यालय ने सुदूर आदिवासी क्षेत्रों में पहुंचकर कंप्यूटर शिक्षा प्रदान करने का बीड़ा उठाया है। इससे इन पिछड़े क्षेत्रों की हालत बदलने लगी है और इन क्षेत्रों के नवयुवकों को शिक्षा मिल रही है और वे योग्य कंप्यूटर प्रोफेशनल बन रहे हैं। विश्वविद्यालय ने मीडिया शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में अच्छी पुस्तकें प्रकाशित की हैं और सामाजिक महत्व के भी विषयों पर अनेक पुस्तकें प्रकाशित की हैं। विश्वविद्यालय ने अपने परिसरों का मध्यप्रदेश में विस्तार किया है विश्वविद्यालय ने माखनलाल जी की नगरी खंडवा के बाद अमरकंटक, रीवां, ग्वालियर में परिसर शुरू करने के बाद अब दतिया में परिसर आरंभ करने जा रहा है।

प्राय: विश्वविद्यालय अपने क्षेत्र में सीमित होकर सिकुडकर रह जाते हैं पर यह खुशी की बात है कि यह विश्वविद्यालय निरंतर अपना विस्तार कर रहा है। मध्यप्रदेश में पिछले पंद्रह वर्षों में तेज गति से विकास हुआ है और मध्य प्रदेश से बीमारू प्रदेश का टैग हट गया है। विश्वविद्यालय का विकास मध्य प्रदेश के तेज विकास के साथ-साथ हुआ है।

देश में आप जब मीडिया में प्रवेश करें तो साहस और हौसलों के साथ सच्चाई को समाज में ले जायें। आज जरूरत है समाज की नकारात्मक ताकत को उजागर करने की। ये ताकतें देश की समरसता यानि अखंडता और एकता को कमजोर करती हैं और देश के विकास में अड़ंगेबाजी भी करती हैं।

जरूरत है, आज मीडिया द्वारा समाज की सही तस्वीर रखने की।

मीडिया के सनसनीवाद ने समरस भारत की सही तस्वीर नहीं रखी है। आम भारतीय जीवन अभी भी मूल्य आधारित जीवन जीता है, पर मीडिया ऐसी तस्वीर प्रस्तुत करता है कि मसलन हमारे जीवन से मूल्य गायब हो गए हैं। भारतीय सभ्यता दुनिया की पुरानी सभ्यताओं में है और भारतीय ज्ञान परंपरा में भारतीय जीवन दृष्टि भी है, जो उसे एक महान सभ्यता बनाती है। आप लोग समाज को बतायें कि देश की प्राचीन सभ्यता की क्या-क्या विशेषताएं रही हैं और यह सभ्यता इतनी सारी चुनौतियों को झेलने के बाद भी अपने मूल स्वरूप को कैसे बचा सकी है।

आप लोग सही मायने में “कर्मवीर” बनें, जिससे आपके काम की गूंज भी समाज को सुनाई पड़े और सामाजिक बदलाव का काम भी हो सके। मेरे विचार से मीडिया को ज़िम्मेदारी और व्यावसायिक रीति से सत्य के प्रोत्साहन की नई टीआरपी अवधारणा अपनानी चाहिए।

I feel that media should dedicate itself to a new TRP philosophy of promotion of Truth in a Responsible and Professional manner.

आप जानते हैं कि माखनलाल चतुर्वेदी जी “कर्मवीर” अखबार निकाला करते थे और यह अखबार अंग्रेज सरकार पर दबाव बनाकर शासन को जवाबदेह और जिम्मेदार बनाता था। गांधी जी भी इस अखबार की खूब तारीफ किया करते थे। सच्चाई की ज्योति को यदि आपने थाम लिया तो यकीन मानिए कि विजय आपकी ही होगी। आपकी राजदृष्टि, समाजदृष्टि में स्पष्टता है तो आपके संचारकर्ता के काम आसान होंगे। मुझे उम्मीद ही नहीं बल्कि पूरा विश्वास है कि आपकी राष्ट्रबोध चेतना और सामाजिक बोध विकसित होगा, जिससे आप घटनाक्रमों की सही पड़ताल करके उसे सही नजरिए से समाज के सामने रख सकेंगे।

भारत के गांवों में भी अब विकास हो रहा है। आप लोग थोड़ा शहरों की चकाचौंध से दूर ग्रामीण भारत में भी जाएं और ग्रामीण भारत की तस्वीर को समाज के सामने रखें। यकीन मानिए कि ग्रामीण भारत पर यदि आपने ध्यान दिया तो न केवल भारतवर्ष की आत्मा को जान पाएंगे बल्कि विकास की बुनियाद को भी समझ सकेंगे।

मेरा यह भी कहना है कि गांधी जी, जो स्वयं एक महान पत्रकार थे, उन्होंने नैतिकता की सही कसौटी दी थी। उनका कहना यही था कि हमे अपने काम का मूल्यांकन इस आधार पर करना चाहिए कि उसका अंतिम पंक्ति के व्यक्ति पर क्या असर पड़ता है। आप भी इस अंतिम कतार के व्यक्ति पर ध्यान जरूर दीजिएगा और इसकी तस्वीर को अपने जेहन में जरूर रखिएगा, जिससे आप भारत वर्ष को सही मायने में मजबूत बना सकें।

मीडिया स्त्री अधिकारों की दिशा में अब जागृत हो रहा है, आप सब को प्रयास करना चाहिए कि मीडिया की प्राथमिकताओं ने नारी गरिमा और नारी अधिकार हमेशा रहे।

मीडिया को वंचित वर्ग के अधिकारों की रक्षा के लिए भी काम करना चाहिए ताकि निर्धनों को मुख्यधारा में लाया जा सके।

पूरी दुनिया में पर्यावरण के खतरे बहुत बढ़े हैं, मुझे लगता है कि आप युवा पत्रकारों को पर्यावरण को संरक्षित करने और बचाने के पूरे प्रयास करने चाहिए।

भारत अब ज्ञान अर्थ व्यवस्था आधारित विश्व-शक्ति होने जा रहा है, और यह सब भारतीय लोगों की काबिलियत के निखरने से ही संभव हो सकेगा। इसलिए ज्यादा से ज्यादा ज्ञान हासिल कीजिये। अपने हुनर को तराशें और बड़ी से बड़ी चुनौती को हासिल करके, अपनी काबिलियत को सिद्ध करें। परिस्थितियां आपको आसान और कठिन चुनौती भरे रास्तों का विकल्प देंगी पर हमेशा ऐसा रास्ता चुनें जिसमें आपकी और समाज की तरक्की दिखती हो। आपके इसी निर्णय से ही आप भी निरंतर अपनी काबिलियत को निखारते हुए, राष्ट्र और समाज को बेहतर और मजबूत बनाने में योगदान दे सकेंगे।

और एक बात याद रखें कि सीखने की असली प्रयोगशाला है समाज। समाज में अगर आप हर दिन कुछ सीखने के संकल्प को लेकर चलेंगे तो अपनी हासिल की हुई शिक्षा में कुछ जोड़ सकेंगे। शिक्षा एक निरंतर चलने वाली सजीव प्रक्रिया है, मगर आप हर दिन कुछ सीखते नहीं हैं और अपना कुछ जोड़ते नहीं हैं तो शिक्षा अधूरी ही रहती है।

मध्यप्रदेश ने एक से बढ़कर एक पत्रकार विभूतियां देश को दी हैं, आप भी आने वाले समय में अपने समय के बेहतर संचारकर्मी हो सकते हैं, जो भारतवर्ष के नवोत्थान में सहायक होंगे।

मुझे पूर्ण विश्वास है कि आप अपने सामाजिक उत्तरदायित्व को समझेंगे और डिजिटल भारत के सपने को साकार करने में अपना पूरा योगदान देंगे। हमारी मिली-जुली संस्कृति जिसमें विविधता और सहिष्णुता सहज रूप से है, इसके स्रोतों को हमें समझकर, इसमें रची-बसी परंपरा को अपने आचरण में भी लाना चाहिए।

अंत में, मैं आप सभी को शुभकामनाएं देता हूं अपना जीवन यशस्वी हो, आपका सामाजिक योगदान स्थायी रहे और आप सब विकसित भारतवर्ष को दुनिया में उसकी सही पहचान दिला सकें।

जय हिन्द!""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Media should enrich thought process of people and promote a positive mindset. He was addressing the gathering after presenting degrees to students at the 3rd Convocation of Kushabhau Thakre Patrikarita Avam Jansanchar Vishwavidyalaya, in Raipur, Chhattisgarh today. The Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Dr. Raman Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President recollected his association with late Shri. Kushabhau Thakre and called him an ideal Public Leader. He has asked students passing out of the University to learn from Mr Thakre and lead a disciplined life with dedication. 

The Vice President said that Media should be critical of the ills in society and heighten awareness of the social maladies afflicting contemporary society like casteism, communalism, corruption and atrocities against women. He further said that Media should be a Means of Empowerment for Development through Informed Actions. Those who obstruct Parliament and not allow it function should not get prominence in Media, he added.    

The Vice President said that Media should dedicate itself to a new TRP philosophy: The Promotion of Truth in a Responsible and Professional Manner. He further said that harmonization of rights and responsibilities are must for a free media to flourish. Information with confirmation can become the most powerful ammunition to fight against injustice, social evils and the negative forces in the world, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address in Hindi:

""कुशाभाऊ ठाकरे पत्रकारिता एवं जनसंचार विश्वविद्यालय के दीक्षांत समारोह के अध्यक्ष एवं छत्तीसगढ़ के माननीय मुख्यमंत्री डॉ. रमन सिंह जी, मंच पर उपस्थित छत्तीसगढ़ शासन के मंत्रीगण, स्थानीय सांसद श्री रमेश बैस, विश्वविद्यालय के कुलपति माननीय प्रो. (डॉ.) एम.एस. परमार, विश्वविद्यालय की कार्यपरिषद, विद्यापरिषद, अध्ययन संकाय एवं शोधपीठ के सम्माननीय सदस्यगण, विश्वविद्यालय के कुलसचिव डॉ. अतुल तिवारी, प्राध्यापकगण, उपस्थित अतिथिगण, स्वर्णपदक एवं  प्रिय छात्र-छात्राओं, देवियों और सज्जनों।

कुशाभाऊ ठाकरे पत्रकारिता एवं जनसंचार विश्वविद्यालय के तृतीय दीक्षांत समारोह के अवसर पर आप सभी के बीच उपस्थित होने पर मुझे अत्यंत प्रसन्नता हो रही है।

मैं सर्वप्रथम स्व. कुशाभाऊ ठाकरे जी को नमन करता हूं।

स्व. ठाकरे जी ने सादा जीवन और उच्च विचार के सूत्र को जीवन भर अपनाए रखा। उन्होंने अपना सारा जीवन राष्ट्र को समर्पित कर दिया।

यह मेरा सौभाग्य है कि ऋषितुल्य स्व. ठाकरे जी के साथ कार्य करने का सुअवसर मुझे प्राप्त हुआ था।

इसके साथ ही मैं इस राज्य के रचयिता, हमारे देश के पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री भारत रत्न श्री अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी जी को प्रणाम करता हूं, जिनके हाथों इस विश्वविद्यालय का उद्घाटन हुआ था।

मुझे इस बात की भी अत्यंत प्रसन्नता हो रही है कि कवि, पत्रकार एवं राजनेता माननीय श्री अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी जी की कालजयी कविता “कदम मिलाकर चलना होगा” को विश्वविद्यालय ने अपना कुलगीत बनाया है। यह कुलगीत विश्वविद्यालय के छात्र-छात्राओं को न सिर्फ विद्यार्थी जीवन में आगे बढ़ने की प्रेरणा देता है, बल्कि यह उनके समूचे व्यक्तित्व को गढ़ने में भी मदद करता है।

आज जब हम मीडिया के माध्यम से देख-सुन और पढ़ रहे हैं, कि किस तरह विश्व के अनेक हिस्सों में अनेक समूहों के मध्य विभिन्न मतभेदों के दुष्परिणाम हिंसा और उपद्रवों के तौर पर सामने आ रहे हैं, तब अटलजी की इस कविता में समाहित दर्शन “कदम मिलाकर चलना होगा” को अपनाने की आवश्यकता और भी बढ़ जाती है।

किसी विश्वविद्यालय का मोनोग्राम उसके दर्शन का परिचय होता है।

आपके मोनोग्राम में बहुत ही सुंदर ढंग से एकतारा और खड़ताल दर्शाए गए हैं, जो हमारे देश के प्रथम संप्रेषक या पत्रकार देवर्षी नारद का प्रतीक है। वास्तव में, आज भी देश के ग्रामीण अंचलों में इसी एकतारे और खड़ताल के माध्यम से संदशों का प्रभावी संचार होता है।

मुझे बताया गया है कि विगत दिनों विश्वविद्यालय ने अपना चौदहवां स्थापना दिवस मनाया। किसी विश्वविद्यालय के जीवन में यह अत्यंत अल्प अवधि कही जाएगी। परंतु इस छोटी सी अवधि में विश्वविद्यालय ने जो उपलब्धियां हासिल की हैं, वे अत्यंत महत्वपूर्ण हैं।

देश के नवोदित राज्य छत्तीसगढ़ में स्थापना के कुछ समय बाद ही देश के प्रथम मीडिया गुरुकुल के तौर पर पत्रकारिता एवं जनसंचार विश्वविद्यालय की स्थापना की गई और यह विश्वविद्यालय मीडिया शिक्षा में स्नातक से लेकर स्नातकोत्तर, एम.फिल. और पीएच.डी. की शिक्षा प्रदान कर रहा है, जो अत्यंत महत्वपूर्ण है। इसके लिए मैं विश्वविद्यालय परिवार को बधाई देता हूं।

पत्रकारों और पत्रकारिता ने हमारे देश के स्वतंत्रता संग्राम में महती भूमिका निभाई थी।

उस दौर के लगभग सभी बड़े नेता प्रत्यक्ष या अप्रत्यक्ष तौर पर समाचार पत्रों के माध्यम से जनता में जागरुकता पैदा करने की दिशा में प्रयासरत थे।

स्वतंत्रता प्राप्ति के पश्चात समाचार पत्रों एवं संचार के अन्य माध्यमों की भूमिका और भी बढ़ गई है। समाचार माध्यम लोगों को सूचना देने, शिक्षित करने और मनोरंजन का कार्य कर रहे हैं।

जहां शहरों एवं महानगरों में रहने वाले लोग संचार के अत्याधुनिक साधनों का प्रयोग कर रहे हैं, वहीं हमें यह ध्यान रखना होगा, कि देश के कई हिस्सों में अभी भी जनजातीय एवं ग्रामीण क्षेत्रों में निवासरत हमारे बंधुओं की पहुंच इन आधुनिक साधनों तक नहीं हो सकी है।

ऐसा माना जाता है कि सूचना व्यक्तियों को सामर्थ्यवान बनाती है। इस मायने में सूचना सशक्तीकरण का माध्यम है। सही सूचनाएं प्राप्त होने पर आत्मविश्वास में वृद्धि होती है।

मीडिया के जो विद्यार्थी अपनी शिक्षा पूर्ण करने के पश्चात आज यहां उपाधि प्राप्त कर रहे हैं तथा जो विद्यार्थी अभी अध्ययनरत हैं, उनसे मैं कहना चाहता हूं कि वे समाज में सूचना के संप्रेषण का कार्य पूरी निष्ठा और जिम्मेदारी से करें।

आज भी हमारे देश के अनुसूचित जातियों, जनजातियों, महिलाओं और पिछड़े वर्गों के करोड़ों लोगों तक सूचनाएं सही मायने में, सही संदर्भों के साथ और सही समय पर पहुंचाए जाने की आवश्यकता है।

इस महती कार्य को सफलतापूर्वक करके आप एक समरस समाज की स्थापना में अपना योगदान दे सकते हैं। एक ऐसा समाज, जहां सूचनाओं के अभाव में कोई अवसरों से वंचित नहीं रह पाएगा।

हाल के वर्षों में यह भी देखा गया है कि समाचार माध्यम न सिर्फ सूचनाएं प्रेषित कर रहे हैं, बल्कि वे एजेंडा तैयार करने में भी महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभा रहे हैं।

समाचार माध्यम लोकतंत्र के तीनों स्तंभों के साथ ही नागरिकों के समक्ष भी एजेंडा प्रस्तुत कर रहे हैं।

मीडिया की इस नई भूमिका की कुछ वर्गों में प्रशंसा की गई, तो कुछ वर्गों ने इसकी आलोचना भी की है। इस बिंदू पर निष्पक्ष तौर से सोचा जाए, तो यह बात निकलकर आती है कि जनता की भलाई के लिए, जनहित के लिए मीडिया यदि एजेंडा प्रस्तुत करता है, तो उसका स्वागत किया जाना चाहिए।

Media should be a Means of Empowerment for Development through Informed Actions. It should enrich the thought processes and promote a positive mindset. It should be critical of the ills in society and heighten awareness of the social maladies afflicting contemporary society like casteism, communalism, corruption and atrocities against women. 

इसके साथ ही यह भी महत्वपूर्ण है कि सूचनाएं प्रेषित करने तथा एजेंडा निर्धारित करने का दायित्व किन हाथों में है। हम सभी भली भांति जानते हैं कि समाचार पत्रों का प्रकाशन एक मिशन से बदलकर उद्योग का रूप ले चुका है।

जहां भारत में पिछले 25 वर्षों के दौरान टीवी चैनलों ने अपनी सशक्त उपस्थिति दर्ज कराई, वहीं प्रौद्योगिकी के विकास के साथ स्मार्ट फोन की मदद से बमुश्किल पिछले 5 वर्षों में डिजिटल मीडिया हम सभी के हाथों में पहुंच चुका है।

ऐसी स्थिति में जब हम सभी सूचनाएं गढ़ने, प्रेषित करने और उसे प्राप्त करने की क्षमता रखते हैं, तब हमारी जिम्मेदारी और भी बढ़ जाती है।

Media should dedicate itself to a new TRP philosophy: The Promotion of Truth in a Responsible and Professional Manner.Harmonization of rights and responsibilities is needed for a free media to flourish. 

उचित और अनुचित में भेद करने का दायित्व हम सभी का है।

इस दौर में इस विश्वविद्यालय के पाठ्यक्रमों से प्रशिक्षित होकर समाज में अपनी भूमिका निभाने जा रहे छात्र-छात्राओं को विवेकशील बनना होगा।

उन्हें इस बात का हमेशा ध्यान रखना होगा कि उनके लिखे एक-एक शब्द का महत्व कितना अधिक है।

Information with confirmation can become the most powerful ammunition to fight against injustice, social evils and the negative forces in the world.

आपके इन्हीं शब्दों के माध्यम से या तो समाज में समरसता कायम हो सकती है या फिर समाज में विषमताएं बढ़ सकती हैं।

यहां पर मैं आपके विश्वविद्यालय के मोनोग्राम में उल्लेखित ऋग्वेद की ऋचा की ओर आपको ले जाना चाहूंगा। “भद्रं नोअपि वातय मनो दक्षमुत क्रतुम।” अर्थात हे देव हमारे मन को शुभ संकल्प वाला बनाओ, हमारी अंतरात्मा को शुभ कर्म करने वाली बनाओ और हमारी बुद्धि को शुभ विचार करने वाली बनाओ।

This attitude to do your best for your country is going to make all the difference in your careers. I have always felt that one should always remember and revere one’s mother, motherland, mother tongue and motivational mentor or guru.

दीक्षांत समारोह की इस वेला में आप सभी प्रण लें, कि अपने कर्मों से न सिर्फ अपना बल्कि अपने माता-पिता, गुरुजनों, समाज और राष्ट्र का मान बढ़ाएं।

अंत में, मैं एक बार फिर आप सभी को तृतीय दीक्षांत समारोह की हार्दिक बधाइयां देता हूं, विश्वविद्यालय परिवार को शुभकामनाएं देता हूं और इस शुभ अवसर पर आपने मुझे आमंत्रित किया, उसके लिए हृदय से आपको धन्यवाद देता हूं।

जय हिन्द !

                            Vice President Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu today said that his visit to three Latin American has addressed the ‘high level contact deficit’ with the important region and would help in improving bilateral trade and investments for mutual benefit. He briefed media persons in Frankfurt, Germany today before leaving for New Delhi after concluding his week long visit to Guatemala, Panama and Peru.

            Shri Naidu said “High level visits by Indian leaders to identified countries and regions of the world are affirmative statements of intent to enhance cooperation for mutual benefit. India has embarked on such engagements over the last four years and this visit is a part of that well thought out outreach. This is in line with India’s vision for a better world through collective actions for shared benefits”. 

            Vice President explained that the three Latin American countries offered significant opportunities for India given their high level of engagement with the USA and the other North and South American economies through regional arrangements and Free Trade Agreements, besides being logistic and financial hubs in the region.

            Shri Naidu further said “India’s sub-optimal engagement with these three countries is to a large extent due to high level contact deficit. My visit is the highest level ever from both sides to Guatemala and Panama since establishment of diplomatic ties about 50 years ago. Former President Shri K.R.Narayanan visited Peru in 1998.  I am hopeful that my visit would catalyse enhanced flow of trade and investments through necessary follow up actions by respective governments”.

            Shri Naidu informed that the top leadership of the three Latin American countries have acknowledged the strengths and expertise of India in various fields and it’s fast growing economy which they said could benefit their countries under enhanced engagement. 

            Vice President stated that during his visit, five Memoranda of Understanding and Agreements have been signed. These relate to training of diplomats and English teachers of Guatemala; Exemption of visas for diplomatic, official and consular passport holders of India and Panama besides a Work Plan for cooperation in agricultural research and Cooperation in New and Renewable Energy with Peru.

            During the talks with Panamanian leaders, Shri Naidu also announced a total of US $ 25 million Line of Credit for setting up a Centre of Bio-diversity and Drug Tracking and a Centre for Innovation and Technology. 

            Shri Naidu said “Presidents, Vice Presidents and concerned senior ministers of these three countries spending long hours discussing various issues of mutual interest and the road ahead with the Indian delegation has been very assuring”. 

            Vice President informed that the Indian delegation highlighted the help India could provide in areas of agriculture, IT, Science & Technology, Space applications, pharmaceuticals, textiles, New & Renewable Energies. 

            He also said that these three countries who suffered from various forms of terrorism supported India’s efforts for global action against all forms of terrorism. “They firmly reiterated support to India’s Permanent Membership in the United Nations Security Council as the largest democracy of the world and an important voice on global issues” he said.

            Shri Naidu was accompanied by Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Shri Jaswantsinh Sumanbhai Bhahor and four Members of Parliament viz., Shri Tiruchi Siva, Shri Anil Desai, Shri Kamlesh Paswan and Smt.Chhaya Verma besides Smt.Preeti Saran, Secretary (East) and senior officials.

                Top leadership of Peru has acknowledged that their country has a lot to learn and benefit from the success story of India and resolved with India to significantly enhance trade relations as the two countries celebrated 55 years of diplomatic ties in Lima on May 11, 2018. 

Vice President Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu today held extensive talks with President, Prime Minister and senior Ministers of Peru in Lima today on a range of issues indicating specific areas for enhanced engagement. He spoke at length about India’s strength in supply of quality and cost effective generic medicines, Information Technology, defence equipment, Science & Technology, Space applications etc.

During the delegation level talks, the Peruvian Prime Minister Mr.Cesar Villanueva Bardales, leading a delegation of four ministers and senior official noted that India is acknowledged as a leader in pharma sector and Peru could take benefit of the same. Health Minister of Peru Ms.Silvia Pessah Eljay suggested that Indian Government may do needful to enable Indian Pharma companies set up generic medicines production facilities in Peru. Peruvian side agreed to consider suggestion of Shri Naidu for hassle free registration of Indian pharma companies for supply of medicines.

Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism of Peru Mr.Rogers Valencia Espinoza, while speaking of the potential of bilateral trade between the two countries said Peru was keen about concluding a Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with India. He mentioned that two rounds of discussions were already in this regard and the third round is to be held in Delhi in August this year. He stressed on the need to conclude this agreement at the earliest for mutual benefit. 

Peru’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Nestor Popolizio Bardales stressed that India deserved to be a Permanent member of the United Nation’s Security Council in line with its size, role and responsibilities in the global scheme of things. He reiterated Peru’s support to India in this regard. 

Referring to the success of Information Technology Centre in Peru set up by India, the Peruvian side more such centres in other parts of the country. 

Earlier, during his talks with the President of Peru, Vice President Shri Naidu said that 55 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries is an important landmark and it was time to assess the achievements so far to chart out a clear course of action to realize the full potential. 

Peruvian President said his country is closely watching India’s progress in different sectors including its transition from an agrarian economy to being an IT leader with strong capacities in Science & Technology, space sector etc. He informed Shri Naidu that concerned ministers were asked by him to make time bond action plans for progressing on identified areas of cooperation. 

Sharing Shri Naidu’s concern about terrorism, President of Peru noted that while terrorists come out with new strategies, the global community to act together to counter terrorism in all it’s different forms and shapes. 

After the delegation level talks, India and Peru signed an Agreement on Cooperation in New and Renewable Energy. Peru is a founder member of the International Solar Alliance, established with India taking the initiative. 

Peru’s External Affairs Ministry organized a special programme in Lima commemorating the 55 years of diplomatic ties with India. Peruvian youth performed Bharat Natyam which was appreciated by Vice President Shri Venkaiah Naidu.

                Vice President Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu has expressed serious concern over growing disconnect in the present world that is highly ‘inter-connected’ like never before and called for intensified collective global effort to address basic problems like poverty and inequality. He asserted that India is seeking a new world order and action based on the country’s ancient wisdom and values  that advocated harmonious existence and common good. He outlined India’s vision for resolving current global challenges while speaking to the Ambassadors of different countries and students in Panama City on May 10, 2018 on the theme ‘In search of a more Representative and Relevant World Order’. 

Shri Naidu noted that technological and scientific advances and expansion of knowledge have thrown up new challenges like cyber security, terrorism, nuclear and chemical warfare etc., threatening human existence. Elaborating further on contemporary issues seeking solutions, he said “Corruption, discrimination, exploitation, violence and violation of basic human rights continue to erode social fabric across the world. These evils and perceptions of exploitation and failure of established governance systems lead to unrest, anger, rebellion and extremism. The sooner we effectively address these issues, the better will be our collective feature”. 

Quoting extensively the ancient Indian sages and Vedas, Shri Naidu said India always firmly believed in peaceful and harmonious co-existence including with the nature and these core principles hold the key for resolving current global challenges through collective action for shared benefits. He quoted from ‘Prithvi Suktam’ which said “May out interactions among ourselves and Mother Earth be harmonious” and also referred to the Vedas to highlight the message “Let peace flow over the whole universe”.

The Vice President said “In the world order we want, the power and responsibilities are shared, opinions and voices are respected and wealth and earth’s resources are shared”. Shri Naidu stressed that no country or group of countries should influence or control global decision making and this warranted immediate reform of the United Nations system to ensure more representative decision making on major global issues. 

Shri Naidu said “India seeks balanced pursuit of national interests while also upholding the broader duties and values mandated by our membership of the comity of nations which shall form the core of the new and reformed World Order we all must establish”. 

Ambassadors of about 40 countries to Panama later interacted with Shri Naidu and appreciated the major initiatives and their implementation by the central government and the fast growing Indian economy.  

Later in the day, Shri Naidu arrived in the Peruvian capital of Lima after visiting Guatemala and Panama for two days each.

                Vice President Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu has said that Indian leadership is reaching out to different countries and regions of the world with higher levels of engagement in pursuit of its vision for shared benefits and the country is not in race with any other in this new and energetic global outreach. Shri Naidu spoke at length on the New India being unveiled over the last four years while addressing Indian diaspora in the Panama City today (May 9,2018). 

Shri Naidu said “Our country over the last four years has been taking rapid strides on several fronts under a stable government and able leadership. This stability and ability are crucial for fully harnessing the untapped energies of our people so that our nation can take its due place in the comity of nations. The energetic PM Shri Modi has set in motion a certain process of transformation encompassing both the ‘minds’ and ‘methods’. The mission that the PM has launched covers both behavioral and performance aspects”. 

Vice President, differing with some commentators blaming democracy for the country’s slow progress asserted “If the leadership has the right vision and ability, things can be changed. ..The New India story will only gain further momentum as the hitherto unreached Indians join this journey with energy and enthusiasm unleashing their long suppressed hidden potential”. 

Saying that as Vice President, he was only speaking of what is happening in the country, Shri Naidu noted “As Vice President, I am beyond political talk. I am only speaking about what  is happening in our country. Prime Minister is the chosen leader of our country and Shri Modi is piloting change with certain energy and vigour and people are seeing the difference. I am not saying that all issues have been resolved and problems fixed. We have too many issues to be addressed and it takes time for sure. But a new beginning has been made”. 

 Elaborating on the progress made by the country and the efforts of global outreach, Shri Naidu said “As a vibrant democracy and a  fast growing economy  with enormous potential, our country has found a new voice, acknowledgement  and visibility across the regions of the world over the last four years. Never before has any PM spoken so eloquently for India and Indians from a position of strength”. 

 Referring to media reports about India’s new global outreach as coming in the way of advances being made by China in different regions, Shri Naidu asserted “India does not like to run a race with others. We have our own vision for India and the world based on our strengths to back it. Our Prime Minister and Chinese President made it clear that there is enough space for both to play out their roles and take advantage of”. 

Saying that India has emerged as a certain ‘new brand’ both at home and abroad, Shri Naidu urged the 32 million diaspora across the world to continue to march ahead with heads held high wearing on their sleeves the tag of Brand India. He called upon them to be true to 5 Ms, i.e Mother, Motherland, Mother tongue, Motherland adopted and Mentor(Guru).

 Panama has the largest number of over 15,000 Indian diaspora in the region.

                Breaking protocol, President of Panama Mr.Juan Carlos Varela Rodriguez today (May 9,2019) accompanied visiting Vice President of India Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu on the later’s visit to the famous Panama Canal. This was an unscheduled engagement of the Panamanian President that surprised the diplomats of both the countries.

At the end of the banquet hosted by himin honour of Shri Naidu, the President of Panama said “Mr.Vice President, I have decided to accompany you on your visit to the Canal and delighted to give you company”. Shri Naidu responded saying “Excellency, it is an honour you would be doing to the people of India andan indication of the importance you attach for improving the relations between the two countries”. 

Vice President of Panama Ms.Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado was scheduled to accompany Shri Naidu to the canal till the President made his mind known at the banquet. She also accompanied Shri Naidu.

President of Panama Mr.Rodriguez spent almost six hours without break with Shri Naidu starting with a one-to-one meeting followed by delegation level talks, the banquet and visit to the Panama Canal, which the diplomats of both sides noted as another rarity. 

At the Panama Canal, a detailed audio-visual presentation was made to Shri Naidu explaining the origins of the path breaking canal project, it’s advantages and the volume of trade being transited through the canal and the passage of vessels with a system of locks. Construction of the canal started in 1904 and the first ship sailed through it in 1914. The USA handed over the Canal to Panama on December 31, 1999.  It was further expanded at a cost of US $ 5.40 billion doubling the carrying capacity and  the first vessel sailing through the expanded canal in June, 2016. 5% of the world trade transits through this canal.

 India –Panama Canal connection was fondly recalled during the visit of Shri Naidu to the canal. He was informed of the  participation of Indians in the construction work during 1904-14 and the Captain of the first vessel that sailed through the expanded canal being an Indian. A Gujarat based company has won the bid for preparing Tender Document for construction of a new bridge on the canal. President of Panama told Shri Naidu that the new bridge would be a show-case project and he was happy with Indian connection with the project.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu visited the historic Antigua (old) Guatemala city on May 8, 2018 for understanding how it’s rich heritage is being maintained since it was declared as a World Heritage City by the UNESCO in 1979. He discussed at length the conservation measures with the Mayor of the city Ms. Susana Heidi Asencio Lueg and concenred officials. He went around varioius monuments restored and being conserved. Impressed by the city’s heritage dating to sixteenth century and it’s preservation further to devastation, Shri Naidu said “It is a clear case of life springing from ruins”. 

Antigua Guatemala was the third capital built by the Spanish rulers since their invasion of Guatemala in 1524. The first two capitals had to be abondoned by 1541 on account of resistance from the local warriors and natural calamities respectively. Old Guatemala witnessed series of earthquakes since 1565 and was destroyed by earthquake Santa Marta in 1773 forcing the shifting of capital to the present Guatamela City. 

Those who stayed back and others who returned started reconstruction of Old Guatemala, restoring most of its mounments. UNESCO declared it as a World Heritage City in 1979. 

Addressing the Municipal Council of Antigua Guatemala, Shri Naidu referred to the ancient Mayan civilisation of Guatemala and the Indus civilisation of India and stressed on the need to preserve the rich cultural roots which would in turn guide the present and future generations. He referred to Ahmedabad also being declared as a World Heritage City and noted that ‘twinning’ of the two heritage cities would benefit both. 

The Vice President visited the historic mounments including San Jose Cathedral, Museum of Colonial Art, King’s Palace, a renovated ruined property being run as a hotel etc. 

Shri Naidu is being accompanied by a delegation inclusing Shri Jaswant Singh Bhabor, Minister of State for Tribal Affaris and Members of Parliament viz., Shri Tiruchi Siva, Shri Anil Desai, Shri Kamlesh Paswan and Smt. Chhaya Verma.

                Agreeing to push the ‘complementary’ and ‘not competitive’ nature of bilateral relations to a new level for mutual benefit from the emerging opportunities in both the countries, India and Guatemala today agreed to support each other’s candidature for Non-Permanent Membership in the United Nations Security Council. Guatemala will support India’s candidature for UNSC membership for 2021-22 while New Delhi will do so for 2031-32 for Guatemala. 

This decision was one of the several outcomes of extensive talks Vice President of India Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu held with the President, Vice President and Parliament Speaker of Guatemala in the capital Guatemala City on May 7, 2018. Kick starting India’s high level outreach to the Latin American countries, Shri Naidu held discussions on a wide range of issues spread over two overs with top leaders of Guatemala. Shri Naidu’s visit is highest level from either side since establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in 1972.  

Presenting the context of his first overseas visit as Vice President, Shri Naidu told Guatemalan leaders that “India is keen about enhancing its engagement with Latin America and looks at Guatemala, the most populous and biggest economy in Central America , as the gateway. My visit to Guatemala is a clear indication of this thinking in New Delhi. Going by trade patterns and consumption needs, we are complementary in nature and not competitors and need to take our relation to a new high taking advantage of emerging opportunities in both countries for mutual benefit”. 

Guatemalan President Shri Jimmy Morales said his country could benefit from the ‘’successful economic story of India” and stressed on the need for improving bilateral engagement in various fields. Referring to India’s soft power, he said he was aware of popular TV serial Kaun Banega Karodpati and films like The Slum Dog Millionaire and The Life of Pi. He also  referred to huge popularity of Indian made two wheelers given their quality and after sale service in Guatemala beating the popular competitors. After talks with Shri Naidu and before leaving for Costa Rica on an official visit, he directed his deputy for detailed talks with the visiting dignitary for exploring new avenues of cooperation with India. 

Vice President Shri Naidu later held detailed discussions with Guatemalan Vice President Dr.Jateth Cabrera Franco and Speaker of Parliament Shri Alvaro Arzu Escobar. 

Leaders of both countries agreed that India and Guatemala are faced with similar challenges including governance issues, terrorism in different forms, poverty and economic disparities and democracy is the best form of governance to address them. Guatemalan Vice President Dr. Franco noted that contrary to the perception their government was making determined efforts to check corruption and his country was facing a different kind of terrorism in the form of criminal gangs. 

Guatemalan Speaker Shri Escobar said “India’s vibrant democracy is a role model in harmonizing vast diversities and offers a lot to learn and India’s economic success is equally inspiring”. Shri Naidu suggested setting up Parliamentary Friendship Group to promote interaction among MPs of both sides. 

During the talks, Indian side agreed to the Guatemala’s request for supplying solar panels to its airports. After discussions and in the presence of both the Vice Presidents, both the sides signed a Memorandum of Understanding for training of diplomats and a Letter of Intent for training Guatemalan English Teachers in India. These agreements will be valid for three years and will be extended thereafter, if required. 

During the talks, Shri Naidu said “In the integrating world order, all the countries need to work together for mutual benefit and for this reason, India is keen about enhancing its engagement with Latin America. India is now making rapid strides with a stable government and able leadership with focus on Reforms and Performance for Transformation. India and Latin American countries could benefit hugely from increased cooperation for enhanced trade and investments”. 

At the banquet hosted for the visiting delegation, Guatemalan Vice President Dr. Franco invited India to send a delegation to the Conference of Ibero America to be held in Guatemala City in November this year which is to be attended by all the Latin American Countries besides Spain and Portugal. This is the first time India got such an invitation for the conference held once in three years. Shr Naidu invited Guatemala to join the International Solar Alliance stating it has found wide appeal with 61 countries already joining it.  

Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Shri Jaswant Sinh Bhabor and Members of Parliament Shri Anil Desai (RS-Shiv Sena), Smt. Chhaya Verma (RS-Congress), Shri Tiruchi Siva(RS-DMK) and Shri Kamlesh Paswan (LS-BJP) besides Smt. Preeti Saran, Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs and senior officials participated in the delegation level discussions.

The Vice President assured the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister on the Kosovo issue, and said that there is no change in India’s principled stand and does not recognize Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) of Kosovo. India has opposed Kosovo's application for membership of various international entities including UNESCO, World Custom Organization (WCO), Interpol, etc, he added.

The Vice President said that there is an immense scope to improve bilateral trade with Serbia. Happy to note that the bilateral trade between India and Serbia has increased in recent years and has reached about 200 million US Dollars in 2017, he added. 

The Vice President said that India is the fastest growing economy in the world and various economic reforms are being undertaken. Serbian companies can take advantage to participate in Indian economy through B-2-B model, he added. 

The Vice President appreciated the popularity of Yoga in Serbia and widespread celebration of International Day of Yoga across Serbia.  

The visiting Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia has invited the Vice President of India to visit their nation and the Vice President has responded positively.

                Namaste- Singapore!

Good Evening! 

नी हाओ

सलामत दतांग

वणक्कम
Minister इस्वरन

Business leaders, 

My Singaporean Friends, 

Members of Indian diaspora in Singapore, 

Namaskar to all of you! 



Today, here in this wonderful setting, we see the power of the relationship between India and Singapore. It’s our heritage; our people; and, a great partnership for our times. It is the grace and majesty, and the roar, of the two lions. It is always a pleasure to return to Singapore. It is a city that never fails to inspire. Singapore may be a small island, but its horizons are global. This great nation has shown us that size is no barrier to the scale of achievements or the strength of a nation’s voice in the world.


But, Singapore’s success also lies in the harmony of its multi-cultural society, in the celebration of its diversity, which under-lies a distinct and unique Singaporean identity. And, in this wonderful mosaic, there is an ancient thread, beautiful and colourful, that binds India and Singapore. 


Friends, 

The course of India’s centuries-old route to South East Asia also ran through Singapore. The human link is deep and enduring. It lives in the Singaporean Indians. And, this evening has been lit-up with your presence, your energy, your talent and your achievements.

Whether you are here through the chance of history or the opportunities of globalisation; Whether your ancestors came here generations ago, or you came here in this century; Each of you has become part of Singapore’s unique fabric, and its progress.


In turn, Singapore has embraced you, your merit and your hard work. Here in Singapore, you represent the diversity of India. If you want to see all festivals of India in one city, or celebrate them for weeks, Singapore is the place to visit.


That might also be true now for Indian food! I still remember the dinner Prime Minister Lee hosted for me in Little India.


Tamil is an official language here. But, it is a testimony to Singapore’s spirit that school children can also learn five other Indian languages. The city throbs with the finest of Indian culture. This is as much due to the talented Indian community as to the support from Singapore Government.


Here in Singapore you have even started a full competition in traditional Indian games. It brings you memories of your youth and enables children to connect to kho kho and kabaddi.


And, in 2017, International Day of Yoga was held at 70 centres in this city. That makes it one centre for every 10 square kilometres.


No other city in the world could have this Yogic intensity. Institutions like Sri Ramakrishna Mission and Sri Narayana Mission have been here for decades. In their service to society, without distinction between people, reflect the values that bind India and Singapore. 


In their journey through Singapore and the region, the greatest of Indian thinkers Swami Vivekananda and poet Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore found a common chord that connects India to the East. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s call to march for India’s freedom from the soil of Singapore -दिल्ली चलो- is an enduring flame in the heart of every Indian.

And, in 1948 a portion of Mahatma Gandhi’s ashes were immersed at Clifford Pier, just across the bay from here. Thousands from all sections of society witnessed the ceremony. A plane showered rose petals as the ashes were immersed. People took sips of water from the sea.

 

Day after tomorrow, I will have the honour to unveil a plaque at Clifford Pier to mark that solemn moment of our history. The moment which underlines even today the timeless and universal values of Mahatma Gandhi.


Friends, 

on the foundations of this extraordinary heritage, the wealth of our human links and the strength of our shared values, India and Singapore are building a partnership of our age. It is a relationship that truly meets the test of strategic partnership.

When India opened up to the world and turned to the East, Singapore became a partner and a bridge between India and ASEAN. Political relations between India and Singapore are among the warmest and closest. There are no contests or claims, or doubts.


It is a natural partnership from a shared vision. Our defence relations are among the strongest, for both. My Armed Forces speak with great respect and admiration for Singapore’s Armed Forces. India’s longest continuous naval exercise is with Singapore.


They are marking their Silver Jubilee now. We are proud to host Singapore’s Army and Air Force for training in India. Our ships regularly visit each other.

Many of you have been on board our naval ships. I, too, am looking forward to visiting a Singapore Navy Ship and an Indian Naval Ship at the Changi Naval Base day after tomorrow.


In international forums, we speak in one voice in the cause of a rules-based order, sovereign equality of all nations, and free and open pathways of commerce and engagement. Economics is the heart-beat of the relationship.


It is a partnership at the front-line of India’s global engagement. Singapore is both a leading investment source and destination for India. Singapore was the first country with which we signed a Comprehnsive Economic Cooperation Agreement.

Nearly 250 flights in each direction every week connect Singapore to 16 Indian cities. And, that is set to grow. India is the third largest source of tourists in Singapore and its fastest growing. Our IT companies are helping Singapore stay smart and competitive.


In many area of India’s development priorities, Singapore is a key partner: smart cities, urban solutions, financial sector, skills development, ports, logistics, aviation and industrial parks.


So, India and Singapore are contributing to each other’s prosperity. And, now we are building new partnerships for the digital world. Prime Minister Lee and I just made a tour of an outstanding exhibition of technology, innovation and enterprise. These are the bright youth of India and Singapore. 


Many of them are brilliant talent from India that have made Singapore home. They will be the bridge of innovation and enterprise between India, Singapore and ASEAN. A short while ago, we saw the international launch of RuPay, BHIM and UPI.


It is natural for these to be launched in Singapore! Together, we will work for using the power of mobile and digital technology for governance and inclusion. Together, we can build a great economic partnership of the new age.


As Singapore shapes a new future for itself, India emerges as the new global frontier of opportunities. Even in a year of deep structural reforms like the introduction of Goods and Services Tax, we remain the fastest growing major economy of the world.


And we intend to stay that-way. Our economy has become more stable. Fiscal deficit is down. Inflation rate is down. Current account deficit is comfortable. The currency is stable. And, the foreign exchange reserves are at a record high.


In India, the present is changing rapidly. A ‘New India’ is taking shape. And, there are many reasons for it. One, Economic reforms are taking place at a speed and a scale not known so far. Over 10,000 measures by Central and state governments in the last two years have helped us move up 42 places in the Ease of Doing Business rankings. 


Over 1,400 out-dated laws have been repealed. India is among the most open economies in the world. Foreign investors can go into almost all sectors, often with up to 100% equity. Indeed, more than 90% of investments in India are through this route.


Two, Tax regime has changed: lower tax rates, increased stability, faster resolution of tax disputes and electronic filing systems. Goods and Services Tax is the biggest tax reform since independence It has unified the nation into a single market and increased the tax base. 


This was not an easy task. But, it was done successfully. And, it has created new economic opportunities. Our personal income tax base has also expanded by nearly 20 million.


Three, our infrastructure sector is expanding at record speed. Last year, we built nearly 10 thousand kilometers of national highways – that is 27 kilometers daily, almost double the speed a few years ago.


Pace of rail track addition has doubled. Metro rails in several cities, seven High Speed Rail Projects, dedicated freight corridors, and modernisation of 400 railway stations will transform the rail sector.

Other projects include 10 green field airports; five new major ports; 111 rivers designated as National Water-ways; and over 30 logistics parks. We added over 80 thousand mega-watts of power in just three years.


And, in renewable energy, we have become the sixth largest producer in the world. That is our commitment to a green and sustainable future. Quite simply, the biggest infrastructure story of the world is unfolding in India.


Four, our manufacturing sector is rebounding. There has been a sharp rise in FDI in the past three years – from 36 billion U.S.dollars in 2013-14 to 60 billion U.S.dollars in 2016-17. There is also special focus on the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Sector.


We have launched sector-specific modernisation and productivity programmes, reduced corporate tax rate, and made tax benefits more attractive and easier. The Indian Startup sector is flourishing, and is now the third largest in the world.


My favourite scheme is, of course, the मुद्रा scheme that offers micro credit to the poor and the excluded. Over the past three years, 128 million loans worth more than 90 billion U.S. dollars have been extended – 74% of these have gone to women; yes, 74% to women! 


Five. We are strongly focussed on financial inclusion. In the course of the past three years, we have opened 316 million bank accounts for those who never had a bank account. Now, 99% of Indian house-holds have a bank account.


It is a new source of dignity and identity for every citizen, a remarkable story of inclusion and empowerment More than 12 billion U.S. dollars have been deposited in these accounts.


Government benefits worth more than 50 billion U.S. dollars have been transferred directly to the beneficiaries. They now have access to affordable pensions and insurance – everything that was once only a dream. Now here in the world has banking expansion taken place on such a scale and at such speed. 

Six, a digital revolution is sweeping through India. Through a biometric identity for everyone, a mobile phone in almost every pocket, and a bank account in everyone’s reach, every Indian’s life is getting transformed.


And, it is also transforming everything else in India: governance, public service, delivery of benefits to the poor, putting banking and pension within the reach of the poorest. For example, digital transactions are growing rapidly.


In 2017, just the UPI-based transactions grew seven thousand percent. In January, all digital transactions were valued at 2 trillion U.S. dollars. We are building broadband connectivity to two hundred and fifty thousand village councils, and we are setting up common service centres in each of those village councils.

These will offer many digital services and create thousands of rural jobs. Under Atal Innovation Mission, we are opening 100 incubation centres and we have opened 24 hundred tinkering labs across India for our children to become innovators and job creators. One of the exhibitors today is from one of these labs.

Seven, India will experience the largest wave of urbanisation in the world over the next two decades. It is a challenge, but also a huge responsibility and opportunity.

We are working to transform 100 cities into Smart Cities, and 115 aspirational districts into new centres of progress.


Mass transit, waste management, pollution control, sustainable habitat and affordable housing are programmes of great priority for us.


Eight, we are investing in skills and raising the standards of higher education to give a life of dignity and opportunity for our 800 million youth. With learning from Singapore, we are setting up advanced Institutes of Skill Development. And, in this fiscal year, we have launched a 15 billion U.S. dollar programme, to further strengthen our higher education system.


Nine, Agriculture sector is receiving a level of priority that it has not since the Green Revolution decades ago. We aim to double the income of farmers by 2022, when Independent India will be 75 and a ‘New India’ will be born.


For this, we are using technology, remote sensing, internet, digital financial system, soft credit, insurance, soil health improvement, irrigation, pricing and connectivity.

Ten, we want every citizen to enjoy what I call ‘Ease of Living’ by 2022. It means, for example, 50 million new houses so that there is roof over every head in 2022.

Last month, we reached a milestone. Each one of our 600 thousand villages are now connected to a power grid. We are also working to provide electric connection to every household.


We have launched this year AYUSHMAN Bharat, the National Health Insurance Scheme. It will cover 100 million families or 500 million Indians with annual coverage of 8000 U.S. dollars. This is simply the largest healthcare scheme in the world.


Quality of life is also linked to clean and sustainable development. That is one of our principal goals. It is rooted in our heritage and our commitment to the planet’s future. And, it informs every aspect of public policy and economic choices in India now.


It includes our mission of Clean India, clean rivers, clean air and clean cities. And, all these changes are taking place because of one and only one reason: our people. A nation of 1.25 billion people, with 65% under the age of 35 years, is on the move, eager for change, and confident about achieving a New India. That is also driving change in governance and politics.

Friends,

There is complete clarity and confidence about the pace and direction of economic reforms in India. We will make it easier and smoother to do business in India. We will work for an open, stable and fair international trade regime. And, our engagement to our East will be among the strongest, and economics will remain an integral part of our Act East Policy.


We want to see a comprehnsive fair, balanced agreement that lifts up all nations on the tide of trade and investment. We have just completed the review of India-Singapore Comprehnsive Economic Cooperation Agreement and we will work to further upgrade it.


We will work with all, most of all with ASEAN, to reach an early conclusion to Regional Comprehnsive Economic Partnership. As India’s engagement with the region grows, Singapore will remain a gateway to ASEAN and the broader East. This year, Sinagapore’s Chairmanship of ASEAN will take India’s relations with ASEAN further and farther ahead.


Friends,

In conclusion For Singapore, there is no better opportunity than India. Few countries have so much in common and so much in potential as India and Singapore. We mirror each other in our societies and we wish the same future for our region.


We pursue a world based on rule of law, and connected by open seas and a stable trade regime. Above all, we have the world’s most talented, dynamic, professional and committed Indian diaspora, proud to be Singaporeans, proud of their Indian heritage, ready to be the bridge between India and Singapore.


The future is a world of unlimited opportunities. It belongs to us. It is up to us to be ambitious and bold to seize it. This evening tells us that we are on the right path. The two lions shall step into the future together.

Thank you. 

Thank you very much.

Reiterating the importance of achieving a free, open, transparent, rules-based, peaceful, prosperous and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, where sovereignty and territorial integrity, international law, in particular UNCLOS, freedom of navigation and overflight, sustainable development and an open, free, fair and mutually beneficial trade and investment system are respected;

Acknowledgingtheneed to maintain maritime safety and security for peace, stability and sustainable economic growth and development in the maritime waters of the Indo-Pacific region as enshrined by UNCLOS and relevant international laws; 

Welcoming the elevation of bilateral relationship between the two countries to the level of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and creation of new mechanisms like bilateral security dialogue, trilateral dialogue, signing of an enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement and Framework Agreement on Cooperation in the Exploration and Uses of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes;

Appreciating the leadership role played by Indonesia and India as previous Chairs of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) to build a more peaceful, stable and prosperous Indian Ocean region through enhanced cooperation as mandated in the Jakarta Concord and Plan of Action as the results of the IORA Leaders' Summit held in March 2017 in Jakarta to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the IORA;

Noting that free and open seas, as regulated by UNCLOS, are essential for peace, stability and prosperity of the region and the international community;

Underscoring the importance to address the emerging maritime security issues facing the Indo-Pacific region including the smuggling of people, arms, drugs and money; illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; and the movement of terrorists;

Emphasizing our collective interests in a prosperous Indo-Pacific region by enhancing connectivity for promoting regional prosperity based on universally recognized international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency, equality and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in this regard looking forward to the expeditious conclusion of ASEAN-India Maritime Transport Agreement;

Exploring the convergences and complementarities in the region between India’s Act East Policy and Security and Growth for all in the Region (SAGAR), and Indonesian Ocean Policy and Indonesia’s Global Maritime Fulcrum Vision, while reaffirming the importance of the ASEAN centrality and unity; 

Recognizing of the importance of the Blue Economy as a driver of inclusive and sustainable economic growth and development in the region;

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Indian community in Jakarta. 
He spoke of the special ties between India and Indonesia, and recalled the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi earlier this year, where leaders from 10 ASEAN nations, including Indonesia, were present. He noted that it is no coincidence that in 1950, the President of Indonesia had been the Chief Guest at the Republic Day Parade in New Delhi. 

He said the members of the Indian diaspora in Indonesia are proud citizens of Indonesia, but wish to remain connected with their Indian roots as well.  

The Prime Minister said that in the last four years, India has witnessed unparalleled transformation. In this context, he spoke of FDI, openness of the Indian economy, ease of doing business, and competitiveness of the Indian economy.  

He said both countries are proud of their democratic ethos and diversity. He gave examples such as the Bali-Jatra, and similarities in cuisine and language to highlight the close cultural links between the two countries. He noted that earlier today, he and President Widodo had jointly inaugurated the Kite Exhibition, which included themes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. 

Talking about developments in India, he said that the Union Government is creating systems that are development-friendly and corruption-free. He said that going ahead from “Ease of Doing Business,” the focus is now on “Ease of Living.” Our processes are transparent and sensitive, he added. He gave an account of the dramatic developments that have taken place in a number of areas of infrastructure development. He spoke of India’s vibrant start-up ecosystem, and the International Solar Alliance.  
Both India and Indonesia have a sensitive outlook when it comes to helping those in need, the Prime Minister asserted. He said that India does not see the colour of anyone’s passport, and helps all fellow humans who require any assistance. He said India and Indonesia do not just rhyme in their names, but share a common rhythm in their culture, traditions, and democratic values. 

The Prime Minister invited the diaspora to visit India to witness first-hand, the changes taking place here.

                इंडोनेशिया में इंडिया को जीने वाले आप सभी बंधुओं को मेरा नमस्कार।

सलामत सोरे, तमान – तमान। (Good Evening Friends)

आपा काबार? (आप कैसे हैं।)

साया सनांग सकाली बर- अदा दी सिनी (मुझे यहां आकर बहुत खुशी है)

 

मैं इंडोनेशिया की जनता, आप सभी का और विशेषतौर पर राष्ट्रपति विडोडो का आभार व्यक्त करता हूं जिन्होंने रमज़ान के इस पवित्र महीने में मेरा स्वागत किया। आज सुबह इंडोनेशिया की विविधता की झलक भी देखने को मिली। विभिन्न पोशाक पहने हुए नागरिकों और बच्चों ने मेरा स्वागत किया। इसने मेरे ह्रदय को छू लिया।


साथियों, 

कुछ महीने पहले ही हमने सभी 10 आसियान नेताओं के साथ भारत का गणतंत्र दिवस मनाया। आसियान में इन्डोनेशिया सबसे बड़ी जनसंख्या का एक अहम सदस्य है। मैं राष्ट्रपति विडोडो का आभारी हूं कि उन्होंने हमें तब उनके आतिथ्य सत्कार का अवसर दिया। यह एक संयोग मात्र ही नहीं है कि सन् 1950 में भारत के पहले गणतंत्र दिवस में भी इंडोनेशिया के राष्ट्रपति मुख्य अतिथि थे।

 

साथियों,


बीते चार वर्षों में सवा सौ करोड़ भारतीयों के प्रतिनिधि के रुप में दुनिया में जहां-जहां भी मैं गया, मेरा प्रयास रहा है कि आप जैसे उन लाखों बंधुओं और बहनों से मिलूं, जिनका मूल भारत भूमि में है। इस दौरान मेरी जितनी भी बातचीत हुई, उसमें एक बात समान रही है। वो बात है मां भारती के प्रति अटूट श्रद्धा और सम्मान। यहां इंडोनेशिया में भी यही भावना मैं अपने सामने देख सकता हूं। इंडोनेशिया के प्रति आपकी जितनी भक्ति है, उतनी ही प्रबल भावना अपनी जड़ों से जुड़ने की है। आप में से अधिकांश इंडोनेशिया के नागरिक हैं लेकिन हृद्य के एक कोने में कहीं भारत भी बसा हुआ है।

 

साथियों,

 

हमारा संस्कृत और संस्कृति का रिश्ता है। और आप सभी जो यहां इंडोनेशिया में आज रच बस गए हैं, हमारे इस रिश्ते की मजबूत कड़ी हैं। आप में से यहां कई चार-पांच पीढ़ियों से हैं तो, ऐसे भी तमाम लोग हैं जो बीते दो-तीन दशकों से यहां पहुंचे हैं। आज आप में से कोई कपड़े के कारोबार से जुड़ा है तो कोई स्पोर्ट्स के सामान का व्यापार कर रहा है। कोई इंजीनियर है, कोई कंसल्टेंट। कोई सीए है तो कोई बैंकर तो कोई अध्यात्मिक गुरू। भारत से ही संबंध रखने वाले श्री गुरुनाम सिंह जी ने 1962 के जकार्ता एशियन गेम्स में इंडोनेशिया के लिए मेडल भी जीता था। मुझे बहुत प्रसन्नता भी है और गर्व भी, कि अपने तप से, कठिन परिश्रम से ना सिर्फ आप सभी ने यहां के परिवेश को अनुकूल बनाया, बल्कि आज आप इंडोनेशिया के विकास में भी बहुत बड़ा योगदान दे रहे हैं।

 

साथियों,

एक दौर वो भी था, जब आपके पूर्वजों को अलग-अलग परिस्थितियों की वजह से भारत छोड़ना पड़ा। आज एक दौर वो भी है जब दुनिया भर में भारत की मजबूत पहचान बनी है। पिछले 4 वर्षों में भारत ने दुनिया की अर्थव्यवस्था को आगे बढ़ाने का काम किया है।

 


	आज भारत दुनिया की सबसे open economies में से एक है। भारत में रिकॉर्ड स्तर पर विदेशी निवेश हो रहा है।
	भारत का Foreign Exchange Reserve लगभग 300 बिलियन डॉलर से बढ़कर 400 बिलियन डॉलर के पार पहुंच गया है।
	Greenfield FDI को आकर्षित करने वाला भारत दुनिया का नंबर वन देश बन गया है।
	FDI Confidence Index में भारत top two emerging market में से एक है।
	वर्ल्ड इकोनॉमिक फोरम के Global Competitiveness Index में भारत की रैंकिंग 71 से सुधरकर 40 हो गई है।
	Ease of Doing Business की रैंकिंग में भारत 142 से सौवें नंबर पर आ गया है।
	Logistics Performance Index में 19 अंकों का सुधार हुआ है।
	Global Innovation Index में भारत की रैकिंग 21 अंक उछली है।
	अंकटाड की रिपोर्ट में भारत को भविष्य की मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्थाओं में Top तीन में रखा गया है।
	पिछले 14 वर्षों में पहली बार Moody's ने भारत की क्रेडिट रैंटिंग में सुधार किया है।



 

भाइयों और बहनों,


भारत जहां दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा लोकतंत्र है वहीं इंडोनेशिया में भी लोकतंत्र की जड़ें बहुत मजबूत हैं। यही कारण है कि जिस प्रकार सवा सौ करोड़ भारतीयों ने मुझ जैसे साधारण नागरिक को प्रधान सेवक बनने का अवसर दिया, वैसे ही इंडोनेशिया की जनता ने भी विडोडो जी को अपना राष्ट्रपति चुना। साथियों, भारत और इंडोनेशिया सामाजिक और सांस्कृतिक विविधता और सद्भाव के प्रतीक हैं। यहां अनेक भाषाएं बोलियां हैं, सैकड़ों समुदाय रहते हैं, तो भारत में भी कोस-कोस पर बदले पानी, चार कोस पर वाणी की कहावत मशहूर है। मैंने कहीं पढ़ा है कि इंडोनेशिया के बोर्नियो द्वीप में सत्रह सौ साल पहले के अवशेष हैं जो भारत के साथ संबंधों के सबूत हैं। अभी तीन-चार दिन पहले ही मैं ओडिशा के कटक में था। वहां पर जिस मैदान में विशाल जनसभा का आयोजन किया गया, उसका नाम था ‘बालीजात्रा’। बालीजात्रा का क्या मतलब है? इंडोनेशिया के बाली की यात्रा। सैकड़ों वर्ष पूर्व ओडिशा के महान नाविक, कटक से निकलकर ही जावा-सुमात्रा और बोर्नियो तक आते थे। आज भी हर साल अक्तूबर-नवंबर में ओडिशा में ‘बालीजात्रा’ का उत्सव बहुत ही शान, बहुत ही धूम-धाम से मनाया जाता है।इंडोनेशिया का गुजरात से भी पुराना नाता रहा है। जब मैं गुजरात का मुख्यमंत्री था, तो एक बार मुझे किसी ने कहा था कि 12वीं सदी के आसपास कच्छ में रहने वाले जो मुसलमान निकले, उनमें से काफी यहां इंडोनेशिया में भी आकर बसे थे। उन लोगों के साथ गुजराती भाषा, गुजराती खान-पान भी इंडोनेशिया पहुंची थी। मुझे बताया गया है कि बुबुर गुजरात, गुजराती खिचड़ी इंडोनेशिया में कई मुस्लिम परिवारों में भी बनाई जाती है। आज भी कई ऐसे शब्द इस्तेमाल में हैं जो भारत इंडोनेशिया के संबंधों की प्राचीनता और घनिष्ठता पर प्रकाश डालते हैं । जैसे भाई के लिए 'सहोदर', निधन के लिए 'माटी', रंगों या colourके लिए 'वर्ण', Group के लिए 'समूह' या 'समूअ', 'उपवास' और 'पुवास', 'बहासा' और 'भाषा'; 'रूपियाह' और 'रुपया'। ऐसे शब्दों को इकट्ठा करें तो पूरी डिक्शनरी बन जाएगी।ये समानताएं स्वाभाविक हैं। भारत और इंडोनेशिया के बीच सिर्फ 90 नॉटिकल मील का फासला है। यानि, हम 90 नॉटिकल मील दूर नहीं, 90 नॉटिकल मील पास हैं। पड़ोसी हैं।


साथियों, 

मुझे बताया गया है कि भारत और इंडोनेशिया के गहरे सांस्कृतिक संबंधों को यहाँ कई प्रकार से मनाया जाता है।यहां ‘इंडोनेशिया तमिल संगम’ के सांस्कृतिक आयोजनों को भी एक अलग पहचान मिली है। पिछले वर्ष जकार्ता व अन्य स्थानों पर अंतरराष्ट्रीय योग दिवस पर आयोजित सफल कार्यक्रमों के बारे में भी मुझे बताया गया है। मुझे यह भी जानकारी मिली है कि बाली में मशहूर भारतीय Traditional medicines के सेंटर, पंचकर्म-आयुर्वेद सेंटरों की लोकप्रियता निरंतर बढ़ रही है। हाल के वर्षों में Holistic Healthcare के प्रति दुनिया भर में आकर्षण बढ़ा है। आपके लिए भी पारंपरिक भारतीय चिकित्सा पद्धतियों का Ambassador बनने का ये बेहतरीन अवसर है।


साथियों, 

वैसे, ये भी एक संयोग ही है कुछ दिन पूर्व ही मुझे नेपाल के जनकपुर में मां जानकी का आशीर्वाद लेने का अवसर मिला था। और अब में यहां इंडोनेशिया में हूँ, जहां पर रामकथा को एक नयी भूमि और नये परिवेश मिले। ये अपने आप में इंडोनेशिया की विशेषता है कि यहां रामायण का मंचन करने वाले कलाकार मुस्लिम हैं। आज कुछ समय पहले राष्ट्रपति विडोडो और मैंने पतंगों की एक प्रदर्शनी देखी। यह देख कर बहुत ख़ुशी हुई की रामायण और महाभारत जैसी कथाओं और परम्पराओं को इंडोनेशिया के सामान्य जनजीवन में आज भी विशेष स्थान प्राप्त है।आस्था और संस्कृति किस प्रकार साथ-साथ पल्लवित और पोषित होते है, उसकी ये बहुत बड़ी मिसाल है।


साथियों, 

पिछली सदी में जब हम दोनों देश आज़ाद हुए तब से ही हम वैश्विक और क्षेत्रीय स्तर पर एक दूसरे के साथ सहयोग कर रहे हैं। बीते चार वर्षों से हमारे संबंधों में और प्रगाढ़ता आई है। आज भारत और इंडोनेशिया के बीच संबंध नई ऊंचाई पर हैं। राजनयिक हो, स्ट्रैटेजिक या फिर आर्थिक सहयोग, भारत और इंडोनेशिया साथ मिलकर चुनौतियों का मुकाबला कर रहे हैं, अवसरों का उपयोग कर रहे हैं। आज भारत और इंडोनेशिया ने अपनी स्ट्रैटेजिक साझेदारी को एक अलग स्तर पर ले जाने का निर्णय लिया है। राष्ट्रपति विडोडो और मैंने आज इसे एक कदम और आगे बढ़ाकर ‘काम्प्रिहेन्सिव स्ट्रैटेजिक पार्टनरशिप’ का दर्जा दिया है। हमारी सेनाओं के बीच सम्मिलित अभ्यास हो रहे हैं। सुरक्षा से जुड़े मुद्दों पर भी हमारे बीच तालमेल बढ़ रहा है। आज इंडोनेशिया ASEAN देशों में भारत का सबसे बड़ा व्यापारिक साझेदार है। आज हमारा व्यापार 18 अरब डॉलर से अधिक तक पहुंच चुका है।


साथियों, 

भारत और इंडोनेशिया के बीच मजबूत संबंधों का एक और आधार है हमारे लोग । यानि आप सब। हमारे यहां एक बहुत बड़ी आबादी ऐसी है जो 35 वर्ष से कम उम्र की है। इनकी ऊर्जा को सही दिशा और प्रोत्साहन देने का प्रयास बीते चार वर्षों से भारत में हमारी सरकार ने किया है। इसीलिए, मेरी सरकार के काम करने की स्पीड तेज़ है और scale बहुत व्यापक है। देश के लोगों की आशाओं-अपेक्षाओं के अनुरूप हमने Good Governance पर बल दिया है, Minimum Government, Maximum Governance पर बल दिया है। हम Citizen-First के मंत्र को लेकर आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। सरकार बहुत ग्राउंड लेवल पर जाकर बड़े प्रशासनिक, वित्तीय और कानूनी कदम उठा रही है।हमारी सरकार के लिए Corruption Free, Citizen-Centric और Development Friendly Ecosystem सबसे बड़ी प्राथमिकता है। पासपोर्ट के लिए अब भारत में महीनों या हफ्तों का इंतजार नहीं करना पड़ता, दो से तीन दिन में पासपोर्ट लोगों के घर पहुंच जाता है। इंडोनेशिया समेत 163 देशों के लोगों को e-Visa की सुविधा दी गई है। e-Visa पर भारत आने वाले टूरिस्टों की संख्या में करीब-करीब 150 प्रतिशत की बढोतरी हुई है।बीते वर्षों में भारत में 1400 से ज्यादा पुराने कानून खत्म किए जा चुके हैं। Goods and Service Tax - GST ने भारत को एक बेहतर Tax Compliance सिस्टम, बेहतर Revenue सिस्टम दिया है।


साथियों, 

हम देश के नागरिकों के लिए Ease of Living और देश के लिए Modern Infrastuructureके Unique Combination पर काम कर रहे हैं। हम भारत में एक ऐसे सिस्टम का निर्माण कर रहे हैं जो ना सिर्फ Transparent हो बल्कि Sensitive भी हो।

 


	रेलवे लाइनों को ब्रॉड गेज में बदलने की रफ्तार दोगुनी हो गई है।
	रेल लाइनों का बिजलीकरण तीन गुनी रफ्तार से हो रहा है।
	गांवों में सड़कें और नेशनल हाइवेज मेरी सरकार दोगुनी रफ्तार से बना रही है।
	पहले जिस स्पीड से पावर ट्रांसमिशन लाइन बिछाई जा रही थी, आज यही काम उससे दोगुनी रफ्तार से हो रहा है।
	पहले सिर्फ 59 गांव पंचायतों के मुकाबले हमने 1 लाख 10 हजार से ज्यादा ग्राम पंचायतों को ऑप्टिकल फाइबर से जोड़ दिया है।
	पहले सिर्फ 28 सरकारी योजनाओं के मुकाबले अब 400 से ज्यादा योजनाओं का पैसा लोगों को सीधे बैंक खाते में मिल रहा है।
	यहां तक की जो LED बल्ब पहले साढ़े तीन सौ रुपए में मिला करता था, वो भी अब 40-50 रुपए में मिलने लगा है।
	पहले जहां भारत में सिर्फ 2 मोबाइल मैन्यूफैक्चरिंग कंपनियां थीं, वहीं अब इनकी संख्या बढ़कर 120 हो गई है। भारत में बन रहे मोबाइल ने Import करने का खर्च भी घटाकर आधा कर दिया है।



 

भारत में आज बड़ी संख्या में नए इंजीनियरिंग कॉलेज खुल रहे हैं, मैनेजमेंट कॉलेज, मेडिकल कॉलेज खुल रहे हैं। सिर्फ पिछले ढाई साल में भारत में 9 हजार से ज्यादा स्टार्ट अप रजिस्टर किए गए हैं। दुनिया का दूसरा सबसे बड़ा Start-up ecosystem भारत में बना है।आज दुनिया भर में भारत के पासपोर्ट की ताकत बढ़ी है। दुनिया की शक्तिशाली व्यवस्थाओं का भारत हिस्सा बना है। भारत Solar Energy को मानव कल्याण के हित में ज्यादा से ज्यादा इस्तेमाल करने के लिए International Solar Alliance की अगुवाई करने वाले देशों में से एक है। हमारी सरकार भारत को 21वीं सदी की आवश्यकताओं- आशाओं-अपेक्षाओं के अनुरूप तैयार करने का काम कर रही है। आज भारत न्यू इंडिया के संकल्प के साथ आगे बढ़ रहा है। हमें न्यू इंडिया बनाना है 2022 तक, जब स्वतंत्र भारत 75 वर्ष का होगा।

यहां इंडोनेशिया में सुख-दुख में एक दूसरे का साथ देने की परंपरा और वसुधैव कुंटुबकम के मंत्र पर आप अडिग हैं। मुझे बताया गया है कि हाल में बाली में जो ज्वालामुखी का हादसा हुआ, उसमें फंसे हज़ारों भारतीय पर्यटकों को बाली और सूराबाया के लोगों ने न सिर्फ बचाया बल्कि उन्हें स्वदेश भेजने का प्रबंध भी किया। इस मानवीय व्यव्हार के लिए मैं आपकी दिल से प्रशंसा करता हूँ। और आपको धन्यवाद भी देता हूँ।मानवीय मूल्यों का यही संरक्षण भारत की विरासत का अभिन्न अंग रहा है। हम इसे भारत में भी उतने ही गौरव के साथ जी रहे हैं। चाहे नेपाल में भूकंप हो या श्रीलंका में बाढ़ की आपदा, भारत की पहचान संकट के समय सबसे पहले उपस्थित रहने वाला देश के तौर पर बन रही है। संकट में फंसे 90,000 भारतीयों को एनडीए सरकार के दौरान सुरक्षित वापस लाया गया है।


साथियों, 

India और Indonesia सिर्फ नाम से ही मिलते जुलते नहीं हैं। यह तालमेल सिर्फ तुक यानि Rhyme का ही नहीं, ताल यानि Rhythm का भी है। यह तालमेल हमारी संस्कृति का है, हमारी परंपराओं का है। हमारी आस्था का है, व्यवस्था का है। लोक संपर्क का है, लोकतंत्र का है।


भाइयों और बहनों, 


भारत और इंडोनेशिया सांस्कृतिक बंधन से बंधे हुए हैं। हमारे बहुत पुराने संबंध हैं। लेकिन आज हम सभी के सामने ये भी सवाल है कि क्या ये पुरातत्व का ही विषय रहेगा? हमारी आने वाली पीढ़ियां, भविष्य में हमारा People to People Contacts और कैसे बढ़े, कैसे मजबूत हो, जीवंत रहे, इस पर भी हमें मिलकर काम करना होगा।आप में अनेक ऐसे होंगे जो कभी भारत नहीं गए। ऐसे भी कई लोग होंगे जिनका काफी सालों से स्वदेश जाना नहीं हुआ होगा। मेरा आपसे आग्रह है कि, एक बार अपने दोस्तों के साथ भारत ज़रूर आएं। भारत में किस प्रकार बदलाव आ रहा है ये आप अनुभव कर पाएंगे। मैं आपको बताना चाहता हूँ कि इंडोनेशिया के नागरिकों को 30 दिन के लिए भारत यात्रा के निशुल्क वीसा की व्यवस्था की जा रही है।अगले कुछ महीनों में एक बड़ा अवसर आपका इंतज़ार कर रहा है। अगले वर्ष जनवरी में उत्तर प्रदेश के प्रयाग में कुंभ का आयोजन होने वाला है। आस्था का ये मेला आपके लिए एक नया अनुभव होगा। यहां आपको अपने भारत की समृद्ध आध्यात्मिकता का दर्शन तो होगा ही, New India की झांकी भी मिलेगी। आपको मैं New India में बन रहे नए अवसरों से जुड़ने का आमंत्रण देता हूं। आप आइए और बदले माहौल का लाभ भी उठाइए। तथा उसे और बदलने में अपना योगदान भी कीजिये।


आपने मुझे यहां इतना मान दिया, सम्मान दिया, इसके लिए फिर एक बार आपका और इंडोनेशिया की सरकार को यहां के प्रशासन को मैं बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद देता हूं।


तेरीमा कासिह कालियान तलह बर-अदा दी सिनी (यहां आने के लिए आप सब का बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद)
सलामत रमादान !

                Your Excellency,
President Joko Widodo,
Distinguished Delegates,
Members of Media,
(Selamat Siang)

Namaskar!

It is my first visit to this great and beautiful country. First of all, I express my gratitude to President Widodo for my very warm welcome and the very wonderful arrangementsmade for this visit. I was particularly touched by the way Indonesian citizens and small children welcomed me in their national costumes. I have deep respect for President’s vision, for his visionary leadership and his personal commitment to strengthening our partnership.

Friends,

I am deeply sorry for the killing of innocent people of Indonesia in the recent terrorist attacks. India strongly condemns such attacks. In this difficult time, India stands firmly with Indonesia. Such tragic incidents gives the message that there is a need to bring more vitality in the efforts being made on the global level to fight terrorism.

Friends,

The Panchsheel philosophy of Indonesia is a living testimony of the prudence and vision of the people of Indonesia. It has also made uninterrupted unification of cultural traditions with religious beliefs. As maritime neighbors and strategic partners our concerns are the same.It is our duty to ensure the safety and security of the maritime routes. It is also important for protection of our economic interests. In today's changing Indo-Pacific region,ours is a very special geo-strategic location. We are facing similar development and environmental challenges.As partners in the Indo-Pacific region, we have shared interests in each other's progress and prosperity. And so, we have agreed on Shared Vision and Principles for the Indo-Pacific region.

Friends, 

India’s ‘Act East Policy’ along with our vision of ""SAGAR"" i.e. Security and Growth for All in the Region – coincides with President Widodo’s Maritime Fulcrum Policy. We had prepared a roadmapduring the visit of President Widodo to India In December 2016. In our discussions today we have assessed the progress made on its implementation. Agreements made between us today will help us to further improve our bilateral relations.I am happy that we have decided to upgrade our partnership to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. We will double our efforts to take our bilateral trade to the level of $ 50 billion by 2025. And I also congratulate the positive contribution of our CEO Forum to help in these efforts.

Friends,

Since millennia we have had strong cultural relations between the two countries. A glimpse of these was also seen in the parade held during our Republic Day this year. Tableau highlightingASEAN-India relations in this year’s parade had depicted the ""Bali Jatra"" festival of India's Odisha state. This annual festival is an example of the fact that our thousands of years of cultural relations are still going strong today. Next year in 2019, we will celebrate 70th anniversary of establishment of our diplomatic relations.During this time, many festivals will be organized in both the countries. A large number of Indian tourists visit Indonesia, especially Bali. By making Uttarakhand and Bali twins, this exchange will further increase.Most of the population in both countries is young. To realize the dreams of these young people and to create employment opportunities for them, we can learn from each other in the fields of education and skill development. We have agreed to increase our cooperation in education and science and technology. We welcome the ideas of Indonesian leadership to increase cooperation and extend cooperation in the IT services sector of India. This will be a beneficial partnership for both countries.

Friends,

India-ASEAN partnership is such a force for peace and shared progress in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.We value the positive role of Indonesia in the ASEAN. The efforts of this association for comprehensive regional cooperation and integration is also an example and an inspiration. I have expressed our gratitude to President Widodo for the strong support of Indonesia in developing India's strategic partnership in ASEAN.I offer my best wishes to Indonesia for hosting the 18th Asian Games in August. I believe this will be a very spectacular and historic event. And in this holy month of Ramadan, I wish for the prosperity, good health and success of all the people of Indonesia on behalf of 1.25 billionIndians and congratulate them for the upcomingfestival of Id-ul-Fitr.

Many many thanks.

(Tarima Kasi Banyak)

                Brothers and sisters,

 It’s my good luck that today I got the opportunity to speak tothe people who are actively involved with a scheme that is very dear to my heart, the enterprising youth and the sisters who came out leaving behind tradition. You are such people who built your path instead of following the traditional way and you built path with courage and will power. You contributed in a big way to the  country’s prosperity and happiness. 

Today, the whole country has joined me in listening to the story of your courage, of the decisions taken by you, of your initiativein  this journey through this video conference. Only last month, I had the opportunity to spend some time with the beneficiaries of the Mudra scheme at the Prime Minister’s residence. Their experiences, their struggle and the stories of their progress gave  satisfactionand also filled my heart with pride. I had decided that day itself that if I get a chance, I would talk to the Mudra beneficiaries, I would chitchat with them. And, today, both your time and my time are being saved because of technology. I can hear your experiences,realise your feelings directly and no intermediaryis required between us. 

The contribution made by the entrepreneurs like you is very important for  the country’s economy. You are aware that loan fairs were organised 25-30 years ago for political benefit. And the people who were politically affiliated, their minions, contractorsand those doing vote bank politics, all such people used to get money from banks. A lot of news items were also published that how much bank loan has been given. No one cared to ask what happened thereafter. We neither organised loan fairs nor did we provide space to any broker. The youth of the country, the mothers and sisters of the country those who wanted to do something on their own, those who wanted to talk to bank officials directly, for them we prepared a product – Mudra Yojana – which became a very big opportunity for those countrymen who wanted to do something. We trusted our small entrepreneurs, we trusted their business skills; we gave them loans under the Mudra Yojanaso that they can start their own business and expand it. Mudra Yojana not only created opportunities for self- employment but also has been acting as a job multiplier. 

Since independence licence regime remained in place in our country. Those who knew someone only they were able to get loans; the work of only those people was done who had references. In some way or other, this system kept the poor people out of the system because they neither had a big name nor any approach. It was one of the big reasons because of which thousands of small entrepreneurs could neither start their business nor expand them as per their abilities. For financial assistance, they remained trapped under the grip of money lenders. 

There was a time in this country when the Finance minister himself used to make phone calls for arranging loans for big industrialists. On the other hand a small entrepreneur used to be trapped in paying 30-40% interest to money lenders in such a way that he could not get out of it in his entire life. This vicious cycle was destined to be broken someday, it was to be broken by someone. We have made efforts in this direction and we have succeeded. We have been breaking apart this vicious cycle. 

With trust and confidence; with the government’s faith in poor people, faith in their dreams and hard work of poor people… 

Had the youth of the country got a scheme like Mudra Yojanadecades ago I am sure the problem of migration towards cities would not have been so acute. Young people would do business on their own staying back in their cities or villages if they were able to avail bank loans without guarantee, had they got the bank loans on low interest rates. Today, the poorest of the poor is getting  bank loan without a collateral. Today, even a common man, without any special name or reference can become an entrepreneur with the help of Mudra loan. And, today, it is not necessary to have a friend or relative in the government.  Today, there is no dearth of talent in the country. Everybody has some skill in one field or another, the need is to recognise that skill and to encourage him. Mudra Scheme has been providing strength to these skills of the people, particularly of the youth. 

When skills are encouraged then they blossom further and a change is brought about in the life. Suppose, someone has a skill in making embroidery on cloths; he or she started a business of making embroidery on cloths by borrowing money under the Mudra Yojana. Gradually, he or she would start a business of designer clothes. Someone got the help in starting his handloom business. In a way, Mudra Yojana has done the job of polishing the skills of the common man. It has done the job of getting recognition of those skills and has done the job of empowering people. Under the Mudra Yojana, an amount of Rs. 5.75 lakh crore has been disbursed among 12 crore beneficiaries. 

    At times it happens that the government has funds for schemes but it cannot be fully utilised. But you will be surprised to know that Mudra is such a scheme where the loan amount has exceeded the target. 

   Under this scheme, 28 per cent, or nearly Rs. 3.25 lakh crore have been given to those people who have for the first time started their business. In a way, these are those people who became  employed after a long spell of unemployment. 

The most satisfactory thing in this scheme is that 74% beneficiaries of the scheme are women, it means about 9 crore beneficiariesare women. When a woman makes progress, when she becomes the centre of economic activity then the confidence of the entire family goes up and entire thinking changes and society becomes empowered. Similarly, 55 per cent of the total loan amount under the Mudra Yojana have been given to members of backward communities. It means out of total 12 crore beneficiaries 55 per cent of loan money have been given to the entrepreneurs of SC/ST and OBC communities. We have been hearing slogans for decades in the name of poverty, we have heard the talk about the upliftment of poor but Mudra Yojana is such a scheme which has been doing the work of giving financial and social power to the backward communities without any discrimination, it has been doing the work of empowering them.

Meanwhile, several institutions have joined the bandwagon. Today, not only 110 banks, but 72 Micro Financial Institutions and 9 Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have also been giving Mudra Loans.  Banks have simplified the process of granting Mudra loan. Paperwork has been made simple andcollecting documents is no longer a matter of  tension. Today, it is a matter of pride to be self-employed and you people are a source of inspiration for that.

The video conference is the second in the series of video bridge by the Prime Minister, interacting with various beneficiaries of Government schemes.

 

Expressing happiness at being able to interact with the beneficiaries, the Prime Minister said that the Mudra Yojana has become a job multiplier. He further added that the initiative has helped in relieving the entrepreneurs from the vicious cycle of moneylenders and middlemen. It has opened up new opportunities for youth, women and those who wanted to start or expand their businesses.

 

Under Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, Government has so fargiven out 12 crore loans worth Rs. 5.75 lakh crore. Out of which 28% of the loans worth Rs. 3.25 lakh crore were given to first time entrepreneurs.Of the total loans disbursed, 74% of the total beneficiaries were women and 55% of the loans were given to SC/ST and OBC communities.

 

Prime Minister, while addressing the PMMY beneficiaries, said that the scheme has transformed the lives of the poor. He said that by aiding small and micro businesses, the scheme has helped to strengthen people economically, socially and has given people a platform to succeed.

 

Emphasizing on creating self-employment, Prime Minister said that being self- employed is a matter of pride now and has helped people in achieving things that were considered impossible before.

 

During the interaction, Prime Minister said that if Mudra Yojana was implemented a few years ago, it would have helped lakhs of people to set up their own businesses and would have stopped migration to a great extent.

 

Interacting with the Prime Minister, beneficiaries explained how Mudra Yojana has helped to set up their own business and thereby helped to create employment for others.

 

Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a scheme launched by Prime Minister on April 8, 2015 for providing loans up to Rs. 10 lakh to the non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises. These loans are classified as MUDRA loans under PMMY. These loans are given by Commercial Banks, RRBs, Small Finance Banks, Cooperative Banks, MFIs and NBFCs.

Following is the text of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's departure statement prior to his visit to Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.

 

""I will be visiting Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore on 29 May – 2 June 2018. India has a robust strategic partnership with all the three countries.

 

On 29 May, I will be in Jakarta on the invitation of Indonesian Presiden Joko Widodo. This is my first visit to Indonesia as Prime Minister. I am looking forward to my discussions with President Widodo on 30 May, as also to our joint interaction with the India-Indonesia CEOs Forum. I will also address the Indian Community in Indonesia.

 

India and Indonesia enjoy strong and friendly ties and share deep historical and civilizational linkages. Both countries are multi ethnic, multi religious, plural and open societies. I am confident that my visit to Indonesia will create greater synergy between Asia’s two largest democracies and further elevate our bilateral ties.

 

On 31 May, on my way to Singapore, I will make a brief halt in Malaysia to congratulate the new Malaysian leadership. I look forward to meet Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad.

 

In Singapore I will be focusing on enhancing India-Singapore partnership in areas of Fintech, skill development, urban planning and artificial intelligence. Singapore entities have become major partners with India in areas like urban development, planning, smart cities and infrastructure development. My visit in Singapore presents an opportunity for both countries to engage further.

 

On 31 May, I will visit the India-Singapore enterprise and innovation exhibition. I will also address a business and community event followed by a roundtable meeting with select top CEOs of Singapore to discuss business and investment opportunities.

 

On 1 June, I will call on Singapore President Halimah Yacob. I will also hold delegation level talks with Singapore Prime Minister Lee, and am looking forward to my visit to the Nanyang Technological University where I would interact with young students.

 

That evening, I will deliver the keynote address at Shangri-La Dialogue. This will be the first time that an Indian Prime Minister would deliver this address. It would be an opportunity to articulate India’s point of view on regional security issues and maintenance of peace and stability in the region.

 

On 2 June, I will unveil a plaque at Clifford Pier, where Gandhiji’s ashes were immersed in sea on 27 March 1948. I would also visit some places of worship that have civilizational linkages with India. 

The last element of my programme would be a visit to the Changi Naval Base in Singapore where I will visit the Indian Naval Ship INS Satpura and interact with officers and sailors of the Indian Navy and Royal Singapore Navy.

 

I am confident that my visit to Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore will provide a further boost to our Act East Policy and enhance our relations and engagements with all the three countries.""

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with Ujjwala beneficiaries across the country, through video conference.

Three Ujjwala beneficiaries were present at each of over 600 centres across the length and breadth of the country, for this interaction.

An estimated 10 lakh people viewed the interaction through various platforms, which included the Narendra Modi App and various television news channels and social media platforms, among others.

Expressing happiness at being able to interact with the beneficiaries, and share their experiences, through technology, the Prime Minister said that the Ujjwala scheme has become a symbol of progress. He added that it is driving remarkable social transformation, which is in turn, influencing the holistic development of the country.

Approximately 4 crore women in rural areas have received LPG connections so far, through the UjjwalaYojana. In all, nearly 10 crore new LPG connections have been issued in the four years since 2014, as compared to 13 crore in the nearly six decade period from 1955 to 2014.

In his initial remarks, the Prime Minister quoted a story written by Munshi Premchand in 1933, to highlight the importance of easing the lives of home-makers. He said Ujjwala has brought about benefits through better health outcomes, freedom from poisonous smoke andcleaner fuel. He said women now have a greater opportunity to earn extra income, as time spent on cooking has been reduced.

The Prime Minister emphasized that the Union Government has been paying attention to ensure that there are no middlemen involved in this scheme, and the beneficiaries are chosen through a transparent process.

He said that 69 percent villages in India now have 100 percent LPG penetration, while 81 percent villages have more than 75 percent LPG penetration.

Interacting with the Prime Minister, beneficiaries explained how the LPG connection had reduced time spent on cooking, and enhanced the quality of life for the entire family.

                Victory to Mother India! 

My dear brothers and sisters who are present here in large numbers,

Four years ago you gave me an opportunity to serve the country with your immense support. It is evident that our government has been successful in leading the country in the right direction, from the fact that you all have come here in such large numbers to shower your blessings in the scorching heat of the sun in the month of May.

Brothers and sisters,

The love and affection shown by you is a result of the satisfaction of the master with his servant. On the completion of 4 years of the NDA Government under the leadership of BJP, this Prime Servant once again bows down to the 125 crore Indians and welcomes you.

Friends,

Today is an important day for the people of Baghpat in West Uttar Pradesh and Delhi NCR. Two major road projects have been dedicated - the first phase of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway and the second Eastern Peripheral Expressway. Rs. 11000 crore was spent on Eastern Peripheral Expressway while about Rs. 850 crore has been spent on the recent part of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway. This entire project costs about Rs. 5000 crores. Today, when I had the opportunity to walk on this new road, I realized that the 14-lane journey is going to make the life of people of Delhi NCR much smoother. A modern technique has been used and concrete has been merged with greenery.

Brothers and sisters,

It took only 18 months to complete this work. Today the 14-lane, 9 kilometre stretch has been inaugurated. However, the 9 kilometre stretch is also of great importance and the people of Patparganj, Mayur Vihar, Gaziabad, Indirapuram, Vaishali and Noida are well aware of it. The second phase of this expressway up to Meerut will also be completed at the same pace like this 9km stretch of road. After its completion, the distance between Meerut and Delhi can be covered in just 40-45 minutes.

Friends,

Delhi NCR is faced with not only traffic jam and congestion but also heavy pollution which is taking a monstrous form every year. One of the major reasons of pollution in Delhi is the vehicles entering Delhi and the subsequent long traffic jams. Taking this problem seriously, our government has planned to lay down expressways around Delhi. It will be done in 2 phases. I got the opportunity to inaugurate its first phase i.e. the Eastern Peripheral Expressway just a moment back. 

Brothers and sisters,

This expressway will reduce the number of vehicles entering Delhi by almost 30%. Those vehicles will pass through the outskirts. A system has been created by which not only the large vehicles and trucks but also the 50 thousand cars will not have to enter Delhi. Moreover, the Eastern Peripheral Expressway is the first expressway in the country, which is Access-Controlled Raw Green Field Expressway. This road has been constructed in just 500 days. These 2 massive projects are now ready at your service and are laced with latest technology. The energy needs will also be fulfilled by solar energy. This means, it will save time and fuel and will reduce pollution. It will also be easy now to transport milk, vegetables and grains from Western UP to Delhi.

Brothers and sisters,

Modern Infrastructure plays a significant role in raising the standard of living of the 125 crore people. This opens up the path towards 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'; because infrastructure doesn't discriminate between caste, creed, sect and the rich and the poor. This creates equal opportunities for everyone. Therefore, our government has given main thrust of its attention to infrastructure related to highways, railways, airway, waterway and power.

Friends,

We have spent more than 3 lakh crores in creating more than 28000 kilometres of new highways in the last 4 years. I want you all and my countrymen to hear it carefully. Until 4 years ago, Highways were constructed at the rate of 12km per day. While today, the highways are constructed at the rate of 27km per day. Under the Bharat Mala project, a provision of RS.5 Lakh crore has been made in this year's budget. Under this, highways of about 35 thousand kilometer are being constructed. Moreover, work is being done at an unprecedented rate not only in constructing highways but also in railways. A widespread network of railways is being laid down in areas that were not connected with railway network before. We are doubling up our efforts to change single lines into double lines and metre-gauge to broad-guage. Speed of trains is also being increased. We have removed about 5500 unmanned crossings in the last four years.

Brothers and sisters,

A new UDAN scheme has been launched to make air travel cheaper and to open up new air routes. Last year, about one crore people traveled by airways; this is more than the number of people who traveled in the air-conditioned coaches of the railways. I am telling you the story of the last 4 years. We are working on our dream so that even a person wearing slippers will be able to afford air travel. We are also emphasizing upon utilizing the country's potential in waterways to the optimum level. More than 100 waterways will soon come up across the country. Today Ships are sailing in river Ganga in UP. UP is going to be directly linked to the sea through river Ganga. Soon the large cargo ships will be able to reach the major ports of the country. Just like the river Ganga, a new scheme is being prepared for the river Yamuna.

Friends,

Wherever new transportation systems are being set up, new opportunities for industrial development are also being opened up. Keeping this in mind, we have announced the development of a new Defence industrial corridor in UP in this year's budget. This corridor will extend to Agra, Aligarh, Lucknow, Kanpur, Jhansi and Chitrakoot. These corridors alone will create new jobs for nearly two and a half lakh people.

Friends,

Everything for building a New India is being done on the basis of expectations of the youth and the middle class. Work is progressing at a rapid pace under the Bharat Net Plan for connecting every village of the country with internet. You can clearly see the pace at which our government is working. Just as I have given you the comparative figures for Highway development, I would like to give you another figure which is worth noting. The UPA government led by Congress could manage to connect only 59 or approximately 60 Panchayats with Optical Fibre network in four years of their tenure while we have connected more than 1 lakh Panchayats. On one hand less than 60 villages and on the other more than 1 lakh villages in four years! The country can clearly see how the work is being done. Make in India is giving an impetus to the manufacturing sector. Four years ago, there were only 2 factories for manufacturing cell phones in India. Now see for yourself where we have reached today. You will be glad to know that at that time only 2 factories manufactured mobile phones, while today 120 factories manufacture mobile phones out of which several are located within NCR. It has provided jobs to many youngsters. Some of them might be present here today.

Friends, 

The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise or the MSMEs play significant role in manufacturing. The MSME sector provides the largest opportunities for employment after the agricultural sector. In UP there is a network of nearly 50 lakh small enterprises. The centre and the Uttar Pradesh government are working together to further expand these industries. The central government has also given a huge tax relief to the MSME sector. The Uttar Pradesh government has taken a major initiative under Yogi ji. The ‘One District One Product’ scheme is significant in this case. The central government has prepared a road map for its contribution to the UP government's efforts in Skill India Mission, stand-up India and Start-up India Mission and Prime Minister's Employment Generation Scheme.

Friends,

Quality business and trade is possible only when an apt security system is in place. The people of West Uttar Pradesh are witnesses to the situation of the past. Today, under the leadership of Yogi ji, criminals are surrendering to the authority. The criminals are taking vows of not committing any crime in the future. I would like to congratulate both Yogi ji and Manoharlal ji for this. They have done a commendable job in UP and Haryana respectively in improving the law and order situation of both the states. They have linked the criminal tracking system amazingly! Earlier the criminals used to commit a crime here and hid in the other state or vice versa. However, today they have shut down all the paths of the criminals for such mischief. I congratulate both of them.

Brothers and sisters,

We are prioritizing women’s empowerment. 7.5 crore toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission and 4 crore gas connections under Ujjwala Yojana have made the lives of the women easy. 75% of the approximate 13 crore loans have been given to women entrepreneurs under Mudra Yojana. Can anyone imagine that 75% of the 13 crore loans raised is by the daughters, sisters and mothers of our country? In the last four years, we have honoured our women and empowered them.

Friends,

Apart from women, we have also taken several important steps in the past four years such as self-employment or social security for empowering the Dalits, oppressed and backward classes of the country. More than half of the loan was given to the Dalits and backward classes under the Mudra Yojana. The Dalit and women entrepreneurs have also benefited from the Stand-up India mission. It is an honour for our government that we have developed 5 places associated with the life of Babasaheb Ambedkar as Panch-Teerth or 5 centres of pilgrimage.

Friends,

I can assert with my experience that those who are selfish are engaged in politics of crocodile-tears or populist politics. On the other hand, the one who is in reality concerned about the problems of the Dalits, oppressed and the deprived section of the society engages him in welfare politics and not the populist one. Apart from providing opportunities, we have also taken several important decisions for providing justice and safety to my Dalit and backward brothers and sisters in the last four years.

We have made the laws related to atrocities against Dalits and tribals even more stringent. We have extended the list of number of atrocities against Dalits from 22 different crimes to 47. A Special Court is being set up for speedy trial of cases related to atrocities against Dalits.

Brothers and sisters,

We have decided to form a commission for sub-categorization of backward castes. The government wants to provide better facilities of reservation within the framework to those who are even more backward within OBC in the government and educational Institutions. Therefore, we have formed this Commission for sub-categorization of OBCs. 

Friends,

The government is also willing to provide a constitutional status to the OBC commission. The OBC community has been demanding it for the past 25 years. But the UPA government didn't bother about it. We have framed the law instead. We have framed important laws in the Parliament to provide constitutional status to the OBC commission. But the Congress and its allies were not supporting it. Therefore, they stood as an obstacle. Therefore, the law is still pending in the Parliament. But I assure the OBC community that the steps taken by Modi will definitely be fulfilled.

Brothers and sisters,

The fact is that Congress and its allies always create obstacles for anything done for the welfare of the poor, the Dalits, backward classes and tribals. They even take the development of the country as a mockery. They take the Swachh Bharat Mission as a joke and the toilets constructed for the poor women as a joke. They even made fun of the fact that our government was providing free gas connections to the poor women. The people with the anti-poor mentality also made fun of the fact that we were providing the poor with bank accounts. These people who are used to nepotism believe that anything done for the poor is a joke. People who tear and throw away the cabinet papers do not believe in showing respect for laws passed by the Parliament with majority. 

Today, the people are watching that for political benefits they are blatantly lying even upon the orders of the Supreme Court. They don't even think about the instability that could possibly be created due to their lies. They are spreading rumors and misleading the people about reservation or the laws related to atrocities against the Dalits. I have heard that they are spreading a new lie among the people and probably it has reached the people of this area. They are spreading this rumour among the farmers that 18% GST will be imposed on those farmers who will give his farm on contract or for share-cropping. I request the losing party to put a limit to their dirty politics. Such an extent of spreading lies! They are misleading my country's farmers. You don't know the extent of sin that you are committing. I request my farmer brothers and sisters not to pay any attention to such rumours and should complaint against those spreading these rumours. I promise you that those who spread such lies will be tackled by the law. 

Friends,

Our government is working upon the concept of 'Gramoday Se Bharat Uday'. My country's farmers, small workers of the villages and the agricultural labourers are the focus of the concept of 'Gramoday'. A provision of 14 lakh crore Rupees has been made to strengthen the infrastructure related to village and farming in this year's budget.

Moreover, schemes like 100% Neem coating of urea, Pradhan Mantri Sinchai Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, have benefitted the farmers and given them reassurance. Our government has decided to provide 1.5 times of the support price of the cost to the farmers. I also congratulate both the Chief Ministers for framing laws according to which maximum products will be purchased from the farmers under the new MSE rules. They have broken all the past records. I congratulate both the Chief Ministers and both the governments dedicated to the farmers.

We are working on the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana which is worth an investment of 6000 crores to prevent the wastage of food grains on the way to the markets from the farms. This scheme is going to benefit the potato producing farmers of the west UP the most. In this budget, a new scheme called 'Operation Green' has been announced which is related to new supply chain system. This will prove to be highly beneficial for the farmers producing fruits, flowers and vegetables.

Brothers and sisters,

Modern techniques like organic farming, apiculture, solar farms etc. are being promoted. Detailed schemes are being framed so that the farmers engaged in these sub-sectors of agriculture can easily avail loans.

Our government is also taking steps for the sugarcane farmers. Last year we had increased the support price of sugarcane by about 11%. This directly benefitted 5 crore sugarcane farmers. Making revolutionary changes in the country's ethanol policy, 10% blending of ethanol with petrol has been approved. Recently a major decision has been taken so that the amount due to the sugarcane farmers is not delayed by the sugar Mills. The government has decided to provide a subsidy of Rs.5 and 50 paise per quintal of sugarcane to the sugar mills. But this subsidy will not be given to the owners of the sugar mills. We are well aware of its misuse. Instead of giving the subsidy to the sugar mills, this amount will be deposited directly into the bank accounts of the sugarcane farmers. In this way, the amount meant for the farmers will not be stuck with the sugar mills. I want to assure the sugarcane farmers here that the government is sensitive towards their problems and is committed to resolving them with stringent measures.

Brothers and sisters,

We are also preparing our cities for the 21st century along with the development of our villages. The infrastructure of the cities is being strengthened with schemes like Smart Cities Mission and AMRIT Yojana. We are making extensive efforts so as to provide houses to the lower and middle income classes living in the cities. We are progressing at a rapid pace in this area compared to the Congress governments. In 10 years i.e. between 2004 and 2014, approximately 13.5 lakh houses were approved for construction in the urban areas whereas in the last four years we have approved 46 lakh houses and have reached almost 50 lakhs. We have done 3 times more work than the Congress. Congress had handed over the keys of 5.5 lakh houses in 10 years in urban areas whereas our government has handed over the keys of more than 8 lakh houses in urban areas within 4 years.

Brothers and sisters,

Urban infrastructure is also being prepared to handle the challenges of growing population. We have seen that 38 years of rule by a single family has led to unplanned growth in urban areas. We know where the problem lies. There was no proper system of removing the sewer from the cities or for water treatment. Our rivers are carrying garbage from the cities and depositing them in the seas. Our mother Ganga, in particular, is bearing the brunt of growing population and industrial pollution. Therefore, our government has started the Namami Gange programme. The government has not only emphasized upon cleanliness of Ganges but also is trying to ensure that no garbage is dumped into the river. So far, more than 200 projects of about 21000 crore Rupees have been approved by the government. Besides, Villages located on the banks of river Ganga are being made Open Defecation Free on a priority basis. Several villages of the 5 states viz. Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal through which mother Ganges flows, have been successful in this mission. 

Friends,

Several major Initiatives have been taken for cleaning the Ganga in the past. However, this government not merely talks about things but works to prove it. This is our work culture. This is our capital. We are ensuring that every penny of the public's hard earned money is spent on them. Therefore, we are trying to ensure that the sewage treatment plants that are being constructed should work properly because it was the culture of the Congress to construct sewage treatment plants that didn't work up to its maximum capacity. Moreover, those stopped working after a short span of time. Efforts are being made to remove this Congress culture from the projects related to mother Ganga.

Friends,

It is being ensured that the plants that are being built will work keeping in mind the needs that will arise 15 years later. Thus, our aim is not only to construct sewage treatment plants but also to run them smoothly.

Brothers and sisters,

Those who have deceived the country's poor, middle class, farmers and youth for 70 years have become frustrated to see the people's trust on the NDA government. This huge wave of people after four years is giving them sleepless nights. The fact is that they neither trusted the country's democracy nor the institutions under the constitution. Their mentality has been revealed completely in the last four years. The country has seen in the last few days how they have threatened the faith in the apex court.

The country is well aware of how they had questioned the Election Commission of India and the EVMs. They have also questioned the Reserve Bank of India and their policies. They have committed the sin of creating a crisis of faith in these Institutions. They are also questioning the agencies that are investigating their scams. Moreover, they even consider the media as biased.

Brothers and sisters,

Those who are worshippers of that one family can never worship democracy. They have even failed to acknowledge the courage of the Indian army during the surgical strike. When international agencies praise India, they cannot even digest that. They even question the same agencies that produced statistics for their government and are providing new statistics for the present government showing its better performance. They question and criticize even when a foreign guest comes and praises India.

Friends,

You and I know the cause of their frustration very well. It is quite obvious to be frustrated when the people lose trust in them. However, I didn't expect them to oppose the country while opposing Modi. But when someone has your faith and blessings i.e. the blessings of 125 Crore Indians then he will never get tired or stop ever.

Friends, my countrymen,

You can evaluate both the sides yourself. On that side are the people for whom their family is their country, while for me the country is my family. The 125 crore people of this country are my family members. I just have your blessings, love and trust to earn. I just have one work which is, serving the 125 crore countrymen. Our resolution of 'Shreshtha Bharat' will be strengthened by your cooperation. I thank you for coming here in such large numbers. The road that has been inaugurated today is an example of what the 21st century India will look like. Its significance is thus not limited to this area alone.

Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Sunday, dedicated to the nation, two newly built expressways in the Delhi NCR Region. The first of these is the 14 lane, access controlled, Phase-I of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, stretching from Nizamuddin Bridge to Delhi UP Border. The second project to be dedicated to the nation is the 135 km long Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), stretching from Kundli on NH 1 to Palwal on NH 2.

The Delhi Meerut Expressway, once completed, will significantly reduce travel times from the National Capital to Meerut, and to several other parts of Western Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. 

After the inauguration of the Delhi Meerut Expressway, the Prime Minister was greeted by people along the newly constructed road, as he travelled in an open jeep for a few kilometres, inspecting the highway. 

The Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), will contribute towards the twin objectives of decongesting and de-polluting the national capital by diverting traffic not destined for Delhi. 

Addressing  a public meeting in Baghpat on the occasion, the Prime Minister expressed confidence that the entire stretch of the Delhi Meerut Expressway would be completed soon. He said the Eastern Peripheral Expressway would help decongest traffic in Delhi. He said modern infrastructure has an important role to play in raising the standard of living of the people. He outlined the steps being taken in building infrastructure, including roads, railways, waterways etc. He gave examples of the increase in pace of infrastructure development. 

In the field of women empowerment, the Prime Minister explained how toilets built under Swachh Bharat Mission, and LPG connections under Ujjwala Yojana are making the lives of women easier. He said that out of 13 crore loans given under Mudra Yojana, more than 75 percent have been given to women entrepreneurs. 

The Prime Minister also mentioned the steps taken for Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Castes. 

The Prime Minister said that in this year's Union Budget, a provision of 14 lakh crore rupees has been made to strengthen rural and agricultural infrastructure.

                Namaskar. Through ‘Mann Ki Baat’, I once again have been blessed with the opportunity to be face-to-face with you. I am sure you distinctly remember that for the last many months, a naval team comprising six women Commanders was on a voyage. I want to tell you something about the ‘Naavika Saagar Parikrama’. These six illustrious daughters of India circumnavigated the globe for over more than 250 days on board the INSV Tarini, returning home on the 21st of May. The entire country welcomed them with open arms, with high spirits. They traversed a multitude of oceans, many a sea, over a distance of almost twenty two thousand nautical miles. This was a first of its kind event in the entire world. Last Wednesday, I got an opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences. Once again, I congratulate these daughters and their spirit of adventure for bringing laurels to the country, for raising the glory of the Navy and significantly so, for conveying to the world that India’s daughters are no less. Who does not know of the sense of adventure? If you view the journey of human evolution, you will notice that breakthroughs in progress have taken birth in the womb of some adventure or the other. There is an umbilical link between development and adventure; the resolve to achieve something, the burning desire to do something unparalleled, the sentiment proclaiming “I too can do it”. The number of such people may be miniscule, but they turn out to be sources of inspiration for millions of others, spanning an array of eras. Recently, you must have come across quite a few notable happenings pertaining to mountaineers attempting to scale Mount Everest. For centuries, Everest has been throwing the gauntlet at humankind. And for long, brave hearts have been responding to the challenge. 

On the 16th of May, a team comprising five tribal students of an Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra- Maneesha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madhavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam- scaled the world’s highest peak. These Ashram School students began training in August, 2017, covering Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh. These young boys & girls had been selected under ‘Mission Shaurya’. True to its name, they brought glory to the country with their brave deed of conquering the Everest. I congratulate these young friends and members of the school in Chandrapur, from the core of my heart. Just a while ago, 16 year old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to scale Everest from the Nepal side. Heartiest congratulations, Beti Shivangi. 

Ajit Bajaj and his daughter became the first ever father-daughter duo to ascend Everest. And it’s not that only the young are climbing Everest. On the 19th of May, Sangeeta Bahal, aged more than 50, scaled the Everest. There are some mountaineers who have shown that apart from possessing skills, they are sensitive too. 

A few days ago, under the ‘Clean Ganga Campaign’, a group from the BSF Scaled the Everest and while returning, removed loads of trash littered there and brought it down. This deed is commendable indeed; it also displays their commitment towards cleanliness and the environment. People have been ascending the Everest for years & many have managed to reach the peak successfully. I congratulate these daredevils, especially the daughters from the core of my heart. 

My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, just a couple of months ago, when I mentioned ‘Fit India’, I did not think it would draw such a good response; that a large number of people would come forward to support it. When I say ‘Fit India’, I believe that the more we play, the more we will inspire the country to come out & play. People are sharing videos of Fitness Challenge on social media; they are tagging each other to spread the challenge. Everybody is now getting connected with this Fit India Campaign. People from the film fraternity, from the world of Sports, common citizens of the country, members of the armed forces, school teachers or even those toiling in fields and farms, their rising notes are building up a crescendo ‘Hum Fit toh India Fit’… ‘If we are fit, India is fit’. For me, it’s heartwarming that the captain of the Indian Cricket team Virat Kohli ji has included me in his challenge… and I too have accepted his challenge. I believe this is gainful and this kind of a challenge will inspire us to be fit alongwith others, as well.

 My dear countrymen, many a time in ‘Mann Ki Baat’, you must have heard me mention a thing or two about sports & sportspersons. And in the last episode, our heroes of the Commonwealth Games shared with us their ‘Mann Ki Baat’, matters close to their hearts through this programme.

Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call. It is true that sports & games that were once a part & parcel of every child’s life, in every lane in the neighbourhood, are fading into oblivion. These games used to be a special feature of summer holidays. Sometimes in scorching afternoons; at times after dinner, children used to play with exuberant abandon for hours together, leaving all worries behind. Some games saw the participation of the whole family. Aiming the ball at the crooked column of stone slats- Pitthoo, playing marbles, testing one’s agility in Kho kho, spinning the top, Lattoo, or applying skills in swiftly flicking the tapered- edged wooden peg and hitting it aloft-Gilli-Danda, innumerable games were an inseparable part of each & every child’s life from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup. Of course, those games were known by different names, depending on the place. Pitthoo is one such game. Some called it Lagori, at other places it was Satoriya, Saat Pathar, Dikori, Satodiya… one game with many names! Traditional sports and games comprise both varieties… outdoor and indoor as well. The unity, intrinsic to our country’s diversity can be witnessed in these games. A single game is known by distinct names at different places. I am from Gujarat. I known of a game played in Gujarat called Chomal Isto. It is played with cowries or tamarind seeds or dice on an eight by eight square board. It used to be played in almost every state. Known as Chowkabara in Karnataka, Attoo in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakaali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Daayaam and Thaayaam in Tamilnadu, Changaa Po in Rajasthan, it had innumerable names. One realizes after playing, despite not knowing the language of a particular state, “Oh! We used to play this game in our state as well!” Who amongst us would not have enjoyed playing Gilli-Danda in our childhood? This is a game that is played across villages and cities. It is also known by different names. In Andhra Pradesh it is called Gotibilla or Karrabilla.In Odisha it’s called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra, Vittidaaloo. Some games are seasonal. There is a season for flying kites. While flying a kite or playing a game, one freely expresses one’s inherent unique qualities. You must have seen many a child, shy by nature, leap up with zest, the moment a game begins. Even children with a seemingly serious countenance start expressing themselves; while playing, the innate child within them comes to the fore. Traditional sports and games are structured in such a manner that along with physical ability, they enhance our logical thinking, concentration, alertness and energy levels. Games are not just games; they teach us values in life, such as, setting targets, building up determination, developing team spirit and fostering mutual co-operation. I recently noticed in a training programme in Business Management, our traditional sports and games being used for improving overall personality development and interpersonal skills. These games are proving to be handy in overall development. And then, there is no prescribed age limit for participating in them. From tiny tots to Grandfather-Grandmother, when we all play these games together then the term ‘Generation Gap’ disappears on its own. At the same time, we also come to know about our culture and traditions. Many games also make us aware about our society, environment and other spheres.

 It is a matter of concern, whether these sports & games will fade away to the point of extinction. It will not just be a loss of a game; it will be the loss of the spirit of childhood, something that will exist only in the verses of poetry.

Ye daulat bhi le lo

Ye shohrat bhi le lo

Bhale chheen lo mujhse meri jawani

Magar mujhko lauta do bachpan ka sawan

Wo kagaz ki kashti, wo baarish ka paani

 

Take away all my riches

Bereave me of all this fame

Snuff out my youth if you so wish 

But do return the monsoon that drenched me as a child

The puddles & my paper boats, the magic of my rains.        

And we will be forever reduced to listening to this song, hence we must keep our traditional sports alive.It is crucial that today schools, neighbourhoods and youth congregations should come forward and promote these games. Through crowd sourcing we can create a very large archive of our traditional games. The Videos of these games can be shot, outlining the way to play these games along with the mandatory rules and regulations.Animation films can also be made so that our young generations for whom these games played in our streets are something to marvel about, can see, play for themselves and thus bloom.

My dear countrymen, on the 5th of June, our nation, India will officially host the World Environment Day Celebrations. This is a very important achievement for India and it is also an acknowledgement as well as recognition of India's growing leadership in the direction of tackling climate change.

This time the theme is 'Beat Plastic Pollution'. I appeal to all of you, that while trying to understand the importance of this theme, we should all ensure that we do not use low grade polythene and low grade plastics and try to curb the negative impact of plastic pollution on our environment, on our wild life and our health. Let us all visit the World Environment Day website ‘wed-india 2018’ and try to imbibe and inculcate the many interesting suggestions given there into our everyday life.

Whenever we face a torrid summer, or floods, incessant rains or unbearable cold, everybody becomes an expert, analyzing global warming and climate change. But does empty talk bring about any solutions? Being sensitive towards nature, protecting nature, should come naturally to us; these virtues should be embedded in our sanskar.

In the past few weeks, we all witnessed that there were dust storms in the different regions of the country, along with heavy winds and unseasonal heavy rains. There was also loss of life and property. These calamities are basically the result of the change in weather patterns. Our culture, our traditions have never taught us to be at loggerheads with nature.

We have to live in harmony and in synchronicity with nature, we have to stay in touch with nature. Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this wisdom at every step of his life. Today when India speaks of climate justice or plays a major role in the Cop21 and Paris agreements or when we unite the whole world through the medium of International Solar Alliance, they all are rooted in fulfilling that very dream of Mahatma Gandhi.

On this environment day, let all of us give it a good thought as to what can we do to make our planet cleaner and greener? How can we progress in this direction? What innovative things can we do? The rainy season is fast approaching; we can set a target of achieving record plantation of trees this time and not only plant trees but also nurture and maintain the saplings till they grow.

My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, you do remember the 21stof June now;not only you and I, June 21stremains a part of the entire world’s collective consciousness. The 21stof June has been mandated and is celebrated as the International Yoga Day in the entire world and people start preparing for it months in advance. The news being received these days is that there are preparations afoot in the whole world to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day.

Yoga for unity and a harmonious society conveys a message that has permeated the world over. Centuries ago, the great Sanskrit Poet Bhartahari had written in his ‘Shataktrayam’.

धैर्यंयस्यपिताक्षमाचजननीशान्तिश्चिरंगेहिनी
सत्यंसूनुरयंदयाचभगिनीभ्रातामनःसंयमः।
शय्याभूमितलंदिशोSपिवसनंज्ञानामृतंभोजनं
एतेयस्यकुटिम्बिनःवदसखेकस्माद्भयंयोगिनः।।

[A man whose father is patience, mother is forgiveness and peace as consort, Truth as his friend, compassion as his sister and restraint for brother as family members and whose bed is the great earth, is clothed by the great sky and whose food is only knowledge. Is indeed a Yogi who won't know any fear.]

This observation expressed centuries ago, straightaway implies that practicing yogic exercises on a regular basis leads to imbibing benefic attributes which stand by our side like relatives and friends. The practice of yoga leads to building up of courage, which always protects us like a father. The practice of yoga leads to germination of a sense of forgiveness in the same manner as a mother has for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend. Bhartahari has said that with regular yogic exercise, truth becomes our child, mercy becomes our sister, self restraint our brother, earth turns in to our bed and knowledge satiates our hunger. When so many attributes become one's partner, then that yogi conquers all forms of fear. Once again, I appeal to all the citizens to adopt their legacy of yoga and create a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.

My dear countrymen, today is the 27thof May, the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji. I render my pranam to Pandit ji. Memories of this month are also linked with Veer Savarkar. This was the very month, the month of May 1857, when Indians had displayed their strength against the British. In many parts of the country, our youth and farmers demonstrated their bravery whilst standing up against the injustice. It is indeed sad that we kept on calling the events of 1857 only as a rebellion or a soldiers’ mutiny for a very long time.

In fact, May 1857 was not only evaluated as a minor historical incident but was also an attempt to dent our self-respect. It was Veer Savarkar who boldly expostulated by writing that whatever happened in 1857 was not a revolt but was indeed the First War of Independence. Savarkaralong with his band of brave hearts celebrated the 50thanniversary of the First War of Independence with great fanfare at India house in London. It is also an amazing coincidence that the month which witnessed the First Struggle for Independence was the month in which Veer Savarkar ji was born. Savarkar ji’s personality was full of special qualities; he was a worshipper of both weapons or shashtra and Knowledge or shaashtras.

Generally Veer Savarkar is renowned for his bravery and his struggle against the British Raj. But besides these sterling qualities, he was also a striking poet and a social reformer who always emphasized on goodwill and unity. A wonderful account about Savarkarji has been given by our dear honorable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji. Atal ji had said - Savarkar means brilliance, Savarkar means sacrifice, Savarkar means penance, Savarkar means substance, Savarkar means logic, Savarkar means youth, Savarkar means an arrow, and Savarkar means a Sword! Behold! What an accurate depiction of Savarkar by Atal ji! Savarkar marched alongwith both poetry and revolution. Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a courageous revolutionary.

My dear brothers and sisters, I was watching a story on TV about our underprivileged daughters of certain slums in Sikar, Rajasthan. Our daughters, who were forced to sift through garbage and beg from home to home in order to earn a living - today they are learning sewing and stitching clothes to cover the impoverished. This is an example where the daughters are stitching ordinary to good quality clothes for themselves and other families. Along with this, they are undergoing a training course in skill development.

These daughters have become self-reliant today and are living their lives with respect and have become a strong support to their families. I wish all these daughters, brimming with hope and trust, a very bright future. They have demonstrated that if you have the desire to do something and if you are determined towards that goal then success can be achieved despite all odds! And this is not only about Sikar, but in every corner of India, you will witness something akin to this. If you observe in your neighbourhood, then you will witness for yourselves how people overcome the difficulties in their lives!

You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, and enjoy tea there, a discussion with some of the customers automatically ensues. These discussions are also political and social in nature, can be about movies, sports and sportspersons or can focus even on the problems of the country – any problem with probable solutions are discussed at length – but often the problems and their solutions  remain limited to such animated discussions only.

But there are some people who go ahead with their work, to bring about a change through their hard work and dedication; they make it a reality. Such is the story of D. Prakash Rao, living in the slums of Cuttack, Orissa, who gave up everything of his in order to adopt and realize the dreams of others!Just yesterday I’ve had the good fortune of meeting D. Prakash Rao.

Shriman D. Prakash Rao has been a tea vendor in the city of Cuttack forthe past five decades. A meagre tea vendor; today you will be surprised to know that the lives of more than 70 children are being illuminated through education due to his efforts. He has opened a school named 'Asha Ashvaasan', spending 50% of his incomefor children living in slums and hutments. He ensures education, health and meals for all the children coming to this school. I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, his persistence and for providing a new direction to the lives of those poor children attending his school. He has banished the darkness from their lives.Who amongst us does not know the Vedic shloka 'Tamso Ma Jyotirgamaya'! However, it has been put intopractice by D. Prakash Rao. His life is an inspiration to us, our society and the whole country. Your surroundings too must be full of such inspiring happenings. There must be innumerable incidents. Come, let us take positivity forward. 

The month of June is so hot that people anxiously wait for the rains, gazing towards the sky for the clouds to appear. People will wait for the moon in a few days from now onwards.Witnessing the moon means that the festival of Eid can be celebrated. After an entire month of fasting during Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a harbinger of celebrations.

I hope and believe that everyone will celebrate Eid with gaiety and fervor and on this occasion children will specially get a grand ‘Eidi’. I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society. Heartiest felicitations to all of you. My dear countrymen, many thanks to you all. We shall meet once again in another episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ next month.

Namaskar

                Governor of Jharkhand, Mrs. Draupadi Murmu, the popular Chief Minister, Mr. Raghubar Das ji, my colleague from the Council of Ministers at the centre Mr. R.K. Singh, Mr. Ashwini, Sudarshan Bhagat ji, Minister of the Government of Jharkhand, Mr. Amar Kumar, Ramchandra ji, our MP Mr. Prem Singh, MLA Mr. Fulchand and my dear brothers and sisters who are present here in large numbers.

First of all, I salute the brave Bhagwan Birsa Munda. This is the land of sacrifice. This is the land of struggle of Jaipal Singh and Shri Munda ji. This is also the land of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's dreams. Its mineral reserves are like the engines of development for the country.

I was told that you have been waiting for the past 2-3 hours. You have warmly welcomed us and showered your blessings on us. I am really grateful for your love and blessings. When I had come to Jharkhand during elections, I used to say that two engines i.e. one engine in the form of Jharkhand government and the other in the form of Central government in Delhi, are necessary for the development of Jharkhand. You have seen for yourselves the efforts put together by the centre as well as the Jharkhand government in the last four years in a fixed direction with pre-determined goals. The results are in front of you. The people of Jharkhand have experienced it very well.

In order to decide whether our modus operandi and intentions are right or not and whether we are working for the welfare of the people or not, is decided by just one criterion in democracy which is acceptance by the public. I congratulate the Government of Jharkhand the Chief Minister Raghubar Das Ji and his entire team. The results of the popular elections in the local bodies that were held sometime back show that the work done by the Jharkhand government and the Central government has full support of the people.

Brothers and sisters,

When I had come here during the elections of 2014, I had said that I will return the love showered on me by Jharkhand with interest. I will return it with development. The steps taken by the Central government one after another show the commitment of the government towards the development of Jharkhand. We are moving ahead with a detailed plan for the welfare of Dalits, oppressed, exploited, deprived, tribal brothers and sisters, women, youth and every section of the society.

Today, 5 projects worth nearly 27 thousand crores are being inaugurated. The amount of 27 thousand crores is even more than the budget of the state governments. The foundation stone of the 5 projects worth 27 thousand crores viz. Factory at Sindri, power project at Patratu, airport at the town of Baba bholenath or siva i.e. Deoghar, and pipelines at AIIMS and Ranchi, are being laid down. Over 50 projects worth approximately Rs.80 thousand crores are already going on. You can imagine how Jharkhand is going to progress and develop compared to other states.

I have always been saying that the people of Jharkhand are in possession of diamonds. The coal is like black diamond. Even if it is dark, it has the capacity to illuminate an area. It has the capacity to generate light and produce energy. Keeping this in mind, with an investment of more than 18 thousand crores, a power project is being inaugurated at Patratu. This coal will not only provide financial strength to Jharkhand but will also provide employment to its youth. New paths of development will open up with the help of this power plant in Patratu. We will ensure that the families that have been displaced by this project should get employment and the families will be taken care of.

I am glad that today I have got the opportunity to provide employment cards to some of the youngsters. Several employment opportunities will be available to thousands of youngsters in the future.

Our dream was to provide electricity to every village in our country. When I took charge in 2014, about 18000 villages were still in dark for the past several centuries. They had no access to electricity. They had not seen the electric poles or the transmission lines. We undertook the task of providing electricity to these villages. These were inaccessible, remote and neglected places. People who are immersed in vote bank politics do not bother about the neglected people. They tend to worry only about their vote bank. However, we follow the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. Therefore, our aim is to provide electricity to each of these 18000 villages, even if it's at a remote corner and the most inaccessible part of the country, with mountain peaks or thick forests. We are ready to spend lakhs of rupees to arrange for transport in such places.

I am glad that we will be able to provide the electricity connections in these 18000 villages before the due date. Earlier no one had the time even after 50-60 years of independence to enquire about the villages that were left un-electrified. However, once we had taken charge, people can see for themselves whether Modi is speaking the truth or not. I am really amused by the fact that those who did not have any time for these 18 thousand villages, are now compelled to visit those villages. Consequently, even the bureaucrats are alert all the time. They are working sincerely under pressure. A pressure is created when a work starts by an announcement. Some people were misleading the country by saying that even though electric poles have been erected and transmission lines have been laid and 5-25 households have been electrified, but has the work been done? Their question is very important.

Those who raise such questions should know that even after 70 years of independence, there are 4 crore or 20% of the households that do not have any access to transmission lines or electricity. Those families have never seen light. It's not that Modi disconnected electricity supply to those households that already had electricity supply. They are to be blamed for compelling these people to live in dark for 60 years. We have taken the responsibility for providing electricity connection to these 18000 villages within the time limit. We are determined to provide electricity connection to 4 crore households under saubhagya scheme. We have taken this responsibility.

Those people who abuse the rich to show their empathy towards the poor keep on repeating that Modi works for the rich. It has become a trend. I want to ask them that which rich section of the society resides in the 18000 villages where electricity connections have been provided. Who are the rich people who reside in those 4 crore households that are still in dark and where Modi wants to provide electricity connection? I want to ask these people who don't have the slightest idea about the sufferings of the workers. Therefore, brothers and sisters, I want to say that we want to include the lowermost strata of the society, the Dalits, the exploited and the deprived section of the society, in the journey of development. Out of the 4 crore families, 32 lakh belong to Jharkhand. I am glad that the Chief Minister along with the central government has taken the responsibility of providing electricity connections to these 32 lakh families. I believe that this initiative will definitely be successful.

Brothers and sisters,

Today I have got the opportunity to re-start the Urea factory at Sindri. This factory was shut down for almost 16 years. But this factory belongs to the time when Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was a minister in the central government from his Bharatiya Janasangha. He had laid the foundation stone of this urea factory at Sindri. Later this was shut down. During 2014 elections, I had told you that we would re-open this factory at Sindri.

Brother and sisters,

Technology should change over time. We have taken steps to use gas as a source of energy. This factory will also start in the near future. A similar factory will be started in Gorakhpur of East Uttar Pradesh.

Brothers and sisters,

Sindri and Dhanbad can be divided like the pole of anchor city. It has a lot of potential. Brothers and sisters,

The urea factories will have easy access to gas. These 3 factories at Barauni of Bihar, Gorakhpur of East UP and Sindri of Jharkhand will help to reduce the transportation cost of obtaining urea for Eastern part of India. The youngsters will get employment. The ease of obtaining urea will help in the country's second agricultural revolution in Eastern India. We want to carry this objective forward.

We have started the process of Neem-coating of urea. Earlier the subsidy was given to the farmers. Urea didn't reach the agricultural fields and was diverted to factories. Those who had run the government for 70 years didn't realize that they should find a way to stop the diversion of the subsidized urea to chemical factories. It was causing such a great loss to the government's treasury.

We took charge and came up with 100% Neem coating of urea. Urea can't be misused for industrial purposes if the Neem oil of its fruit is applied. Urea can solely be used for agricultural use. Therefore, the theft of urea could be ceased.

The people working for the rich are now worried due to this step but now my farmers don't have to queue up for urea. They don't have to purchase Urea from the black market. There was a time when they were beaten up by the police for urea. They are now relieved. For the past two years not a single complaint has been raised about unavailability of urea because we have stopped the theft of urea.

Brothers and sisters,

I have been fighting against corruption and deceit. Several steps have been taken in this direction. Today I will get the opportunity to lay the foundation stone of the gas pipeline project in Ranchi. The 21st century infrastructure should include gas grid, optical fibre network, water grid, power grid and all types of modern facilities. Why should Jharkhand lag behind? Therefore, Ranchi will also be among the rapidly progressing cities that will carry India forward. With this dream, we have decided to work upon the gas grid. Gas will be available to every household and in the future gas will reach 70 districts of UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam through pipeline.

It was our dream to make kitchens smoke-free. We have started the Ujjwala scheme to attain this goal. Our second step in this direction will be providing gas through pipelines and we are working upon the third step. Clean cooking through solar energy is the next step so that food could be cooked using solar energy with minimal cost. Research is going on in that direction.

Today I have also got the opportunity to lay the foundation stone of AIIMS at Deoghar. A lot of patients have to be transferred to AIIMS at Delhi from eastern India. The poor cannot afford it. We are working in the direction of providing best facilities to the poorest of the poor by spreading the network of AIIMS in eastern India. We are starting AIIMS at Deoghar keeping this in mind. Similarly, Deoghar is also a pilgrimage centre. It's the land of Lord Bholenath. This is also a Shakti Peeth. People from across the country want to visit it. It has a great potential for tourism. Therefore, we are trying to connect it through airport.

The ministry of tourism is also engaged in this work. It's our dream that people wearing slippers should also be able to travel by aeroplanes. This is our dream. You will be delighted to know that last year the number of passengers travelling in planes was greater than those travelling in AC coaches of railways. This depicts that changes are being brought into the lives of the common man.

Brothers and sisters,

We are moving ahead with several developmental projects. It's our dream to provide homes to the poor by 2022. The scheme aims to provide a house with toilet, water supply, power supply and schools nearby. By the year 2022 that will mark 75 years of independence, no person should be without a house. We are moving ahead with this dream.

Brothers and sisters,

I urge you all to participate in the journey of development. The country is now traversing the path of honesty. The common man of India lives the life of honesty. This government is with those who live for honesty and struggle for honesty. Therefore brothers and sisters, we are moving ahead with this important responsibility to fulfil your dreams. You have come in such large numbers and have showered your blessings. I believe that Jharkhand will move to greater heights and progress towards a new Jharkhand. With this belief, I thank you all!

                The Hon'ble Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina Ji, Hon'ble guests, Hon’ble Chief Minister, Hon’ble Governor and friends!

 

The Bangladesh Bhawan is a symbol of cultural bondage between India and Bangladesh. This building is a symbol of the strong relationships between the millions of people of both the countries in terms of art, language, culture, education, family relationships and it marks the relationship that is strengthened by shared struggles against torture. I thank Sheikh Hasina ji and the people of Bangladesh for this building. I am extremely delighted to inaugurate this building in the holy month of Ramadan, from the karm-bhumi (the land where one works) of Gurudev Tagore who's the composer of the National Anthem of both India and Bangladesh.

 

Friends,

 

The history of this University and of this holy land is older than that of the Bangladesh's and India's independence and even older than the partition of Bengal during the colonial era. It is a symbol of our shared heritage which the British could not divide, nor the politics of ‘divide and rule’. The myriad waves of the river Ganga touch the shores of both the countries. Our similarities strengthen our relationship. Bangabandhu, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is respected in India as much as in Bangladesh. In a similar manner, the respect towards the great personalities like Swami Vivekananda, Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi is the same in Bangladesh as well as in India.

 

The poems and the songs of the world renowned poet Rabindranath Tagore echoes in every village of Bangladesh. Similarly the compositions of Kazi Nazrul Islam are popular in every corner of West Bengal.

 

Names of several dignitaries of Bangladesh are associated with this university. Among them are Rezwana Choudhari Bannya, Aditi Mohsin, Lily Islam, Lina Taposhi, Sharmila Banerjee, and Nisar Hossain. As a result of the vision of Rabindranath Tagore, this Institution is beyond our political boundaries and bonds. Gurudev himself was a person of independent thoughts, who wasn't confined within the boundaries. He belonged to Bangladesh as much as to India. He was introduced to the Bengali folk songs of Gagan Harkara and Lalan Fakir on the soil of Bangladesh. The tune of his 'Amar sonar Bangla' song was inspired by Gagan Harkara. Influence of Baul song can be clearly seen in Rabindra Sangeet. Bangabandhu was a great admirer of Gurudev's ideals and art. Tagore's Universal Humanism had influenced Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Gurudev's 'Shonar Bangla' was an important part of Bangabandhu's enchanting speeches. The idea of Tagore's Universal Humanism is an inspiration for us too. In our own words, we have reflected it in the concept of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas'.

 

Friends,

 

We have to make ceaseless efforts so that the future generations are also made aware of the rich cultural traditions and the contributions made by these great personalities of both India and Bangladesh. All the related departments like the High Commission of India and other organisations and individuals, Indian Council of Cultural Relations etc. are engaged in this work. Today, as the 'Bangladesh Bhavan' has been inaugurated here, we have taken the responsibility of the renovation of Gurudev Tagore's residence ""Kuthibari"" in Kushtia district of Bangladesh.

 

Friends, the shared legacy and the sweetness of Rabindra Sangeet have smeared our relations with nectar and have united us at times of happiness and misery. This is the reason that even though the struggle for the liberation of Bangladesh was across the border, but the seeds of inspiration were sown in this land. Although the wounds were inflicted on the people of Bangladesh for the selfish desires of the opponents, yet the pain was felt on this side. This is the reason that when Bangabandhu became the leader of liberation, the spirit of millions of Indians was also automatically associated with that campaign. Our shared resolve and its history against tyranny and terror will continue to inspire future generations through this building. Friends, I remember how emotional it was last year when Bangladesh had honoured Indian soldiers in Delhi. It was not just the honour of 1661 Indian soldiers who had sacrificed their lives for Bangladesh's liberation but also of plethora of emotions associated with each of the freedom fighters of Bangladesh. It is very rare that neighbouring countries honour each other's soldiers.

 

Friends,

 

Golden chapters of India and Bangladesh relations are being written down for the past few years. Complex bilateral issues such as the land boundary and Maritime boundary, which were once believed impossible to be resolved, have now been resolved. We are also rapidly progressing in the area of connectivity in terms of roads, railways, inland waterways and coastal shipping. New dimensions of connectivity are also evolving.

 

Last year the air conditioned train service was started between Kolkata and Khulna. We have named it 'Bandhan', which means 'friendship'. We are developing our relationship with the help of this 'Bandhan'.

 

India has been supplying uninterrupted electricity to Bangladesh. The current supply is 600 MW. This year we have a target of increasing it to 1100 MW.

 

The Northeast India is getting internet connection from Bangladesh too. India has provided 1 billion dollars of line of credit for assisting the developmental priorities set by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for Bangladesh. There is a good progress in their implementation. Projects have been identified and credit has been provided for some projects.

 

Bangladesh is progressing rapidly also in the area of space technology. Recently, Bangladesh has launched its first satellite, Bangabandhu. I want to congratulate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the people of Bangladesh for this achievement. Today, in India we are using space technologies for raising the standard of living of the people and to bring transparency in the system. I am confident that in the future we will open new paths of cooperation between the two countries in the field of space technology.

 

I am glad that the regular interaction between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ji and us is instilling new energy to the cooperation between the two countries. She had visited India last year too. Her presence in this event is an honour.

 

Friends,

 

Both our aspirations as well as challenges are similar. The crisis of climate change is in front of us. If the scorching sun is going to put challenges before us, the solution also lies in that sun's energy. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ji has put forth the vision of Power to All for Bangladesh by the year 2021. In India, our target is to provide electricity connection to every household by next year. We have already completed the goal of providing electricity to every village of our country. Our resolutions are same and the way of attaining them is also the same.

 

Friends,

 

India has taken the initiative of the International Solar Alliance. Many countries of the world have become part of this Alliance. This Alliance will explore the potential of solar power across the world and will also prepare a mechanism of funding to different countries. I am glad that Bangladesh is also a part of this Solar Alliance. The Summit of International Solar Alliance was held in Delhi in the month of March this year. We were extremely pleased that the Hon’ble President of Bangladesh had participated in the Summit. This shows the strong willingness of the two countries for cooperation to turn the challenges into opportunities.

 

Last month I met a hundred-member young delegation from Bangladesh. I realized that their dreams and aspirations are similar to that of the youth of India. We are committed to working together for development and to fulfil the dreams of the youth of both the countries.

 

Today under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh has moved on to a new path of development. India is as proud as the people of Bangladesh as she has fulfilled all the criteria for achieving the level of a 'developing economy'.

 

Bangladesh has also made significant progress in the field of social sector and has made the life of the poor easier. I believe this remarkable work will inspire the people of our country.

 

Friends,

 

Today, the thread of the journey of development of India and Bangladesh is intertwined like a beautiful garland. There is an atmosphere of uncertainty in certain parts of the world. The geopolitics of the world is constantly changing. However, in the last few years an unflinching truth has been revealed to us; and that is the strong friendship between India and Bangladesh for progress, development, peace and stability. This cooperation has been enriched not only at bilateral level but also through platforms like BIMSTEC that has promoted regional progress and connectivity.

 

Friends,

 

Every country will progress if this area develops. It has come to us as an opportunity in this period of time. Today, the close friendship and collaboration between India and Bangladesh is also a lesson for others to study and assess.

 

Friends,

 

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ji has set a vision to make Bangladesh a developed country by 2041. This vision is a symbol of her far-sightedness and the tradition set by Bangabandhu that concerns the welfare of every Bangladeshi. India offers her full cooperation in achieving this goal.

 

I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to Sheikh Hasina ji for coming here. My best wishes to all of you at the inauguration ceremony of the Bangladesh Bhavan. Thank you!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today laid the foundation stone of various projects of the Government of India and Government of Jharkhand, at an event in Sindri. These include:


	Revival of Sindri Fertilizer Project of Hindustan Urvarak and Rasayan Ltd.
	Ranchi City Gas Distribution Project by GAIL
	All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Deoghar
	Development of Deoghar Airport
	Patratu Super Thermal Power Project 


 

He also witnessed the Exchange of MoUs for Jan AushadhiKendras.

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister paid homage to BhagwanBirsa Munda. He said that the State Government and the Union Government are working together for the rapid development of Jharkhand. 

He said the total cost of the projects, for which foundation stones have been laid today, is Rs. 27,000 crore. He said these development projects will give opportunities to the youth of Jharkhand. 

He said that when he assumed office, there were 18,000 villages lacking access to electricity. We worked to brighten the lives of people in these villages and took electricity there, he added. Now, we have gone a step further and we are ensuring every household in India has access to electricity, he said. 

He said fertiliser plants which had stopped working are in the process of being revived. Eastern India will gain the most from this, he added. 

The Prime Minister said that the healthcare sector in the State will be transformed with the establishment of AIIMS in Jharkhand. The poor will get access to top quality healthcare, he added. 

The Prime Minister said that the Union Government has made air-travel accessible and affordable.

Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina, present on the stage, Governor of West Bengal Mr. Keshari Nathji Tripathi, Chief Minister of West Bengal Ms Mamata Banerjee, Vice-Chancellor of Visva Bharati Professor Sabuj Kali Sen and Vice-Chancellor of Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Institute Swami Swamyapriyanand ji, everyone present here from Visva Bharati and my dear young friends,

 

As the Chancellor of Visva Bharati, first of all I apologize to all of you because on the way to the university some children were pointing out to me that they didn't even have access to drinking water. As the Chancellor of the University it's my responsibility to ensure that you are not inconvenienced. Therefore, I beg your pardon for the inconvenience caused to you. Being the Prime Minister, I have had the opportunity to participate in the convocation of several universities of the country. In most of the cases I was present there as a guest. But today I am not a guest here but the Chancellor. My role here is a result of democracy. I am the Chancellor due to the post of Prime Minister. This democracy is in itself a master that is inspiring more than 125 crore Indians in different ways. Every person who is nurtured and educated by the values of democracy is helpful in building a better India and a better future. We have been told that आचार्यत विद्याविहिता साघिष्ठतम प्राप्युति इति which means that one cannot attain education, excellence and success without going to a teacher. I am really fortunate to have got the opportunity of spending some quality time with so many teachers on the holy land of Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur.

 

Just like one can feel the power of mantras in a temple, I am experiencing a similar energy in the Viswa Bharati University. While I was coming towards the stage after getting down from the car, I was wondering that once Rabindranath Tagore had stepped on every part of this land. He must have penned down his words sitting here. He might have hummed his music somewhere here and might have held long conversations with Mahatma Gandhi here. He might have explained the meaning of life, nation and self-respect of the nation to his students.

 

Friends,

 

Today we have gathered here to follow a tradition. Amarkunj is a witness to several such events for the past century. One phase of whatever you have learnt over the past several years will conclude today. I want to congratulate all the recipients of the degree. My best wishes to them for their future endeavours. This degree is the proof of your educational qualification. Therefore, it is significant in this regard. However, you have achieved not only the degree but also the priceless learnings. You are the heir of a rich heritage. You are associated with a Guru-Shishya tradition which is both ancient and modern.

 

In the vedic and puranic era, Sages had nurtured this tradition while in the modern era, it was carried forward by great personalities like Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. This is not just an address but a great message for you all. This is an example of how nature teaches us to be a good human being or a nation. This is the expression behind this wonderful organisation and the great idea of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore which became the cornerstone of Viswa Bharati.

 

Brothers and sisters,

 

यत्र विश्वम भवेतेक निरम।  This means that the entire world is a nest or a house. This teaching of the Vedas has been made the essential message of Viswa Bharati by Gurudev. The essence of India's rich tradition is hidden in this Veda Mantra. Gurudev wanted this place to be a proclamation which the whole world would make its home. The nests and homesteads are given equal importance where the entire world can be accommodated. This is what Indianness is. This it is the mantra of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' which has been echoing from the land of India for the past thousands of years. Gurudev had devoted his entire life to this mantra.

 

Friends,

 

The Vedas and Upanishads were as relevant even 100 years back when Rabindranath Tagore had come to Shantiniketan as they were thousands of years ago. These are even relevant today for dealing with the challenges of the world in the 21st century. It is true that today nations are confined within political boundaries. However, it is also a fact that the great traditions of this land have spread in the form of globalization. Today, Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ji is also present among us. It is a rare occasion as the Prime Ministers of two countries are present in the same convocation. India and Bangladesh are two nations but our interests lie in co-ordination and cooperation with each other. We can learn a lot from each other whether it is about culture or public policy. For example, the Bangladesh Bhawan which will be inaugurated by both of us shortly. This building is also a reflection of Gurudev's vision.

 

Friends,

 

At times, I am surprised when I see that not only Gurudev's personality, but also his travels were extensive. During my foreign tours, I meet many people who tell me that several years ago Tagore had visited their country. In those countries today, Gurudev is still remembered with great love and respect. People try to associate themselves with Tagore.

 

In Afghanistan, every Afghan keeps mentioning about the story of Kabuliwala with great pride. Three years ago when I went to Tajikistan, I had got the opportunity to inaugurate a statue of Gurudev. I can never forget the respect that people had for Gurudev there.

 

In many universities of the world Tagore is still a subject of study. There are chairs named after him. It won't be wrong to say that Tagore was and is still a global citizen. On this occasion, I am really eager to tell you about the relation he had with Gujarat. Gurudev had a special relationship with Gujarat. His elder brother, Satyendranath Tagore was the first Indian to join the civil services. He had stayed in Ahmedabad for a long time. Most probably he was the Commissioner of Ahmedabad. I had read somewhere that before leaving for England, Satyendranath ji had taught his younger brother English for six months in Ahmedabad only. Gurudev was only 17 years old at that time. During that period, Gurudev had written some important parts of his popular novel 'Khudito Pashan' and a few poems in Ahmedabad. In a way, every corner of the country including Gujarat had played some or the other role in the emergence of Gurudev at the global front.

 

Friends,

 

Gurudev believed that every person is born to attain some goal. Education plays a crucial role in making every child capable in order to reach their goals. We can get a glimpse of the kind of education he desired for children in his poetry 'power of affection'. He used to say that education is not the only thing which is imparted in schools. Education is a balanced development of every aspect of a person which can not be tied to time and place. And that's why Gurudev always desired that Indian students were well-acquainted with what was happening in the external world; how many people lived in other countries; what were their social values, their cultural heritage and so on. He always insisted upon knowing these things. However, at the same time he insisted that one should not forget one's Indian culture.

 

I was told that once he had explained this aspect through a letter to his son-in-law who had gone to study agriculture in America. He had written to his son-in-law that studying agriculture was not enough and meeting the local people was also a part of education. He further wrote that if in the process of knowing the people he started losing his identity then he should keep himself locked inside the room.

 

In the Indian National Movement, Tagore ji's educational and Indian philosophy became a distant one. His life was an integral part of national and global ideas, which have been part of our ancient traditions. This was also one of the reasons that he created a separate world of education in Visva-Bharati here. Simplicity is the basic principle of education here. Classes are still run under the trees in the open air. There is a direct interaction between man and nature. All the dimensions of human life including music, painting, theatre and acting are being nurtured in the lap of nature. I am glad that this institution is continuously moving towards fulfilling the dreams with which its foundation stone was laid by Gurudev. His efforts to combine education and skill development and for uplifting the standard of life of common man is commendable. I have been told that you are working together to develop almost 50 villages here. My hopes and ambitions expanded when I was told about this effort. Hope grows with work. Since you have done so much my expectations from you have also raised slightly.

 

Friends,

 

This institution will complete its 100 years in 2021. You can exapand your efforts from 50 villages to 100 or 200 villages in the next 2-3 years. It's my request to you all to sync your efforts to the needs of the country. For example, you can make a resolution that by the centenary of the institution in 2021, you will develop 100 villages that will have electricity connections in every household, gas connection and toilets, mothers and children will be fully immunized and people will be educated about digital transactions. They will be aware of common Service centres and the way to fill up online forms.

 

You must be well aware of the fact that gas connections provided under Ujjwala scheme and toilets built under Swachh Bharat Mission are meant for easing the lives of women.

 

Your efforts in the villages, worshippers of Shakti, will work to empower women on this land. Besides, efforts can also be made to turn these 100 villages into nature-loving or nature- worshipping villages. Just like you are working for the preservation of nature, these villages will also become part of your mission. These villages should carry forward the vision of water conservation through adequate arrangements for water storage. Air pollution  can be prevented by avoiding the use of firewood. Soil can be conserved by using organic fertilizer keeping cleanliness in mind. Gobar Dhan Yojana of the Government of India can be used to chieve this. You can complete all that work by making a check list.

 

Friends,

 

Today we are facing different types of challenges. 125 crore Indians have vowed to build a New India by 2022  that will mark 75 years of independence. Education and institutions of education like this one play significant role in the pursuit of this resolution. Young people from such institutions give new energy and direction to the country. Our universities are not just educational institutions. Efforts are going on to ensure their active participation in social life.

 

Under Unnat Bharat Abhiyan, the universities are being linked to the development of the villages. In line with Gurudev's vision, the central government is constantly working to strengthen our education system according to the needs of New India. A new scheme called Revitalizing Infrastructure and System in Education i.e. RISE has been announced in this year's budget. Under this, one lakh crore rupees will be spent in the next four years to improve the education system of the country. Global Initiative of Academic Network was also started. Through this, the best teachers of the world are being invited to teach in Indian institutions. With an investment of one thousand crores, Higher Education Financing Agency has been created to provide adequate facilities to educational institutions. This will help the major educational institutions to invest in high quality infrastructure. 2400 schools across the country  have been selected to shape the innovative mindset of the children at an early age. In these schools, we are focusing on students from class 6 to 12 through Atal Tinkering Labs. These labs with modern technology are being introduced to children.

 

Friends,

 

Your institution is an living example of innovation in education. I would wish that more than 11000 students of Visva-Bharati should avail maximum benefits out of the schemes introduced for promoting innovation. You are all passing out from this Institution. With the blessings of Gurudev, you have received a vision. You are carrying the identity of Viswa Bharati with you.

 

I would urge you to carry on with your efforts to elevate its pride. The people will salute this Institution when they will hear about its students who would change the lives of 500-1000 people through innovation.

 

Remember, what Gurudev had said, ""Jodi Tor daak shune keu na ashe tabe ekla chalo ray"". If no one is ready to walk with you, keep going alone towards your goal. But today I have come here to tell you that if you take one step, the government is ready to move four steps with you. Public participation will only take our country forward to the desired 21st century of which Gurudev had dreamt.

 

Friends,

 

Gurudev had told Gandhiji sometime before his death that Visva Bharti is the ship where the most precious treasure of his life remains. He hoped that all of us, the people of India, would cherish this precious treasure. So, it's the responsibilty of all of us to not only preserve this treasure but also to enrich it. May Viswa Bharati University keep showing new ways to the world along with the dream of New India? With that I end my speech. Thank you very much.

 

May you fulfil your dreams along with the dreams of your parents, this institution as well as the country. Best wishes to you all! Thank you very much!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today visited Santiniketan in West Bengal. 
Prime Minister Modi received the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, at Santiniketan. Paying homage to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, the two leaders signed the visitors’ book. The two leaders then attended the Convocation of the Visva Bharati University. 


Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister described India’s democratic system of governance as a great teacher, which inspires over 125 crore people. He said it was his good fortune to be among the learned people on this sacred land of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. 


He congratulated the students who received degrees today. He said that all those who studied at this University have not just received a degree, but have also become inheritors of a great legacy.


The Prime Minister said that the teachings of the Vedas, which describe the entire world as one nest, or one home, are reflected in the values of Visva Bharati University.


Welcoming the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, he said that India and Bangladesh are two nations, whose interests are linked to mutual cooperation and coordination among each other. 


The Prime Minister said that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is respected widely across the world. He recalled that he had the opportunity to unveil a statue of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore in Tajikistan three years ago. He said Tagore is a subject of study in Universities across the world even today. He described Gurudev as a global citizen. 


The Prime Minister said that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore always wanted Indian students to keep abreast of developments across the world, even as they kept their Indianness intact. He appreciated Visva Bharati University for its efforts at skill development and education in nearby villages. He encouraged the University to expand this effort to 100 villages by its centenary year in 2021. He also called upon the University to work towards overall development of these 100 villages.


The Prime Minister said that institutions such as Visva Bharati University have a key role to play in the creation of a New India by 2022. He outlined initiatives taken by the Union Government in the education sector. 


Speaking on the occasion of the inauguration of Bangladesh Bhavan, the Prime Minister described it as a symbol of the cultural ties between India and Bangladesh. 


He said that this University and this sacred land have a history that has seen the freedom struggles of both India and Bangladesh. He added that it is a symbol of the shared heritage of the two countries. 


He said that Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rehman is respected equally in both India and Bangladesh. Similarly, he added that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Swami Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi are respected in Bangladesh as much as in India. 


In the same vein, he said that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore belongs to Bangladesh, as much as to India. 
The Prime Minister said that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore's credo of Universal Humanism is reflected in the Union Government's guiding principle of ""Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas."" He said that the shared resolve of India and Bangladesh, against cruelty and terrorism, will continue to inspire future generations through the Bangladesh Bhavan. He recalled the felicitation of Indian soldiers by Bangladesh in New Delhi last year. 


The Prime Minister said that the last few years have marked a golden period in relations between the two countries. He mentioned the resolution of the land boundary issue, and various connectivity projects. 


He asserted that the two countries have similar goals, and are taking similar paths to achieve those goals.

                Your Excellency, Prime Minister & my friend,

Mark Rutte,

Distinguished Delegates,

Members of the Media,



Friends,

Heartiest welcome to Prime Minister Mark and his delegation in India. I am particularly pleased that with Prime Minister Mark, his four Cabinet colleagues, the Mayor of the Hague and more than 200 business representatives have also come to India. This is the largest business delegation to have come to India from Netherlands. And it clearly shows how much dynamism is there in our trade and investment relationship. So many possibilities are there. Prime Minister Rutte first came to India in 2015. I visited Netherlands in 2017 and today this was our third summit meeting. There are very few such countries, with whom we have this kind of momentum of high level visits in our relationships. And for this momentum and for giving personal priority to the relations with India, I congratulate my friend Mark from the bottom of my heart.


Friends,

Today, both of us reviewed the progress in our bilateral relations. And shared our own assessments of regional and global developments. And we also met the prominent CEOs of both the countries. Last year when I went to Netherlands, I had urged my friend Mark to think positively on becoming a member of the International Solar Alliance. The expertise, the technology and the experience which Netherlands has in the field of solar power, whole world should benefit from it. And I am happy that today Netherlands has become a member of the International Solar Alliance. I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Rutte for this decision. From UN Security Council to Multilateral Export Control Regimes, India and Netherlands have had very good and close cooperation and coordination. And now International Solar Alliance will be a new dimension of our strong cooperation in international forums.


Friends,

India is not new to Dutch companies. Hundreds of Dutch companies have been working in India for many years. So far Netherlands is the fifth largest source for total foreign direct investment in India and in the past few years it has emerged as the third largest source. Similarly, Netherlands is also a very attractive destination for investment by Indian companies. And therefore, meeting with the CEOs of both the countries is very useful. I am happy that the business community in Netherlands is enthusiastic about opportunities being created in India. I have also assured them of my strong commitment towards economic reforms in India. Areas related to agriculture and food processing are particularly important for India. These topics are connected with our Food Security and at the same time, it is also important for our goal of doubling the income of the farmers of India. Netherlands has expertise in these areas. Last year Netherlands participated as the Focus Country in World Food India Summit. And I believe that in its next edition in 2019, participation of the Netherlands will be even more. I am happy that the first Indo-Dutch Center of Excellence for vegetables has started in Baramati. We are working together on other similar types of centers as well. Similarly, our cooperation in urban development is also very dynamic. Waste Water Management projects in Vadodara and Delhi are making good progress. We are completing 10 years of cooperation in Science & Technology, and this successful partnership will be further strengthened by participation of Netherlands as a Partner Country in the Tech Summit, which will be held in India in 2019.

Friends,

Providing special attention to the issues of Indian society living abroad has been a major priority of my government's foreign policy. I specifically thank Prime Minister Rutte and the Government of Netherlands for the assistance in safe extraction of Indian nationals at the time of hurricane that came in Sint Maarten in September 2017.


Excellency,

Once again I very warmly welcome you and your delegation in India.

Thank you,

Many Many Thanks.

                Six women officers of the Indian Navy, who successfully circumnavigated the globe on the sailing vessel, INSV Tarini, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi today. 

The expedition, known as the Navika Sagar Parikrama, was the first-ever Indian circumnavigation of the globe by an all-women crew.

During the interaction, the crew made a presentation on various aspects of the mission, their preparation, training, and experiences during the journey.

The Prime Minister congratulated the crew on the success of their mission. He encouraged them to share and write about their unique experiences during the journey. Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Sunil Lanba, was present on the occasion.

The vessel was skippered by Lt. Commander Vartika Joshi, and the crew also comprised Lt. Commanders Pratibha Jamwal, P Swathi, and Lieutenants S Vijaya Devi, B Aishwarya and Payal Gupta.

                My dear brothers and sisters,

There are a lot of old faces here. Our Chamanlal Ji is here. It is a very important day today for Jammu & Kashmir. This is my fourth public  programme in the state. Since morning, I have been witnessing a flow of development from the high mountains of Leh-Laddakh to the valley of Kashmir and now at the foothills of Jammu. And because of these programmes I got late and could not arrive here in time.  I seek your forgiveness for this.

Be it is the Zojila Tunnel that connects the rest of India with Leh or Kishan Ganga project in Bandipora or the Hydro Power Project  that is coming up on Chinab river in Kishtwar region. All this open up a new door for the happiness for Jammu & Kashmir. The  rivers flowing through the state are going to give momentum to the development of this region. Dedicating one hydro power project to the nation and laying foundation  for another, this has made today a very unique and memorable day.

Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to dedicate or lay the foundation for 4 big infrastructure related projects for Jammu. Two of them are dedicated to the Divine Mother Vaishno Devi. The foundation stone for  Pakal Dul project has been laid here just a while ago. You can understand that how beneficial it is going to be for the state from the fact that it is going to produce equivalent to one third of the electricity which is now being produced in the state in a day,

This project has been constructed under the Prime Minister’s Development Programme. This one thousand megawatt capacity project is ready for launch. This scheme with the investment of Rs. 8,000 crore is going to create several opportunities for employment at this place. It will provide direct employment to nearly 2,500 people. In addition, there will be vegetable producers, there will be milk suppliers here; it is going to give a new opportunity for generating income to the people who do any kind of work.

Friends, our government has been working with a new approach towards the development of the country and this approach is: from isolation to integration. It means those areas of the country which were isolated some reason, where the light of development had not reached so far, now  priority is being given to those areas. And this is the reason, be it North-East or Jammu & Kashmir I will try to be there myself. I don’t know whether any Prime Minister has got such opportunity earlier or not, but, perhaps, I have come to Jammu & Kashmir for more than a dozen times as a Prime Minister in addition to political visits. It’s true that you took care of me during the earlier days. In a way you have raised me. We have been working on the formula of: development through connectivity. Be it connectivity through roads or be it connecting the hearts, no stone is being left unturned at any level. Every such step is being taken for the development of Jammu & Kashmir which has the strength of converting this state in to a rising star of a New India. Let’s imagine the map of India when the crown jewel of India will shine like a crown made of diamonds and this sparkle will show the path of development to rest of the country.

Brothers and sisters, central government has been working along with the state government to accomplish this task and we have been taking forward the schemes and implementing them on the ground. Only a while ago, the foundation stone for the ring road was laid and this would solve the problem of traffic jams of the city of Jammu as well as of this place. The effort will be made to complete the project in the next three years. When this ring road will be ready it will bring in a. lot of  facilities to all of you, the inhabitants of Jammu and also to millions of tourists who come here. And you will see, this 50 kilometers long ring road will develop a new Jammu. A new Jammu on the either sides of this road. I can see it very clearly what kind of development, what kind of expansion will be there. It will certainly reduce the traffic jam within and nearby areas of Jammu city, not only this, the ring road will also make it very easy to transport the heavy machinery through military vehicles in strategic and border areas of Punchch, Rajouri, Naushera and Akhnoor.

Friends, your city Jammu has been selected under the Smart City Mission. Smart systems have been developed here regarding traffic to sewage management. The state government has been engaged in this  work. The fund for this work has already been approved by the central government.

Brothers and sisters, for development, our entire focus is on infrastructure – be it highways or railways or waterways or i-ways or roadways, all these are compulsory things for the 21stcentury.

The government’s thinking is very clear that if we need to raise the standard of living of 1.25 billion countrymen then we will have to first make it easy and convenient for them. In other words, you can call them - smart systems. And it is the outcome of this thinking that a network of highways have been developed at a rapid pace across country under the Bharat Mala project.

Be it Jammu & Kashmir or Western India or North East, this is the project to connect the country with a network of highways. In this year’s budget, more than Rs. 5,000 crore has been allocated for construction of 35,000 kilometers long road under this project. More than Rs. 2,700 crores will be spent in Jammu & Kashmir under this project.

Brothers and sisters, the work on several highway projects has been going on in Jammu & Kashmir too. Several schemes worth thousands of crores of rupees for connecting Jammu to Srinagar and other parts of the country have already been completed. And the work has been taking place at a fast speed on some other schemes. Today, the work is going  on several highway projects like Jammu-Punch, Udhampur-Ramban, Ramban-Banihal, Srinagar-Banihal and Kazigund-Banihal, and these projects are going to be proved lifeline for this region. Nearly, Rs. 15,000crore will be spent on these roads. In addition to this, the villages have been connected under the Prime Minister Rural Road Scheme. In the last two years, nearly one lakh kilometers long rural roads have been constructed under this scheme. In the last two years, more than 3,500 kilometers long rural roads have been constructed in the villages of Jammu & Kashmir.

Friends, tourism is a big source of revenue for Jammu & Kashmir, particularly those places which are related to religious faith be it Baba  Barfani (Lord Shiva) or Darbar of Mata Rani (Divine Mother Vaishno Devi), millions of tourists come to visit these shrines. The government has been making several efforts so that the pilgrims full of devotion should get the facilities and also the employment opportunities are generated for local people.

Today, the train service has reached the Vaishno Devi shrine in Katra. I had got the opportunity to publicly dedicate this rail route immediately after becoming the Prime Minister. This rail route has provided a lot of  convenience to the devotees of mother goddess. We don’t want to stop at this only and this is the reason that two big projects have been inaugurated today. The first one is another route for visiting the shrine of mother goddess and the other one is for supplying goods to the shrine of the mother goddess through a ropeway.

Friends, now the devotees can reach to the shrine of divine mother Vaishno Devi through Tarakota route. This is an optional route for devotees who walk on feet between Katra and Ardh Kunwari. This will also provide them freedom from crowd. And I have been told that this route will also be connected through a one and a half kilometers long link road to the existing pedestrian’s path. So that the devotees can use either of the pedestrian’s path to reach up to the temple. This is completely safe and secure path for the devotees of the mother goddess where every arrangements have been made to provide them every facility.

Friends, in addition to this alternative route, today, I also got the good opportunity to inaugurate a material ropeway leading up to the doors of the abode of the mother goddess. Carriage of goods will become much  more easier because of this material ropeway. Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board will be able to make arrangements for providing food  facilities to devotees with ease by utilising these unique facilities. This ropeway is also going to provide a great help in disposal of waste material around the temple. The goods will be supplied from Katra to the temple and the waste material will be brought back in the return journey.

Friends, this kind of facility is also being developed for the devotees on the lines of material ropeway. Bhairon Ghati Bhawan, which is being built at the cost of Rs. 60 crore, is going to be completed very soon. This  ropeway will have the capacity to ferry 800 people per hour. It is going to be extremely helpful for old and physically handicapped devotees. When this ropeway will become fully functional then it will carry 40-45 people  within three minutes. This ropeway system will have an automated ticketing system on the lines of Delhi Metro. I congratulate Mr. Chairman and his entire team for the way the Shrine Board has been working to provide more facilities to the devotees.

Brothers and sisters, infrastructure development in Jammu & Kashmir will lead to tourism and tourism will lead to employment generation. However, education and skill development play an important role in  employment. Central government has approved setting up of big institutions in the field of education in the state. Whether it is IIM or IIT that are going to be constructed in Jammu, these institutions are going to become a milestone in the development of the state. In addition to this, the scholarships have been provided to the students of Jammu & Kashmir for completing their education in the reputed universities and colleges of the country.

Brothers and sisters, women empowerment has been a priority for the government. Several schemes for providing financial and social power to women have been launched in the last four years. Nearly 9.5 crore women entrepreneurs of the country have obtained loans for their small businesses without any bank guarantee. More than 50 lakh women of state of Jammu & Kashmir are among them. On the other hand, the government has been working towards providing smoke free kitchen to poor mothers and sisters of the country under the Ujjwala scheme. Clean cooking – this scheme has been proving to be  specially beneficial to mothers and sisters from the villages, be it Dalits, oppressed or backwards it has been beneficial to all the mothers and sisters belonging to all these communities. While more than 4 crore LPG connections have been provided free of cost in the country, the Ujjwala scheme has reached the kitchen of more than 4 lakh mothers and sisters in Jammu & Kashmir.

Friends, under the Clean India Mission, a movement to rid the country of open defecation has been launched. This is not just related to cleanliness but it is also an issue of honour of women. The country and the world  have seen how much aware the mothers and sisters of Jammu & Kashmir have been about this movement. I myself saw  an 87 year old lady constructing a toilet in Udhampur. She did not take anybody’s help,  there was just one passion to join this cleanliness mission.

Friends, when this kind of efforts are made then the courage and conviction increase by several times. At some place, five year old girls  are joining in this movement and somewhere else 87 year old mother is joining this movement. The depth of the feeling towards cleanliness and dignity can be gauged from this fact only. And this is the reason that the coverage of rural cleanliness has gone beyond 80 per cent. Under this scheme, toilets in more than 8.5 lakh houses have been constructed in Jammu & Kashmir too.

Friends, financial and social empowerment of women will be incomplete till the time attention is not paid to their skill development. This is the reason that several efforts have been made for the development of skills  of women of Jammu & Kashmir. Nearly 5,000women have been provided training for the trade related to handicrafts, tailoring and agriculture. 

Brothers and sisters, when I came here two years ago then I had made an appeal to the youth of this place, to all of you to take maximum advantage of the schemes run by the government. Today, I am happy to  inform that the youth of this place had taken maximum advantage of these schemes. More than 20 lakh people have opened their bank accounts in the state under the Prime Minister Jan Dhan scheme. And nearly 8,00 crore rupees have been deposited in these accounts; I am only talking about Jammu &Kashmir. More than 40 thousand of my brother and sister workers of the state working in the un-organised sector have joined in the Atal Pension scheme which was formulated for them. More than 9 lakh people of the state have joined those two schemes with low premium which are being run by the government. And a claim amount of nearly Rs. 3 crore has already been disbursed under these schemes.

Friends, the youth of this area has always been ahead in joining in the armed forces. As per the tradition, a lot of avenues have been provided to the youth of the state to join in the armed forces. More than 20,000 people have been recruited in the army, central armed forces, police forces and India Reserve Battalions under the special recruitment drives.

Friends, this is the land of Dogras, this is the land of braves. This place has both valour and patience, it also has sweet music as well. While it has fragrance coming from Basmati rice fields yet it also has potential for modern factories. Our determination is steadfast and our path is correct too. I have no doubt that with the blessings of divine mother Vaishno Devi and the hard work done by you people, this state shall scale the new heights of development and it shall certainly achieve success.

Thank you.

                My young colleagues and all the dignitaries present here. 

Friends, 

       This morning I got the opportunity to visit different parts of Jammu & Kashmir. I got late in coming here, we arrived late by almost an hour or so.  First of all, I beg your pardon for reaching late here.  Today, several projects of development have been dedicated from Leh to Srinagar. Some new projects have been started. I have always known the capacity of farms and fields of Jammu and orchards of Kashmir and also felt the spiritual and natural power of Leh-Laddakh. Whenever I come here my belief gets further strengthened that this is the one region of the country that has capability to march ahead in terms of development.  We have been moving in the right direction, we have been achieving success due to the meaningful attempts made by the hard working people and due to the talented youth like you. 

       Friends, this university is nearly 20 years old and since then so many students have passed out from here. And they have been making their contribution in the social life at some place or other. 

      It is the sixth convocation ceremony of the university today. I got the opportunity to come amongst you on this occasion. I express my sincere gratitude to the university administration for inviting me. I am happy that some students from the schools of Jammu are also present here today. Today, the certificates, degrees and medals have been awarded to more than 400 students. This is the result of the hard work done by you as a part of this distinguished institution of the country. I extend my best wishes and congratulations to all of you, especially to daughters as today they have emerged victorious. 

     Today, you look at sports, you look at education, everywhere daughters are doing wonders. I see it before me that there is a spark in your eyes, a confidence is there in your eyes. This sparkle is there while realising both the dreams and challenges of the future. 

Friends,

     This is not just a degree or certificate in your hands but it is a certificate of hopes of farmers of the country. The certificates that you are holding in your hands, it is full of hopes and aspirations of farmers of the country. This is a certificate of those millions and millions of hopes which the farmers of this country, who feed us, have of you people with a lot of expectation. 

      Technology has been changing with the time and this changing technology has been changing the basics of a lot of things. The one who can cope up with this fast pace it is the youth of this country. And because of this today I am amongst you, when I got the opportunity to talk to you people, I considered it very important. 

Friends, 

      The way technology has been changing the nature of jobs and new avenues of employments are being created, similarly it is necessary to develop a new culture in the agriculture sector. The more we make our traditional methods technology centric the more it will be beneficial for farmers. And by following this vision, the central government has been encouraging the use of modern technology linked to the agriculture sector in the country. 

     More than 12 crore soil health cards have been distributed in the country so far. More than 11 lakh farmers in Jammu & Kashmir have received these cards out of the total. With the help of these cards, farmers are becoming aware about what kind of fertiliser is required; what is required in their fields. 

       Farmers have also benefitted from 100 per cent Neem coated  urea. This has not only resulted in the increase in production but it has also brought down the urea consumption per hectare. 

     Micro and sprinkler irrigation has been given encouragement while keeping in the mind the modern technology for irrigation and use of every single drop of water. Per drop more crop, this should be our mission. 

     In the last four years, more than 24 lakh hectare area have been brought under the micro and sprinkler irrigation. Union cabinet has approved more than Rs. 5,000 crore fund for micro irrigation just two days ago. All these polices, all these decisions, they strengthen our target of doubling the farmer’s income. And you people are an important part of the system which is being created through these efforts. 

      This is the country’s expectation of you people that after completing your education here, you will play an active role in making the agriculture a profitable venture with the help of scientific approach, technological innovation and research and development. It is the responsibility of our younger generation to make the agriculture and animal husbandry and other related activities better by using the modern technology. 

      My expectations have gone up when I heard about the efforts made by you people. I have also been informed about the model developed by you and your university to raise the farmer’s income in this region. You have named it integrated farming system model or IFS Model. This model includes grains, it also covers fruits and vegetables, flowers, animal husbandry, fisheries and poultry, it also includes compost, mushroom, biogas and it also has the concept of planting trees on the boundaries of farms. Not only it will ensure higher monthly income but also provide twice as much employment in a year. 

       This model that ensures a farmer’s income  all through the years is very important in itself. You got clean energy, you also got freedom from waste, village cleanliness has also been ensured, and your model also ensures doubling of farmer’s income in comparison with the traditional model of farming.  I would like to especially praise your model that you people have developed by taking into account the climatic condition of this place. I would like that this model should be publicised more in Jammu and nearby areas. 

Friends,

    The government does not want the farmers to be dependent on just one crop. And we have been placing emphasis on encouraging all those things that can be a source of additional income. The development of new sectors of future in agriculture is going to be an integral part of the farmer’s development, it is going to help it. 

     In addition to the green and white revolutions, the more emphasis we will lay on the organic revolution, water revolution, blue revolution, sweet revolution, the farmer’s income will increase in the same proportion. This was the thinking of the government in the budget presented by us. Earlier an arrangement was made for encouraging the dairy sector but this time we have created two new funds with an allocation of Rs. 10,000 crore for fisheries and animal husbandry. It means that now the farmers will easily get support for agriculture and animal husbandry. In addition to this, the facility of credit extended to them through Kisan Credit Cards, which was earlier restricted only to agriculture, now this credit facility will also be available to farmers for fisheries and animal husbandry. 

       A big scheme has also been announced recently for reforming the agriculture sector. Eleven schemes related to agriculture have been included in the HaritKrantiKrishiUnnatiYojana. And an amount of Rs. 33,000 crore has been allocated for this. And this amount of Rs. 33,000 crore is not a small amount. 

Friends, 

    The Government is focused on creating wealth from waste in a big manner. Now this kind of movement is picking pace in different parts of the country that has been working for converting agriculture waste into wealth. 

     In this year’s budget, the government has also announced a scheme called GobarDhanYojana. In addition to increasing the village cleanliness, it will also help in increasing the income of farmers and people engaged in animal husbandry by utilising the bio wastage generated in the village. It’s not like that the wealth can only be created through byproducts. Sometimes the different use of main product of the crop can also boost the farmer’s income. Be it coir waste or coconut shells or bamboo waste or residue left in the farm after harvesting the crop, all these can help you to supplement your income. 

     In addition to this, we have also made it easier to cultivate bamboo by amending the bamboo related old law. You would be surprised to know that our country was importing bamboo worth Rs. 15,000 crore every year. There was no logic in it. 

Friends, 

      I’ve also been informed that you people have developed new varieties of 12 crops here. Ranveer Basmati, perhaps, this is very famous all over the country. Your effort is commendable.

      However, the challenges faced by the agriculture sector today are not limited to just the quality of seeds. This challenge is also related to change in the climate. This is the result of the hard work done by our farmers, our agriculture scientists and policies of the government that our farmers have had record production during the last year. Be it wheat or rice or pulses, all the old records have been broken. Edible oil seeds and cotton have also registered massive increase in production. But if you look at the data of the last few years then you would find that some kind of uncertainty still persists in the production. And the biggest reason behind this is the dependence of our agriculture on rain water. 

      Because of the impact of climate change, while on the one hand a rise in the temperature has been witnessed, on the other some parts are becoming rain deficient. Its impact is also being seen in Jammu & Kashmir. Be it paddy cultivation or horticulture or tourism, water in sufficient quantities is essential for all these things. Glaciers meet the need of water in Jammu & Kashmir. But glaciers are melting at a fast pace because of the way temperature is rising. And as a result of it there is water shortage in some areas and in some other areas it has resulted in floods. 

Friends, 

       When I was reading about your university while coming here I also got to know about the FASAL project of you.  You try to assess before the start of the crop season about the crop production and what kind of humidity is going to be there throughout the year. But now you need to go beyond this. New technologies are required to deal with new challenges. This strategy is required at both the level of crop as well as at the level of technology. We will have to consider those crops which consume less water. And it should also be part of your continuous thought process that how to add value in the agricultural produce. 

     I will give you an example of sea buckthorn. Perhaps, many  of you are aware about this sea buckthorn. This plant which is being found in the Laddakh region has the capacity to tolerate the harsh weather and temperature between minus 40 degree to plus 40 degree centigrade. No matter how dry the season may be but it keeps flourishing on its own. Reference to its medicinal properties is also being found in the Tibetan literature of the 8th century AD. Several modern institutes of the country and the world have considered it extremely valuable. Be it the problem of blood pressure or fever or be it tumor or stone or ulcer or be it the problem of cold and cough; the medicines made of this sea buckthorn provide relief from these problems. 

     As per one study, the sea buckthorn available in the world alone can meet the entire vitamin C requirement of the world. The value addition of this agriculture product has changed the entire scenario. Now sea buckthorn has been used in a big way in herbal tea, in jam and protective oil and cream and also in health drinks. It is very useful for armed force personnel deployed at a very high altitude. Sea buckthorn has been used in producing several antioxidant products. 

      Today, I am giving this example from this platform, I also say this thing because whichever area of the country will be chosen by you people as your workplace you will find several such products there. You can develop a model there because of efforts made by you. While emerging as an agriculture scientist from a student and by adding value you can become the leader of an agricultural revolution. 

    There is another important topic in agriculture, it is artificial intelligence. This is going to bring about revolutionary changes in agriculture in the near future. Farmers have been using it in a limited manner in some parts of the country, like use of drone technology in pest control and for spraying medicines has gradually started now days. 

     In addition to this, new technology has been used in soil mapping and community pricing. Apart from this, the block chain technology will also have an important role in the coming days. This technology will make possible real time monitoring of supply chains. This will bring about transparency in the dealings in the agriculture sector. Most important thing is that it will check the misdeeds of middlemen and it will also check the wastage of production. 

Friends,

        We all know this thing very well that one of the reasons behind rising cost of agriculture is poor quality seeds, fertiliser and medicines. Block chain technology can help tackle this problem. With the help of this technology, a product can be easily checked at any stage from production to till the time it reaches to farmers. 

       There will be a complete network which will include farmer processing units, distributors, regulatory authorities and consumers. This technology can be developed on the basis of a smart contract agreed upon between all these parties. And because anyone connected in this entire chain can keep an eye on this thing therefore there is very small possibility of corruption in this system. 

      In addition to this, this technology can also set the farmers free from incurring the loss due to changing prices of their commodities. Any person connected in this chain can share information with each other in real time. And prices can be determined at every stage as per mutual understanding. 

Friends,

      The government has already been linking the village markets across the country under schemes like e-NAM. In addition to this, an effort is being made to link more than 22,000 village and wholesale markets with the global market.  The government is also emphasizing on and encouraging the farm producers organization (FPOs). The farmers can very easily link themselves with village markets and big markets on their own by farming their small associations. 

    Now, the technology like block chain will also make our efforts more meaningful. 

Friends, 

        You people will have to think about developing such models that are friendly to futuristic technologies besides being appropriate to local needs. 

       We should focus our attention on this thing: how can we have new innovations and new start ups in the agriculture sector. You should make consistent efforts to link the local farmers with technology. And I have been told that during your course you people have done a lot of work to link the farmers with the organic farming at the local level. You people have also been doing research to develop the crops that are appropriate for organic farming. This kind of different attempts at every level will also make the life of farmers easier. 

Friends, 

      In the last four years, central government has approved several schemes for the farmers and horticulturists of Jammu & Kashmir. Five hundred crore rupees have been sanctioned for other schemes related to agriculture and horticulture and Rs. 150 crore of this amount has already been released. Cold storages are being constructed in Leh and Kargil. In addition to this, a subsidy of Rs. 20 crore has been provided for the people setting up the solar dryers. 

     I am hopeful that the efforts made by the government, from seeds to market, will further strengthen the farmers of the state. 

Friends, 

      The country is going to celebrate 75 years of its independence in 2022. I believe that many of you students would have established yourselves as a good agriculture scientists. I urge you that your university and the students of the university must set a target for yourself while keeping the year 2022 in mind. For example, it could be deliberated that how our university could be included not only in the top universities of the country but also in the top 200 universities of the world. 

     Similarly, the students of the university can make a pledge about increasing the crop production per hectare or taking the modern technology to maximum number of farmers. 

Friends, 

      When we talk about making the agriculture technology led and entrepreneurship driven then the development of quality human resources is a big challenge in itself. 

      The responsibility of all the institutions in the country, like your university, goes up. In such a situation, five Ts - training, talent, technology, timely action and trouble free approach becomes very important in my view. These five Ts are very important for bringing about revolutionary changes the country’s agricultural system. And, I am hopeful that you will also keep these things in mind while deciding about your resolves. 

Friends, 

       Today, you people are coming out of a closed environment of your classrooms and I convey my best wishes to you. You are coming out of this class room made of walls but a very big and open classroom is waiting for you people outside. At this place, just one stage of your learning process has come to an end, the serious education of a real life is starting from here. Therefore, you will have to keep alive the mindset of a student in you. You should never let die this student inside you. Only then you will be able to develop a better model for the farmers of the country through your innovative ideas. 

       You should make a pledge and realise your dreams and your parent’s dreams. You should make your contribution in nation building. With this hope, I conclude my speech and I convey my best wishes and congratulate all my colleagues. I convey by best wishes to their parents as well. Congratulations.

Thank you very much.

     Once again I have got the opportunity to come amongst you in Jammu & Kashmir. Your love and affection brings me here again and again. There will not be a single year in the last four years when I did not come here. When Diwali was celebrated in Srinagar after the floods, I had celebrated my Diwali here among the flood victims. In addition to this I got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers deployed on the border and today I am amongst you when it is the holy month of Ramzan. This month is the occasion of remembering Prophet Mohammad Saheb and his teachings. The teachings of equality and brotherhood from his life alone can take the country and the world forward in the true sense of word. 

 

       It’s also a happy coincidence that we had gathered here on fulfillment of a big dream in this holy month of Ramzan. Today, I got the good opportunity to dedicate Kishanganga Hydro Electric Project to the nation.  After overcoming several hurdles this project is ready to add new dimensions in the developmental journey of Jammu & Kashmir. I congratulate all of you on this occasion. Not only will it provide free electricity to the state, but it will also provide free of cost electricity. At present, a big part of Jammu & Kashmir’s electricity requirement is being met by other parts of the country. With the start of this 330 megawatt electricity project, the problem of electricity shortage in the state will be solved to a great extent. 

Brothers and sisters, 

    This project is a shining example of engineering skills. Several people have worked hard to complete this project. Water of Kishan Ganga river has been supplied to Bonar Nullah in Bandipora by digging a tunnel in the mountain. Every worker, every engineer, every employee of this project is especially praiseworthy. It was the result of your courage that we could complete this project. 

      Today, I also got the opportunity to lay the foundation stone for a ring road for Srinagar from this platform. More than 500 crore rupees will be spent on this 42 kilometer long road. This ring road will solve the problem of traffic jam in the interior areas of Sirnagar city to a great extent, it will make your life convenient. 

    And, the development of all three regions of the state – Kashmir, Jammu & Laddakh is also essential to bring about the change in the lives of people of Jammu & Kashmir. A package of Rs. 80,000 crore was approved while keeping this thing in the mind. I am glad that projects worth Rs. 63,000 crore have been sanctioned in such a short span of time and more than Rs. 20,000 crore have already been spent. The work of constructing an IIT and IIM in Jammu & Kashmir and the modernization of primary healthcare centres to district hospitals has also been going on with the help of this fund. 

       New national highways, all-weather roads, new tunnels, power transmission and distribution lines, conservation of rivers and lakes, schemes for farmers, cold storage, warehouses and new initiatives for providing employment to youth, several such new initiatives have been taken up. The work is being done on the priority basis to make the 21st century Jammu & Kashmir as per the expectations and aspirations of the people of this place.  

Friends, 

        Whenever I visit mountains I am always reminded of one proverb. Earlier it was said that the youth and water of a hilly area never come to its use. This proverb is of that time when modern technology was not so widespread and the man was powerless against the nature. Now the time has changed. We are determined to change this proverb with the help of you people. Both the water and youth of Jammu & Kashmir are going to be useful for this land. 

      There are several rivers in Jammu & Kashmir that have a lot of potential for hydro power. This is that part of the country that has the capacity to not only produce enough power for itself but for the country as well. We have been working on several projects in the last four years while keeping this thing in mind. Soon the work will start on a hydro power plant in Kishtwar at a cost of Rs. 8,000 crore. 

      Continuous efforts are being made to provide uninterrupted electricity to every household in Jammu & Kashmir. Advanced technologies like smart grid and smart meters are being used. Street Lights are being modernized. More than Rs. 4,000 crore is being spent to provide electricity from villages to towns of Jammu & Kashmir and to improve the electricity distribution system of the state. 

Friends, 

      Our aim is not to just supply electricity to villages and households but  efforts are also being made to lessen the burden of electricity bill on those households where electricity has already been supplied. More than 78 lakh LED bulbs have been distributed in Jammu and Kashmir under the Ujala scheme. It has been saving more than Rs. 400 crore to the people of the state per year on account of electricity bulbs. The government is busy in providing electricity to every household in the state. Under the Saubhagya scheme, the work is going on to provide electricity to every such household where there was no electricity connection so far.  

Friends,

     If there is anything called the biggest means of development of Jammu & Kashmir, if there is any such sector then it is tourism. We have observed this for decades that this sector which produces highest number of employment with  the least investment, it has been the fortune maker for the state of Jammu & Kashmir. However, this sector no longer works on old method. Modern tourist wants facilities. He does not want to wait for hours to go from one place to another, he does not want to get stuck in the narrow lanes, he wants uninterrupted supply of electricity, he wants cleanliness and he wants good air service. 

     Our government has been moving forward with several schemes while keeping in the mind the requirements of a modern ecosystem required for tourism. The more powerful this system will become the more tourists will come to Jammu & Kashmir. Not only this, the youth of Jammu & Kashmir will also get new avenues for employment and your income will increase in the same proportion. 

Friends,

      There are several regions in the world where the entire economy is focused on tourism - the economy of the entire country. Jammu & Kashmir alone has that capacity that it can further increase the rate of growth of economy of the country. If I talk about tourism alone then the work of developing 12 development authorities, 3 tourism circuits and 50 tourist villages is being done at an investment of Rs. 2,000 crore. However, as I have said earlier, it is extremely essential to strengthen not only tourism but also the entire eco system of tourism. 

    Connectivity is a big basis for ecosystem. And that is the reason that large scale efforts are made to improve the connectivity in Jammu & Kashmir. Almost half of the total package given to the state is being spent on road sector. A network of national highways is being laid in Jammu & Kashmir. 

    I have inaugurated the work on the country’s longest tunnel – Zojilla Tunnel – before coming here. This tunnel is going to write a new story of development of Jammu & Kashmir. Just imagine, if connectivity improves you can get rid of a lot of inconveniences such as  if you are going for study, going to meet relatives or for treatment or for business or for sale and purchase of goods.  We will be able to reduce the losses suffered by the farmers of this place to a great extent because of delay in transportation as your apples and vegetables become stale or useless due to delay in transportation.  

    Whether it is the ring road that is going to be constructed in Srinagar or be it Srinagar-Shopian-Kazigund national highway or be it Chengani-Sudh Mahadev-Goha Road, the completion of these projects will save your time and it will also reduce the losses of your resources. Those areas of the state which become unreachable during the snowfall, they are also being linked, a helicopter service is being provided for those areas. You people are also aware that the government is working to develop Srinagar and Jammu into smart cities.  

     Over Rs. 550 crore  are being spent to improve water supply and sewage system in the cities. When there will be modern facilities, modern roads then it will not only improve your lives but it will also add a lot of value in the beauty of Jammu & Kashmir. 

Brothers and sisters,

      When we talk about making villages and cities ‘smart’ then cleanliness is an important part of this thing. I am happy to note that the people of Jammu & Kashmir has been taking forward this mission with all their might. 

      I have recently seen a video of a Kashmiri girl on social media. Five year old ‘Jannat’ was busy in cleaning the Dal lake. When the future of the country thinks in such a sacred and honest manner as a member of this mission I become even happier. Friends, there are several other people who have been doing several such things at their levels. 

Brothers and sisters, 

      I am aware that the destruction caused by the massive flood in the state has fundamentally changed your lives. We have been making every effort to compensate for the losses incurred at various places. And for this purpose, regular help is being provided to the state government. 

Friends, 

      There is one more very serious issue on which the PDP-BJP coalition government and union government have been working jointly. This issue is of displaced people. Those who have come here from across the border because of the bad situation there, and also those who had to leave their homes due to local problems, nearly Rs. 3,500 crore are being spent on their rehabilitation at different places. 

Friends, 

      Today, the youth of Jammu & Kashmir are becoming role models for the youth of other states. When I see the names of the youth of the state in the list of civil services, when I meet them I become very happy. I remember that when a girl from Bandipora brought laurels for the country in kick-boxing the country felt immense pride. The country can’t allow to waste a talent like Tajamul. And this is the reason why the central government has been working jointly with the state government to shape the sporting talents of the state. And every effort is being made with the same spirit to develop sports related infrastructure in the state. 

Brothers and sisters,

      Serious efforts are made to provide the educational and employment opportunities to the youth of Jammu & Kashmir. Several schemes have been implemented in coordination with the state government. The work to train more than one lakh youth of the state is being underway under the Himayat scheme. More than 16,000 students have received benefit of Prime Minister Special Scholarship Scheme. They have been provided with the opportunity to complete their higher education in the top colleges and universities of the country. An offer of service has been made to nearly 60,000 students who had to leave the education midway due to different reasons. 

      New opportunities are created for the youth of the state so that they can become useful for the safety and security of the citizens of the state and the country. Five battalions of India Reserve force have been sanctioned to strengthen the police in Jammu & Kashmir. I have been told that the process of recruitment is in its last stage and after that five thousand youths of the state will be employed in the security sector. 

Brothers and sisters,

      Safety and security of the country and its citizen is the biggest priority for our government. Our security forces are fully committed to discharge this duty. I would like to say to all of you, to Jammu & Kashmir police, paramilitary forces and Jawans of Indian army that you have been doing  a wonderful job in the midst of a very difficult situation. You people deserve the credit for the kind of coordination and synergy you have. The contribution of the security forces for every resident of Jammu & Kashmir who was stuck in a difficult situation is immense, be it flood or storm or the calamities like fire. Every single image of the difficulties faced by them for the people of Jammu & Kashmir is imprinted on the minds of people of the country. 

Brothers and sisters, 

    Today, 1.25 billion people of the country have been working to realise the pledge of making a New India. Jammu & Kashmir can become the most shining star of this New India. There is no reason why Jammu & Kashmir can’t have the best educational institutes of the country, best hospitals, best roads and most modern airport of the country. There is no reason why the children of the state cannot become good doctors, good engineers, good professors or good officers.  

Friends, 

      There are a lot of powers who do not want the development of Jammu & Kashmir, who do not want the happiness of the people of the state, however, friends, we need to move forward by giving a fitting reply to these foreign powers. 

       The coalition government of PDP-BJP working in the state under the leadership of Mehbooba Mufti Ji and NDA government at the centre have regularly been working to bring those youths back in the mainstream who have been influenced by the foreign propaganda and have been assaulting their own holy land. 

Friends,

      There is no alternative to peace and stability. I appeal to those youth who have gone astray that they should comeback in the mainstream. And this mainstream is their family and their parents. This main stream is there active contribution in the development of Jammu & Kashmir. Enhancing the prestige of Jammu & Kashmir is the responsibility of this young generation. There are so much means, so much resources, so much capability.  There is no reason why Jammu & Kashmir should lag behind  in comparison to other parts of India. Every single stone, every single weapon picked up by the misguided youths destabilises their own Jammu & Kashmir. 

      Now the state must get out of this atmosphere of instability. They will have to join the mainstream of development of India for the sake of their own future, and for the sake of their future generations. For thousands of years we lived as the children of motherland India. There is no power on earth that can drive a wedge between brothers. Those people who have been working towards that end for  decades, now are on the verge of disintegration. 

Brothers and sisters, 

      I would once again say this thing that last year I had celebrated Diwali in Gurez among Jawans and this year I am amongst you on the occasion of Ramzan. And this is the feeling of Kashmir, and this is the gift of this land and the world. Everybody is welcome here, everybody is respected here. This is the land of that tradition which is not present anywhere else in the world. This land has been enriched more by traditions rather than by different sects and communities. Atal Ji was a follower of this Kashmiriyat and so is Modi. And I had said this thing from the ramparts of the Red Fort:

    Today’s problem is not going to be solved by use of abusive language or through bullets; this problem will be solved by embracing every Kashmiri. 

      Both the state and central governments have both policy and intention for the development of state of Jammu & Kashmir and we never lag behind in taking decisions. Whether it is the process of taking back the thousands of court cases from students or be it the ceasefire which has been announced in this holy month of Ramzan, the thinking behind these decision are that every youth, every person of Kashmir should get stability and development. 

Friends, 

     This is not just a ceasefire, this is also a means to expose those who spread terror in the name of Islam. I believe that people of Jammu & Kashmir can see this thing how efforts were made to keep them under illusion. The government has  appointed an interlocutor to take forward this process of stability. He has been meeting the elected representatives of people and also with different institutions and bodies of the state. And I expect people to go and share their issues with him. He has been trying to strengthen the peace process by talking to everyone. 

Brothers and sisters, 

       The government is not leaving any stone unturned for this thing. However, I appeal to all of you, to all the citizens of Jammu & Kashmir to maintain this alliance of democracy and Kashmiriyat; the biggest responsibility and the biggest role in this thing is of the parents of the state, of the youth of the state and of the intellectuals and religious leaders of the state. 

      Let all of us focus our entire energy only on one thing and that is development of Jammu & Kashmir. There is only one solution for all the problems, for all the disputes and differences and it is development and development alone. 

      I am confident that along with a New India, a New Jammu & Kashmir, a peaceful and prosperous Jammu & Kashmir will further strengthen the developmental story of India. And because of this confidence, I openly share my feelings with you people. I open my heart. And I tell the people of the world that all the countries of the world those who have followed this path (path of terrorism) they are regretting it today. Everybody is turning back. They are trying to find the ways to turn around. And that is why we have to take forward our legacy of this life of peace and tranquility, this life of brotherhood, the life of peace and prosperity and a happy and contented life. And the central government will not leave anything wanting, we will take every step wherever they are required and your support will be with us in this thing. We will be able to achieve our desired goals for which we have started our journey and once again the whole of Jammu & Kashmir will once again provide the opportunity to embrace everyone with love and affection as it has always done. 

Isi Bhawana Ke Saath Setha-Setha Shukriya, Aj Diyu Ijazat, Khudai Thai Nav Khoshat Khush-hal.

Thank you.

     Once again I have got the opportunity to come amongst you in Jammu & Kashmir. Your love and affection brings me here again and again. There will not be a single year in the last four years when I did not come here. When Diwali was celebrated in Srinagar after the floods, I had celebrated my Diwali here among the flood victims. In addition to this I got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers deployed on the border and today I am amongst you when it is the holy month of Ramzan. This month is the occasion of remembering Prophet Mohammad Saheb and his teachings. The teachings of equality and brotherhood from his life alone can take the country and the world forward in the true sense of word. 

 

       It’s also a happy coincidence that we had gathered here on fulfillment of a big dream in this holy month of Ramzan. Today, I got the good opportunity to dedicate Kishanganga Hydro Electric Project to the nation.  After overcoming several hurdles this project is ready to add new dimensions in the developmental journey of Jammu & Kashmir. I congratulate all of you on this occasion. Not only will it provide free electricity to the state, but it will also provide free of cost electricity. At present, a big part of Jammu & Kashmir’s electricity requirement is being met by other parts of the country. With the start of this 330 megawatt electricity project, the problem of electricity shortage in the state will be solved to a great extent. 

Brothers and sisters, 

    This project is a shining example of engineering skills. Several people have worked hard to complete this project. Water of Kishan Ganga river has been supplied to Bonar Nullah in Bandipora by digging a tunnel in the mountain. Every worker, every engineer, every employee of this project is especially praiseworthy. It was the result of your courage that we could complete this project.

I have been told that the process of recruitment is in its last stage and after that five thousand youths of the state will be employed in the security sector. 

Brothers and sisters,

      Safety and security of the country and its citizen is the biggest priority for our government. Our security forces are fully committed to discharge this duty. I would like to say to all of you, to Jammu & Kashmir police, paramilitary forces and Jawans of Indian army that you have been doing  a wonderful job in the midst of a very difficult situation. You people deserve the credit for the kind of coordination and synergy you have. The contribution of the security forces for every resident of Jammu & Kashmir who was stuck in a difficult situation is immense, be it flood or storm or the calamities like fire. Every single image of the difficulties faced by them for the people of Jammu & Kashmir is imprinted on the minds of people of the country. 

Brothers and sisters, 

    Today, 1.25 billion people of the country have been working to realise the pledge of making a New India. Jammu & Kashmir can become the most shining star of this New India. There is no reason why Jammu & Kashmir can’t have the best educational institutes of the country, best hospitals, best roads and most modern airport of the country. There is no reason why the children of the state cannot become good doctors, good engineers, good professors or good officers.  

Friends, 

      There are a lot of powers who do not want the development of Jammu & Kashmir, who do not want the happiness of the people of the state, however, friends, we need to move forward by giving a fitting reply to these foreign powers. 

       The coalition government of PDP-BJP working in the state under the leadership of Mehbooba Mufti Ji and NDA government at the centre have regularly been working to bring those youths back in the mainstream who have been influenced by the foreign propaganda and have been assaulting their own holy land. 

Friends,

      There is no alternative to peace and stability. I appeal to those youth who have gone astray that they should comeback in the mainstream. And this mainstream is their family and their parents. This main stream is there active contribution in the development of Jammu & Kashmir. Enhancing the prestige of Jammu & Kashmir is the responsibility of this young generation. There are so much means, so much resources, so much capability.  There is no reason why Jammu & Kashmir should lag behind  in comparison to other parts of India. Every single stone, every single weapon picked up by the misguided youths destabilises their own Jammu & Kashmir. 

      Now the state must get out of this atmosphere of instability. They will have to join the mainstream of development of India for the sake of their own future, and for the sake of their future generations. For thousands of years we lived as the children of motherland India. There is no power on earth that can drive a wedge between brothers. Those people who have been working towards that end for  decades, now are on the verge of disintegration. 

Brothers and sisters, 

      I would once again say this thing that last year I had celebrated Diwali in Gurez among Jawans and this year I am amongst you on the occasion of Ramzan. And this is the feeling of Kashmir, and this is the gift of this land and the world. Everybody is welcome here, everybody is respected here. This is the land of that tradition which is not present anywhere else in the world. This land has been enriched more by traditions rather than by different sects and communities. Atal Ji was a follower of this Kashmiriyat and so is Modi. And I had said this thing from the ramparts of the Red Fort:

    Today’s problem is not going to be solved by use of abusive language or through bullets; this problem will be solved by embracing every Kashmiri. 

      Both the state and central governments have both policy and intention for the development of state of Jammu & Kashmir and we never lag behind in taking decisions. Whether it is the process of taking back the thousands of court cases from students or be it the ceasefire which has been announced in this holy month of Ramzan, the thinking behind these decision are that every youth, every person of Kashmir should get stability and development. 

Friends, 

     This is not just a ceasefire, this is also a means to expose those who spread terror in the name of Islam. I believe that people of Jammu & Kashmir can see this thing how efforts were made to keep them under illusion. The government has  appointed an interlocutor to take forward this process of stability. He has been meeting the elected representatives of people and also with different institutions and bodies of the state. And I expect people to go and share their issues with him. He has been trying to strengthen the peace process by talking to everyone. 

Brothers and sisters, 

       The government is not leaving any stone unturned for this thing. However, I appeal to all of you, to all the citizens of Jammu & Kashmir to maintain this alliance of democracy and Kashmiriyat; the biggest responsibility and the biggest role in this thing is of the parents of the state, of the youth of the state and of the intellectuals and religious leaders of the state. 

      Let all of us focus our entire energy only on one thing and that is development of Jammu & Kashmir. There is only one solution for all the problems, for all the disputes and differences and it is development and development alone. 

      I am confident that along with a New India, a New Jammu & Kashmir, a peaceful and prosperous Jammu & Kashmir will further strengthen the developmental story of India. And because of this confidence, I openly share my feelings with you people. I open my heart. And I tell the people of the world that all the countries of the world those who have followed this path (path of terrorism) they are regretting it today. Everybody is turning back. They are trying to find the ways to turn around. And that is why we have to take forward our legacy of this life of peace and tranquility, this life of brotherhood, the life of peace and prosperity and a happy and contented life. And the central government will not leave anything wanting, we will take every step wherever they are required and your support will be with us in this thing. We will be able to achieve our desired goals for which we have started our journey and once again the whole of Jammu & Kashmir will once again provide the opportunity to embrace everyone with love and affection as it has always done. 

Isi Bhawana Ke Saath Setha-Setha Shukriya, Aj Diyu Ijazat, Khudai Thai Nav Khoshat Khush-hal.

Thank you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, arrived in Leh on the first leg of a day-long visit to Jammu and Kashmir today.

He attended the Closing Ceremony of the Birth Centenary Celebration of the 19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche in Leh. At the same event, he unveiled a plaque to mark the commencement of work on the Zojila Tunnel.

The 14 km long Zojila tunnel will be India’s longest road tunnel and Asia’s longest bi-directional tunnel. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister, had approved the  construction, operation and maintenance of this tunnel between Baltal and Minamarg, on the Srinagar-Leh section of  NH-1A, at a total cost of Rs 6800 crore earlier this year. The construction of this tunnel will provide all-weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh. It will cut down the time taken to cross the Zojila pass from the present three and a half hours, to just fifteen minutes. It will lead to all-round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions. It also has immense strategic importance.

Addressing a large gathering on the occasion, the Prime Minister recalled the rich contribution of the 19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche. His was a life dedicated to serving others, the Prime Minister said. 

He added that the 19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche distinguished himself as an outstanding diplomat. He mentioned that during his visit to Mongolia, he had witnessed first-hand, the goodwill he has in that country. 

Shri Narendra Modi expressed happiness that he is visiting the three regions of Jammu and Kashmir today. 

He said the State of Jammu and Kashmir is going to get development projects worth Rs. 25,000 crore. These projects will have a positive impact on the people of the state, he added.

                Thirty nine Officer Trainees of Indian Foreign Service, currently undergoing training in the Foreign Service Institute, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi today. 

 

Addressing the Officer Trainees, the Prime Minister stressed the importance of representing India abroad in the context of India’s rich history, culture and traditions. The Prime Minister said that IFS Officers should remain alive not only to the current national priorities, but also future requirements for national development. The Prime Minister encouraged the Officer Trainees to become more tech-savvy and engage fully with the State governments and diaspora, who are increasingly important stakeholders in the conduct of foreign relations.

 

Two diplomats from Bhutan, also currently under training at the Foreign Service Institute, also joined the group.

                Shakyaji, you, your colleagues and Kathmandu's municipal corporation have organized this reception for me. I am extremely grateful to you people for this thing. It is not only for me, but it is an honor to entire India. Not only me, but 1.25 billion Indians are also grateful. Every Indian has a relationship of affinity with Kathmandu and Nepal. And I am also fortunate to have got this thing. 

Even when I was not in politics… Whenever I visit Nepal, I have this feeling of peace and affection. And the biggest reason for this is your love, your affection and the warm welcome and respect shown by you people. 

Yesterday, I was in Janakpur. It gives a very important message to the modern world. What was the uniqueness of Raja Janak? He caused the destruction of weapon and joined all with love and affection. This is the land that destroys the weapons and binds with love and affection. 

Friends, whenever I think of Kathmandu then the image that emerges is not just of a city. That image is not of just a geographical valley. It’s not just that Kathmandu is mere capital of our neighbor and inseparable friend Nepal. It is not only the capital of the country of Mt. Everest and Lily Guraj. It is not only the capital of the country of Lord Buddha's birthplace. Kathmandu is a world in itself and the history of this world is as old, as majestic and as vast as the Himalayas. 

Kathmandu has always attracted me. Because this city is as deep as it is fast moving. It is a precious jewel in the lap of the Himalayas. Kathmandu, is not just a canopy made of wood. This is a divine and grand palace of our shared culture and heritage. The city's diversity gives a glimpse of Nepal's great heritage and its large heart. Whether it is the forest of Nagarjuna or the hills of Shivpuri, whether it is calmness of hundreds of waterfalls and streams or the origins of Baghmati, this city of thousands of temples, Manjushree caves and Buddhist monasteries is unique in the world in itself. 

From the roof of the buildings here one can see Dhaulagiri and Annapurna on one side and Sagarmatha on the other side which are known to the world as Everest and Kanchan Jangha. Where else this kind of view is possible? And if it is possible then it’s only and only in Kathmandu. 

The patterns of Basantpur, the reputation of Patan, the magnificence of Bharatpur, the art of Keertipur and the elegance of Lalitpur; it seems Kathmandu has gathered all the colors of a rainbow in itself. So many traditions are mixed in its air just as Roli mixes with sandalwood. Prayers at Pashupatinath; gathering of devotees; spirituality walking on the stairs of the Sovereign Lord; chanting of 'Om Mani Padme Hum' echoing at the every step taken by the pilgrims performing parikrma of Lord Buddha. It seems as if all the musical notes of a tune have embraced each other on the threads.

I have been told that certain festivals, such as the festivals of Nevari community, are such that have an unprecedented confluence of Buddhists and Hindu beliefs and practices. Tradition and culture have made the artisans and handicraft of Kathmandu unmatched. Whether it is handmade paper or statues like Tara and Buddha; whether it is utensils made of clay from Bharatpur or stone, wood and metal work of Patan, Kathmandu is the great amalgamation of Nepal's unique art and craftsmanship. And I am glad that the new generation of Nepal have been following very well this tradition. And it is also bringing a newness to it by modifying it as per the youth. 

Friends, I have had the privilege of visiting Pashupatinath in both of my visits to Nepal so far. In this visit, I was fortunate to visit Janakpur Dham and Muktinath in addition to Pashupati Nath, to all the three holy shrines. These three places are not only important pilgrim centers, they are India and Nepal's unshakable and unbreakable relation like Mt. Everest. In future whenever there will be an opportunity for me to visit Nepal, I will certainly make a programme to visit Lord Buddha's birth place Lumbini. 

Friends, peace, and balance with nature, and value systems of both of our countries which are filled with spiritual values, these are a legacy for all the mankind and for the entire world. And, therefore, it is not surprising thing that people from all over the world are drawn towards India and Nepal in search of peace. 

Some people go to Banaras and some other visit Bodh Gaya, while some go and stay in the lap of the Himalayas, while some other people live like ascetics in the monasteries of Buddha, but the quest is the same. The solution to the malaise of modern life will be found in the shared values ​​of India and Nepal. 

Friends, Pashupatinath located on the bank of river Bagmati in Kathmandu and Kashi Vishwanath located on the banks of river Ganges, Buddha's birthplace Lumbini, Bodh Gaya - the place for hermitage, and Sarnath – the region from where the message was delivered. 

Friends, we all of us have a rich and common heritage which is thousands of years old. Our shared heritage is the property of youth of both the countries. It has the roots of their past, the seeds of the present and the shoots of their future.

Friends, the entire world is passing through an era of several types of changes. Global environment is full of several fluctuations and uncertainties.

Friends, for thousands of years this belief that the whole world is one family has been the philosophy of India. We have been taking forward our philosophy of Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas (Together with all, development for all) in our foreign cooperation policy with the same piousness. There is a prayer in Indian scriptures: 

सर्वे भवन्‍तु सुखिन: सर्वे सन्‍तु निरामया:। सर्वे भद्राणि पश्‍यन्‍तु मा कश्चित् दुःख भाग्भवेत्।

Which means: May all be happy, may all be healthy. May there is wellbeing for everyone, may no one suffer. Indian seers have always dreamed of this thing. To achieve this ideal, our foreign policy is based on taking everyone along with us and we particularly share the experiences and opportunities of India with our neighborhood. In our culture ‘Neighborhood First’ is not just foreign policy but it is a way of living. There are many examples. While being a developing country itself, India has been cooperating for more than 50 years for capacity building in more than 160 countries under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Program, and we have been extending our cooperation as per the requirements of those countries. 

Last year India launched South Asia satellite. As a result of this, our neighboring countries are receiving its services as a gift from our space capabilities. And when I had come here at the same platform for SAARC Summit then I had announced this thing from the same platform. At the same time, we are also focusing on how we can forge international partnerships to face the major challenges of the modern world which no one country can handle on its own. For example, in 2016, India and France together conceived a new international treaty based organization in the context of climate change. This revolutionary step has now been converted into a successful experiment. 

In March this year, French President Macron and the leaders of nearly 50 other countries participated in the first summit of this International Solar Alliance in Delhi. Such efforts will help in forging technological and economic partnerships to meet the challenges of climate change, I am confident that this will particularly help in meeting the needs of small developing countries.

Friends, when Indians look at Nepal then we become very happy to see the environment and people here. The atmosphere in Nepal is full of optimism and of desire to have a bright future, and for strengthening the democracy, and also of the vision of a ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalese’, and all of you have contributed in a very big way in creating this environment. 

After the massive tragedy of the earthquake of 2015, the patience and indomitable courage exhibited by the people of Nepal and especially in Kathmandu is an example for the entire world. This is a testimony to the firm commitment and hard work of your society that a new system has been created in Nepal in such a short time while handling the disaster. After the earthquake, not just the buildings, in a way the whole country and society were rebuilt. Today there are democratic governments at all the three levels in Nepal - federal, provincial and local. And the elections for all three levels have been successfully conducted within one year. This power is inherent in all of you therefore I sincerely congratulate all of you. 

Friends, Nepal has come a long way from the war to Lord Buddha. Bullet was dominant power but Nepal has opted for ballot after giving up bullet. This is journey from the war to Buddha. However, the destination is still far away, you still have to go a long distance. In a way, now we have reached the base camp of Mount Everest, but we still need to climb to the summit of Mt. Everest. And as mountaineers get a very strong support and company from the Sherpas of Nepal, India is ready to do the work of a Sherpa for you people in this developmental journey of Nepal. 

This was the message that I have delivered in different words, this was the feeling that I have expressed yesterday and today during my Nepal visit, and also during the Prime Minister Oli’s visit to India last month. I am saying this thing with a lot of responsibility that Nepal must march ahead according to its own needs and priorities. India will always walk shoulder to shoulder with Nepal for its success. India’s success lies in your success. India’s happiness lies in Nepal’s happiness. 

Whether it is the work of constructing railway lines or laying roads or the work of hydropower or of transmission lines or of Integrated Check Post or of oil pipeline or whether it is the job of further strengthening the cultural and people to people ties between the people of Nepal and India, we are always with you in your every need and will continue to do so in future also. We have started the work on DPR (detailed project report) for connecting Kathmandu with India through railway. And, now, perhaps it is…I don’t know how much discussion it has received here in Nepal, these days IPL cricket matches are being organsied in India and Nepal has also connected with IPL. 

You are familiar with several recent initiatives of this journey. I have been told that for the first time a Nepalese player Sandeep Lamichane has been participating in the IPL. I hope that in future our people-to-people relationship will continue to be strengthened not only through cricket but also through other sports as well. 

Friends, with these words, I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the mayor of Kathmandu Shri Shakya ji, to the administration of Kathmandu, to the Government of Nepal, to the respected chief minister, to the respected foreign minister and to all of you. And I have the same feelings in my heart as you have in your hearts, the same feeling is there in my heart which is there in the heart of every Nepali, and the same feeling is there in the heart of every Indian and that is: 

Long Live, Nepal-India Friendship, 

Long Live, Nepal-India Friendship, 

Long Live, Nepal-India Friendship,

Thanks a lot.

Your Excellency, राइट ऑनरेबल प्रधानमंत्री 

श्री K. P. Sharma 

ओली जी, 

विशिष्ट अतिथिगण, 

उपस्थित media के साथियों, 

नमस्कार।
प्रधानमंत्री ज्यू, 

तपाई ले मेरो हार्दिक स्वागत र सत्कार गर्नुभयो। 

यस लाई म हार्दिक आभार व्यक्त गर्द छूँ। 


साथियों,

वैसे तो नेपाल से मेरा बहुत पुराना नाता रहा है, लेकिन प्रधानमंत्री के रूप में नेपाल की यह मेरी तीसरी यात्रा है। इससे यह स्पष्ट है कि नेपाल के प्रति, और भारत-नेपाल संबंधों के प्रति, मेरी और मेरी सरकार की प्रतिबद्धता कितनी गहरी है। और चाहे मैं प्रधानमंत्री के रूप में आया हूँ, या फ़िर एक सामान्य नागरिक के रूप में, नेपाल के लोगों ने मुझे हमेशा अपना माना है, और परिवार के सदस्य की तरह मेरा स्वागत किया है। इस अपनेपन के लिए, गर्मजोशी भरे स्वागत-सत्कार और सम्मान के लिए, मैं प्रधानमंत्री श्री ओली जी का, उनकी सरकार का, और नेपाल के लोगों का, ह्रदय से आभार प्रकट करता हूँ। नेपाल के साथ भारत के संबंध भी, दो सरकारों के संबंधों से कहीं ऊपर, इसी प्रकार पारिवारिक हैं, मित्रतापूर्ण हैं, और जन-सामान्य के बीच के आपसी मधुर और गहरे रिश्तों की मज़बूत नींव पर खड़े हैं।

Friends, 

मेरी यह नेपाल - यात्रा एक ऐसे ऐतिहासिक समय में हो रही है, जब नेपाल में federal, (प्रोविन्सिअल), और local, तीनों स्तरों पर चुनावों का सफ़ल आयोजन हो चुका है। नेपाल के इतिहास में यह कालखंड स्वर्णिम अक्षरों में लिखा जाएगा। नेपाल की जनता ने आर्थिक और सामाजिक प्रगति और परिवर्तन के लिए, राष्ट्र-निर्माण के लिए, प्रधानमंत्री ओली जी के नेतृत्व और vision में अपना भरोसा जताया है। नेपाल के लोगों द्वारा संघीय, लोकतांत्रिक framework में राष्ट्र-निर्माण और विकास यात्रा के फ़ैसले का मैं अभिनंदन करता हूँ। एक अखंड, समृध और सशक्त नेपाल के लिए सभी नेपाली लोगो की आकांक्षा का भारत समर्थन करता है समावेशी विकास और आर्थिक समृद्धि के आपके प्रयासों की सफ़लता के लिए भारत के सवा सौ करोड़ लोगों की शुभकामनाएं आपके साथ हैं।

Friends, 

पिछले महीने हमें भारत में प्रधानमंत्री ओली जी का स्वागत करने का अवसर मिला था। हमने दोनों देशों के विकास के लिए हमारे visions पर काफी बातचीत की थी। आज, यह मेरा सौभाग्य है कि मैं उनके साथ नेपाल की राजधानी में खड़ा हूँ। पड़ौस में, संपर्क और मित्रता के लिए भारत के विज़न की झलक मेरी इस यात्रा में मिलती है।


साथियों, 

भारत के लिए हमारा ""सबका साथ, सबका विकास” का vision, और नेपाल के लिए ओली जी का ""समृद्ध नेपाल, सुखी नेपाली” का नारा एक दूसरे के पूरक हैं। आज हमने एक बार फ़िर भारत और नेपाल की साझेदारी के सभी आयामों की समीक्षा की। लगभग पाँच सप्ताह पहले प्रधानमंत्री ओली जी भारत आए थे, तो उन्होंने मुझसे कई विषयों का उल्लेख किया था। मुझे प्रसन्नता है कि इतने कम समय में ही, दोनों देशों की teams ने मिल कर सभी मुद्दों पर काम किया है और कइ मुद्दों को तो सुलझा भी लिया है। आज की हमारी बातचीत में मैंने इस प्रगति के बारे में प्रधानमंत्री ओली जी को विस्तार से जानकारी दी। हमने कृषि, inland waterways और railways में कई परिवर्तनकारी पहलों की शुरुआत की है। इससे दोनों देशों के लोगों और व्यवसायों की आपसी connectivity बढ़ेगी। मैं inland waterways में हमारे सहयोग को विशेष रूप से महत्वपूर्ण मानता हूँ। नेपाल land-locked न रहे, बल्कि land-linked और water-linked हो, हम प्रधानमंत्री ओली जी के इस vision को साकार करने में हर संभव सहायता और प्रयास करने के लिए प्रतिबद्ध हैं। हमारे कृषि मंत्री शीघ्र ही मिलेंगे। और कृषि अनुसन्धान, कृषि शिक्षा और कृषि विकास में सहयोग के लिए roadmap तैयार करने पर काम करेंगे। रक्सौल और काठमांडू के बीच नए railway link के लिए survey का काम शीघ्र ही शुरू होगा। और trade and investment में हमारे संबंधों को और अधिक मजबूत करने के लिए, हम शीघ्र ही Treaty of Trade का comprehnsive review भी करेंगे। स्वास्थ्य सहयोग में हम एक नया क़दम उठा रहे हैं। काठमांडू में स्थित भक्तपुर कैंसर अस्पताल में कैंसर रोगियों के इलाज के लिए हम शीघ्र ही भारत में विकसित भाभाट्रोन रेडियो-थेरपी मशीन install करेंगे।

Friends, 

हमारे जल-संसाधन और उर्जा सहयोग में आज एक नया अध्याय जुड़ा है। प्रधानमंत्री ओली जी के साथ मिल कर आज मुझे 900 मेगावाट की अरुण-थ्री विद्युत् परियोजना की नींव रखने का सौभाग्य मिला। लगभग 6000 करोड़ भारतीय रुपयों के निवेश की यह परियोजना, नेपाल में होने वाले सबसे बड़े projects में एक है। नेपाल में रोजगार के अवसरों के साथ, इस project से नेपाल में आर्थिक और व्यावसायिक अवसर भी बनेंगे। पंचेश्वर project, एवं hydropower, जल-संसाधन और उर्जा के क्षेत्रों में अपने सहयोग के अन्य projects पर भी हम अपनी बातचीत आगे बढ़ा रहे हैं। हम दोनों इस बात पर भी सहमत हैं कि connectivity हमारे लोगों के विकास के लिए बहुत महत्वपूर्ण factor है। हम अनादी काल से हिमालय पर्वतमाला और नदियों आदि के माध्यम से जुड़े हुए हैं। और अब हम roads, railways, power transmission lines, oil pipeline आदि के माध्यम से अपनी इस connectivity को और अधिक बल देना चाहते हैं।

Friends, 

भारत और नेपाल के मजबूत संबंधों में हमारा open border एक विशेष भूमिका निभाता है। हम किसी भी अवांछनीय तत्व द्वारा इस open border का दुरुपयोग नहीं होने देंगे। प्रधानमंत्री ओली जी और मैं हमारे द्विपक्षीय रक्षा और सुरक्षा सहयोग को और अधिक मजबूत करने के लिए भी प्रतिबद्द हैं। Open border के साथ हमारे संबंधों की एक और विशेषता है – हमारे गहन आध्यात्मिक संबंध। 2014 में जब मैं नेपाल आया था, तो भगवान पशुपतिनाथ का आशीर्वाद लेने का अवसर मिला था। आज सुबह मुझे जानकी मंदिर में माता सीता के दर्शन का सौभाग्य मिला। और मैं आशा करता हूँ कि कल सुबह मुक्तिनाथ और पशुपतिनाथ जी के प्रांगणों में उनकी प्रार्थना करने का सौभाग्य भी मिलेगा। हर साल मेरे जैसे लाखों भारतीय श्रद्धालु नेपाल आते हैं। और इसलिए, प्रधानमंत्री ओली जी और मैंने भारत और नेपाल के बीच पर्यटन को बढ़ावा देने के लिए साथ मिल कर रामायण और बौद्ध circuits के विकास पर भी आज चर्चा की। साथ ही हमने ठोस क़दम भी उठाए हैं।

Friends, 

पिछले महीने दिल्ली में, और आज यहां काठमांडू में, हमारी बातचीत में लिए गए निर्णयों से हमने भारत-नेपाल संबंधों में एक नई उर्जा का, एक नए momentum का संचार किया है। आज जब मैं भारत-नेपाल संबंधों के भविष्य के बारे में सोचता हूँ, तो बहुत आशावादी विचारों से सोचता हूँ। इसी आशा, विश्वास, भरोसे और आपसी मित्रता की भावना के साथ, मैं एक बार फ़िर प्रधानमंत्री ओली जी का, उनकी सरकार का, और नेपाल के लोगों का ह्रदय से आभार प्रकट करता हूँ।

भारत– नेपाल मैत्री 

अमर रहोस्।

धन्यवाद।

                All the dignitaries present here and my dear brothers and sisters of Janakpur present here in large numbers,

Jai Siya Ram, 

Jai Siya Ram, 

Jai Siya Ram, 

Brothers andsisters,

When I came to Nepal as Prime Minister for the first time in August 2014, I had said in the Constituent Assembly that I would soon visit Janakpur. I apologize to you all as I have been a bit late. Probably, Sita Maiya (Mother Sita) had decided that today, the day of Bhadrakali Ekadashi, is the day for me to visit here. It had been my desire since long that I should pay by obeisance to Mother Sita and the capital of King Janak by visiting this place. My long and cherished dream has been fulfilled today by visiting the Janaki temple and I feel grateful in life by fulfilling that desire.

Brothers and sisters,

India and Nepal are two countries, but our friendship is not of recent times, we are friends since Treta Yug (since ages). King Janak and King Dashrath tied not only Janakpur and Ayodhya but India and Nepal also in the bonds of friendship and partnership. This is the bond of Ram-Sita and of Buddha and also of Mahavir. This is the bond which pulls the people of Rameshwaram to Pashupatinath. This is the bond which pulls the people of Lumbini to Bodh Gaya and this is the bond, the religious belief, and this is that affection which has brought me to Janakpur today. 

Since the period of Mahabharat and Ramayan there has been this connection of Janakpur. There has been this link of Biratnagar during the period of Mahabharat followed by Simrana Ganj. And this connection of Lumbini in the Buddha period; this relation has been there since ages. India-Nepal relations are not linked to any definition, but they are attached to a language and this is the language of faith, this is the language of affection, this is the language of bread and this is the language of relationships forged through marriage ofdaughters. This is the place of Mother Janaki, without whom Ayodhya is incomplete. 

Our mother and our faith, both are the same; our nature and our culture, both are also the same; our way and our prayers are also the same. There is this fragrance of our hard work and also the echo of our valor. Our hopes and aspirations are also the same, so are our desires and our ways. Our desires, our objective and our destination are also the same. This is the land of those hard workers whose contribution provides further impetus to the developmental journey of India. India's belief system is incomplete without Nepal. India’s faith and history is incomplete without Nepal. Our pilgrim centers are incomplete without Nepal. And even our Ram is also incomplete without Nepal.

Brothers and sisters,

Your piety is deeper than the ocean and your self-respect is taller than the Sagarmatha. Just like Mithila's Tulsi spreads the fragrance of purity, chastity and dignity in India’s courtyard, similarly India's affinity towards Nepal pours this entire area with the trio of peace, security and culture.

Mithila's culture, literature, folk art, Mithila’s hospitality, everything is very amazing. And today I’ve been experiencing this thing. Today, I’m experiencing your love; I am able to feel your blessings.  Mithila’s culture holds a very high place in the world. The compositions of the poet Vidyapati still hold equal importance both in India and Nepal. The sweetness of his words is still present in the literature of both India and Nepal. 

By coming to Janakpur, and after feeling your love and affection, it never occurred to me that I am among strangers, everything is just like ours, everyone is just like our own, there is affection in everything, in fact these are just our own.Friends, Nepal have been the center of spirituality and philosophy. It is that holy land where Lumbini is situated. That Lumbini where Lord Buddha was born. 

Friends, mother earth’s daughter, mother Sita symbolizes those human values, principles and traditions which connect our two nations together. This land of Janak became the source of women awakening because of mother Sita. Mother Sita epitomizessacrifice, penance, dedication and struggle. From Kathmandu to Kanyakumari, we all are followers of the tradition of mother Sita. As far as her majesty is concerned, her devotees are spread throughout the world. 

This is the land which has showed us all how our daughters should be respected. This lesson of respecting our daughters is the greatest need in the modern society.Women power has played a major role in cherishing our history and traditions. Take the example of Mithila Paintings here. Women contributed greatly to the promotion of this tradition and today this art of Mithila is famous all over the world. We also get to see the awareness about nature and environment in this art form. Today, in this era of women empowerment and climate change, this is a great message to the world from the land of Mithila. Presence of wise women like Gargi and sages like Ashtavakra in the court of Raja Janak also proves that along with administration how much importance was given to the wisdom and spirituality. 

Debates on the public welfare policies among scholars were organized in the court of King Janak. King Janak himself used to participate in those debates, and the decisions that would come out of those brainstorming was implemented in the interest of the people and the country. His subjects were everything for King Janak. He had nothing to do with the attachments and relationship with his family. Thinking about the welfare of his people and subjects was his only duty and that is why Raja Janak is also called Videha. Videha means the one who is not attached to his body, and who has dedicated himself to the public, dedicated himself to the welfare of its people.

Brothers and sisters,

Today, India and Nepal have been moving ahead with this message of public welfare and message of King Janak. The relations of Nepal with India have been tied by the politics, diplomacy and strategy and even beyond that they have been tied through our deities. Individuals and governments will continue to come and go, but this relationship is everlasting. This is the time when we should jointly protectfive things: values, education, peace, security and prosperity. We believe that Nepal's development itself is the source of regional development. What is the nature of friendship between India and Nepal; it can be very well understood through these couplets of Ramcharitmanas. 

जेनमित्रदु:खहोहिंदुखारी।

तिन्हहिबिलोकतपातकभारी॥

निजदु:खगिरिसमरजकरिजाना।

मित्रकदु:खरजमेरुसमाना॥

It means that it is a big sin to even look at those who don’t feel the pain of their friend's misery. Therefore, if your own misery is as vast as a huge mountain, do not give it more importance, but if your friend's misery is as miniscule as a dust particle you must consider it as mountain and you should do whatever possible to help him.

Friends, 

History is witness that whenever any calamity had struck India or Nepal, both had stood together. We have supported each other in every difficult situations. India has been a permanent partner in Nepal’s development for decades. Nepal comes first in our 'Neighborhood First' policy. Today, India has been moving forward towards becoming the third largest economy in the world at a rapid pace, similarly your Nepal is also developing rapidly. Today, I have got the opportunity to come to Nepal to give this partnership a new energy.

Brothers and sisters, 

First and foremost condition of development is democracy. I am happy that you are strengthening the democratic system. Elections were held in your country recently. And you people have elected a new government. You have given the mandate to fulfill your dreams and aspirations. I congratulate all of you for successfully conducting elections at all three levels within a year. For the first time in Nepal's history, all seven provinces of Nepal have elected provincial governments. This is a matter of pride not only for Nepal but it is also a matter of pride for India and the entire region. Nepal is ushering into a new phase for socio-economic change, which is based on good governance and inclusive development. 

This year, rather I should say ten years ago, youth of Nepal chose ballet over bullet. I congratulate the people of Nepal for this meaningful change from the path of conflict to the path of Buddha. Democratic values are yet another link thatstrengthens the ancient relations of India and Nepal. Democracy is that power which gives even the most ordinary and extraordinary men the right to fulfill their dreams without any impediments. India has realized this power and today every citizen of India has been dedicated to realising his dreams. I can see that spark in the eyes of all of you that you too want to take your Nepal forward on the same path. I see the same dreams for Nepal in your eyes.

Friends, 

Recently I got the opportunity to welcome Nepal's Prime Minister Oli Ji in Delhi. I got the opportunity to know his vision for Nepal. Oli ji has dreamed of a ‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalese’. India has always wished for a prosperous and wealthy Nepal. On behalf of 1.25 billion Indians, on behalf of Government of India, I wish all the best to Prime Minister Oli for fulfilling his vision for Nepal. This is the same approach that I have for India. 

Our government in India is moving ahead with the principle of Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas. It has been ourconstant effort that not a single section or any part of the country remains untouched from development. Whether it is east or west, whether it is north or south, the chariot of development has been running very fastin every direction. Especially the attention of our government has been much in those areas where the light of development has not reached until now. In this context, Purvanchal, which is the eastern part of India that is adjacent to Nepal border, is being given the special attention. From UP to Bihar, from North East, from West Bengal to Odisha, we have taken the pledge to bring up this whole area at par with the rest of the country. Whatever work is being done in this area, it is definitely going to benefit Nepal the most as a neighbor. 

Brothers and sisters, 

When I talk aboutSabka Satha-Sabka Vikas (Together with all-Development for all) then I wish the same not only for India but also for all its neighboring countries, and when there are discussions about ‘Prosperous Nepal-Happy Nepalese’ in Nepal, then I am very much delighted. 1.25 billion Indians become very happy too. My brothers and sisters of Janakpur, we have taken a very big resolution in India and this resolution is of making a New India. 

India is completing 75 years of independence in 2022. 1.25 billion Indians have set a target of making a New India by then. We are building a new India, where even the poorest of poor will get the same opportunity for development. Where there is no discrimination, no lower class or upper class and where everyone is respected. Where there is education for every children, income for every youth and medical facilities for the elderly. Where life is easy and a common man does not have to struggle with the system. Where the society is free from corruption and wrongdoings, we are moving ahead towards that kind of aNew India. 

We have made several improvements in the country and administration. Procedures have been simplified. And, today, the world is praising the steps taken by us. We have been strengthening the relation between nation building and public participation. Today, I have come here to assure you people that 1.25 billion Indians will be extremely happy to contribute towards making the lives of ordinary citizens of Nepal prosperous.

Friends, the feeling of fraternity are further strengthened when we keep visitingeach other’s places. I am happy that I got the opportunity to come here amongst you peopleimmediately after Prime Minister of Nepal’s visit to India. Just as I come here often, people of both the countries should also move freely across the border in the same manner. 

We are connected through the Himalaya Mountain, through the farms and fields in the foothills, through the countless paths and kachcha roads, through dozens of small rivers, and we are also connected through our open border. However, in today's era this is not enough.We,…and I will summaries all the topics in a very brief manner that was mentioned by the chief minister. We have to connect through highways,We have to connect through Information Ways, it means through I-ways. We have to connect throughTransways, it means through electricity lines. We have to connect through railways. We have to connect through customs check posts. We have to connect through the expansion of air services. We have to connect through inland waterways. Whether it is land, air, water or space, we have to connect with each other. Connectivity is important so that people to people contacts can further flourish and strengthen and that is the reason that we are giving priority to connectivity between India and Nepal. 

Today itself, along with the Prime Minister Oli Ji, I inaugurated the bus service from Janakpur to Ayodhya. Last month, Prime Minister Oli and I had inaugurated the first Integrated Check Post in Birganj. When this post will become fully operational then the trade and movement on the border will become much easier. Work on the Jaynagar-Janakpur railway line is also moving at great speed. 

Brothers and sisters,

Efforts are being made to complete this line by the end of this year. When this railway line will be completed, then Nepal will be connected to India’s vast railway network. We are now moving forward to connect Kathmandu with India through Raxaul in Bihar at a fast speed. Not only this, we are also trying to connect India and Nepal with waterways. Nepal will soon be connected to the sea through Indian waterways. Through these waterways the goods made in Nepal will be easily accessible to other countries which will help creation of new industries and employment opportunities in Nepal. These projects are not only important for the socio-economic transformation of Nepal but they are also important for trade and commerce. 

Today, there is a hugetrade between India and Nepal. People keep movingbetween the countries for trade. Mr. ChiefMinister you were talking about this, last month we have announced a new partnership in agriculture sector. Under this partnership, cooperation in the field of agriculture will be further encouraged. It will stress upon on how to increase the income of the farmers of both the countries. Cooperation in the use of science and technology in agriculture sector will be enhanced.

Brothers and sisters,

In the modern era, development without technology is impossible. India is among the top five countries of the world in space technology. You people would recall that when I had visited Nepal for the first time, then I had said that India would send a satellite for its neighbors like Nepal. I have fulfilled my promise last year. South Asia Satellite, which was launched last year, today, it has been working with its full potential and Nepal is getting benefitfrom this.

Brothers and sisters,

We are following the path of Five Ts for the development of India and Nepal. The first T is Tradition, thesecond T is Trade, the third T is Tourism, the fourth T is Technology and the fifth T is Transport, that is, through tradition, trade, tourism technology and transportation, we want to take Nepal and India forward on the path of development.

Friends, in addition to culture, trade between India and Nepal is also a key link in our relationship. Nepal is developing rapidly in the field of power generation. Today, about 450 megawatts of electricity is supplied to Nepal from India. We have laid down new transmission lines for this. 

Friends, I had asked in the Constituent Assembly of Nepal in 2014 that why the oil should be supplied through trucks, why not directly through a pipeline. You will be happy to know that we have also started the work on Motihari-Amalekhganj Oil Pipeline. 

In India, our government has been running a program called SwadeshDarshan. Under this program, we are connecting our historical placeswith our spiritual places.In Ramayana Circuit, we are connecting all such places where Lord Rama and Mother Janaki had set their feet. Now, in this series, we have been moving forward in the direction of connecting Nepal also. Whatever places in Nepal are linked to Ramayana they can be connected to the rest of India and devotees can be offered the pleasure of an affordable and attractive pilgrimage so that they come to Nepal in large numbers and tourism of Nepal can be developed.

Brothers and sisters, 

Every year thousands of devotees from Janakpur in India come to visit Janakpur on the occasion of Vivah Panchami. Devotees keep coming for performing aParikrama throughout the year. These devotees should not face any difficulties, therefore, I am happy to announce that we will cooperate with the Nepal Government in its plan for development of Janakpur and nearby areas. India will provide an assistance of Rs. 100 crores for this work. Theprojects will be identified in collaboration with the Government of Nepal and in collaboration of provincial government. Since the time of King Janak, it has been the tradition of Janakpur Dham that it has given something not only to Ayodhya but it has given something or some other thing to the entire society. I came here just to have an audience with Mother Janaki. These announcements for Janakpur are dedicated in the feet of mother Janaki on the behalf of 1.25 billion Indians. 

Similarly, there are two more such programs: Buddhist Circuit and Jain Circuit. Under these programs, all the places related with Buddha and Mahavir Jain in India are being connected with each other. There are several places related to Buddhist and Jain faith in Nepal. These could also be a good thing for developing a bond for the pilgrims and tourists of both the countries. This will also create employment opportunities for the youth of Nepal.

Brothers and sisters,

There are many similarities in our food habits and our languages. The number of Maithili speaking people in India is same as in Nepal. Maithili art & culture and civilization are discussed globally. When both the countries will make a combined effort for development of Maithili then the development of this language will become more easily possible. I have been told that some Maithili filmmakers are now going to release new Maithili films in Qatar and Dubai in addition to Nepal and India. This is a welcome move and it needs to be encouraged. As a large number of people here speak Maithili, similarly the number of people speaking Nepali in India is also quite high; efforts are also being made to encourage the translation of Nepali language literature. Let me also tell you that Nepali isamong those Indian languages which have been recognized in the Indian Constitution. 

Brothers and sisters, 

There is one more area where our partnership can be further developed. Indian people have started a very huge cleanliness campaign. When you visit your relatives in Bihar and other neighboring states, you might have seen and heard about it. In just three or four years, more than 80 percent of India's villages have become open defecation free. Separate toilets have been provided for girl students in every school of India. I am very happy to note that like the 'Clean India' and the 'Clean Ganga' campaigns you people have also started a successful campaign to clean the historical and religious places of Janakpur and I congratulate Mr. Mayor for this thing. It is also a matter of great pleasure that youth of Nepal is joining in the attempts to conserve the places of mythological importance. 

Particularly, I would like to congratulate Mayor of this place, his colleagues, youth of this place and members of legislature and members of parliament of this place who have taken forward the Clean Janakpur campaign. 

Brothers andsisters, today I have visited Mother Janaki. I will alsoget the opportunity to be blessed by Muktinath Dham and then Pashupatinath Ji tomorrow. I believe that with the blessings of God and people of Nepal whatever agreements will be signed, they will be helpful in realising the dream of a prosperous Nepal and a happy India. 

Once again I express my sincere gratitude to the Prime Minister of Nepal respected Oli Ji, of the state government and city government and also of the people of Nepal. I thank all of you.  

Jay Siyaram, Jay Siyaram.

                Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s departure statement prior to his visit to Nepal.

“I will be visiting Nepal on 11-12 May 2018 at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Nepal Rt. Hon’ble KP Sharma Oli.

This will be my third visit to Nepal as Prime Minister. It reflects the high priority India, and personally I attach to our age-old, close and friendly ties with Nepal.

My visit closely follows the State Visit of Prime Minister Oli to India last month. These high-level and regular interactions reflect my government's commitment to the 'Neighbourhood First' policy, in consonance with the motto of ‘SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas’.

Together, our two countries have completed several bilateral connectivity and development projects in the last few years, and have initiated transformational initiatives for the benefit of our two peoples.

Prime Minister Oli and I will have the opportunity to take forward our recent wide-ranging discussions in New Delhi on issues of mutual interest, and to advance our cooperative partnership across diverse sectors.

In addition to Kathmandu, I am also looking forward to visiting Janakpur and Muktinath. Both these places attract a large number of pilgrims every year. They are living testimony to the ancient and strong cultural and religious ties between the peoples of India and Nepal.

As Nepal enters a new era of consolidating gains of democracy and achieving rapid economic growth and development, India will continue to remain a steadfast partner of Government of Nepal to implement its vision of ‘Samriddha Nepal, Sukhi Nepali'.

I am looking forward to meeting the political leaders and friends in Nepal. I am confident that my visit will further cement our people-centric partnership with Nepal on the basis of mutual benefit, goodwill and understanding.’’

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Monday reviewed the progress of preparations towards the launch of the ambitious Health Assurance programme under Ayushman Bharat.

The Prime Minister was apprised of the preparation done so far, including consultations with States, for the smooth and expeditious rollout of the Health Assurance programme.

The scheme will provide a cover of upto Rs. 5 lakh per family. It will be targeted to cover over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families.

The Prime Minister stressed on providing maximum benefit to the poor and marginalized sections of society, under this scheme.

Top officials of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, NITI Aayog and PMO, briefed the Prime Minister on various aspects of the scheme.

Last month, on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti, the Prime Minister had inaugurated the first 'Health and Wellness Centre' under Ayushman Bharat, in the aspirational district of Bijapur in Chhattisgarh.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) the between India and Angola for promoting bilateral cooperation in the field of Electronics and Information Technology.

 

The MoU intends to promote closer cooperation in the areas of e-Governance, HRD for IT education, Information Security, Electronics Hardware manufacturing, IT embedded Software industry, Telemedicine etc.

 

Background:

 

The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has been mandated to promote international cooperation in the emerging and frontier areas of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) under bilateral and regional framework of cooperation. MeitY has entered into MoUs/Agreements with counterpart organizations/ agencies of various countries to promote close cooperation and exchange of information in the area of ICT. To further enhance cooperation with various countries, particularly in view of the new initiatives taken by Government of India like ""Digital India"", ""Make in India"" etc., there is an increased need for exploring business opportunities in the technology sector which are of interest.

 

MeitY negotiated a comprehensive MoU for a focussed cooperation in ICT areas such as in e-Governance, HRD for IT education, Information Security, Electronics Hardware manufacturing, IT embedded Software industry, Telemedicine etc. After negotiations the draft MoU was finalised and signed during the visit of Hon'ble Minister of State for External Affairs Mr. M.J. Akbar on behalf of MeitY, Government of India and Mr. Domingos Custodio Vieira Lopes, Secretary of State for International Cooperation and Angolan Communities, on behalf of Minister of Telecommunications and Information Technology, Government of Angola.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Turkey on trade in poppy seeds to ensure quick and transparent processing for import of poppy seeds from Turkey.

 

Details:

 

The MoU provides that –

 


	
	
		Turkish Grain Board (TMO) shall maintain an online system to enable regulation of export of poppy seeds from Turkey to India. Exporting companies shall submit application through the Agean Exporters Association (EIB) (responsibility given by law) to TMO for obtaining membership of the online System.
		Each year, the quantity of poppy seeds which shall be imported by India from Turkey shall be decided by Government of India in consultation with Government of Turkey taking into account the production of poppy seeds in Turkey in a crop year, balance from previous crop years and domestic or other export requirement of Republic of Turkey.
		The exporting companies shall get registered with the TMO. Each sales contract entered into by the exporting company with Indian importer shall be registered with TMO through the online system referred. It shall be the responsibility of TMO not to register sales contract in excess of the quantity referred to in Para 2 above.
		Taking into account the quantity as referred to in Para 2 above, every year both parties may consider to set a quantity to be imported by any Indian importer in a crop year.
		The Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN) will register the sales contract registered by TMO as per details accessed on the online system maintained by TMO in accordance with guidelines for registration laid down by Ministry of Finance, Government of India. The CBN shall upload the details of sales contract so registered by it on the online system. TMO shall allow the export in respect of only those contracts so registered by CBN.
		The TMO shall provide a legal production certificate for the poppy seeds to exporters following the submission of sales contract and the completion of other necessary procedures.
	
	


 

The MoU will promote quick and transparent processing of quota allocation and prior authorization for poppy seeds import from Turkey. In this way genuiness of import contract can be easily ensured as well as many litigation matter resulting in delay in the import can be avoided.

 

The MoU will ensure continuous availability of poppy seeds in domestic market of India and ultimately Indian consumers of poppy seeds will be benefited.

 

Background:

 

Import of poppy seeds from Turkey got withheld due to litigation resulting in great hike of price of poppy seeds in domestic market of India and hoarding of the same by some importers. Various stays given by the Court and repeated adjournment of hearing graves the situation and resulted in less availability of poppy seeds in the country leading to a great problems to the consumers. To avoid such legal complication, price rise and hoarding, an alternative mechanism needs to be evolved by way of an MoU between Government of India and Government of Turkey in which real time data can be exchanged to ensure the quantity of poppy seeds imported from Turkey is genuine and legally produced in Turkey.

Out of the 17000-18000 species of flowering plants, more than 7000 are estimated to have medicinal usage in folk and documented systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha & Homoeopathy (AYUSH System of Medicine). About 1178 species of medicinal plants are estimated to be in trade of which 242 species have annual consumption levels in excess of 100 metric tonnes/year. Medicinal plants are not only a major resource base for the traditional medicine & herbal industry but also provide livelihood and health security to a large segment of Indian population. There is global resurgence in traditional and alternative health care systems resulting in world herbal trade which stands at US$ 120 billion and is expected to reach US$ 7 trillion by 2050. Moreover, there are a large number of medicinal plants, particularly those found in tropical region, which are common to the two countries given similar geo-climatic factors.

                The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has has approved the signing and ratification of Agreement between India and Brunei Darussalam for the Exchange of Information and Assistance in Collection with respect to Taxes.

Details:


	The Agreement enables the competent authorities of India and Brunei Darussalam to provide assistance through exchange of information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the two countries concerning taxes covered by this Agreement.    



	The information received under the Agreement shall be treated as confidential and may be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts or administrative bodies) concerned with assessment, collection, enforcement, prosecution or determination of appeals in relation to taxes covered under the Agreement. Information may be disclosed to any other person or entity or authority or jurisdiction with the prior written consent of the information sending country.
	The Agreement also provides for automatic exchange of information between India and Brunei with respect to categories of cases.
	The Agreement also enables assistance in collection of tax revenue claims between both countries.
	The Agreement provides for Mutual Agreement Procedure for resolving any difference or for agreeing on procedures under the Agreement.
	The Agreement shall enter into force on the date of notification of completion of the procedures required by the respective laws of the two countries for entry into force of the Agreement.


The Agreement will stimulate the flow of exchange of information between India and Brunei for tax purposes which will help curb tax evasion and tax avoidance. It will also enable assistance in collection of tax revenue claims between both countries.

As such, the Agreement does not have any financial implications. Only in the event of extraordinary costs exceeding USD 500 as per Article 9 of the Agreement, the same will be borne by the Government of India. India has similar provisions in other such tax information exchange agreements.

Background: 

The Central Government is authorized under section 90 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to enter into an Agreement with a foreign country or specified territory for exchange of information for the prevention of evasion or avoidance of income tax chargeable under the Income Tax Act, 1961. Negotiations for entering into an Agreement for the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes were conducted at Brunei from 10th  to 11th January, 2017.  Pursuant to the same, the Governments of India and Brunei Darussalam have agreed on the text of the Agreement.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its in-principle approval for establishing a Central University by the name of “Central University of Andhra Pradesh” in Janthaluru Village of Ananthapur District, Andhra Pradesh. A provision of funds worth Rs. 450 crore has been approved for meeting the first phase expenditure towards establishment of the said University.

 

          The Cabinet also approved the proposal for operationalization of the Central University in the transit campus, initially by forming a society under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 in order to give a legal status to it till the amendment to the Central Universities Act, 2009 is enacted and to enable commencement of academic activities from the Academic Year 2018-19. The Central University would be mentored by an existing Central University till its governing structure is in place. 

 

          The approval would increase access and quality of higher education and help in minimizing the regional imbalances in education facilities, and give effect to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014.

                In a major boost to public transport infrastructure in NOIDA, the Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved extension of Delhi Metro corridor from Noida City Centre to Sector-62, Noida Uttar Pradesh covering a length of 6.675 k.m. at the total completion cost of Rs.1,967 crores. Gol liability will be Rs. 340.60 crore on account of Grant and Subordinate Debt.

Details:


	Approval for Extension of Delhi Metro corridor from Noida City Centre to Sector-62, Noida, Uttar Pradesh covering a length of 6.675 k.m. 



	Total completion cost of the project is Rs.1,967 crore.
	Project will be implemented by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC), the existing Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) of the Government of India and Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi.
	Project will be covered under the legal framework of Central Metro Acts, Metro Railways (Construction of Works) Act, 1978 and the Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002, as amended from time to time.


Major Impact: 

The extension of Delhi Metro corridor from Noida City Centre to Noida Sector 62 is the extension to Dwarka-Noida City Centre line of Delhi Metro system which will result into people being assured about their mobility and thus more people will like to move to this satellite town of Delhi, thus decongesting Delhi. As a result, more residential and commercial complexes will develop in this region. With metro rail in place, there will be less vehicular traffic on roads leading to less congestion, less time and cost of journey, less consumption of fossil fuel and less environmental pollution.

The population of Noida and people of surrounding areas will be greatly benefitted by the extended line. At the project site, approximately 800 staff including Engineers and other staff have been engaged. Further, DMRC has started the procedure for recruitment of around 200 employees for Operation & Maintenance of this corridor. 

About 81% progress of civil work and 55% of overall financial progress of the project have been achieved.

Background: 

The Noida city, located in Gautam Buddha Nagar District of Uttar Pradesh State, was created under the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development Act. It possess all modern amenities and is considered to be one of the most modern suburbs of Delhi in the National Capital Region (NCR). The population of Noida as per 2011 Census of India is about 6.42 lakhs. Due to lush green and open area in the city, more and more people from Delhi and surrounding area are preferring NOIDA as their settling place.

The trend of urbanization of Noida is upward. Number of Industrial and Institutional units is also being established in this city. Noida mainly has road linkages with Delhi and the adjoining areas of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana State. People come for work to Noida from other places and vice versa. These factors will lead to increment of traffic demand and need for an efficient pollution-free mass rapid transport system. Noida is connected by Metro rail and trains are running upto Noida City Centre (Sector 32 Noida). It is proposed to extend the Metro Corridor from Noida City Centre to Noida Sector 62 by a length of 6.675 Km with six stations. Noida does not have railway station and the nearest railway station is Hazarat Nizamuddin, New Delhi which is at a distance of about 15 km. The nearest airport Delhi is at about 35 km from NOIDA. The population is expected to grow exponentially in Noida region in the coming years.

                The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has has approved the strengthening of the mechanism for resolution of commercial disputes of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) inter se and also between CPSEs and other Government Departments/Organizations. The Cabinet decision is based on recommendations of the Committee of Secretaries (CoS). The decision will put in place an institutionalized mechanism within the Government for speedy resolution of commercial disputes of CPSEs without the matter being referred to the Courts of law.

Details:


	A new two-tier mechanism will be put in place of the existing Permanent Machinery of Arbitration (PMA) mechanism to resolve commercial disputes (excluding disputes concerning the Railways, Income Tax, Custom & Excise Departments) between CPSEs inter se and CPSEs and Government Departments/Organizations, outside the Courts of law.
	At the First level (tier), such commercial disputes will be referred to a Committee comprising of Secretaries of the administrative Ministries/Departments to which the disputing CPSEs/Parties belong and Secretary-Deptt. of Legal Affairs. The Financial Advisors (FAs) of the two concerned administrative Ministries/Departments will represent the issues related to the dispute in question before the above Committee. In case the two disputing parties belong to the same Ministry/Department, the Committee will comprise Secretary of the administrative Ministry/Department concerned, Secretary-D/o Legal Affairs and Secretary-Department of Public Enterprises. In such a case, the matter may be represented before the Committee by the FA and one Joint Secretary of that Ministry/Department.


Further, in case of a dispute between CPSE and State Government's Department/Organization, the Committee will be comprised the Secretary of the Ministry/Department of the Union to which the CPSE belongs and Secretary-D/o Legal Affairs and a senior officer nominated by the Chief Secretary of the State concerned. In such a case, the matter may be represented before the Committee by concerned Principal Secretary of the State Government's Department/ Organization.


	At the Second level (tier), in case the dispute remains unresolved, even after consideration by the above Committee, the same will be referred to the Cabinet Secretary, whose decision will be final and binding on all concerned.
	For the prompt disposal of disputes, a time schedule of 3 months at the first level has been prescribed.


Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) will issue guidelines immediately to all CPSEs through their administrative Ministries/Departments and State Governments/UTs for compliance.

The new mechanism will promote equity through mutual/collective efforts to resolve commercial disputes thereby reducing the number of litigations regarding commercial disputes in Court of Law and also avoid wastage of public money.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved National Policy on Biofuels – 2018.

Salient Features:


	The Policy categorises biofuels as ""Basic Biofuels"" viz. First Generation (1G) bioethanol & biodiesel and ""Advanced Biofuels"" - Second Generation (2G) ethanol, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) to drop-in fuels, Third Generation (3G) biofuels, bio-CNG etc. to enable extension of appropriate financial and fiscal incentives under each category.
	The Policy expands the scope of raw material for ethanol production by allowing use of Sugarcane Juice, Sugar containing materials like Sugar Beet, Sweet Sorghum, Starch containing materials like Corn, Cassava, Damaged food grains like wheat, broken rice, Rotten Potatoes, unfit for human consumption for ethanol production.
	Farmers are at a risk of not getting appropriate price for their produce during the surplus production phase. Taking this into account, the Policy allows use of surplus food grains for production of ethanol for blending with petrol with the approval of National Biofuel Coordination Committee.
	With a thrust on Advanced Biofuels, the Policy indicates a viability gap funding scheme for 2G ethanol Bio refineries of Rs.5000 crore in 6 years in addition to additional tax incentives, higher purchase price as compared to 1G biofuels.
	The Policy encourages setting up of supply chain mechanisms for biodiesel production from non-edible oilseeds, Used Cooking Oil, short gestation crops.
	Roles and responsibilities of all the concerned Ministries/Departments with respect to biofuels has been captured in the Policy document to synergise efforts.


Expected Benefits:


	Reduce Import Dependency: One crore lit of E10 saves Rs.28 crore of forex at current rates. The ethanol supply year 2017-18 is likely to see a supply of around 150 crore litres of ethanol which will result in savings of over Rs.4000 crore of forex.
	Cleaner Environment: One crore lit of E-10 saves around 20,000 ton of CO2 emissions. For the ethanol supply year 2017-18, there will be lesser emissions of CO2 to the tune of 30 lakh ton. By reducing crop burning & conversion of agricultural residues/wastes to biofuels there will be further reduction in Green House Gas emissions.
	Health benefits: Prolonged reuse of Cooking Oil for preparing food, particularly in deep-frying is a potential health hazard and can lead to many diseases. Used Cooking Oil is a potential feedstock for biodiesel and its use for making biodiesel will prevent diversion of used cooking oil in the food industry.
	MSW Management: It is estimated that, annually 62 MMT of Municipal Solid Waste gets generated in India. There are technologies available which can convert waste/plastic, MSW to drop in fuels. One ton of such waste has the potential to provide around 20% of drop in fuels.
	Infrastructural Investment in Rural Areas: It is estimated that, one 100klpd bio refinery will require around Rs.800 crore capital investment. At present Oil Marketing Companies are in the process of setting up twelve 2G bio refineries with an investment of around Rs.10,000 crore. Further addition of 2G bio refineries across the Country will spur infrastructural investment in the rural areas.
	Employment Generation: One 100klpd 2G bio refinery can contribute 1200 jobs in Plant Operations, Village Level Entrepreneurs and Supply Chain Management.
	Additional Income to Farmers: By adopting 2G technologies, agricultural residues/waste which otherwise are burnt by the farmers can be converted to ethanol and can fetch a price for these waste if a market is developed for the same. Also, farmers are at a risk of not getting appropriate price for their produce during the surplus production phase. Thus conversion of surplus grains and agricultural biomass can help in price stabilization.


Background:

In order to promote biofuels in the country, a National Policy on Biofuels was made by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy during the year 2009. Globally, biofuels have caught the attention in last decade and it is imperative to keep up with the pace of developments in the field of biofuels. Biofuels in India are of strategic importance as it augers well with the ongoing initiatives of the Government such as Make in India, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Skill Development and offers great opportunity to integrate with the ambitious targets of doubling of Farmers Income, Import Reduction, Employment Generation, Waste to Wealth Creation. Biofuels programme in India has been largely impacted due to the sustained and quantum non-availability of domestic feedstock for biofuel production which needs to be addressed.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for extending the investment limit from Rs 7.5 lakhs to Rs 15 lakhs as well as extension of time limits for subscription from 4thMay 2018 to 31stMarch, 2020 under the Pradhan MantriVayaVandanYojana (PMVVY) as part of Government's commitment for financial inclusion and social security.

 

Further, as a boost to the Social Security initiatives for senior citizens, the investment limit of Rs 7.5 lakh per family in the existing scheme is enhanced to Rs 15 lakh per senior citizen in the modified PMVVY, thereby providing a larger social security cover to the Senior citizens.  It will enable upto Rs.10000 Pension per month for Senior Citizens. 

 

As of March, 2018, a total number of 2.23 lakh senior citizens are being benefited under PMVVY. In the previous scheme of Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana-2014, a total number of 3.11 lakh senior citizens are being benefited.

 

Background:

 

The PMVVY is being implemented through Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to provide social security during old age and protect elderly persons aged 60 years and above against a future fall in their interest income due to uncertain market conditions. The scheme provides an assured pension based on a guaranteed rate of return of 8% per annum for ten years, with an option to opt for pension on a monthly / quarterly / half yearly and annual basis. The differential return, i.e. the difference between the return generated by LIC and the assured return of 8% per annum would be borne by Government of India as subsidy on an annual basis.

                            The Union Cabinet chaired by chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Restructuring of the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) by upgradation, creation and abolition of certain posts of Joint Secretary-level and above. The total cadre strength of Indian Bureau of Mines has been maintained at the existing strength of 1477.

            The restructuring would help in enabling the IBM to effectively discharge its function to help reform and transform the regulation of the mineral sector. It will enable the adoption of IT and space technology by the IBM to improve its effectiveness in mineral regulation and development. Further, the posts entail a great deal of decision-making and accountability in the functioning of the organization. 

Impact:

            

            The proposal will create direct employment opportunities for technical personnel with higher responsibility for contribution in faster development of mineral sector, thereby generating more employment avenues in the sector as a whole. The improved and enhanced performance of IBM would benefit the mining sector.

 

Details:

            The upgradation, creation and abolition of certain posts of Joint Secretary-level in IBM consists of:

 


	Creation of 1 post of Chief Controller of Mines in Level 15 and 3 posts of Controller of Mines in Level 14;


 


	Upgradation of 11 posts i.e. 1 post of Controller General from Level 15 to 16, 2 posts each of Chief Controller of Mines and Director (Ore-Dressing) from Level 14 to 15 and upgradation of 8 posts (5 posts of Controller of Mines,        1 each of Chief Mineral Economist, Chief Ore-Dressing Officer and Chief Mining Geologist) in the existing Level of 13A to 14; and


 


	Abolition of 1 existing cadre post of Deputy Director General (Statistics), an officer of Indian Statistical Service in Level 14 in pay matrix.


 

Background:

            IBM was set up by the Government of India on 1st March, 1948 under the Ministry of Works, Mines and Power, primarily as an advisory body to help in formulation of policy and legal framework for mining sector and advising Central and State Governments on development and utilization of mineral resources. The role and responsibility of IBM have changed with emerging needs of the sector as facilitator and regulator of mining sector (other than coal, petroleum and atomic minerals).

 

            Ministry of Mines had constituted a Committee for comprehensive 'Review andRestructuring of the Functions and Role of IBM' in the light of the 'National Mineral Policy' (NMP) 2008 The Committee submitted its report on 04.5.2012 which was accepted in the Ministry.

 

            The Ministry of Mines has taken a number of initiatives through IBM for effective facilitation and regulation of the mineral sector:

 


	implementation of the Sustainable Development Framework (SDF) and Star Rating of Mines for their efforts and initiatives encompassing the scientific, environmental and social aspects of the mining activity;


 


	development of Mining Surveillance System (MSS) in association with Bhaskaracharya Institute of Space Application & Geo-informatics (BISAG) to detect illegal mining within 500 metres zone of lease boundary of major minerals using satellite imageries; and 


 


	thrust on R&D activities on mineral processing including process development for upgradation of low grade ore; (iv) development of IT enable Mining^ Tenement System (MTS) for computerizing the mineral sectors activities.


            

   The restructuring of IBM was essential to enable it organisationally to take up the responsibilities entrusted in the role with the recent changes in the policy and legislations, revised charter of function of IBM and the new activities and initiatives undertaken by IBM. IBM is also engaged in handholding the States for auction of mineral blocks for greater transparency in allocation of mineral concessions. IBM is helping the States in preparation of auction blocks, publishing of average sale price, assisting in post auction monitoring and approval process.

 

The relocation of offices of IBM has already been effected for carrying out the responsibilities given to IBM. New Regional Offices at Raipur and Gandhinagar have been opened and the sub-regional office at Guwahati has been upgraded to Regional office. The existing Regional Offices at Kolkata and Udaipur have been upgraded to the Zonal office (East) and Zonal Office (North). For the purpose of Skill Development, an Institute of Sustainable Development Frame Work' at Udaipur and 'Remote Sensing Centre' at Hyderabad and National Level Training Centres 'Institute of Sustainable Mining’ at Kolkata have been opened and Skill Development Centre at Varanasi is also shortly being opened.

                 The Union Cabinet chaired by chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Cadre review and formation of Group ‘A’ service of the technical cadre of Petroleum & Safety Organization (PESO) in the name of Indian Petroleum & Explosives Safety Service (IPESS).

The measure will enhance the capacity and efficiency of the organization and it will also enhance career progression of its Group ‘A’ officers. 

Background:

PESO is a subordinate office under Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP). The organization is serving the nation since 1898 as a nodal agency for regulating safety of substances such as explosives, compressed gases and petroleum. Over the years, the role and responsibilities of PESO have increased manifold and expanded into diverse fields. Today, the organization deals with wide range of subjects related to explosives, petroleum, compressed gases, pressure vessels, gas cylinders, cross-country pipelines, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Auto Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Auto LPG) etc. The increase in workload is manifested in the quantum jump in the number of licensed premises and other activities.

The present sanctioned strength of Technical Group ‘A’ cadre of PESO is 137 having 60 Junior Time Scale (JTS) level officers, 46 Senior Time Scale (STS) level officers, 23 Junior Administrative Grade (JAG) level officers (Level 12), 7 JAG level officers (Level 13) and 1 Senior Administrative Grade (SAG) level post of Chief Controller of Explosives.

To remove acute stagnation in all grades and uplift the morale of the workforce and enhance its performance, it has been decided to form Group ‘A’ Service of the technical cadre of PESO in the name of IPESS and restructure the newly-formed service by increasing 5 posts at Level-13 and 3 posts at Level-12 and corresponding reduction of 8 posts at Level-11.

The PMSSY, a Central Sector Scheme, aims at correcting the imbalances in the availability of affordable tertiary healthcare facilities in different parts of the country in general, and augmenting facilities for quality medical education in the under-served States in particular. 

 

Impact: 

Setting up of new AIIMS would not only transform health education and training but also address the shortfall of health care professionals in the region. Construction of new AIIMS is fully funded by the Central Government. The Operations & Maintenance expenses on new AIIMS are also fully borne by the Central Government.

 

Upgradation programme broadly envisages improving health infrastructure through construction of Super Specialty Blocks/Trauma Centers etc. and procurement of medical equipment for existing as well as new facilities on Central and State share basis.

 

Employment Generation: 

Setting up new AIIMS in various states will lead to employment generation for nearly 3000 people in various faculty & non-faculty posts in each of the AIIMS. Further, indirect employment generation will take place due to facilities & services like shopping centre, canteens, etc. coming in the vicinity of new AIIMS.

 

The upgradation programme is carried out in selected Government Medical Colleges (GMCs) by agencies appointed by the Government of India under the direct supervision of the Central Government. Post-Graduate seats and additional faculty posts as per norms will be created and filled up in these GMCs by the respective State/UT Governments.

 

The construction activity involved for creation of the physical infrastructure for the various new AIIMS and Government Medical Colleges' upgradation projects being undertaken under the scheme is also expected to generate substantial employment in the construction phase as well.

 

Background:

The PMSSY was announced in 2003 with objectives of correcting regional imbalances in the availability of affordable/ reliable tertiary healthcare services and also to augment facilities for quality medical education in the country. PMSSY has two components -

 


	Setting up of AIIMS-like institutions; and

                The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given approval to accede to the Protocol under World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on tobacco control to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products. It will be applicable to both smoking and chewing or smokeless tobacco (SLT) forms as  negotiated and adopted under Article 15 of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC).  India is a party to WHO FCTC.

 

Details:

 

The protocol lays down obligations of the parties. It spells out supply chain control measures that must be adopted by the parties viz. licensing of manufacture of tobacco products and machinery for manufacturing of tobacco products, due diligence to be kept by those engaged in production, tracking and tracing regime, record keeping, security; and measures to be taken by those  engaged in e-commerce, manufacturing in free-trade zones and duty free sales.

 

The protocol lists out offences, enforcement measures such as seizures and disposal of seized products. It calls for international cooperation in information sharing, maintaining confidentiality, training, technical assistance and cooperation in scientific and technical and technological matters.

 

Impact:

 

Elimination of illicit trade in tobacco products through strengthened regulation will help in strengthening comprehensive tobacco control, leading to reduction in tobacco use which in turn, will result in reduction in disease burden and mortality associated with tobacco use.

 

Accession to such treaty will provide actionable alternatives against such prevailing practices that are affecting public health at large. India, being at the forefront of tobacco control, would be able to influence the international organizations including World Custom Organization in controlling such illicit trade.

 

The protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products is a path breaking initiative in strengthening global action against tobacco and is also a new legal instrument in public health. It is a comprehensive tool to counter and eventually eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products and to strengthen legal dimensions for international health cooperation.

 

Background:

 

            The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is the first international public health treaty negotiated under the auspices of the WHO. The objective of FCTC is to provide a framework for supply and demand reduction measures for tobacco control at the national, regional and global levels.

 

            One of the key tobacco supply reduction strategies contained in Article 15 of WHO FCTC envisages elimination of all forms of illicit trade and tobacco products, including smuggling, illicit manufacturing and counterfeiting. Accordingly, the said Protocol was developed and adopted by the Conference of Parties (COP) which is the governing body of FCTC. The protocol is divided into 10 parts and contains 47 Articles.

                The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given approval to accede to the Protocol under World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on tobacco control to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products. It will be applicable to both smoking and chewing or smokeless tobacco (SLT) forms as  negotiated and adopted under Article 15 of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC).  India is a party to WHO FCTC.

 

Details:

 

The protocol lays down obligations of the parties. It spells out supply chain control measures that must be adopted by the parties viz. licensing of manufacture of tobacco products and machinery for manufacturing of tobacco products, due diligence to be kept by those engaged in production, tracking and tracing regime, record keeping, security; and measures to be taken by those  engaged in e-commerce, manufacturing in free-trade zones and duty free sales.

 

The protocol lists out offences, enforcement measures such as seizures and disposal of seized products. It calls for international cooperation in information sharing, maintaining confidentiality, training, technical assistance and cooperation in scientific and technical and technological matters.

 

Impact:

 

Elimination of illicit trade in tobacco products through strengthened regulation will help in strengthening comprehensive tobacco control, leading to reduction in tobacco use which in turn, will result in reduction in disease burden and mortality associated with tobacco use.

 

Accession to such treaty will provide actionable alternatives against such prevailing practices that are affecting public health at large. India, being at the forefront of tobacco control, would be able to influence the international organizations including World Custom Organization in controlling such illicit trade.

 

The protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products is a path breaking initiative in strengthening global action against tobacco and is also a new legal instrument in public health. It is a comprehensive tool to counter and eventually eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products and to strengthen legal dimensions for international health cooperation.

 

Background:

 

            The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is the first international public health treaty negotiated under the auspices of the WHO. The objective of FCTC is to provide a framework for supply and demand reduction measures for tobacco control at the national, regional and global levels.

 

            One of the key tobacco supply reduction strategies contained in Article 15 of WHO FCTC envisages elimination of all forms of illicit trade and tobacco products, including smuggling, illicit manufacturing and counterfeiting. Accordingly, the said Protocol was developed and adopted by the Conference of Parties (COP) which is the governing body of FCTC. The protocol is divided into 10 parts and contains 47 Articles.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for restructuring of balance sheet of Scooters India Limited, Lucknow (SIL) by way of:

 


	reduction of equity of Rs. 85.21 crore in the share capital of SIL held by Government of India against accumulated losses. The reduction would be deemed to have taken effect as on 31.03.2013 and 
	freezing the interest on the Non-Plan loan of Rs. 1.89 crore released to SIL during 2012-13 from the date of its release to the company and conversion into equity of the outstanding principal amount of Rs. 1.89 crore.


 

With this approval, the balance sheets of Scooters India Limited from 2012-13 onwards will be regularised and further restructuring will be effected accordingly. This is also expected to clear a hurdle in the process of disinvestment of the company.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to the following proposal of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion:-

 

i.     Development of Freight Village, an Integrated Multi Modal Logistics Hub (IMLH), Nangal Chaudhary, Haryana on 886.78 acres of land to be implemented by the project Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in two phases.

ii.   Financial sanction of Rs. 1029.49 crore for development of Phase I and in principle approval for development of Phase II of the project. Expenditure on Phase I comprises cost of entire land at Rs. 266 crore including cost of the land to be used for development of Phase II.

iii.  Investment of Rs. 763.49 crore by National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust (NICDIT) which includes of Rs. 266 crore as equity and Rs. 497.49 crore as debt in the SPV; and

iv.  Bidding for trunk infrastructure development by SPV on EPC basis;

          

Impact:

           The project has enormous economic value in terms of direct and indirect benefits and multiplier effects on the economy. The economic benefits of the project will include creation of employment, reduction in fuel costs, boosts to exports, reduction in vehicle (trucks) operating cost, reduction in accident related costs, increase in collection of taxes by the State Government, reduction in pollution, etc.

 

           The proposed development of a Freight Village as Multi Modal Logistics Hub is estimated to generate over four thousand direct and six thousand indirect employment.   Job creation will not be limited to core logistics facilities but would also entail opportunities for entire logistics supply chain.

           

Details:

 


	The construction of trunk infrastructure will be undertaken in two phases. Phase I will be implemented by financial year 2020-21. 
	The award of various construction packages will be made in a manner so that the entire construction of trunk infrastructure gets completed simultaneously. 
	Phase-ll of the project will be reappraised in 2028 or earlier, if so required, for suitable financial sanctions.
	For implementation of proposed Freight Village, an SPV has been incorporated as a 50:50 Joint Venture of Government of India through NICDIT and Government of Haryana through HSIDC under the name ""DMIC Haryana Multi Modal Logistic Hub Project Limited"".


 

The Freight Village will be connected through Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) at Dabla, which is at a distance of approximately 10 kms. This logistics hub integrated with the DFC would have the following components:

 

i.   High speed connectivity to key ports and Industrial Centres;

ii.  Lower cost of supplying goods - faster freight operations & removal of

multiple handling costs; 

iii.   Improved service quality; 

iv.    Real time freight tracking and data analysis; 

v. Single-point   solution   to   all   logistics   need   like   loading/aggregation/packaging/ storage;

vi.   Speedy access to ports from hinterland; 

vii. Economy of scale in supply chain operations with reduced cost and time of operations; 

viii.  Last mile gateway port connectivity from the hinterland;

ix.    Contain unorganized growth of container freight stations.

 

Background:

           Government of India (Gol) is developing the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor, as a global manufacturing and investment destination around 1,504 km long Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) as the backbone. Investment Regions and Industrial Areas have been identified for development in this corridor, across six States namely Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

 

           Haryana is a major industrial and trading hub in North India. Potentially high rate of industrial development has to be supported through additional infrastructure to handle the transport of raw material and manufactured goods. Haryana is expected to witness container traffic of about 10 Million Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit (TEUs) by 2025. Hence, development of a Freight Village in Mahendragarh district of Haryana has been considered necessary to achieve the following objectives:

 

i.  Improving efficiency of operations of existing industries in the region as well as attractiveness of the region as an investment destination for various categories of industries, warehousing and logistics operators;

ii.   Tapping potential traffic along the Western DFC and of Northern states which is likely to galvanise rail-based freight movement with high-end operational features of faster and high-capacity freight trains. It will serve as a world-class multi modal facility that provides for efficient storage/transitioning of goods to/from DFC, thereby catering to the escalated freight traffic;

iii. Offering an attractive destination to freight companies and customers to boost industrial development in the region and creating economic opportunities. The facility will not only house standard container handling activities but will create various value added services.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today has approved an initial Corpus of Rs.5,000 crore for setting up of a dedicated “Micro Irrigation Fund” (MIF) with NABARD under Pradhan MantriKrishiSinchayeeYojana (PMKSY). 

 

Details:


	The allocation of Rs. 2,000 crore and Rs. 3,000 crore will be utilised during 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively. NABARD will extend the loan to State Governments during this period.  Borrowings from NABARD shall be paid back in 7 years including the grace period of two years.
	The lending rate under MIF has been proposed at 3% lower than the cost of raising the fund by NABARD.
	This cost shall be met from the ongoing scheme of PMKSY-PDMC by amending the existing guidelines
	The total financial implication on interest subvention comes to about Rs 750 crore.


 

Benefits:


	The dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund would supplement the efforts of Per Drop More Crop Component (PDMC) of Pradhan MantriKrishiSinchayeeYojana in an effective and timely manner.
	With the additional investment for micro irrigation accessing MIF, innovative composite/ commodity/ community/ cluster based micro irrigation projects/ proposals may bringabout 10 lakh ha.
	The Fund will facilitate States to mobilise resources for theirinitiatives, including additional (top up subsidy) in implementation of PMKSY-PDMC toachieve the annual target of about 2 Million ha/year during the remaining period of 14thFinance Commission under Per Drop More Crop Component of PMKSY as recommended by the Group of Secretaries.


 

Implementation Strategy and targets:

 

States may access MIF for innovative integrated projects, including projects in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode and also for incentivizing micro irrigation through an additional (top up) subsidy over and above the one available under PMKSY-PDMC Guidelines and for covering additional areas. It should not be a substitute for State's share in PMKSY-PDMC.

 

Farmers Producers Organization (FPO)/Cooperatives/State Level Agencies can also access the funds with State Government Guarantee or equivalent collateral. Farmers Co-operatives may access this fund for innovative cluster based Community Irrigation Projects.

 

An Advisory Committee to provide policy direction and ensure effective planning, coordination and monitoring along with a Steering Committee for examining and approving the Projects/proposals from State Governments (total cost, eligible loan amount to the State and phasing), coordination and monitoring to ensure time bound implementation of the assisted projects/proposals within approved cost and phasing is proposed to be constituted.

 

Coverage:

The approval shall have Pan India coverage. With the operation of MIF, it is expected that the States which are lagging behind in adoption of Micro Irrigation would also be encouraged to take advantage of the fund for incentivizing farmers as being done by the good performing States. Besides, community driven and innovative projects to be taken up by the States would bring additional coverage of Micro Irrigation.

 

Rationale:

The Task Force on Micro Irrigation had estimated a potential of 69.5 m ha under micro irrigation, whereas the area covered so far is only about 10 m. ha (14%). Further, the Group of Secretaries, 2017, emphasized on target of 10 million ha under micro irrigation over the next 5 years, which would require an additional annual coverage of about 1 million ha compared to the present pace of implementation. This can be accomplished by effective utilization of the resources of both PMKSY-PDMC and MIF in any or both of the following manner:


	To facilitate the States in mobilising the resources for expanding coverage of Micro Irrigation by taking up special and innovative projects
	To incentivise micro irrigation beyond the provisions available under PMKSY-PDMC to encourage farmers to install micro irrigation systems

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to provide financial assistance @ of Rs. 5.50 per quintal of cane crushed in sugar season 2017-18 to sugar mills to offset the cost of cane, in order to help sugar mills to clear cane dues of farmers.

Details:


	The assistance shall be paid directly to the farmers on behalf of the mills.
	It will be adjusted against the cane price payable due to the farmers against Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) including arrears relating to previous years.  
	Subsequent balance if any, shall be credited into the mill’s account.  


          Assistance shall be provided to those mills which will fulfil the eligibility conditions as decided by the Government.

Background:

Due to higher sugar production against the estimated consumption during the current sugar season 2017-18, the domestic sugar prices have remained depressed since the commencement of the season. Due to depressed market sentiments and crash in sugar prices, the liquidity position of sugar mills has been adversely affected, leading to accumulation of cane price dues of farmers which have reached to more than Rs.19,000 crore. 

In order to stabilize sugar prices at reasonable level and to improve liquidity position of mills thereby enabling them to clear cane price dues of farmers, Government has taken following steps in past three months:


	Increased customs duty on import of sugar from 50% to 100% in the interest of farmers.
	Imposed reverse stock holding limits on producers of sugar for the months of February and March, 2018.
	Government has also fully withdrawn the customs duty on export of sugar to encourage sugar industry to start exploring possibility of export of sugar. 
	In view of the inventory levels with the sugar industry and to facilitate achievement of financial liquidity, mill-wise Minimum Indicative Export Quotas (MIEQ) have been fixed for sugar season 2017-18. Export Quotas of 20 Lakh tonnes of all grades of sugar; viz. raw, plantation white as well as refined, have been prorated amongst sugar factories by taking into account their average production of sugar achieved by the sugar mills during last two operational sugar seasons and the current season (up to February,2018). 
	Further, to facilitate and incentivize export of surplus sugar by sugar mills, Government has allowed Duty Free Import Authorization (DFIA) Scheme in respect of sugar.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today has approved the proposal for renaming and restructuring of Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP) as Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK).  CCEA has also approved its continuation during the remaining period of the 14th Finance Commission.

Impact:


	The restructured programme would provide better socio economic infrastructure facilities to the minority communities particularly in the field of education, health & skill development as compared to the present situation, which would further lead to lessening of the gap between the national average and the minority communities with regard to backwardness parameters. The flexibility introduced in the programme will enable addressing important issues that would result in speedier implementation leading to greater inclusiveness of the minority communities.
	The criteria for identification of Minority Concentration Towns and Clusters of Villages have been rationalized by lowering the population percentage criteria of Minority Communities and fulfilment of backwardness parameters in the following manners:-



	Earlier only those Towns which were found backward in terms of both in Basic Amenities and Socio-economic parameters were taken up as MCTs. Now, the Towns which were found backward in either or both of the criteria have been taken up as MCT.
	Earlier only those Cluster of Villages which were having at-least 50% population of Minority Community were taken. Now the population criteria has been lowered to 25%.


· These   rationalization   of criteria  would  facilitate   the   inclusive  growth  of communities and social harmony, 


	The area to be covered under PMJVK would be 57% more as compared to the existing MsDP.  
	The MsDP covered 196 district of the country whereas PMJVK will cover 308 districts of the country.


Expenditure:

Funding of the scheme would be from budgetary provision of the Ministry. The Expenditure Finance Committee, Department of Expenditure has recommended for the continuation of the programme as PMJVK at the cost of Rs. 3,972 crore as per layout below:

(*The Budgetary allocation of Rs.1200 crores was received in 2017-18. The programme was implemented on the same format as approved by Cabinet for implementation during 12th Plan period)

As stipulated in the scheme, the recurring/maintenance expenses will be borne by the State Government/UTs/Organization.

Beneficiaries:

The Programme aims to address development deficits in the identified minority concentration areas. The identification of minority concentration areas has been done on the basis of presence of substantial population of notified Minority Communities based on Census, 2011. The inclusion of Minority Concentration District Headquarters along with the Minority Concentration Towns having population more than 25,000, Minority Concentration Blocks and Cluster of Villages as per Census, 2011 data, will extend the coverage of population of minority communities.

States/Districts covered:


	The PMJVK will be implemented in Minority Concentration District Hqrs(MCD Hrs), Minority Concentration Block(MCBs), Minority Concentration Towns(MCTs) falling in 308 districts of 32 States/UTs.
	The unit area for implementation will include 109 MCD Hqrs, 870 MCBs and 321 MCTs.
	Moreover, the scheme will also be implemented in Backward Clusters of Minority Concentration Villages(CoMCV). These CoMCV will be identified on the proposal of the States/UTs as per criteria of PMJVK.
	The PMJVK would now cover five more States/UTs namely Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Nagaland, Goa and Pondicherry.
	Minority Concentration Areas of 61 districts out of 115 Aspirational districts have been covered under PMJVK.


Areas identified by data of Census 2011

 


	Unit area of implementation has been further broadened by including Minority Concentration Districts Headquarters in addition to the minority concentration Blocks, Minority Concentration Towns and cluster of minority concentration villages.  
	As compared to MSDP, the PMJVK would now cover five more States/UTs namely Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Nagaland, goa and Pondicherry.  All States/UTs earlier covered under MsDP have also been included under PMJVK.
	Under PMJVK Minority Concentration Blocks (MCBs) and Minority Concentration Towns (MCTs) falling in 308district of 32 States have been covered.
	The area covered under PMJVK will have 109 MCD Hqrs., 870 MCBs and 321 MCTs.


Special focus by earmarking funds:

 

(i)         80% of the resources under the PMJVK would be earmarked for projects related to education, health and skill development.

(ii)       33 to 40% of resources under the PMJVK would be specifically allocated for women centric projects.

 

Monitoring of the Programme strengthened:

(i)        Provisions related to Monitoring Mechanism, Transparency and Publicity of Information have been further strengthened by including an online module along with geo-tagging. 

(ii)      A provision to bring all implementing agencies under Public Finance Management System(PFMS) and its effective use ensured to monitor fund utilization has been made in PMJVK.

Background:

>      MsDP has been identified as one of the Core of the Core Schemes under National Development Agenda in the Report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalization of Centrally Sponsored Schemes, which was constituted by NITI Aayog. The programme was launched in the year 2008-09 in 90 identified Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs) having at least 25% minority population and below national average with respect to one or both of the backwardness parameters with the objective of developing assets for socio-economic and basic amenities. The MCDs were identified on the basis of census 2001 data. The programme continued during 11th Five Year Plan.

>      The MsDP was restructured in June 2013 for implementation during 12th Five Year Plan and the area of implementation was replaced by Minority Concentration Blocks (MCB), Minority Concentration Towns (MCT) and Clusters of Villages. Total MCBs - 710, MCTs - 66 in 196 Districts. The MsDP is currently in operation in 27 States/UTs.

>      MsDP has been designed primarily to address the developmental gaps/deficits in identified backward minority concentration areas by topping up of existing Centrally Sponsored Schemes of various Central ministries/departments without any change in the norms, guidelines and the funding pattern.

>      The projects considered are additional class rooms, laboratories, school buildings, hostels, toilets, buildings for Polytechnics, ITIs, Community Health Centres, Primary Health Centres / Sub-centres, Anganwadi Centres, Rural Housing etc.

>      In addition to gap filling projects, MsDP also provides for taking up innovative projects which are not covered by any of the existing CSS of various ministries and these are funded in the ratio of 60:40 and for NE and Hilly States at 90:10 between the Centre and States. This includes Sadbhav Mandap, Market shed etc.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to for expansion and upgradation of integrated terminals at Chennai, Guwahati & Lucknow Airports, at a cost of Rs.2467 crore, Rs.1383 crore and Rs.1232 crore, respectively. 

Details:

Highlights of the three projects are as follows:

Lucknow Airport: Construction of New Integrated Terminal will have an area of 88,000 sqm along with the existing terminal building with 16292 sqm and will have annual capacity to handle 2.6 million international and 11 million domestic passenger traffic. The new terminal building would cater to the requirement of passenger growth up to the year 2030-31.

Chennai Airport: Total built up area of the proposed terminal building, including the present proposal measuring 197000 sqm shall be 336000 sqm with an annual capacity to handle 35 mppa. The new terminal building incorporates green building features with an aim to achieve GRIHA-4 Star rating. The building would cater to the requirement of passenger growth up to the year 2026-27.

Guwahati Airport: The New Terminal Building shall have an area of 102500 sqm to handle combined annual capacity (old and new terminals) of 9 mppa. The building would cater to the requirement of passenger growth up to the year 2026-27. This will encourage investment & tourism in NER with thrust on ‘Act East’ Policy. 

 

Background:

Recognising its role as the growth driver of the Indian economy, the Government of India has given enhanced trust for the infrastructure sector in the Union Budget 2018-19. Towards this endeavour, Government of India has brought out National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP), which is the stepping stone to provide robust air connectivity throughout the length and breadth of our country. The Policy also envisages to create an ecosystem which encourages economic growth of the country, by enabling people to connect with ease at an affordable cost, through Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS), aptly titled as UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). 

The country has witnessed phenomenal growth rate in the range of 18 to 20 percent in the last 3 years. According to IATA Traffic Study, India, at 7th position as of now, is likely to take 3rd position by 2023-24 by overtaking UK, Japan, Spain & Germany. The current rate of the growth in domestic aviation sector of India is the highest globally.

To meet the growing demand, Government of India has launched a new initiative of NABH Nirman (NextGen Airports for Bharat), wherein systems and processes are geared to provide enhanced airport capacity to handle 1 billion trips in the next 10 to 15 years.

Airport capacity upgradation and expansion require both development of new greenfield airports and expansion of existing brownfield airports and same will be funded by the Indian private sector and Airports Authority of India by leveraging its balance sheet. 

Airports Authority of India is in the process of implementing plans for development of infrastructure to meet growing aviation demand by creating additional capacity at AAI Airports like, Chennai, Guwahati, Lucknow, Agartala, Patna, Srinagar, Pune, Trichy, Vijayawada, Port Blair, Jaipur, Mangalore, Dehradun, Jabalpur, Kolhapur, Goa, Rupsi, Leh, Calicut, Imphal, Varanasi & Bhubaneswar with a capex of Rs.20178 Crores in the next 4 to 5 years. 

AAI has already awarded the works at Agartala, Calicut, Port Blair towards construction of new state-of-the-art integrated terminals and is in the process to immediately approve the works for upgradation and expansion of capacity at Chennai, Lucknow and Guwahati Airports, at a cost of Rs.2467 crores, Rs.1383 crores and Rs.1232 crores, respectively. Similarly, upgradation of airside capacity by way of strengthening and extension of runways, construction of new apron bays has been taken up to cater to the demand from airline operators who have placed confirmed orders for almost 900 aircrafts in the coming 10 years.

Under New Greenfield Airport Policy, many major cities are expected to have multiple airports. Government has granted approval for Noida International Airport (Jewar), Mopa (Goa), Purandar Airport (Pune), Bhogapuram Airport (Visakhapatnam), Dholera Airport (Ahmedabad), Hirasar Airport (Rajkot). Capex outlay of Rs.50000 crores is expected in the development of New Greenfield Airports, wherein approval of Government of India has been given. In the private sector also, upgradation and expansion is in the offing for Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad Airports at a cost of Rs.25000 crores in the next five years’ time.

                The Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology has decided to adopt the word ‘AYUSH’ in Hindi and English languages for scientific and technical purposes. The “AYUSH” became popular as the acronym for five traditional and complementary systems of medicine, namely Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy and successfully adopted and used in all Government communications. The decision follows a proposal from the Ministry of AYUSH in this regards.

Hailing this decision, Shri Shripad Naik, the Union AYUSH Minister said that it would underline the essential unity of all holistic systems of healing.  He also said that this decision would add strength to the efforts of the Ministry of AYUSH to develop integrated solutions to manage the public health challenges of the Country.

As approved by the Commission, the word ‘ayush’ will have the meaning “Traditional and Non-Conventional Systems of Health Care and Healing which include Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa, Homoeopathy etc. Following the Commission’s recognition, the word is expected to gain currency in popular usage in a short span of time.

Despite many commonalities, the practice of the Ayush systems of healthcare in India have remained fragmented in system-specific silos.  Today’s decision would, in the long term, highlight the unifying features of the different systems.  It would facilitate projects and activities of larger scope to emerge, and thereby promote faster development of these systems.  This decision will also give a boost to India’s efforts to find a place for the Indian Systems of Healthcare in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) of the World Health Organization.  The Indian systems finding a place in ICD will lead to their international acceptance, increased rigor of research in them and their over-all development.

About 1178 species of medicinal plants are estimated to be in trade of which 242 species have annual consumption levels in excess of 100 metric tonnes/year. Medicinal plants are not only a major resource base for the traditional medicine & herbal industry but also provide livelihood and health security to a large segment of Indian population. There is global resurgence in traditional and alternative health care systems resulting in world herbal trade which stands at US$ 120 billion and is expected to reach US$ 7 trillion by 2050. Moreover, there are a large number of medicinal plants, particularly those found in tropical region, which are common to the two countries given similar geo-climatic factors.

                            The polling for the Bye-elections to four Parliamentary Constituencies and ten State Legislative Assemblies in various States was concluded peacefully today, without any serious untoward incident. During the polling process, some reports of non-functioning of EVMs and VVPATs were received from different polling booths, which were replaced with fully functional EVMs/VVPATs from the reserve stock, which is kept specifically for the purpose of such replacement on poll day. However, it is pertinent to note that these Reserve EVMs/VVPATs are subjected to the same rigorous testing and checks as are done on the EVMs/VVPATs actually deployed at  the polling booths. The replacement of defective EVMs/VVPATs during actual polls is a normal process and does not vitiate the integrity or credibility of the poll process in any way whatsoever.

            As per the present data compiled from the field reports, the replacement of EVMs and VVPATs during the polls in the various States is as per the Table annexed.

            The Commission undertakes a comprehensive scrutiny of the reports and inputs received from the Returning Officers, General Observers, CEO of the State, as well as feedback from the candidates and other stakeholders and arrives at a considered decision regarding re-polls, if required on a case to case basis. The Scrutiny of important election documents is scheduled in all the Constituencies for tomorrow.

 As regards consultation with leaders of different political parties before presenting electoral bonds is concerned, this issue has been transferred to Ministry of Finance as it might concern them and not the Election Commission of India.

                News reports surfacing in the media alleging 'large scale' failure of EVMs and VVPATs in the ongoing bye-elections and interruption of poll in the States of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh are an exaggerated projection of reality.

The Election Commission of India has said that the Commission allocates sufficient reserve of EVMs and VVPATs for every General/Bye election to the Lok Sabha or State Legislative Assembly. It is pertinent to mention that during commissioning of EVMs and VVPATs, apart from EVMs and VVPATs required for deployment at every polling station, adequate number of reserve EVMs and VVPATs (around 20-25%) are prepared to replace any defective machine on poll day at the polling station. These reserve EVMs/VVPATs are kept with Sector Officers, who replace the defective EVMs/VVPATs, if any report on non-functioning of EVM/VVPAT received from any polling station. Since each sector Officer is entrusted with only 10-12 polling stations, the time taken to replace any EVM/VVPAT at a polling station is normally less than 30 minutes. The replacement of defective EVMs/VVPATs during actual polls is a normal process and does not vitiate the integrity or credibility of the poll process in any way whatsoever.

Further, there are reports being aired in some news channels of polling being cancelled in 35 booths in 11-Bhandara-Gondiya Parliamentary Constituency in Maharashtra, is not based on facts. Also, the reports emerging in some quarters about EVMs/VVPATs failing in 25% polling booths in the same PC are also incorrect. It is clarified  that voting has not been cancelled in any polling station in 11-Bhandara-Gondiya PC and voting is continuing smoothly after necessary replacements, where ever required. However, as and when a report from RO/DEO/CEO regarding long interruption of polling is received, the Commission takes a decision on those matters on case to case basis. 

The Commission undertakes a comprehensive examination and root-cause analysis of all the defects observed in the machines through the Technical Experts Committee of the Commission and necessary remedial actions are being taken for smooth conduct of poll process.

                Election Commission of India today held a round table conference with former CECs/ECs. The consultation meeting was attended by former CECs S/Shri M.S.Gill, J.M.Lyngdoh, T.S.Krishna Murthy, B.B.Tandon, Dr. S.Y.Quraishi, V.S. Sampath, H.R. Bramha, Dr. Nasim Zaidi and former EC GVG Krishnamurty.

Chief Election Commissioner Shri O.P.Rawat,  Election Commissioners Shri Sunil Arora and Shri Ashok Lavasa,  welcomed all former CECs/ECs present. The invitees lauded the Commission for this initiative and expressed the hope that such consultations would become a regular feature.

The deliberations focused on following aspects of electoral management:


	It was noted that universal use of EVM/VVPAT is a commendable initiative. It was opined that Awareness programmes should be extended to educate all the voters about its benefits. This will help in avoiding any controversy about its use.
	It was noticed that hate speeches are being used during campaigns which vitiate the political atmosphere. There is an urgent need to control such speeches in larger public interest.
	It was deliberated to analyse the duration of polls so that the number of phases is reduced. The lesser number of phases will reduce the period of MCC it was noted, which has its implications in multiple phases of elections.
	The ERO-net was well appreciated. However, the process of voter registration can further be eased after taking cues for the models of voter registration in other successful democracies.


During the meeting, Sr DEC Shri Umesh Sinha also gave a glimpse of current initiatives undertaken by the Commission like Electoral Literacy Clubs, ERO-Net, RO-Net, Grievance Redressal System etc.

                            The Chief Election Commissioner of India Shri Om Prakash Rawat today interacted with 250 students from ten ASAEN Countries. The Students from Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, are visiting India as part of the Indo-ASEAN students exchange programme under the aegis of Ministry of External Affairs.  

Terming the youth as the beacon of hope for future of democracy, Shri Rawat said Election Commission of India attaches great importance to involvement of young people in all the democratic processes.  The Chief Election Commissioner in his address stressed that Emerging challenges to electoral integrity such as fake news, paid news, data harvesting to do profiling and unleashing of targetted messages to sway voting patterns, social media vulnerabilities (emergence of bots) etc. make it imperative to look up to young to devise strategies to meet these challenges for preserving hard earned democracy. 

Shri OP Rawat pointed out that 70 percent of the global population are living in democratic nations now, as opposed to a mere one percent some 200 years back. He said that it is important for all stakeholders of democratic governance to try to broaden the avenues for the young people to effectively participate in the full spectrum of democratic activities, starting with elections and delivery through good governance. 

Shri OP Rawat also informed that Electoral Literacy Clubs are being formed in schools and colleges to motivate youngsters to participate fully in electoral processes. He said that the Election Commission has set up the India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM) to provide a platform for ‘capacity building’ of election managers from all across the democratic world as well as for sharing the best practices. 

“We all can jointly take pride in the phenomenal progress made in furthering mutual cooperation by India and ASEAN in the last 25 years. This association has given birth to a new template of regional cooperation and integration for the world — Shared Values, Common Destiny’” Shri Rawat added. 

The Senior Deputy Election Commissioner Shri Umesh Sinha also addressed the gathering detailing the varied dimensions and complexities involved in the Election processes.

                During the last decade, India has attained first position with around 14% average annual growth in the export of fish & fishery products. Fish production in India has also grown by 27% in 2014-18 as compared to 2010-14. This was stated by the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh while addressing the Fisheries Ministers of Coastal states and Union Territories. Shri Singh further added that owing to low prospects of fisheries production along the coast, the government has decided to promote deep sea fishing and has introduced a sub-component 'Assistance for Deep Sea Fishing' under the Blue Revolution. 

Shri Singh further said that under this scheme, self-help groups of traditional fishermen are being given 50 per cent of the vessel cost i.e. the central assistance of Rs 40 lakh for vessel costing up to Rs 80 lakh. Advanced and modern deep sea fishing vessels will be built in the country by indigenous technology. He informed that in the first year, central funds amounting to more than Rs 300 crore have been released for the implementation of this scheme benefitting fishermen from states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. 

Shri Singh also stated that the Government has made a budget provision of Rs 7,522.48 crore for the establishment of Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FAIDF) which has the potential to benefit 40 lakh marine and inland fishermen, especially women, self-help groups, weaker sections by making available modern infrastructure facilities and increased value of the produce. He said like farmers, fishermen will also get the benefit of 'Kisan Credit Card'.

The Union Agriculture Minister expressed happiness that the new ""National Policy on Marine Fisheries"" was notified by the Ministry of Agriculture on May 1, 2017 after detailed discussions with stakeholders. This, he said, will promote the integrated development of marine fisheries in the country for the next 10 years. For an effective implementation of the policy, the Centre and the coastal states will have to work together.

Shri Singh said according to estimates by scientists, existing marine fisheries’ resources are over-exploited up to 200 meters depth from the mainland, thereby posing serious threat to the livelihood of traditional fishermen. The area of 200 meters depth lies within 12 nautical miles and is a subject matter of state governments. Therefore, under the National Policy on Marine Fisheries, a sustainable and responsible fishing must be ensured by the states. He appealed to the state governments to take all necessary steps to ensure sustainable fishing.

He appealed the States to fix fleet size, gear size, minimum legal size of fish, and minimum net size in their respective territorial waters to ensure proper utilization of marine fishery resources through fisheries management.

Agriculture Minister further informed that the Central Government has imposed a ban on the use of harmful fishing methods in EEZ such as LED or artificial light and pair trawling on November 10, 2017. He appealed to all the states to stop such harmful practices in their respective territorial waters. He also called upon the states to adopt mariculture to increase the income of fishermen.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today has approved an initial Corpus of Rs.5,000 crore for setting up of a dedicated “Micro Irrigation Fund” (MIF) with NABARD under Pradhan MantriKrishiSinchayeeYojana (PMKSY).  

 

Details:


	The allocation of Rs. 2,000 crore and Rs. 3,000 crore will be utilised during 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively.  NABARD will extend the loan to State Governments during this period.  Borrowings from NABARD shall be paid back in 7 years including the grace period of two years.
	The lending rate under MIF has been proposed at 3% lower than the cost of raising the fund by NABARD. 
	This cost shall be met from the ongoing scheme of PMKSY-PDMC by amending the existing guidelines 
	The total financial implication on interest subvention comes to about Rs 750 crore.


 

Benefits:


	The dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund would supplement the efforts of Per Drop More Crop Component (PDMC) of Pradhan MantriKrishiSinchayeeYojana in an effective and timely manner.
	With the additional investment for micro irrigation accessing MIF, innovative composite/ commodity/ community/ cluster based micro irrigation projects/ proposals may bringabout 10 lakh ha. 
	The Fund will facilitate States to mobilise resources for theirinitiatives, including additional (top up subsidy) in implementation of PMKSY-PDMC toachieve the annual target of about 2 Million ha/year during the remaining period of 14thFinance Commission under Per Drop More Crop Component of PMKSY as recommended by the Group of Secretaries.


 

Implementation Strategy and targets:

 

States may access MIF for innovative integrated projects, including projects in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode and also for incentivizing micro irrigation through an additional (top up) subsidy over and above the one available under PMKSY-PDMC Guidelines and for covering additional areas. It should not be a substitute for State's share in PMKSY-PDMC.

 

Farmers Producers Organization (FPO)/Cooperatives/State Level Agencies can also access the funds with State Government Guarantee or equivalent collateral. Farmers Co-operatives may access this fund for innovative cluster based Community Irrigation Projects.

 

An Advisory Committee to provide policy direction and ensure effective planning, coordination and monitoring along with a Steering Committee for examining and approving the Projects/proposals from State Governments (total cost, eligible loan amount to the State and phasing), coordination and monitoring to ensure time bound implementation of the assisted projects/proposals within approved cost and phasing is proposed to be constituted.

 

Coverage:

The approval shall have Pan India coverage. With the operation of MIF, it is expected that the States which are lagging behind in adoption of Micro Irrigation would also be encouraged to take advantage of the fund for incentivizing farmers as being done by the good performing States. Besides, community driven and innovative projects to be taken up by the States would bring additional coverage of Micro Irrigation.

 

Rationale:

The Task Force on Micro Irrigation had estimated a potential of 69.5 m ha under micro irrigation, whereas the area covered so far is only about 10 m. ha (14%). Further, the Group of Secretaries, 2017, emphasized on target of 10 million ha under micro irrigation over the next 5 years, which would require an additional annual coverage of about 1 million ha compared to the present pace of implementation. This can be accomplished by effective utilization of the resources of both PMKSY-PDMC and MIF in any or both of the following manner:

                Laying the foundation stone of the frozen semen station in Maranga, Purnea Union Minister of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the frozen semen station is being set up at a costof Rs 64 crore under the RashtriyaGokul Mission with 100% contribution from the Central Government. Out of this, Rs 20 crore has already been released. He said the artificial insemination techniques can increase milk production and productivity. Currently, the artificial insemination is being done by CMOFED (Sudha) in Bihar. For artificial insemination, semen from high genetic merit bulls is needed. 

He stated that this is the government after Independence that has been taking concrete steps for the welfare of farmers at the grassroot level. To improve the condition of farmers, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has taken a resolve to double their income by 2022 and in order to achieve this, the Ministry of Agriculture along with the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries is working wholeheartedly. 

Shri Singh elaborated that the frozen semen station in Purnea will be the first state-of-the-art semen production center of the country. The center will develop highly modern bull shade, semen processing lab, feed and godown, agricultural equipment, and other facilities. In this, 300 high genetic merit bulls will be kept and 50 lakhs of semen dose will be produced per year. Red Sindhi, Bachaur, Gangatiri, Sahiwal breeds will also be kept. With the establishment of this semen station, milk productivity of cows and buffaloes will increase rapidly in the state.

The Minister said the RashtriyaGokul Mission was initiated in December 2014 with an aim to conserve and develop indigenous breeds. Proposals from Bihar under RashtriyaGokul Mission in 2015 and 2017 have been approved with a sum of 133.26 crore. Under the scheme, Rs 52.40 crore has been released to the state.

                          Shri Suresh Prabhu, Minister for Civil Aviation today reviewed the growth of airport infrastructure in India and called for preparation of a holistic “Vision - 2035” document. The vision document is expected to address issues such as congestion at airports, runways and airspace; development of unserved and under-served airports; ways and means to boost the air connectivity to small cities and towns - thereby increasing revenues. It will further provide a direction to the economic development in these areas in terms of job creation and cargo infrastructure development. 

          Observing that growth of airport infrastructure in many places has not kept pace with the passenger traffic, Sh. Prabhu urged AAI and other Airport operators to bolster their efforts to build new infrastructure and to expand existing airports to enhance the facilities available, keeping in view the pace of growth of Indian aviation sector.

          The Minister reviewed the on-going and planned expansion works at various airports such as Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Goa, Pune, Lucknow, Trivandrum, Guwahati, Jaipur, Calicut, Visakhapatnam, Bhubaneshwar, Patna, Coimbatore, Srinagar, Varanasi Chandigarh, Indore, Mangaluru, Amritsar and Bagdora. He examined the capacity of each airport against the number of passengers travelled and reviewed the measures being taken to decongest them. He noted the issues arising in expanding the existing airports as well as in constructing the new ones in different States and said that he would take up those issues with respective State Governments. The Minister asked the officials to suggest innovative land acquisition methods - a serious problem faced at many cities. The review meeting was attended by the Secretary of Civil Aviation along with other senior officers.

                Shri Suresh Prabhu, Minister for Civil Aviation reviewed the status of Skill Development in Aviation Sector and the progress being made on developing National Air Cargo Policy, here today. He directed the concerned in the Ministry to come up with a comprehensive development plan for skilling the people in the aviation sector. 

During the review meeting, the Minister stated that the demand for aviation skilled personnel has been rising commensurately with the boom in the civil aviation sector witnessed in the last 3-4 years Recognizing this demand and to bolster the Skill India Mission, Shri Suresh Prabhu made the following observations:


	Steps must be taken so as to have skill development centres across all States. 
	Institutional strengthening – In the context of training, the existing institutional structure should be strengthened further to ramp up the training. The business model of the Aviation University should be re-looked keeping in mind the vast demand for the human skilled resources in the coming years. As per a study, by 2035, the Indian Civil Aviation sector would require 0.8 to 1 million personnel directly and another 3 million indirectly. 
	Training process re-engineering – outline actionable ideas to modify the existing training process to enhance the quality of the output as well as to make the system more efficient
	A comprehensive development plan on skill development should be prepared along with funding related strategies that will aid the capacity building required in the sector


Shri Suresh Prabhu also reviewed the progress being made on developing National Air Cargo Policy. Recognizing the need for increasing air cargo industry size in India, the Sh. Prabhu made the following observations:


	Sufficient land should be earmarked in the upcoming airports for cargo operations.
	Should create air cargo trans-shipment hubs in India – sourcing cargo from neighbouring states and partner countries.
	The policy should aim at creating inter-modal hubs and should have air-sea, air-road, air-inland waterways connectivity
	Geographical location and distinct products related to that location should be kept in mind while developing the cargo policy


Stressing on the need for skilling the people in aviation sector and to have national air cargo policy in place, Shri Prabhu directed the concerned in the Ministry to work on the observations made in the review meeting and come up with actionable items soon.

                Shri Suresh Prabhu, Minister for Civil Aviation today said that the government is committed to the building of airport capacity as part of NABH (NextGen Airports for BHarat) Nirman initiative. He said that the three key aspects of NABH Nirman are (1) fair and equitable land acquisition, (2) long-term master plan for airport and regional development and (3) balanced economics for all stakeholders. He said that improving passenger amenities, promoting cargo handling facilities and early operationalisation of 56 new airports under UDAN scheme will be his focus areas while simultaneously working on improving regional connectivity and improving passenger services in a big way.

Accepting the recommendations made by the steering committee on Greenfield Airports,  Sh. Suresh Prabhu today accorded site clearance approval to the Greenfield International Airport at Purander, Pune. The Minister also accorded ‘in-principle’ approval to the Government of Uttar Pradesh for setting up of Noida International Greenfield Airport at the North of Jewar Village, Utta Pradesh.

One of the conditions of site clearance approval to Pune Greenfield Airport is that the Mahashtra Airport Development Company Ltd - MADC, the agency executing the project, will try not to close the existing Pune airport. It will accordingly take up the matter with Ministry of Defence and will try to make both the airports available for civil use. With the grant of site clearance approval, the MADC, may proceed with preparation of Techno Economic Feasibility Report and Detailed Project Report.

MoCA had granted site clearance to the Noida International Greenfield Airport on July 06, 2017. The U. P. Government appointed Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) as the implementing agency on its behalf in October 2017. YEIDA obtained the No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Defence on January 11, 2018. With the Minister’s approval today the YEIDA has got in-principle approval for setting up of Noida International Greenfield Airport at North of Jewar village, Uttar Pradesh.

Recognising its role as the growth driver of the Indian economy, the Government of India has given enhanced trust for the infrastructure sector in the Union Budget 2018-19. Towards this endeavour, Government of India has brought out National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP), which is the stepping stone to provide robust air connectivity throughout the length and breadth of our country. The Policy also envisages to create an ecosystem which encourages economic growth of the country, by enabling people to connect with ease at an affordable cost, through Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS), aptly titled as UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). 

The country has witnessed phenomenal growth rate in the range of 18 to 20 percent in the last 3 years. According to IATA Traffic Study, India, at 7th position as of now, is likely to take 3rd position by 2023-24 by overtaking UK, Japan, Spain & Germany. The current rate of the growth in domestic aviation sector of India is the highest globally.

To meet the growing demand, Government of India has launched a new initiative of NABH Nirman (NextGen Airports for Bharat), wherein systems and processes are geared to provide enhanced airport capacity to handle 1 billion trips in the next 10 to 15 years.

Airport capacity upgradation and expansion require both development of new greenfield airports and expansion of existing brownfield airports and same will be funded by the Indian private sector and Airports Authority of India by leveraging its balance sheet. 

Airports Authority of India is in the process of implementing plans for development of infrastructure to meet growing aviation demand by creating additional capacity at AAI Airports like, Chennai, Guwahati, Lucknow, Agartala, Patna, Srinagar, Pune, Trichy, Vijayawada, Port Blair, Jaipur, Mangalore, Dehradun, Jabalpur, Kolhapur, Goa, Rupsi, Leh, Calicut, Imphal, Varanasi & Bhubaneswar with a capex of Rs.20178 Crores in the next 4 to 5 years. 

AAI has already awarded the works at Agartala, Calicut, Port Blair towards construction of new state-of-the-art integrated terminals and is in the process to immediately approve the works for upgradation and expansion of capacity at Chennai, Lucknow and Guwahati Airports, at a cost of Rs.2467 crores, Rs.1383 crores and Rs.1232 crores, respectively. Similarly, upgradation of airside capacity by way of strengthening and extension of runways, construction of new apron bays has been taken up to cater to the demand from airline operators who have placed confirmed orders for almost 900 aircrafts in the coming 10 years.

Under New Greenfield Airport Policy, many major cities are expected to have multiple airports. Government has granted approval for Noida International Airport (Jewar), Mopa (Goa), Purandar Airport (Pune), Bhogapuram Airport (Visakhapatnam), Dholera Airport (Ahmedabad), Hirasar Airport (Rajkot). Capex outlay of Rs.50000 crores is expected in the development of New Greenfield Airports, wherein approval of Government of India has been given. In the private sector also, upgradation and expansion is in the offing for Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad Airports at a cost of Rs.25000 crores in the next five years’ time.

                Sh. Suresh Prabhu, Minister for Civil Aviation has welcomed the Telecom Commission’s approval for offering in-flight connectivity within Indian airspace. He said that the decision would enable flyers to avail data and voice services during flights over Indian airspace and the government will now work towards creating the license framework for a special category of service providers called ‘In-flight connectivity provider.

He said that these developments mean that airlines are now equipped to bring dramatic, yet cost effective, enhancements to the passenger experience –with passengers ordering products from their phones and tablets and arranging to have them delivered to their homes, or the hotel on arrival at their destination. He said that connectivity to the ground means cabin crews can help passengers to change their onward transit plans to accommodate for changes to their flight, while they are still in the air.

Sh. Prabhu assured that he will ensure earliest implementation and complimented those involved in the decision. Re-iterating the government’s commitment in improving the services to air passengers he stated that a new India is in the making under the leadership of Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi where everything is undergoing a positive transformation, from mindsets to methodologies.

Construction of airport building and runway for airport at Sindhudurg, Maharashtra

Maharashtra will get a new airport at ParuleChipi in Sindhudurg district in 2018. Work on the project is expected to be completed in June this year, before the onset of monsoon and the Ganesh Festival, which will begin in September this year.

The airport is being constructed by IRB Sindhudurg Airport Pvt. Ltd. on a design-build-finance-operate-transfer (DBFOT) basis for the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). Sindhudurg airport will have a 2500-meter runway which has provision for future development. The airport will be built at an approximate cost of 520 crores.

Sindhudurg airport will have the capacity to handle 200 departing and 200 passengers arriving during peak hours with expansion facilities to serve up to 400 departing and 400 arriving passengers without additional construction. Although the airport will be serving domestic travellers it will be equipped with facilities to serve International charter flights. 

Agreement for construction of the airport has already been signed between Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and IRB Sindhudurg airport Pvt. Ltd. in 2009. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has given in-principle approval and environmental clearance has also been granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forest. 

Construction of taxi way, apron and isolation bay has been completed and work on the airfield ground lighting in on. Construction of passenger terminal building, ATC tower and technical building is on in full swing. Construction of other ancillary buildings is in progress and will be completed on time. 

An airport in Sindhudurg was necessary in order to provide better connectivity to the Konkan region of Maharashtra, parts of Goa, North Karnataka and Western Maharashtra. At present the state of Maharashtra has three functional international and 13 domestic airports.

                The Union Minister of Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal chaired a detailed review meeting with Shri R.K. Singh, Minister of State (IC) Power and New & Renewable Energy and with top officials of Ministries of Coal, Railways and Power in New Delhi today.

In the meeting, review of Power supply requirement during the ongoing summer and forthcoming winter season was carried out. Various short term, medium term and long term measures were discussed in detail to improve the coal stock position in Power Plants of the country.  

Comprehensive review of targets for coal production and dispatches by the coal companies is carried out.  

Shri Piyush Goyal stressed on the necessity to increase Plant Load Factor (PLF) of various Power Plants of the country. He said that all pithead plants with sufficient coal supply should run at 100% PLF. He expressed the desire to hold fortnightly meeting of the ministries involved, to review the power situation in the country.

He stressed on the need for States located far from mines to use provisions under “Flexibility of utilization of Coal” rules, so that this coal can be used by those power stations near the coal source . Gujarat and Maharashtra have already been using these provisions. This will enable cheaper power to the respective States and efficient utilization of rolling stock enabling coal supply for other power stations.

He gave clear instructions to the officials of the three ministries to keep a close vigil on the power production and supply situation in the country and to keep in close touch with Chief Secretaries and Power Secretaries of the States for this purpose.

Shri Goyal expressed the need to improve the turnaround time of rakes by better scheduling of trains and optimum utilization of traffic blocks. He expressed the need to rationalize operational and maintenance practices on the high density routes of Indian Railways.  

He stressed on reducing terminal detention of wagons inside Power Plants and Coal sidings to generate extra capacity. 

Last but not the least, he emphasized that team effort, better coordination between Ministries involved and the rationalization of work procedures will lead to generation of extra capacity within the existing system and ensure 24X7 power supply for the people of India.

The recommendation of the IMTF have been approved by the Competent Authority.

Point-wise details : 

1.         Coal linkage rationalization shall be an exercise in which the coal linkage of a Thermal Power Plant (TPP) of an Independent Power Producer (IPP) may be transferred from one Coal Company to another based on the availability during the fiscal and future coal production plan of the coal company.

2.         The underlying objective behind the exercise shall be to reduce the landed cost of coal due to reduction in transportation cost. The savings achieved due to this reduction of landed price of coal are required to be passed on to the Discom/consumer of power.

3.         This exercise shall be voluntary on the part of the TPPs. The exercise aims to reduce the distance by which coal travels, thus, easing up the Railway infrastructure for gainful utilization for other sectors.

4.         The one time process of calling for the requests of the IPP for linkage rationalization shall be undertaken jointly by CIL, SCCL and CEA in a transparent manner.

5.         This linkage rationalization shall be considered only for IPPs having linkages through allotment route. The IPPs shall also be stating the Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) for which the linkage rationalization shall be requested and their preferred mode of transportation after the linkage rationalization.

6.     The Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) of the rationalized source from any coal company would be signed/implemented only after the appropriate Electricity Regulatory Commission approves the supplementary agreement.

7.     Any dispute as and when it arises would be resolved as per the provision of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.

Implementation strategy and targets :

The proposed rationalization of linkages is transparent, objective and creates a level playing field for IPPs in each domain. It attempts to make optimal rationalization of the vital natural resources across the power units of IPPs.

Major impact :

The reduced landed price of coal shall lead to savings in cost of power generated and shall reduce transportation cost of coal.

The savings achieved due to reduction in the landed price of coal shall be passed on to the Discom/consumers of power.

The exercise shall also help in reducing the load on the transportation infrastructure.

                India has taken the lead in seeking to revive WTO discussions on issues related to preventing theft of traditional knowledge. Government of India, along with the Centre for WTO Studies, Indian Institute of Foreign Trade and the South Centre (an inter-governmental organisation based in Geneva), are organising an International Conference on TRIPS- CBD Linkage in Geneva on 7-8 June 2018. 

Brazil and South Africa are some of the other countries that have joined hands with India on this crucial initiative. The international conference will bring together indigenous people/local communities in developing and developed countries, internationally acclaimed academicians working on the subject, Geneva-based negotiators and capital based experts. They will brainstorm on the options for energising negotiations on this subject in the WTO. Resource persons, stakeholders and experts from a large number of countries, including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Peru, Philippines, New Zealand, South Africa, Switzerland, and the US, would participate in the international conference.  

The Convention on Biological Diversity is a multilateral agreement on sustainable development and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resource. It has membership of 196 countries. 

The Doha Ministerial Declaration in 2001 had tasked the TRIPS Council of the WTO to examine the relationship between the TRIPS Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the protection of traditional knowledge and folklore. It also mandated that while doing so, the Council should be guided by the objectives and principles set out in the TRIPS Agreement and should fully take into account the development dimension. While there has been considerable debate and deliberations on the subject no common understanding has yet been reachedat the WTO.

TRIPS CBD Linkage is important for India and other developing countries because it seeks to address bio-piracy. It has been a long standing demand that patents should not be granted for existing traditional knowledge and associated genetic resources.  Further, it has also been argued that where traditional knowledge forms a basis for further scientific developments that are sought to be patented, there should be a mechanism to ensure disclosure of information in this regard. This is considered essential not only from the point of view of addressing information asymmetry at the patent office but in also enabling better assessment of the inventive step involved. The developing countries seek an amendment in the TRIPS Agreement to make disclosure of source or origin of genetic resource by patent applicants, submission of evidence of prior informed consent of local communities and evidence of fair and equitable sharing of benefits under the relevant national regimes mandatory. In 2008, developing countries garnered the support of the European Union to form a coalition of 109 countries (which included the African and Caribbean and Pacific Countries) for the above proposal seeking amendment of the TRIPS Agreement to enable mandatory disclosures in patent applications. The last major proposal along similar lines but incorporating the mechanism agreed to under the Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity was submitted by India, Brazil along with other like-minded countries in 2011. After this, the discussions appear to have lost steam. 

The Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits arising from their utilization came into effect in 2014. The protocol provides a legal framework for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources for research and commercialization purpose. At present, more than 100 countries have acceded to the protocol. This makes its mandatory for them to set down an access and benefit regime in compliance with the protocol.

 

India is optimistic that during the forthcoming international conference on TRIPs CBD issues the proponents will agree on a clear roadmap for pursuing this issue at the WTO.

The Union Minister for Commerce & Industry Suresh Prabhu releasing the strategy paper & business plan of India’s Computer Software &ITeS and Electronics Export, prepared by Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council in New Delhi

 

Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council (ESC) has prepared a strategy paper for augmenting software exports to US$ 178 billion by 2022. Union Commerce &Industry and  Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu, released the strategy paper in New Delhi yesterday. The Minister praised the efforts by the ESC for taking this initiative to prepare a strategy for boosting India’s computer software &ITeS and electronics export. The Minister further added that Government of India will extend all possible support to the industry for intensifying the exports to traditional markets and to make forays into the alternate markets like Africa, Latin America and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). He said that the government is taking proactive steps for making ICT exports more vibrant and to motivate more units to focus on exports.

The strategy paper highlights the need for some policy level changes that are critically needed, such as resolving visa problems with the US, greater access of professionals to European countries, early signing of Totalisation Agreement with the US, setting up of incubation centres and language proficiency facilities in major IT hubs. The current business model for export of software and ITeS is relevant for outsourcing work. For the emerging markets like Africa and Middle East, a different model, is required since India mostly offers product solutions. Although potential for export of software &ITeS in US and Europe is high, the smaller companies are grossly underperforming because of innovation andtechnology leadership gaps. The paper also spells out specific policy prescriptions, market destinations and other enabling inputs that can bring about transformational changes in the Indian software and services exports. Specific suggestions include judiciously blending software and hardware, creating newer export outlets, fiscal incentives, country specific software export promotion measures.

                Department of Commerce formally issued notification for creation of Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Hon’ble Commerce and Industry Minister Sh. Suresh Prabhu has given his approval for creation of DGTR in Department of Commerce, consequent upon amendment carried out by Government of India to the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 on May 7, 2018 in this regard.

 

          DGTR will be the apex National Authority for administering all trade remedial measures including anti-dumping, countervailing duties and safeguard measures. The DGTR will bring Directorate General of Anti-dumping and Allied duties (DGAD), Directorate General of Safeguards (DGS) and Safeguards (QR) functions of DGFT into its fold by merging them into one single national entity. It will also provide trade defence support to our domestic industry and exporters in dealing with increasing instances of trade remedy investigations instituted against them by other countries.  In the last three years, India initiated more than 130 anti-dumping/countervailing duty/safeguard cases to deal with the rising incidences of unfair trade practices and to provide a level playing field to the domestic industry.

DGTR has been approved with a sanctioned strength of 112 posts drawn from Directorate General of Anti-dumping and Allied duties of Department of Commerce and Directorate General of Safeguards of CBEC. DGTR will be a multi service organization drawing upon the skill-set of various officers from the field of International Trade, Customs, Revenue, Finance, Economics, Costing and Law. The creation of DGTR will also result in savings of 49 posts to the Government on account of merging DGAD and DGS. This has been in tune with the goal of the Prime Minister to have “Minimum Government Maximum Governance”. 

Sh. Suresh Prabhu, Commerce and Industry Minister has expressed satisfaction over creation of DGTR, an issue pending since 1997, and has termed it to be manifestation of vision of Prime Minister to provide a level playing field to our domestic industry.

The Minister of Commerce and Industry Shri Suresh Prabhu launched the Intellectual Property (IP) mascot – IP Nani – at the conference on National Intellectual Property Rights Policy in New Delhi today. An anti-piracy video featuring Mr. Amitabh Bachchan was also launched by the Minister at the event. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, the Minister said that protection of Intellectual Property Rights is critical for building a knowledge based society. Minister further said that mere legal provisions are not sufficient for protection of Intellectual Property Rights but their strict implementation is equally required. Piracy is a serious crime which should not go unpunished. Minister also called for creating awareness against stealing Intellectual Property Rights and stressed on the need for participation of society in the effort.

 

Mascot IP Nani is a tech-savvy grandmother who helps the government and enforcement agencies in combating IP crimes with the help of her grandson “Chhotu” aka Aditya. The IP mascot will spread awareness about the importance of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) among people, especially children, in an interesting manner. 

 

This character is also in line with the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) campaign for the World IP Day which celebrates the brilliance, ingenuity, curiosity and courage of the women who are driving change in our world and shaping our common future. It also highlighted that how a strong IP system can support innovative and creative women and indeed everyone in their quest to bring their amazing ideas to the market. 

 

lPRs are increasingly becoming crucial drivers of social and economic growth by encouraging creativity and innovation. Realizing the importance of IPRs, the National IPR Policy was approved by the Union Cabinet on 12th May 2016. The first and foremost objective of the Policy is “IPR Awareness: Outreach and Promotion”. Under this objective, one of the key focus areas is awareness on IPR for school children, as it is essential to nurture creativity and the ability to innovate starting out from a young age.

 

In this context, the Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM), a professional body under the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) collaborated with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EU-IPO) to produce a series of animated videos on IPRs for children with IP Nani as their central character. All these videos are available on CIPAM’s official YouTube channel (CIPAM India), Twitter handle @CIPAM_India and Facebook Page @CIPAMIndia. 

 

CIPAM has been conducting IPR awareness workshops for school students since April 2017. Till date CIPAM has reached out to over 100 schools sensitizing over 8,000 students on IPRs. Additionally, CIPAM also engaged with the National Council of Educational Research & Training (NCERT) to curate content on IPRs. As a result, for the first time ever IPRs have been exclusively included in the NCERT textbook for Class 12 school syllabus. These efforts are aimed at inspiring the next generation of creators and innovators to become proud IP owners.

                It has been observed that there have been some misinformed news reports appearing in the media about import of sugar from Pakistan. 

Import of Sugar from Pakistan

It is clarified that in FY 2018-19 (Till 14.5.2018), import of sugar from Pakistan has been just 1908 MT for a value of USD 0.657 million. In 2017-18, there was an import of 13,110 MT for a value of USD 4.68 million.

We must see this import in the overall context that total annual sugar production of India is about 31.90 million MT in Sugar season 2017-18.  Further, India exported 1.75 million MT in 2017-18. During April-May 2018, the total export of sugar has been   240,093 MT. Thus import from Pakistan has been very miniscule as compared to total production in the country and exports from India. Further, it has been reported that Pakistan Government has provided cash freight subsidy of Rs 10.7 per kg on sugar. 

Import Policy of Sugar

At present import of sugar is free with a customs duty of 100%. There is no Pakistan specific restriction for any item for imports to India.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to the following proposal of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion:-

 

i.     Development of Freight Village, an Integrated Multi Modal Logistics Hub (IMLH), Nangal Chaudhary, Haryana on 886.78 acres of land to be implemented by the project Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in two phases.

ii.   Financial sanction of Rs. 1029.49 crore for development of Phase I and in principle approval for development of Phase II of the project. Expenditure on Phase I comprises cost of entire land at Rs. 266 crore including cost of the land to be used for development of Phase II.

iii.  Investment of Rs. 763.49 crore by National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust (NICDIT) which includes of Rs. 266 crore as equity and Rs. 497.49 crore as debt in the SPV; and

iv.  Bidding for trunk infrastructure development by SPV on EPC basis;

          

Impact:

           The project has enormous economic value in terms of direct and indirect benefits and multiplier effects on the economy. The economic benefits of the project will include creation of employment, reduction in fuel costs, boosts to exports, reduction in vehicle (trucks) operating cost, reduction in accident related costs, increase in collection of taxes by the State Government, reduction in pollution, etc.

 

           The proposed development of a Freight Village as Multi Modal Logistics Hub is estimated to generate over four thousand direct and six thousand indirect employment.   Job creation will not be limited to core logistics facilities but would also entail opportunities for entire logistics supply chain.

           

Details:

 


	The construction of trunk infrastructure will be undertaken in two phases. Phase I will be implemented by financial year 2020-21. 
	The award of various construction packages will be made in a manner so that the entire construction of trunk infrastructure gets completed simultaneously. 
	Phase-ll of the project will be reappraised in 2028 or earlier, if so required, for suitable financial sanctions.
	For implementation of proposed Freight Village, an SPV has been incorporated as a 50:50 Joint Venture of Government of India through NICDIT and Government of Haryana through HSIDC under the name ""DMIC Haryana Multi Modal Logistic Hub Project Limited"".


 

The Freight Village will be connected through Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) at Dabla, which is at a distance of approximately 10 kms. This logistics hub integrated with the DFC would have the following components:

 

i.           High speed connectivity to key ports and Industrial Centres;

ii.          Lower cost of supplying goods - faster freight operations & removal of

multiple handling costs; 

iii.         Improved service quality; 

iv.          Real time freight tracking and data analysis; 

v.                   Single-point   solution   to   all   logistics   need   like   loading/aggregation/packaging/ storage;

vi.          Speedy access to ports from hinterland; 

vii.         Economy of scale in supply chain operations with reduced cost and time of operations; 

viii.        Last mile gateway port connectivity from the hinterland;

ix.          Contain unorganized growth of container freight stations.

 

Background:

           Government of India (Gol) is developing the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor, as a global manufacturing and investment destination around 1,504 km long Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) as the backbone. Investment Regions and Industrial Areas have been identified for development in this corridor, across six States namely Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

 

           Haryana is a major industrial and trading hub in North India. Potentially high rate of industrial development has to be supported through additional infrastructure to handle the transport of raw material and manufactured goods. Haryana is expected to witness container traffic of about 10 Million Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit (TEUs) by 2025. Hence, development of a Freight Village in Mahendragarh district of Haryana has been considered necessary to achieve the following objectives:

 

i.       Improving efficiency of operations of existing industries in the region as well as attractiveness of the region as an investment destination for various categories of industries, warehousing and logistics operators;

ii.   Tapping potential traffic along the Western DFC and of Northern states which is likely to galvanise rail-based freight movement with high-end operational features of faster and high-capacity freight trains. It will serve as a world-class multi modal facility that provides for efficient storage/transitioning of goods to/from DFC, thereby catering to the escalated freight traffic;

iii.         Offering an attractive destination to freight companies and customers to boost industrial development in the region and creating economic opportunities. The facility will not only house standard container handling activities but will create various value added services.

                The Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM), a professional body under the aegis of the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce & Industry, is organizing a conference on successful completion of two years of the National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy adopted by the Government of India in May 2016 in New Delhi today. 

Shri Suresh Prabhu, Minister of Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviation, will launch the IP Mascot at the event. One of the key objectives of the policy aimed at “involving eminent personalities as ambassadors to spread awareness and importance of IP in India”. In this context, an anti-piracy video featuring Mr. Amitabh Bachchan will also be launched at the event. 

The National IPR Policy is a vision document that aims to create and exploit synergies between all forms of intellectual property (IP), concerned statutes and agencies. It sets in place an institutional mechanism for implementation, monitoring and review. It aims to incorporate and adapt global best practices to the Indian scenario. 

In this regard, the Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM) was created in the year 2016 as a professional body under the aegis of DIPP to take forward the implementation of the National IPR Policy. Since then, CIPAM is working towards creating public awareness about IPRs in the country, promoting the filing of IPRs through facilitation, providing inventors with a platform to commercialize their IP assets and coordinating the implementation of the National IPR Policy in collaboration with Government Ministries/Departments and other stakeholders.

This conference will mark two years of the National IPR Policy and will have focused sessions on women in innovation and creativity, awareness, commercialization and enforcement of IPRs. It will highlight the progress with regards to the objectives of the policy and the way forward.

                With the aim to foster competitiveness and to propel the States and Union Territories to work proactively towards promotion of their Startup eco-systems, the States Startup Ranking Framework was launched by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) on 6th February 2018. This was also targeted at facilitating States/UTs to identify, learn and replicate good practices from each other and for bringing to fore, their own progress in the regard.

As a run-up to this, DIPP actively engaged with State and UT Governments over the past several weeks to help them prepare and participate in the States Startup Ranking exercise. Two rounds of video conferences were organised by DIPP with all the States and UTs in the month of March and April 2018. A dedicated team from DIPP also visited all States and UTs to conduct ranking awareness and capacity building workshop. In order to provide exposure to State/UT officials about the process of developing Startup ecosystem in their respective regions, 3 knowledge exchange workshops were conducted at leading incubators in the country. The workshops were organised at T-Hub, Hyderabad on 9th April, 2018, iCreate, Ahmedabad on 11th April, 2018 and Sunrise Incubation Tower, Vishakhapatnam on 16th April, 2018. There was a lot of enthusiasm shown by the States and Union Territories in these workshops which were attended in large numbers.

States and UTs have participated enthusiastically in this first ever State Startup Ranking exercise. A total of 30 States and UTs have participated in this exercise whose last date for submission of documents was 30th April. It is encouraging to note enthusiastic participation from majority of north-eastern and hill States as well, where the Startup ecosystem is still nascent.

The participating States and UTs shall now be evaluated on a score of 100, against 38 action points categorized into 7 areas of intervention such as Startup Policy and implementation, Incubation support, Seed Funding, Angel and Venture Funding, Simplification of Regulations, Easing Public Procurement and Awareness & Outreach. In order to evaluate States/UTs in a balanced and transparent manner, the assessment will be based on the aggregate score of the documentary proofs substantiating the implementation of action points by the State/ UT Government and also feedback from Startup ecosystem beneficiaries/components (to be picked up randomly from the list of beneficiaries/components that the state itself provides). DIPP has appointed seven dedicated evaluation committees involving members from all relevant departments and reputed players in the ecosystem, for evaluating States’ responses in each area of intervention. The performance of the States will be dynamically presented on the State Startup Ranking dashboard hosted on www.startupindia.gov.in. The overall exercise is expected to be complete with announcement in ranking in June, 2018.

The launch of the ranking framework has galvanized the States into action, thereby giving impetus to the Startup movement across the country. The impact created by this exercise is highlighted below through some of the encouraging responses as submitted by State Governments, which are currently under evaluation: 


	Announcement of Startup Policy 
	Introduction of specific incentives in State Startup policy for women lead Startups 



	Constitution of State Startup nodal team 
	Provision of financial support to State Incubators 
	Design of guidelines for Seed Funding for Startups 



	Launch of State chapters of angel networks 



	Hosting discussions/workshops to identify Startups in disruptive technologies



	Conducting State Startup Yatras - a series of boot camps in colleges/ universities to generate ideas

                The Government of India carried out an Amendment to the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 on May 7, 2018 substituting “Directorate General of Trade Remedies” in place of “Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties” in Department of Commerce.  This has paved way for creation of an integrated single umbrella National Authority to be called the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) for providing comprehensive and swift trade defence mechanism in India. The amendment of Allocation of Business Rules has also mandated Department of Commerce with work pertaining to recommendation of Safeguard measures.

 

2.       Presently, the trade defence mechanism in India lacks optimality and takes more than a year to complete proceedings in cases pertaining to unfair trade practices.  Currently, the Directorate General of Anti-dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) deals with anti-dumping and CVD cases, Directorate General of Safeguards (DGS) deals with safeguard measures and DGFT deals with quantitative restriction (QR) safeguards.  The DGTR will bring DGAD, DGS and Safeguards (QR) functions of DGFT into its fold by merging them into one single national entity. DGTR will deal with Anti-dumping, CVD and Safeguard measures. It will also provide trade defence support to our domestic industry and exporters in dealing with increasing instances of trade remedy investigations instituted against them by other countries.  The creation of DGTR will provide a level playing field to the domestic industry.  In the last three years, India initiated more than 130 anti-dumping/countervailing duty/safeguard cases to deal with the rising incidences of unfair trade practices and to provide a level playing field to the domestic industry.

 

3.       The DGTR will function as an attached office of Department of Commerce.  The recommendation of DGTR for imposition of Anti-dumping, countervailing & Safeguard duties would be considered by the Department of Revenue.

 

4.       The DGTR will be a professionally integrated organisation with multi-spectrum skill sets emanating from officers drawn from different services and specialisations.  The DGTR will also bring in substantial reduction of the time taken to provide relief to the domestic industry.  The newly constituted body is in consonance with the goal of Minimum Government Maximum Governance of the Prime Minister of India.

 

5.       The Commerce and Industry Minister Sh. Suresh Prabhu expressed his satisfaction over the fact that the proposal of creation of DGTR which was pending since 1997 has been approved under the leadership of the Prime Minister, making it an epochal event for the benefit of the domestic industry.

                Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation Minister, Suresh Prabhu, today addressed secretaries and senior officers in the first inter-ministerial meeting on Sectoral Export Promotion Strategy. The meeting was attended by Secretaries to Government of India from Department of Commerce, DIPP, Electronics and IT, Animal Husbandry and Dairying and MSME, besides senior officers from about 14 other administrative Ministries/Departments including Agriculture, Textiles, Petroleum, Food Processing Industries, Pharma, Chemical and Petrochemical, Defence production and MEA which are concerned with various product groups which comprise a substantial part of India’s merchandise exports.

Commerce Minister emphasised that exports are strategically important and sustained growth in exports is critical for India. It is therefore imperative to promote exports as a combined and joint mission which requires the effort of all ministries and departments of the Government.

The Minister asked all officers to prepare an action plan on boosting exports of products being handled by their respective Ministries and send it to the Department of Commerce within the next fortnight. The action plan should also have short term targets which are achievable in the next two months. The Department of Commerce will take the assistance of Ministry of External Affairs to implement the action plans through our commercial missions abroad. Minister informed that the Union Cabinet has accorded approval of Rs. 5000 crores to promote export of services in champion sectors and the Department of Commerce (DoC) is organizing the next Global Exhibition on export of Services at Mumbai on 15th May 2018. He stated that the DoC is now actively associating with State Governments for promoting exports recognizing the fact that States are the key stakeholders in the growth of exports. Regional Authorities of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) have been assigned enhanced role and responsibilities to liaise with state governments to assist in formulation and implementation of state export policy and strategy and to represent the Department of Commerce in the State and Union Territory Governments. Officers have been asked to identify a few districts under their jurisdiction to assess and prepare a dossier on their export potential and initiate measures to realise the full potential of actual exports from that area.

Minister further added that on external front DoC has engaged with about 150 countries in the last few months. A task force on SEZs has also been set up to ensure that export potential from these zones is utilized fully. He informed the respective Ministries and Departments that DoC as well as the ITPO can organize road-shows and exhibitions for their sectors and products. Increased exports will also ensure that the capacity utilization of manufacturing units is maximised and their employment potential is fully utilized. Minister stated that a holistic approach to manufacturing and exports is the need of the hour as protectionist approach may actually have a negative impact on value added items of export. We need to push the idea of looking for new markets as well as exporting new products. Ministries should work out the strategy, and after receiving the plans, DoC will organize further meetings with export promotion councils, trading houses as well as major exporters. A ‘Best Exporting Ministry/Dept. Award’ will also be announced.

The Minister advised the EXIM bank to prepare an action plan to alleviate the financial difficulties being faced by exporters. Similarly the FPI sector can take the help of NABARD for financing their projects. The Minister announced that the arrangement for having inter-ministerial meetings to boost exports with concerned administrative ministries will be institutionalized by DoC.

Minister of State, Commerce & Industry, C. R. Chaudhary complimented CIM for having called this meeting and stated that while the Department of Commerce has taken many steps to boost exports, this by itself is not enough and there needs to be a complementarity with other Ministries/ Departments in this effort. He invited attention to stagnating exports in gem and jewellery, textiles and leather sectors and exhorted the Departments to come up with new proposals to boost exports in these areas.

Commerce Secretary, Smt. Rita Teaotia informed the officers that while there has been a 10% growth in merchandise exports in the current year, our share in global trade is static at 1.7% in merchandise exports and 3.4% is services exports. We need to look at new markets. While we have done well in US and Europe there has not been adequate focus on fast emerging markets in Asia. We need to focus more on exports to China, Latin America and Africa.

DGFT, Shri Alok Chaturvedi initiated the discussion by giving the trend of India’s trade data. He observed that India’s share of exports is high in goods which are less traded and low in goods that are traded more in the world. This needs to be realigned. DG highlighted the sectors where the export share of the sector in India’s exports is less compared to the share of the sector in world exports. These were identified as potential sectors. Growing world trade, Make in India campaign, enhancement in ease of doing business were identified as opportunities for enhancing exports.  He stated that the Department of Commerce has great expectations from today’s meeting and we expect the departments/ ministries present to do a SWOT analysis and come up with sectoral export promotion strategy for the product groups pertaining to them.

Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation Minister, Suresh Prabhu speaking at the inauguration of iPHEX, International Exhibition of Pharma and Healthcare

 

Ministry of Commerce and Industry is fully committed to promoting the Indian pharmaceuticals industry globally, said Commerce and Industry Minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, after inaugurating 'iPHEX' in New Delhi today. The 6th annual International Exhibition of Pharma and Healthcare (iPHEX) is being attended by over 650 delegates from 130 countries, including scores of regulators. The Minister said that Government is committed to promoting pharmaceutical exports to untapped markets, including China which has agreed for a high level bilateral Round Table to pave the way for Indian Pharma to get market access and penetration in their vast market. 

 

Shri Prabhu assured the global pharmaceutical players and regulators, of best quality and affordability of the Indian drugs. He emphasised the need for reaching out to newer markets, especially in Africa, where affordability is the key issue, which can be very well addressed by the Indian exporters. He stressed on the need of both competitive and complementary strategies, so that each segment of Pharmaceutical sector can benefit. He further said that there is need to make both traditional and preventive medicine, to work together.  He also said that Genomics is the new branch in medicine, which can play a major role for the Indian Pharmaceutical sector. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Commerce Secretary Mrs Rita Teaotia said that effort is on to ensure uniform quality in the pharmaceutical sector. The Ministry is committed to ensure that consistent quality and efficacy is maintained by Indian pharmaceutical products. 

 

Enumerating the measures to improve Ease of Doing Business, the Drugs Controller General of India, Dr Eswara Reddy, announced increasing the validity of the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) Certificate, from two to three years. He further stated that protocol for clinical trials approval has also been changed, setting the time line of 45 days. Once approval does not come within this timeline, the protocol would have deemed to be approved. 

 

Chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (PHARMEXCIL) Mr Madan Mohan Reddy expressed confidence that the global business will be retained in India because of competitive cost of production. He complimented the Commerce and Industry Ministry for taking several measures to make India the main source of global manufacturing in pharmaceuticals. 

 

PHARMEXCIL Vice Chairman Mr Dinesh Dua said besides generics, India will soon emerge as a force to reckon with in the area of innovative drugs.

Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Shri Suresh Prabhu, speaking at the Port Officers’ Meeting in New Delhi.

 

A two-day meeting of port officers organized by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), of the Department of Commerce, ended today in New Delhi.  The Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Shri Suresh Prabhu, addressed the regional officers from different parts of the country and urged them to reorient their thinking to be a facilitator and not a regulator.

The Minister added that the regional officers have to take their job as a challenge and an opportunity as foreign trade is now a strategic issue for India as it not only benefits the domestic economy but also links the country with global trade. The Minister asked for greater engagement of regional officers with the state governments in order to boost exports. He urged DGFT to set up a committee headed by the chief secretary of states on all export promotion issues including logistics.

The Minister further added that officers of DGFT in the regions should identify districts with potential to export unique products and those officers who are able to fulfil their targets will be rewarded.  He urged DGFT to organize regular orientation programmes for employees at all levels so that they are aligned to the mission of DGFT to serve exporters of the country.

During the two days’ deliberations the regional authorities of DGFT discussed various administrative issues being faced by them and measures to be taken for streamlining regulatory mechanisms for exports. During the discussions it was also decided that regional authorities of DGFT should conduct outreach programmes with exporters on all issues of the Department of Commerce.

                          The Union Cabinet chaired by chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Cadre review and formation of Group ‘A’ service of the technical cadre of Petroleum & Safety Organization (PESO) in the name of Indian Petroleum & Explosives Safety Service (IPESS).

          The measure will enhance the capacity and efficiency of the organization and it will also enhance career progression of its Group ‘A’ officers. 

Background:

          PESO is a subordinate office under Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP). The organization is serving the nation since 1898 as a nodal agency for regulating safety of substances such as explosives, compressed gases and petroleum. Over the years, the role and responsibilities of PESO have increased manifold and expanded into diverse fields. Today, the organization deals with wide range of subjects related to explosives, petroleum, compressed gases, pressure vessels, gas cylinders, cross-country pipelines, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Auto Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Auto LPG) etc. The increase in workload is manifested in the quantum jump in the number of licensed premises and other activities.

          The present sanctioned strength of Technical Group ‘A’ cadre of PESO is 137 having 60 Junior Time Scale (JTS) level officers, 46 Senior Time Scale (STS) level officers, 23 Junior Administrative Grade (JAG) level officers (Level 12), 7 JAG level officers (Level 13) and 1 Senior Administrative Grade (SAG) level post of Chief Controller of Explosives.

          To remove acute stagnation in all grades and uplift the morale of the workforce and enhance its performance, it has been decided to form Group ‘A’ Service of the technical cadre of PESO in the name of IPESS and restructure the newly-formed service by increasing 5 posts at Level-13 and 3 posts at Level-12 and corresponding reduction of 8 posts at Level-11.

                The field officers of BSNL should focus on better customer service and try to change the negative customer perception about BSNL, said ShManoj Sinha, Minister for Telecommunications.  The Minister was speaking at the Heads of Circles Conference (HOCC) of senior officers of BSNL being organized at BSNL Corporate office here during 10-11 May, 2018.

“Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) has many bigger opportunities in near future other than mobile telephony.  Many tenders have been finalized for 2G, 3G and 4G services. Market share of BSNL has been improved from 7.6% to 9.43% which is commendable. BSNL can play significant role in Smart City projects, NFS and FTTH. Works worth Rs 150 Crore has been allotted to BSNL under smart city projects, which can be taken as an advantage”, the Minister added.

While addressing the function, Ms. Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary, Telecom underlined the need of BSNL to be aggressive and innovative.  BSNL is a key partner in BharatNet implementation and has increased market share as well.  Smart thinking and smart implementation at this stage will be an edge for BSNL, Ms Sundararajan added 

        We have deliberately re-named the National Telecom Policy as National Digital Communication Policy (NDCP) 2018 which aims to provide Broadband for All.  The objective is that every citizen of India must have broadband of 10mbps speed by 2022. We are also organizing workshops with States to aggressively drive that and make sure that by 2022, broadband becomes available to all, Ms Sundararajan said.

        BSNL has a clear lead and advantage. While we realize the target of installing five million wifi hotspots by 2020 and 10 million hotspots by 2022, as mentioned in the draft NDCP 2018. 50% of household in India will have FTTH, Ms Sundararajan said.     

Addressing the Conference, Shri AnupamShrivastava, CMD BSNL said that there is tough competition in the telecom scenario these days. Even in this turbulent times BSNL could not only face the competition head on by matching tariff by tariff and even at times proactively coming up with bold, innovative, unlimited data and voice plans. This has helped BSNL to increase its market share as well as remain MNP positive.

The Conference was attended by the Board of Directors and Heads of BSNL Telecom Circles.

                Telecom Commission has approved almost all the TRAI’s Recommendation on In-flight Connectivity in its meeting on 1st May 2018. With this, the airlines and the TSPs can offer voice and data services in India Airspace once an aircraft reaches an altitude of 3000 metres. It is expected that it will take 3 to 4 months to operationalise the service.

In line with earlier decision of Committee of Secretaries, In-Flight voice and data services shall be provided through Indian Satellites or through satellites approved by Department of Space for communication purposes, with gateways in India.

A separate category of licensee called In-Flight Connectivity Provider shall be created with a token license fee of Re. 1. Such facilityof voice and data connectivity shall also be extended to ships and other moving vehicles (Earth Stations in Motion).

                Shri Ram Vilas Paswan, Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution asserted that foodgrain at subsidized prices is  being allocated for welfare and development of weaker sections of  society to ensure adequate standards of nutrition in Welfare Institutions and SC/ST/OBC Hostels. Shri Paswan chaired the meeting of Food Secretaries of States/UTs to discuss execution of Welfare Institutions  and Hostels Schemes today in New Delhi. 

 

Shri Paswan stated that Government of India has revamped its scheme for additional allocation of foodgrain to ensure adequate standards of nutrition in such institutions with a view to meet the requirement of Welfare Institutions such as Beggar Homes, Nari-niketans and other similar welfare institutions sponsored by State Governments/UT Administrations, that are not covered under Targeted Public Distribution System or under any other Welfare Scheme; and also for residents of SC/ST/OBC Hostels.

 

Shri Paswan informed that as per the schematic guidelines, the hostels with atleast 2/3rd of the resident students belonging to SC/ST/OBC community are eligible to get subsidized foodgrain for all the resident students, including those who belong to other categories.  The Central Issue Price of foodgrain under the scheme is fixed at BPL rates.

 

The Food Minister further stated that the scale of issue of wheat and rice (ratio to be decided on the basis of food habits in different areas) is as per the nutrition requirement of the residents, subject to a maximum of 15 kg per resident per month.  

 

The details of the scheme are available at this Department’s website (http://dfpd.nic.in/1sGbO2W68mUlunCgKmpnLF5WHm/newpolicy-070917.pdf)

                Shri Ram Vilas Paswan, the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution launched the 'Handbook for Implementation of Cash Transfer of Food Subsidy' in New Delhi today. The handbook has been jointly developed by Department of Food and Public Distribution (DoFPD) and World Food Programme (WFP).

 

The handbook is a step by step guide for implementation of cash transfer of food subsidy scheme and is based on India's rules, regulations and experience in cash transfers of food subsidy, and WFP's global experience in cash based transfer. Shri C.R Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Secretary DoFPD, Shri Ravikant and Dr. Hameed Nuru, Country Director WFP, were also present during the launch.

 

Shri Ram Vilas Paswan complemented the efforts of the DoFPD and WFP for preparation of the handbook. Shri Paswan hoped that it will serve as a guide to all states/union territories that are implementing or planning to implement cash transfers for food subsidy, as it details out the prerequisites, processes, and roles and responsibilities of all stakeholder involved in the cash transfer process. Union Minister said that the implementation of cash transfer of food subsidy scheme is one of the important initiatives of this government for ensuring targeted delivery of benefits. He further added this handbook will help in easy understanding of the overall systems and the entire process flow, which would contribute greatly towards the easy adoption and success of cash transfers of food subsidy in India.

 

Shri Paswan also highlighted the reform measures implemented by his government to check leakages and diversions of foodgrains in the ""in-kind"" distribution of food grains, through end-to-end computerisations of PDS operations. In this regards he especially highlighted installation of ePoS devices at fair price shops for biometric authentication of beneficiaries and electronic capturing of transactions.

 

At the launch, Dr. Hameed Nuru, Country Director WFP said, ""It is indeed in-line with the vision and aspirations of the nation, that WFP is supporting the Government of India. WFP has been working with the government at national and state level in the implementation of the NFSA, and is proud to be a partner of the government in its efforts towards food security and achieving of SDG 2 goals.""

 

Currently, Cash Transfer of Food Subsidy is being implemented in union territories of Chandigarh, Puducherry and urban areas of Dadra & Nagar Haveli while some more states have shown interest in implementation.

                1.         Due to higher sugar production against the estimated consumption during the current sugar season 2017-18, the domestic sugar prices have remained depressed since the commencement of the season. As a result, accumulated dues of farmers have reached to over Rs.20,000 crores.

2.         In order to stabilize sugar prices at reasonable level and to improve liquidity position of mills thereby enabling them to clear cane price dues of farmers, Government has taken following steps in past three months:

(a)      Increased customs duty on import of sugar from 50% to 100%.

(b)      Imposed reverse stock holding limits on producers of sugar for the months of February and March, 2018 to stabilise sugar price.

(c)      Government has also fully withdrawn the customs duty on export of sugar to encourage sugar industry to start exploring possibility of export of sugar.

(d)      In view of the inventory levels with the sugar industry and to facilitate achievement of financial liquidity, mill-wise Minimum Indicative Export Quotas (MIEQ) totalling 20 Lakh MT have been fixed for sugar season 2017-18.

(e)      Further, to facilitate and incentivize export of surplus sugar by sugar mills, Government has allowed Duty Free Import Authorization (DFIA) Scheme in respect of sugar.

3.         In April, 2015, the cane price arrears of farmers reached to an alarming level of about Rs. 22,000 crores. The Central Government then notified, in December, 2015, a production subsidy scheme to offset the cost of cane to clear the dues of sugarcane farmers; a subsidy was provided @ Rs. 4.50/- per quintal of cane crushed.  As a result of this measure, the sugar prices stabilized and arrears were reduced substantially.

4.         In order to help sugar mills to clear cane dues of farmers, the Government has decided to provide financial assistance @ of Rs. 5.50 per quintal of cane crushed in sugar season 2017-18 to sugar mills to offset the cost of cane. The said assistance shall be paid directly to the farmers on behalf of the mills and be adjusted against the cane price payable due to the farmers against Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) including arrears relating to previous years. 

5.         Mills which fulfill the following conditions, will be eligible for the said assistance of Rs.5.50/qtl of cane crushed:

(a) Mills having ethanol production capacity and who have signed contracts with Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) for supply of ethanol, should have supplied at least 80% of indented quantity of ethanol under Ethanol Blended with Petrol Programme (EBP) to OMCs during 2017-18 ethanol season (December, 2017 – November, 2018).

(b) The mill should have filed updated online return in Proforma-II relating to data on crushing of cane, production of sugar, sale of sugar and by-products, etc as prescribed by Government under the provisions of Sugar (Control) Order, 1966.

(c) The mill should have fully complied with all the orders/directives of Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) to the sugar mills during 2017-18 sugar season.

6.         The said assistance of Rs.5.50/qtl of cane crushed will be provided on the basis of actual cane crushed or inter se allocation of earlier estimated 2800 LMT of cane to be crushed during 2017-18 sugar season, whichever is lower.

7.           The total assistance would be about Rs. 1540 crore which will directly benefit a large number of farmers and will help the sugar mills in a long way in discharging their liabilities on account of cane price dues of farmers.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to provide financial assistance @ of Rs. 5.50 per quintal of cane crushed in sugar season 2017-18 to sugar mills to offset the cost of cane, in order to help sugar mills to clear cane dues of farmers.

Details:


	The assistance shall be paid directly to the farmers on behalf of the mills.
	It will be adjusted against the cane price payable due to the farmers against Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) including arrears relating to previous years.  
	Subsequent balance if any, shall be credited into the mill’s account.  


          Assistance shall be provided to those mills which will fulfil the eligibility conditions as decided by the Government.

Background:

Due to higher sugar production against the estimated consumption during the current sugar season 2017-18, the domestic sugar prices have remained depressed since the commencement of the season. Due to depressed market sentiments and crash in sugar prices, the liquidity position of sugar mills has been adversely affected, leading to accumulation of cane price dues of farmers which have reached to more than Rs.19,000 crore. 

In order to stabilize sugar prices at reasonable level and to improve liquidity position of mills thereby enabling them to clear cane price dues of farmers, Government has taken following steps in past three months:


	Increased customs duty on import of sugar from 50% to 100% in the interest of farmers.
	Imposed reverse stock holding limits on producers of sugar for the months of February and March, 2018.
	Government has also fully withdrawn the customs duty on export of sugar to encourage sugar industry to start exploring possibility of export of sugar. 
	In view of the inventory levels with the sugar industry and to facilitate achievement of financial liquidity, mill-wise Minimum Indicative Export Quotas (MIEQ) have been fixed for sugar season 2017-18. Export Quotas of 20 Lakh tonnes of all grades of sugar; viz. raw, plantation white as well as refined, have been prorated amongst sugar factories by taking into account their average production of sugar achieved by the sugar mills during last two operational sugar seasons and the current season (up to February,2018). 
	Further, to facilitate and incentivize export of surplus sugar by sugar mills, Government has allowed Duty Free Import Authorization (DFIA) Scheme in respect of sugar.

                The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), in association with the three Insolvency Professional Agencies, namely, the Indian Institute of Insolvency Professionals of ICAI, the ICSI Institute of Insolvency Professionals, and the Insolvency Professional Agency of Institute of Cost Accountants of India, organised a Conclave of Insolvency Professionals yesterday in Mumbai. Over 250 Insolvency Professionals (IPs) participated in the Conclave. It was second such Conclave, the first one was organised on 10th February, 2018 in New Delhi.

Dr. M.S. Sahoo, Chairperson, IBBI in his address on “Building the Institution of Insolvency Professionals”emphasized that profession is a key institution of a market economy and the profession of IPs is a key institution of the insolvency and bankruptcy regime.For him, IPs are intellectual properties of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy regime and it is the endeavour of the IBBI to create, preserve and enhance the intellectual property of the regime. While appreciating the performance and conduct of IPs in general, he urged the IPs to collectively build and preserve the reputation of the fledgling institution and not allow a few undesirable elements to tarnish its reputation, as it is difficult to mend the reputation once it is lost. He believed that if the institution conducts well, its role and relevance would increase over time. The reverse can also happen. He stated that the institution of IPs needs to be robust and efficient to inspire the confidence of stakeholders. Given that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Reforms, which serves a very important cause of the nation, rests on the shoulders of the institution of IPs, the IPs need to have unwavering passion for their duty.

 Hon'ble Justice Mr. M. M. Kumar, President, National Company Law Tribunal, in his address on “Duties of Resolution Professional under the Code & Best Practices” highlighted the paradigm shift in law that segregates commercial aspects of insolvency resolution from judicial aspects and empowers the stakeholders and the adjudicating authority to decide matters within their respective domain expeditiously. The IPs act as the bridge between the adjudicating authority and the stakeholders and urged the IPs to guide the Committee of Creditors (CoC) in complying with the provisions of the Code, and to bring it up before the adjudicating authority wherever the CoC behaves contrary to the provisions of the Code.He advised the IPs not to introduce avoidable practices such as invitation of Expression of Interest which adds to cost and time without corresponding gains. Heemphasized that the intent of the law is to resolve the insolvency of a corporate debtor and the liquidation must be the last resort only after efforts to resolve has failed. He underlined that the assets of the corporate debtor undergoing resolution are assets of the nations and must continue to be used for creating value for the nation.He cited recent examples of successful resolutions that should motivate the IPs to realise the objectives of the Code. He urged the IPs to seize the opportunity under the Code to let them be used for the nation. He ended with a quote from George Bernard Shaw: “I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the community, and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work, the more I live. Life is no ‘brief candle’ to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for a moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to the future generations.” 

 Mr. Rashesh Shah, President, FICCI and Chairman, Edelweiss Group, in his address on ‘Insolvency Professional as Key Facilitator for Value Creation’ dwelled on the insolvency reforms in developed nations and believed that this reform would result in democratisation of credit in India that would fuel its growth further. He stated that in the first five years, the USA had witnessed 500 changes in law. He appreciated that Indian authorities are changing the law with alacrity to meet the emerging needs. He felt that this reform, along with other ongoing positive measures, would catapult the Indian economy to a $5 trillion economy by 2025, making it the third largest economy in the World, next only to the USA and China.This growth will provide a rare opportunity for IPs.He identified five pillars of an IP: transparency, knowledge, fairness, execution capability, and ability to balance the stakeholders. He ended his talk with a quote from European Bank for Reconstruction and Development: “Insolvency process cannot be imagined without the involvement of an IP who in many respects is the lynchpin of the process; the link between the court, creditors, and the debtor.”

Mr. B.S.V. Kumar, Hon’ble Judicial Member, NCLT; Mr. M.K. Shravat, Hon’ble Judicial Member, NCLT; and Dr. Navrang Saini, Whole Time Member, IBBI also addressed at the Conclave. 

The Conclave ended with the vote of thanks by Mr. Susanta Sahu, Chief Operations Officer of the Indian Institute of Insolvency Professionals of ICAI.

                The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code) is a modern economic legislation. Section 240 of the Code empowers the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) to make Regulations subject to the conditions that the Regulations: (a) carry-out the provisions of the Code, (b) are consistent with the Code and the Rules made thereunder; (c) are made by a notification published in the Official Gazette; and (d) are laid, as soon as possible, before each House of Parliament for 30 days. 

The IBBI has evolved a transparent and consultative process to make regulations. It has been the endeavour of the IBBI to effectively engage stakeholders in the regulation making process. The process generally starts with a working group making draft regulations. The IBBI puts these draft regulations out in public domain seeking comments thereon. It holds a few round tables to discuss draft regulations with the stakeholders. It takes the advice of its Advisory Committee. The process culminates with the Governing Board of the IBBI finalising Regulations and the IBBI notifies them. This process endeavours to factor in ground reality, secures ownership of Regulations and makes Regulations robust and precise, relevant to the time and for the purpose.   

Public consultation enables collective choice and hence plays an important role in evolution of regulatory framework. The participation of the public, particularly the stakeholders and the regulated, in the regulatory process ensures that the regulations are informed by the legitimate needs of those interested in and affected by regulations.

 

Usually, a regulator prepares draft regulations and presents these to the stakeholders to revalidate its understanding of the issues the said regulations seek to address, and the appropriateness of such regulations to address the issues. Based on the inputs from the stakeholders, the regulator finalises the Regulations with modifications, as may be warranted. The IBBI has been essentially following this approach and will continue to do so. 

Despite the best of efforts and intentions, a Regulator may not always have the understanding of the ground realities, as much and as early as the stakeholders and the regulated may have, particularly in a dynamic environment. The stakeholders could, therefore, play a more active role in making regulations. They may contemplate, at leisure, the important issues in the extant Regulatory Framework that hinder transactions and offer alternate solutions to address them, in addition to responding urgently to draft regulations proposed by the Regulator. This is akin to crowdsourcing of ideas. This would enable every idea to reach the regulator. Consequently, the universe of ideas available with the regulator would be much larger and the possibility of a more conducive Regulatory Framework much higher. 

Keeping in view the above, the IBBI invites comments from public, including the stakeholders and the regulated, on the Regulations already notified under the Code. The comments received between 30th April, 2018 and 31st December, 2018 shall be processed together and following the due process, Regulations will be amended to the extent considered necessary.  It will be the endeavour of the IBBI to notify modified Regulations by 31st March, 2019 and bring them into force on 1st April, 2019. A similar exercise was undertaken in the previous year and consequently several Regulations were amended with effect from 1st April, 2018. 

It is clarified that this is in addition to the extant approach of inviting public comments on Draft Regulations before notifying them.

Key discussions of the SCO meeting focused on achieving more in-depth and creative multilateral cultural cooperation and promoting regional cultural cooperation and mutual understanding of the people.

The Exhibition,marks an unprecedented collaboration in museum exhibition,  withthe British Museum, London; National Museum, New Delhi; and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS), Mumbai and is actively supported by the Culture Ministry.



 

The exhibition chronologically encapsulates the evolution of Indian civilization since antiquity and its interconnectedness with the outside world through a raft of exquisite artefacts from India and abroad.  ‘India and the World: A History in Nine Stories’ offers insights into two million years of history.  It was planned as part of commemoration of 70 years of India’s independence and a year of major cultural exchange between India and the UK (UK/India 2017). 



Shri Raidescribed the exhibition as a “journey through history”, taking Indians to “moments in history that are a matter of pride for us”.“This is also a celebration of cultural exchanges and a moment to remember that our civilization has existed for millions of years and what it has given to the world in terms of culture, science and spirituality,” he added.

Speaking at the event, National Museum Director General Dr. B R Mani, said “This is a phenomenal exhibition for the sheer number of artefacts, the profoundness of concept and the unprecedented extensive collaboration of Indian museums and private collections with the British Museum, London. It truly offers a brilliant exposition on the splendid Indian civilisation and its impact on the global civilizations of the yore,”



Dr. Hartwig Fischer, Director, British Museum, said it is a first of its kind project that establishes a dialogue between objects, cultures, institutions and the public to provide a new and rich perspective on moments in Indian history. 

Present at the occasion, Mr. Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Director General, CSMVS, said, “The exhibition is a first of its kind experiment outside the US, the UK and European borders, and attempts to provide a model for museums to share their collections with people across the world, some of whom may otherwise never have access to them. The objects from the British Museum and from Indian museums and private collectors, together in conversation, unlock fascinating stories and histories, and help us understand how we relate to the wider world.""

Unveiling a special postal cover brought out by the Department of Post, Shri L.N. Sharma said the exhibition  showcases Indian history from two million years ago to the present day, not just displaying the regional connects but global links  that provide visitors with a lifetime opportunity and a great learning experience.

A special feature added to this significant exhibition includes the brail tactile feature of some of the displayed objects for those visually challenged visitors who may like to know and feel the beauty of the objects. It was collaborated with Access for ALL, DAG and Radio Mirchi in creating an apparatus to understand the various aspects of the exhibition through multiple senses. Another important feature to this exhibition is the installed tactile paintings and 3 D models which leads to a wide range of interaction with the object on display, thus making it universal to a large section of the society.

The Exhibition willrun for  two monthstill June 30 and is available for public viewing on all days from 10 am to 6 pm, except on Mondays and public holidays. There will also be theatre workshops, guided tours, thematic walks for kids and interesting events like treasure hunt and online weekly quiz on the event’s website (https://www.indiaandtheworld.org).

                The  Minister of State for Culture(I/c) and Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma  will inaugurate in New Delhi tomorrow the Exhibition  ‘India and the World: A History in Nine Stories’ -an extensively collaborative effort of the British Museum, London; National Museum, New Delhi; and ChhatrapatiShivajiMaharajVastuSangrahalaya (CSMVS), Mumbai  with the active support of the Culture Ministry. The  Exhibition will be inaugurated at 5.00 PM, at the National Museum auditorium, New Delhi.

The exhibition chronologically encapsulates the evolution of Indian civilization since antiquity and its interconnectedness with the outside world through a raft of exquisite artefacts from India and abroad.  ‘India and the World: A History in Nine Stories’ offers insights into two million years of history.  It was planned as part of commemoration of 70 years of India’s independence and a year of major cultural exchange between India and the UK (UK/India 2017). 

Over 200 objects from British Museum, London and 20 museums and private collections from India are on display.Major lenders to the Exhibition are The British Museum, ChhatrapatiShivajiMaharajVastuSangrahalay, Mumbai, ASI, Aurangabad Circle, ASI, Kolkata Circle, Central Antiquity Collection, PuranaQilla, New Delhi, MumtazMahal Museum, Red Fort, New Delhi, QutbMinar, New Delhi, Crafts Museum, New Delhi, Indian Museum, Kolkata, Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata, Bihar  Museum, Patna, Department of Museums and Archaeology, Government of Telangana, Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Haryana, Government Museum & Art Gallery, Chandigarh, India International Centre, New Delhi, Alkazi Foundation for the Arts, New Delhi, Basilica of Bom Jesus, Goa, Mani Bhavan Gandhi Sangrahalaya, Mumbai, Naman P. Ahuja, New Delhi, Sharma Centre for Heritage Education, Chennai, Museum of Christian Art, Goa, Raqs Media Collective, New Delhi, Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge. 

Conceived over a period of two years of intense planning and curatorial brainstorming, ‘India and the World’ has been jointly curated by a team in the UK and India. The Exhibition has been conceptualised by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Director General, CSMVS. Curators Jeremy David Hill and Beatriz Cifuentes Feliciano, from the British Museum, joined efforts with Naman P Ahuja, Associate Professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi and his curatorial assistant, AvaniSood to develop this unique exhibition

The exhibition is spread over nine sections, each representing a pivotal moment in history: Shared Beginnings (1,700,000 years ago to 2000 BC), First Cities (3000–1000 BC), Empire (600 BC – AD 200), State and Faith (AD 100–750), Picturing the Divine (AD 200–1500), Indian Ocean Traders (AD 200-1650), Court Cultures (AD 1500–1800), Quest for Freedom (1800–Present), and Time Unbound. 

Beginning with the Indus Valley Civilisation and coming down to the present, the artefacts range from stone sculptures, terracotta, coins, tools, inscriptions and manuscripts to textiles, jewellery, Mughal miniatures and contemporary paintings, demonstrating the common threads of human history.

A striking feature of the show is not only its linear and chronological depiction of Indian civilization, but also its exploration of ideas across time periods, and a profound insight into confluence of the ancient and the modern. Essentially, it highlights the strong connections India has shared historically with the rest of theworld, impacting each other through a gamut of activities that helped evolve a global culture.   

The nine-gallery exhibition is staggering in several respects: in the number of rare objects that it brings together, the time period and styles that it covers, the exquisiteness of each object and the rich stories that it tells us about our ancestors. Overall, there are 104 important works of art from the Indian subcontinent in dialogue with 124 iconic pieces from the British Museum.  

Curatorial walks and talks, besides educational activities like stone tool, Harappan seal and bead making, currency design, scroll painting, clay moulding, blindfold photography and sculpture making will be held on the sidelines of the event. In addition, there will be theatre workshops, guided tours, thematic walks for kids and interesting events like treasure hunt and online weekly quiz on the event’s website (https://www.indiaandtheworld.org). 

The Exhibition, is travelling to the national capital from Mumbai andis supported by the Ministry of Culture, Tata Trusts, the Getty Foundation and the Newton Bhabha Fund.  It  will run for two months till June 30 and is available for public viewing on all days from 10 am to 6 pm, except on Mondays and public holidays.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, chaired the first meeting of the National Committee for the Commemoration of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (May 2, 2018). The Committee has a total of 125 members, including 116 from India and encompasses the President (as chair), the Vice-President, Prime Minister, Union Ministers, former Prime Ministers, Chief Ministers, senior MPs and political leaders from across party lines, and eminent Gandhians, social thinkers and activists representing a cross-section of Indian society and regional diversity. The Committee also has nine international members, including two former Secretaries General of the United Nations – Mr Kofi Annan and Mr Ban Ki-moon – and Nobel laureates Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and former US Vice-President Al Gore. Today’s meeting was attended by 82 members of the Committee, including two from abroad. [Lists of Committee members and of those who attended are attached.

The meeting began with introductory remarks by the Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh, who said that the focus of the Commemoration should be to present Gandhian values and principles both to the people and through the people in a contemporary idiom. He then invited the President of India to address the meeting.

In his speech, President Kovind stressed that Mahatma Gandhi does not belong to India alone. He remains one of India’s greatest gifts to humankind and his name finds resonance across the continents. Mahatma Gandhi was the most influential Indian of the 20th century. He was the inspiration for our largely non-violent, inclusive and democratic freedom struggle. He remains the ethical benchmark against which we test public men and women, political ideas and government policies, and the hopes and wishes of our country and our people. His legacy is so rich and so wide that we cannot do justice to it if we were to meet for a few days, let alone a few hours.

The President said that the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi is more than a celebration of a great life and a remembrance of history. Gandhiji himself would have wanted it to be a moment of renewal, of making a fresh commitment to the goals of a just, honest and fair society – at home and abroad. The Mahatma is our past, he is our present and he is also our future. So many of the themes and ideas he spoke and wrote of – some of them far ahead of their time – are even more relevant today.The President said that when we work for an India free of caste and religious prejudice, we invoke Gandhiji. When we strive towards Swachh Bharat, and a cleaner and more hygienic India, we invoke Gandhiji. When we speak of the rights of women and children and of civil liberties of small and disadvantaged groups, we invoke Gandhiji. When we talk of the health and well-being of the Indian farmer and the Indian village, we invoke Gandhiji. When we strive for energy access for the last village and the last home, we invoke Gandhiji. When we build capacities in solar and renewable energy, we invoke Gandhiji. When we battle climate change and promote green, eco-friendly living, we invoke Gandhiji. And what is sustainable development if not an expansion of Gandhiji’s simple mantra: “The earth has enough for everyone’s need but not for everyone’s greed.”

 

The President said that it is for this reason that the 150th Birth Anniversary Commemoration has world-wide meaning. Let us elevate this to a global celebration, using platforms such as the United Nations and other multilateral organisations. The focus should not just be on events, but on tangible, actionable legacies that will make a difference to the lives of ordinary people – wherever they may be.

The President then called upon those present to share their ideas and suggestions on how we may commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

Following the President’s address, several Committee members, including Union Ministers, Chief Ministers and others, made suggestions on how the Commemoration – which will run from October 2, 2018 to October 2, 2020 – could be planned. Suggestions ranged from welfare programmes and specific measures to help farmers, to travelling exhibitions and creating infrastructure and linkages in specific locations and states associated with Mahatma Gandhi.

Since it would not be feasible for the entire National Committee to be convened frequently, the meeting resolved to set up a smaller Executive Committee, headed by the Prime Minister, to take forward the commemoration of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.

Encapsulating the sense of the meeting, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, thanked various members of the Committee for their constructive suggestions and recommendations. He said it is important that this occasion be celebrated in a manner that ensures Mahatma Gandhi continues to be an inspiration for future generations. Globally as well, this occasion should serve to increase awareness about Gandhiji, he said.

The Prime Minister stressed that all programmes associated with this celebration should be designed around the theme of “Karyanjali” - or “Gandhi in action”. He expressed happiness that the suggestions received today were mostly action-oriented. The Prime Minister said that Mahatma Gandhi and his teachings are timeless. He said that Mahatma Gandhi can become a mechanism for people around the world to understand India. He felt that solutions to several contemporary problems could be found by following the path shown by Mahatma Gandhi.

The Prime Minister emphasised the need to use technology in the celebrations, so that the whole world can take note and participate. He called for the celebrations to move beyond government events and take the shape of a mass movement - or Jan Bhagidaari. He also urged all state governments to have similar consultations and draw plans at the state level.

                A misleading news item has appeared today (31.05.2018) in Indian Express alleging kickbacks to Indian Govt. officials through Global Marketing SP Ltd. in the contract for spares for AN-32 Aircraft.  

It is informed that MoD or IAF has neither interacted nor signed any agreement with Global Marketing SP Ltd., nor were any such agreements witnessed. IAF has also confirmed that Global Marketing SP Ltd. has not participated in any of the meetings held towards finalization of the contract dated 26.11.2014 with STE Ukraine.

Embassy of Ukraine in India had sent a request to MHA and MEA, Govt. of India dated 06.03.2018 for legal assistance in investigation of a criminal case filed against officials of Ukraine Government’s State Owned Enterprise (STE).  This is as per international treaty between India and Ukraine.  This request contains a list of questions to be answered.  There are no allegations against any Indian Govt. official.  Government of India has only been requested to render legal assistance.

The heptr filled water from Yamuna reservoir and dropped over the site. This had to be repeated thrice to contain the fire. This was the first time the Bambi ops was done in an urban situation wherein the nitty gritties of drop are very precise owing to high rises around and chances of collateral damage. The operations started this morning wherein helicopter flown by Wing Commander Pradeep Bhola of the Mighty Armourswas successful in dousing the fire.

A total of approx 8000 lts of water was dropped in this incident.

                The existing Hotline mechanism was initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO at 1800 hours (IST). Both the DGsMO reviewed the prevailing situation along the Line of Control and International Border in J&K. Indian Army DGMO agreed with the proposal to undertake sincere measures to improve the existing situation to ensure peace and avoidance of hardships to the civilians along the borders.

Both the DGsMO agreed to fully implement the Ceasefire Understanding of 2003 in letter and spirit forthwith and to ensure that henceforth, the Ceasefire will not be violated by both sides. It was also mutually agreed that in case of any issue, restraint will be exercised and the matter will be resolved through utilisation of existing mechanisms of Hotline Contacts and Border Flag Meetings at Local Commanders’ Level.

                The Cantonments came up during the British era and were exclusive areas where service personnel and their families resided.  Over the years, cities have expanded and a large number of civilians now reside in close proximity of the Cantonments.  Some of these civilians provide essential services to military personnel and their families, while others find the environs of military areas conducive to settle down.  Whilst the passage through Cantonments to civilians who give support to military personnel is provided for mutual benefit, the others who are denied the passage feel aggrieved.  The latter have often raised the issue of closure of roads through Cantonments which facilitates access to their residential areas.  

 

            Some good public schools and Army Public School also exist in Cantonments.  Children from civilian background are studying in these schools and cannot be denied access. Hence, a large number of roads have remained open to civilian traffic, even before the orders for opening other roads were promulgated. Therefore, access to additional areas within Cantonments has now been allowed.

 

            Some roads were unilaterally kept closed for very long periods and a review was essential.  A number of iterations were carried out with all stake holders where views expressed by all concerned were deliberated upon.  After giving due thought to the likely implications on the opening of roads, a considered decision was taken to open roads in military areas for one month and thereafter review the nature of traffic passing through these areas.  Decision on opening or closure of roads will be taken after a feedback from Local Military Authorities (LMA) on whether roads can be opened for civil traffic, completely, selectively or as in the past.

 

            There seems to be some apprehension in the minds of military personnel and their families that the opening of roads may lead to a security situation or traffic congestion.  It is clarified that this is a deliberate, calibrated and monitored exercise.  The aim of opening roads in Cantonments is to streamline the process of closure where required after carrying out assessment of the nature of traffic moving through Cantonments by following due procedure.  A freehand has been given to the LMA to close and control access to the Cantonments when there is actionable intelligence input or in case of emergencies.  A simplified procedure will shortly be issued to jointly address the needs of the local public and the military establishment.

                The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, met here today and accorded approval for the procurement of equipment for the Defence Forces valued at over Rs. 6900 crore.

In a major boost to indigenisation and in realisation of India’s growing technological prowess, the DAC approved procurement of Thermal Imaging (TI) Night Sights for the Rocket Launcher (RL) used by the Army and the Air Force under ‘BUY(Indian) IDDM’ category through established Indian Vendors. The TI sight for 84mm RL will be used by troops in operations to facilitate accurate and continuous engagement of moving and static enemy targets and destruction of field fortifications (bunkers) during hours of complete darkness. The sight will enable own troops to detect and recognize enemy tanks and soldiers’ movement during night and engage them with greater efficiency. Furthermore, the effect of camouflage and concealment will be drastically reduced as RL detachments will be able to ascertain location of enemy taking cover behind foliage and thin walled constructions with greater ease.  

The DAC also accorded approval for undertaking Design and Development of the Long Range Dual Band Infrared Imaging Search and Track System (IRST) for SU-30 MKI aircraft under ‘Make II’ sub category and subsequently, for procurement of at least 100 IRSTs under ‘Buy (Indian–IDDM) category.  The system will be able to operate in day and night conditions and will substantially enhance the capabilities of the aircraft.

            With the above approvals, in the last eight months alone, the DAC has pursued modernisation of the Armed Forces with greater vigour and has accorded major thrust on indigenisation. Approvals for procurement of equipment valued at approx Rs 43,844 crore, have been accorded, of which, Rs 32,253 crore would be Made-in-India, through the indigenous route.

                Vice Admiral GS Pabby, AVSM, VSM, Chief of Materiel commissioned IN LCU L54 into the Indian Navy today at Port Blair. IN LCU L54 is the fourth Landing Craft Utility (LCU) Mk-IV class to be inducted into the Indian Navy. The ship has been indigenously designed and built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers, Kolkata. The Commissioning of L-54 is yet another manifestation of the country’s indigenous design and ship building capability. 

LCU MK-IV ship is an amphibious ship with its primary role being transportation and deployment of Main Battle Tanks, Armoured Vehicles, troops and equipment from ship to shore. These ships based at the Andaman and Nicobar Command, can be deployed for multirole activities like beaching operations, search and rescue, disaster relief operations, supply and replenishment and evacuation from distant islands.

The ship, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Munish Sethi, has a complement of 05 officers, 41 sailors and is capable of carrying 160 troops in addition. The ship, displacing 830 Tons, is capable of transporting various kinds of combat equipment such as the Main Battle Tank, T72 and other vehicles. The ship is fitted with state-of-the-art equipment and advanced systems like Integrated Bridge System (IBS) and Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS).

The remaining four ships of the same class are in advanced stages of construction at M/S GRSE, Kolkata and are scheduled to be inducted over the next year and a half. The induction of these ships will contribute to the nation’s maritime security needs and is in consonance with the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s drive for ‘Make in India’.

                IAF has pressed into service its MLH class helicopter using Bambi Buckets, to contain the forest fire at Katra. The operations stared this morning wherein two helicopters, one each of the Daring Dragons and of Snow Leopards units, of the Western Air Command were launched. The heptrs filled in water from the Reasi water reservoir in the specially built Bambi Buckets which can carry approximately 2500 ltrs of water at a time.

The first drop was done in the area of the new track from Ardhkuwari to Bhawan. “Itswas a daunting task keeping in mind the challenging terrain and high tension cables in the area” said the captain of the lead aircraft Wing Commander Vikram. 

Operation of these types requires special skills by the pilot who flies with a very heavy load underslung. “We trained to respond to these types of situations whenever demanded. The operations are scheduled to continue through the day till the fire is contained” said Wing Commander Rahul the captain of the second aircraft.

A reccee of the area was carried out yesterday to ascertain the complexities of the operations.

                BrahMos, supersonic cruise missile was successfully test fired at 1145 hours today from the Integrated Test Range (ITR), Balasore, Odisha. The missile was launched from a Mobile Autonomous Launcher (MAL) and successfully flew in its pre-set trajectory fulfilling its mission objectives.

In today’s launch the major subsystems manufactured indigenously under “Make in India” campaign were tested. “Through this launch the critical indigenous components including fuel management system and other non-metallic airframe components have qualified to form part of the missile” said DG (BrahMos) & CEO & MD, BrahMos, Dr Sudhir Mishra after witnessing the launch. 

SA to RM & DG (Missiles & Strategic Systems) Dr G Satheesh Reddy congratulated the Scientists for successfully developing the multiple sections of BrahMos and proving them in the mission.

Chairman DRDO & Secretary Department of Defence R&D Dr S Christopher congratulated Team DRDO and BrahMos on the successive successful flight test and said that a major milestone has been achieved in the indigenisation of BrahMos.

BrahMos is a joint venture between DRDO of India and NPOM of Russia. The highly versatile BrahMos has been operationalised in the Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Air Force. 

BRAHMOS has established itself as a major force multiplier in modern-day complex battlefields with its impeccable land-attack, anti-ship capabilities with multi-role and multi-platform abilities.

                The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, met here today.

In continuation of its efforts to streamline defence procurement procedures and to reduce timelines so as to ensure timely delivery of equipment to the Armed Forces, the DAC discussed and approved various measures to simplify the defence procurement procedure. These measures will be incorporated in the DPP-16, the manual governing the defence procurement procedure. The significant changes inter-alia include devolution of powers within the Ministry of Defence and the Service Headquarters, concurrent running of the acquisition process instead of sequential stage clearance, deletion of repetitive processes, aligning of various documents with revised financial guidelines, amongst others. These measures will go a long way in obviating undue procedural delays and will hasten activities besides shrinking procurement timelines.  

These amendments form part of the ongoing Business Process Re-engineering in Defence Capital procurements.

The AI Task Force of Ministry of Defence under the Chairmanship Shri C Chandrasekharan, Chairman of Tata Sons, has met twice on 10 February and 28 April 2018. In the last meeting it was discussed that one of the key approach for the use of AI is to work on building profile that mimics normal behaviour by learning from the data generated from a given use case. Then using machine learning/ deep learning techniques, one can draw correlations among various parameters in an automated way (from the huge data set) and can flag pattern and anomalous behaviour for further analysis and insights. This essentially forms the basis for AI based applications. Thus, it was decided that a Stakeholders’ Workshop on AI in National Security and Defence shall be organized for ‘Listing of Use Cases.

                Indian Naval Sailing Vessel Tarini (INSV Tarini) entered Goa harbour and came alongside the INS Mandovi jetty on completion of a historic global circumnavigation voyage on 21 May 18. The all-women crew of Tarini was received at the jetty by Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri who had also flagged them off on 10 Sep last year. Admiral Sunil Lanba, Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral AR Karve, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Naval Command, senior officers and enthusiastic members from the naval community both serving and retired, as well as civilians were present at the Naval Boat Pool to welcome INSV Tarini .

            It was a poignant moment for the “Navika Sagar Parikrama” team which included a number of naval personnel who worked behind the scenes from the time of origination of the idea of circumnavigation by an all women crew, right through the planning, implementation and training till the successful execution of the voyage. The women crew themselves were ecstatic on completion of the voyage. Speaking at the occasion, the Skipper Lt Commander Vartika Joshi said, “We knew at the very start of this voyage that we had a daunting task ahead. However, the many challenges we encountered brought in a new found strength from within, which we ourselves never knew we were capable of. Our close bonding helped us overcome those difficult times.” It was also a time for happy reunion of the crew with their families after a period of over eight and half months. 

This is the first-ever Indian circumnavigation of the globe by an all-women crew. The vessel was skippered by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi, and the crew comprised Lieutenant Commanders Pratibha Jamwal, P Swathi, and Lieutenants S Vijaya Devi, B Aishwarya and Payal Gupta. 

Speaking at the occasion, the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri, Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman said that she is extremely honoured and feels humbled before the crew of team Tarini for what they have achieved. She further added that “it’s not the girls achieving, it’s the youngsters from India achieving. The women of this country have shown that it is possible for the youngsters, if they want to do something, that they can indeed do it, by showing commitment, grit and dedication”.

During his address Admiral Sunil Lanba Chief of the Naval Staff said, “The grit and determination displayed by these young women officers would definitely encourage future generations to take on daunting challenges and strive for success”.

During her 254 day long voyage, the vessel has covered over 22,000 Nautical miles, visiting five countries – Australia, New Zealand, Falkland Islands (UK), South Africa and Mauritius. At each of these countries the crew received a rousing welcome both from the Indian diaspora as also from the local community. During the course of her voyage, the vessel has met all criteria of circumnavigation, viz. crossing the Equator twice, crossing all Longitudes, as also the three great capes (Cape Leeuwin, Cape Horn and Cape of Good Hope). The expedition was covered in six legs, with halts at 5 ports: Fremantle (Australia), Lyttleton (New Zealand), Port Stanley (Falklands), Cape Town (South Africa) and Port Louis (Mauritius). 

 The crew and the vessel encountered rough seas on numerous occasions during the voyage. The extremely cold climate coupled with stormy weather conditions especially in the Southern Ocean made the task of circumnavigating the globe highly daunting and challenging. The vessel also witnessed winds in excess of 60 knots and waves up to 7 meters high, whilst crossing the Pacific Ocean.  

The indigenously-built INSV Tarini is a 56-foot sailing vessel, which was inducted in the Indian Navy in February 2017, and has showcased the ‘Make in India’ initiative on the International forum.

The expedition titled ‘Navika Sagar Parikrama’ is in consonance with the National policy to empower women to attain their full potential. It has showcased ‘Nari Shakti’ on the world platform and helped change societal attitudes and mindset towards women in India by raising visibility of their participation in challenging environs.  

The crew also collated and updated meteorological, ocean and wave data on a regular basis for accurate weather forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD), as also monitored and reported marine pollution on the high seas. They interacted extensively with the local populace, especially children, during the port halts to promote Ocean sailing and the spirit of adventure. 

A senior naval officer said, “The women officers have done the country proud not only in showing the Indian Flag at distant shores but also in demonstrating the sea faring capability of Indian women.”           

The women officers will be proceeding to New Delhi shortly, where they will meet the Hon’ble Prime Minister.

	All closed roads in the Cantonments to be reopened immediately.
	The issue of closure of individual roads will be reviewed de novo, in conformity with the provisions as laid down, and any closure of roads to be undertaken, will be done only after following the due procedure.
	A simplified detailed SOP will shortly be issued to jointly address the needs of the local public and the military establishment.


 

All other issues raised in the meeting dated 04 May 2018, were deliberated in detail and a time bound action plan is being prepared in consultation with all stakeholders.

                As part of ongoing operational deployment of the Indian Navy’s Eastern Fleet ships to South East Asia and North West Pacific region, three Indian Naval Ships Sahyadri, Shakti and Kamorta under the command of Rear Admiral Dinesh Kumar Tripathi, Flag Officer Commanding, Eastern Fleet shall be making a port call at Tien Sa Port, Danang from 21-25 May 2018.  

During the visit, there would be professional interaction between personnel of both the navies, official calls and interaction with dignitaries of the Vietnamese Government. Visits by local populace, guided tours for Indian Naval personnel, sports events and a band concert by Indian Navy band is also planned.  On completion of the harbour phase, both Indian Navy and Vietnam Peoples’ Navy would be undertaking an exercise. 

Bilateral relations between India and Vietnam are characterised by strong bonds of friendship based on cultural, religious and economic ties dating back to 2nd Century AD. The influence of Indian civilisation speaks of the deep rooted historical linkages between the two nations. India-Vietnam relations have been strengthened in recent years due to a vibrant economic relationship and growing convergence on security issues. In 2016, during the official visit of Indian Prime Minister, Mr Narendra Modi to Vietnam, the relations between the two countries were elevated to the level of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.  Visit by Prime Minister of Vietnam, HE Mr Nguyen Xuan Phuc to India in January this year as a guest for the Republic Day and for the ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit and a State visit by the President of Vietnam, HE Mr Tran Dai Quang in March 2018 signify momentum of the bilateral relationship.  

Strong defence cooperation is a vital component of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two countries.  The Indian Defence Minister is scheduled to visit Vietnam in June this year and the Chief of General Staff of Vietnam People's Army and the Commander-in Chief of Vietnam People's Navy are scheduled to visit India later this year.  

The Indian Navy has had extensive interactions with Vietnam People’s Navy, particularly in the field of training, repairs, maintenance and logistics support aimed at capacity building. The last visit by Indian Navy ship to Vietnam was in Sep 2017, when two of its  ships INS Satpura and INS Kadmatt visited Hai Phong port. The current visit seeks to enhance maritime cooperation between the two Navies and will further bolster the strong bonds of friendship between the two countries and contribute to security and stability in the region and the world at large.

                Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman gave away the DRDO Awards- 2016 & 2017 to various DRDO scientists for their outstanding contributions, while commemorating the National Technology Day, here today.  Some of the prominent scientists, who received the award, include former Secretary Department of Defence R&D, Scientific Advisor to Raksha Mantri and Director General, DRDO Dr VKSaraswat for DRDO Lifetime Achievement Award – 2017, former Secretary Department of Defence R&D, Scientific Advisor to Raksha Mantri and Director General, DRDO Dr VasudevKalkunteAatre for DRDO Lifetime Achievement Award – 2016, the Scientific Advisor to Raksha Mantri, Distinguished Scientist & Director General (Missiles & Strategic Systems) Dr G Satheesh Reddy for Technology Leadership Award – 2016, etc.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Smt Sitharaman said India being one of the largest procurer of defence equipment, the emphasis on indigenisation has to be reiterated, which has happened in the last four years. She stated that if India were to be a manufacturing hub for Defence products, indigenization has got to be on the top of the agenda. She said that manufacturing cannot be continuously and constantly with borrowed technology and hence that is where DRDO’s Research & Development plays a very critical role. 

 

The Raksha Mantri congratulated all the scientists who received the awards and wished them a great bright future. She also wished the organisation and all its scientists the very best. 

 

The Chairman DRDO and Secretary Department of Defence R&D, Dr S Christopher also addressed the function and e-launched the ‘Navrachna’ implementation programme during the event. It was attended by senior officials from the three Services, DRDO and the Ministry of Defence.

                Indian Army Women Officers’ Mountaineering Expedition to Mt. Bhagirathi-II (6512 metres) consisting of nine women officers, was flagged off by Director General of Military Training on 14 May 2018. The expedition will be conducted from 14 May to 11 Jun 18. The team also plans to set a new world record of practicing Yoga at 21000 ft on the occasion of Yoga Day 2018.

The expedition aims at encouraging women in the field of adventure where dauntless courage, will-power and determination is put to test. The Indian Army women officers are exploring their maximum potential in the field of adventure sports.

Mt. Bhagirathi-II is located in the Garhwal Himalayas in Gangotri National Park. The peak rises right above the Gangotri glacier which sets new challenges for the climbers. The summit is challenging owing to its technical requirements, vertical ascents, inclement and unpredictable weather conditions. It will be a true test of the climbers’ technical acumen in mountaineering, mental strength and physical courage.

                Furthering the Digital India-initiatives of Govt. of India, Principal Controller of Defence Accounts(Pensions), Allahabad has startedissuance of electronic-Pension Payment Orders (e-PPOs) to the pensioners along with their Pension Disbursement Agencies viz., Banks, Defence Pension Disbursement Offices, Post Offices, etc. What began in the first phase, for all Commissioned Officers and JCOs/ORs of Armed Forces from the month of October 2017, has now been extended to all defence pensioners including defence civilians.

 

Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (Pensions), Allahabad is the sole agency under Ministry of Defence which sanctions Pensions for the Defence Services viz., Army, Coast Guard, Defence Research and Development Organization,General Reserve Engineer Force, Border Roads Organization, Military Engineering Services and other Defence organisations including Defence Account Department and Defence Civilians.

           

The shift from manual system to e-PPO system is expected to minimize delays in pension disbursement and further revision as and when needed.  This initiative also eliminates the occurrence of human errors in data entry at multiple levels.

 

The next big step in this direction would be digitizing pension documents received from 46 record offices and more than 2900 Heads of Offices. This initiative by PCDA (P) will facilitate better implementation of OROP.

                Head Quarter Western Air Command, situated in Subroto Park, Delhi conducted a seminar on Humanitarian and Disaster relief(HADR) on 14 may 18. The seminar is being conducted to focus onto effective measures to deal with HADR situations in Northern region of India. Apart from the IAF participation, secretary level delegations from the states of Himanchal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttrakhand, Haryana, Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir are participating in the seminar. Major respondents to disaster situations like NDMA, NDRF and ITBP are also attending the seminar.  

 

In disaster situations, more often than not, the IAF is the first responder and kick starts the process of help to the affected population. To its credit, the IAF has not only national disaster relief operations like Op Madad – Chennai Cyclone, Op Rahat– UttrakhandFlash Floods, Op MeghRahat– Flood relief in J&K and relief operations at Andhra Pradesh during cyclone HUD HUD, it also has been carrying out relief actions in the international disaster situations like Evac of Indian Diaspora from Yemen, Op Maitri – earthquake relief at Nepal, cyclone relief at FIJI and flood relief in Sri Lanka. In most cases aircraft and personnel of Western Air Command have been the mainstay of these operations.

 

 

On the agenda are also discussions on National Perspective on Disaster Management & Capability Building and Enhancement of disaster relief for the attending states. Discussions on the response procedure using the IAF platforms would also be held at the seminar.

 

“I hope that by the end of the seminar we would have a clear understanding between all agencies involved in responding to a crisis situation at the earliest in an effective, efficient and economical manner. This would definitely reduce the loss of life and infrastructure during calamities” said the Senior Air Staff Officer of Western Air Command, Air Marshal NJS Dhillon AtiVishishtSeva Medal. 

 

 

 

HQ WAC has been conducting such seminars and demonstrations across its area of responsibility. The present high level seminar held at Subroto park, New Delhi culminates on 15 May 18.

                          General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Army Staff shall be visiting Sri Lanka from 14 to 17 May 2018 on an official visit. It shall be the first visit of General Bipin Rawat to Sri Lanka. During the visit, he is scheduled to meet the senior most political and military hierarchy of Sri Lanka.

         

          The visit assumes significance in light of India’s persistent efforts to strengthen the existing bonds of friendship and military cooperation based on mutual interests and understanding. Indian Army has been catering not only for varied training requirements of the Sri Lankan Army including imparting specific tailor-made training in different fields but also providing military hardware support. During the visit, the Chief of the Army Staff shall be inaugurating a communication Laboratory at School of Signals, Kandy, conceptualized and established by the Indian Army, to train the personnel of Sri Lanka Army Signal Corps. The Army Chief shall also be visiting the Sri Lanka Military Academy at Diyatalawa to exchange best practices related to pre-commissioning training being followed by the two armies.

         

          Apart from interaction with the senior leadership of the three Services, General Bipin Rawat shall also be meeting the Regional Military Commanders at Kandy and Trincomalee. The visit is yet another milestone in reaching out to our immediate neighborhood and take forward the military to military cooperation to the next level.

                Exercise Harimau Shakti 2018 between Indian and Malaysian Armies concluded with a Closing Ceremony at the tropical rainforests of Hulu Langat on 11 May 2018. The grand finale of the Exercise was a tactical operation on conduct of attack on enemy camp. 

 

The Closing Ceremony marked the successful conclusion of Exercise Harimau Shakti 2018. The event began with customary salute to Brigadier General Abdul Malik Bin Jiran, Commander 12 Infantry Brigade, followed by national anthem of both the nations. Exercise arm bands were taken off from the exercise appointments and the Regimental flag of GRENADIERS was handed back to Col SN Karthikeyan, CO 4 GRENADIERS by Lt Col Irwan Bin Ibrahim, CO 1 Royal Ranger Regiment symbolising the handing over of the troops back to the Indian Contingent Commander at the end of the Exercise.

                                                                                  

In his closing address, the Commander complimented the troops from both the contingents for their exemplary conduct, high morale and tactical acumen throughout the Exercise. He also remarked that the Contingents would have learned by sharing their knowledge and experiences. He also complimented the Indian contingent for assimilating and understanding the nuances of jungle operations as per Malaysian doctrine and fighting shoulder to shoulder with their Malaysian Counterparts. The ceremony came to a close with the war cries of both the contingent and customary recital of prayers by the Malaysian Army. 

 

His Excellency Shri Mridul Kumar, Indian High Commissioner to Malaysia, also visited the Exercise contingents at the Exercise area and complimented the troops on successful completion of the joint training exercise. He was highly appreciative of the high spirits and exemplary drills shown by the Contingents under challenging conditions and inclement weather. 

 

The professional acumen, operational abilities, battle drills and physical endurance displayed by the contingents over the last fortnight, were of extremely high standard and an apt reflection of the level of interoperability achieved during the Exercise. The contingents from Indian and Malaysian Armies have been able to share their experiences in counter insurgency operations and learn from each other. The future editions of Exercise Harimau Shakti will surely take this legacy forward and will ensure that the two nations continue to maintain close defence ties in ensuring peace and security in the region.

                In yet another first, the IAF successfully conducted its first online selection test for airmen from 03 to 06 May 18. Taking forward the Digital India Initiative of the Government of India, the first ever Scheduled Test for Airmen Recruitment (STAR) was conducted successfully through computer based online tests in collaboration with Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) Pune, a Government of India organisation functioning under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. This is the first instance of any of the three services undertaking selection tests online. This makes it easier for candidates across the country to appear for selection accommodating a wider choice of candidates, without having to apply an early filtration necessary in the earlier selection process.

 

A total of 409169 candidates had registered for the online STAR examination for Airmen. The online examination was successfully conducted at 439 centres spread over 102 cities across the country. This included over 100 centres in the North Eastern states, J&K and states which have limited representation in the IAF. Over 80% of the candidates were allotted centres of their first choice. 320678 candidates (78.37%) out of those who had registered appeared for the online test.

 

In the earlier manual pattern of tests, despite the IAF receiving over 4 lakh applications, owing to the limitations of testing capacity at the Airmen Selection Centres, only 80000 to 1 lakh candidates could be called to undergo the written test. Candidates were therefore screened out based on their Class 12 marks, thus denying opportunity to otherwise eligible candidates. In the online test format, all eligible candidates applying for STAR would be tested at examination centres closest to their place of residence. This would imply a near eight fold increase in the number of candidates who would be tested annually. The IAF stands to gain from the larger pool of candidates to choose from, while offering a level playing field to all eligible candidates.

 

The initiative is part of the Air Headquarters policy to reach out to the best talent to man and service the technology intensive platforms that equip the IAF. Apart from increased transparency and cost reduction, the initiative will help the IAF reach out to the youth in remote corners of the country and help them participate in the selection. Being the first of its kind initiative, the conduct of the examination was closely monitored by the highest echelons of Air Headquarters and Command Headquarters. Hon’ble Raksha Mantri and Chief of the Air Staff complimented the team involved in planning and executing the online tests in collaboration with CDAC, in ensuring that the entire process was executed without any glitch. It is a major milestone that would set a new benchmark for providing a fair opportunity to deserving youth from the remote corners of the country to join the IAF.

                The first edition of this year’s Bi-annual Naval Commander’s Conference is scheduled from 08 to 11 May 18. During the conference, Navy will review its new Mission-Based Deployments philosophy aimed at ensuring peace and stability in the region. The new deployment philosophy, in furtherance of the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR), aims at sustained, peaceful and yet responsive presence of Indian Naval ships in critical areas and choke points. 

The Navy’s focus over the past year has been on Combat Efficiency and Materiel Readiness, and upkeep of its large fleet of 131 ships and submarines. Various measures taken to improve Combat Efficiency, including the new Transition Cycle for ships for transition from maintenance periods through a training phase and thereon to full scale operations will be examined at the conference. 

Measures to ensure safety, continued training, and checks and balances on crew proficiency on-board its frontline warships will also be reviewed. An overhaul of the training standards of units by revamping the ‘Ship Operating Standards (SHOPS)’ is also underway. The new SHOPS, set to be unveiled shortly, focuses on Role-based training in realistic scenarios and sets standards to be met by units as also targets individual crew proficiency levels. 

The Navy has been at the forefront in the absorption and exploitation of cutting-edge technology. Naval Commanders would deliberate upon steps to improve the Teeth-to-Tail ratio and explore niche fields such as Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics.  Harnessing cutting-edge technology, specifically those ‘Made-in-India’, to improve organisational effectiveness and efficiency would be another key focus area of the Commanders. 

Indian Navy has been the flag-bearer of the indigenisation and ‘Make in India’ initiative. 27 ships and submarines are currently under construction in Indian Shipyards, including the first indigenous Aircraft carrier ‘Vikrant’. The Navy promulgated the ‘Indian Naval Indigenisation Plan 2015-30’ which has laid down our plans for the next fifteen years. This allows for Industry to formulate strategies to meet the requirements of the Navy through the new Strategic Partnership Model, notified in May 17, as well as domestic R&D. These initiatives, which are aimed at enhancing indigenous defence industrial capability extending up to the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), shall also be discussed. 

The Commanders would also deliberate on the optimal utilisation of the Navy’s share of the defence budget through prioritising capital acquisitions and modernisation plans to bridge critical capability gaps. The four day conference would culminate on 11th May. 

The Naval Commander’s Conference would be addressed by the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri during the inaugural session followed by discussions with the officials of Ministry of Defence.

                            Late Marshal of the Indian Air Force Arjan Singh DFC was the first and the only ‘Five Star’ rank officer of the IAF and was a keen lover of the game of Hockey.  The IAF legend has always been an inspiration to the Air Warriors and lead from the front not only in the field of battle but also in sporting activities.  The first ‘Marshal Arjan Singh Memorial’ All India Hockey Tournament is being conducted by Air Force Sports Control Board, New Delhi to honour the great soldier. 

            To propel the awareness of Hockey and also to reinstate its prominence, a national level tournament uniting 16 teams (eight elite club teams of the country with another eight teams from the armed forces and para military forces) is being held at Chandigarh from 07 to 12 May 18. The matches will be conducted at 3 Base Repair Depot (Air Force) and Sector 42 Astro Turf Hockey Grounds at Chandigarh. 

 

            Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa PVSM AVSM YSM VM ADC would be the Chief Guest for the final match on 12 May 18.  Curtain raiser and press conference of the tournament will be held on 06 May 18.  Air Marshal Hemant Sharma AVSM VSM, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Maintenance Command will declare the tournament open. Prominent sports personalities have also been invited to witness and grace the occasion. 

 

            The Indian Air Force has always been in the forefront for promoting sports and games. The recently concluded Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast, Australia yielded a rich haul of 03 medals from the Air Force stables. The medal harvest is a testimony to the impetus being provided by the IAF towards sporting excellence. The ‘Marshal Arjan Singh Memorial’ All India Hockey Tournament is yet another endeavour in the direction of achieving sporting prowess in our National sport.

                The Dakota DC-3 VP 905, which was accepted by the CAS from the Hon’ble Member of Parliament (RajyaSabha) Mr. Rajeev Chandrasekhar on 13 Feb 18, was formally inducted into the IAF today evening at Air Force Station Hindan.

            The aircraft commenced its journey from the UK on 17 Apr 18 and was flown by a joint crew of the IAF and M/s Reflight Airworks Ltd. The aircraft flew a total of 9750 km during its ferry into India and made en-route halts in France, Italy, Greece, Jordan, Bahrain and Oman. The aircraft landed on Indian soil at Air Force Station Jamnagar on 25 Apr 18 and reached its final destination at Air Force Station Hindan on 26 Apr 18.

            This historic flight of the Dakota DC-3 VP 905, across seven countries, was a commemoration of the service provided by this venerable aircraft to the nation.  The arduous feat of traversing half the globe in nine days on an aircraft of this vintage is a tribute to the steadfast determination and professionalism of the crew, the unflinching support provided by the Embassies of India in the countries en-route and the unwavering reliability of the old war horse. 

            The aircraft was escorted on its final leg of the journey, which was over the sea from Muscat to Jamnagar, by a P-8I aircraft of the Indian Navy, a C-130J and the Su-30 MKIs of the IAF. It was received with due ceremony by Air Mshl RK Dhir, AOC-in-C SWAC and the Hon’ble MP Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar. Air Cmde MK Chandrasekhar (Retd) was granted special permission by the Raksha Mantri to fly on board the aircraft from Jamnagar to Air Force Station Hindan. His presence on the aircraft commemorated the contribution and sacrifice of a multitude of veterans who have successfully operated this aircraft in times of peace and war.

            To honour the homecoming of the Dakota, a grand ceremony was held at                      Air Force Station Hindan today. The ceremony was attended by the Chief of the Air Staff, Senior functionaries of the MoD, diplomats from the High Commission of the UK, officers of the IAF, representatives from M/s Reflight Airworks and proud veterans of the IAF who have operated this magnificent flying machine.

            The unique journey undertaken by the Dakota to its homestead, the Vintage Aircraft Flight of the IAF, was keenly followed the world over and its arrival has scripted an indelible mark in the rich legacy of the IAF.

                Formations of South Western Command are carrying out Exercise VIJAY PRAHAR employing more than 20000 troops, cutting edge equipment and state of the art force multipliers in the Mahajan Field Firing Ranges close to Suratgarh in Rajasthan. The exercise is aimed to orchestrate wide spectrum of threats which are planned to be tackled through high tempo joint air and land operation involving hundreds of aircrafts, thousands of tanks and artillery pieces supported by real time intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and just in time logistic support.

 

The month-long exercise is essentially to practice the troops in penetrative manoeuvres across the obstacle ridden terrain under a nuclear umbrella.

 

During the exercise, the formations of South Western Command are practising and operationalising certain innovative concepts of operating in the network centric environment, integrated employment of modern day sensors with the weapon platforms, employment of attack helicopters in the air cavalry role and bold offensive of application of the Special Forces. The formations will refine their drills and procedures for fighting in the nuclear environment during the course of the exercise.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said here today that Northeast students' hostels will soon become functional in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi and Bangalore University.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that considering that a large number of students from the North Eastern States undertake courses in Bangalore University, it was decided to have a hostel in in its campus  to meet their  accommodation demands. He said that two years back a  piece of land was acquired from the Bangalore University management and the foundation stone of the building was laid. The construction work is nearing completion and expected to become functional shortly, he added.

 

Mentioning about the another hostel to be built  in the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Dr Jitendra Singh said that  a piece of land had been acquired within the campus of the Jawaharlal Nehru University. The building is also expected to be completed in the near future, he added.

 

The cost of construction of both these projects has been borne  by the NEC / Ministry of Northeast (DoNER). He said, the modalities of admission to these hostels will be worked out in due course of time.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh said he had suggested to keep 75% accommodation reserved for the  inmates from the eight North Eastern States in these hostels. This, he said, will offer an opportunity to the students from the Northeast to engage in a healthy social and cultural mingling with students from other parts of the country and at the same time, this might also help in generating some revenue in managing the hostel.

 

Meanwhile, Dr Jitendra Singh informed that a piece of land has been acquired at Rohini, Delhi where the construction of another hostel for students from Northeast will be undertaken, which will cater primarily to the students from Delhi University At the same time, he said,  land spread over more than three acres has also been acquired at a prime location at Dwarka in Delhi where a Northeast Convention cum Cultural Centre is proposed to be brought up.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh ​has said the​ Government has approved setting up of an exclusive ""Brahmaputra Study Centre"" at Gauhati University, Guwahati, for which a fund of about Rs. 28  crore will be provided by the Ministry of DoNER. 

The Vice-Chancellor of Gauhati University, Dr Mridul Hazarika, who called on Dr Jitendra Singh here today, said that the University has decided to provide land within the campus for a separate block for the Brahmaputra Study Centre / Department.  

Dr Jitendra Singh said the Gauhati University is one of the oldest universities in the country and it needs to cultivate a unique identity for itself which could attract scholars from far and wide by setting up the ""Brahmaputra Study Centre"". He said, Brahmaputra is one of the largest rivers of the world and the Study Centre being set up within the Gauhati University will offer an opportunity for research in different aspects of river Brahmaputra in physics, hydrology, waterways, environment, disaster/flood management, hydro-power production etc.   

Describing it as a ""one stop destination"" for all issues and problems that may emerge from time to time with respect to the Brahmaputra River System, Dr Jitendra Singh informed that the first major study at the Centre has already been initiated.  He said, it is devoted to the research on the causes and prevention of frequent floods in the river and includes some of the internationally renowned scholars from across the world. 

Dr Jitendra Singh pointed out that the Ministry of DoNER in the last four years has gone beyond the mandate of focusing only on development works and has also tried to contribute for enrichment of education sector in Northeast. In this regard, he referred to the initiative of the Ministry in setting up the ""Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Study Centre"" in IIM, Shillong where the former President breathed his last. He also referred to the tripartite MoU signed between Barooah Cancer Institute Guwahati, Assam Government and the North-Eastern Council, as a result of which, super-specialty cancer courses in DM (Onco-Medicine) and MCh (Onco-Surgery) have been started for the first time in the region.

Pointing out some new initiatives under Ministry of DoNER funded works, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that amenities have been created at Nathu La in Sikkim for acclimatisation of pilgrims undertaking Mansarover Yatra through this route.  He added that such tourist facilities are being developed at the popular tourist hub Majuli island in Assam.  He said, improved connectivity has already seen growth in tourism in the NE region, which has immense potential to generate employment.

The Tourism Minister Shri Alphons said, development of tourism and identifying new tourist hubs in the NE region is a  priority for his ministry and added that funds will be made available for this task. He said that North East region has great locations which could be ideal as film shooting destinations. He further said that the region could be great attraction for tourists from South East Asian countries. The Ministry of Tourism will provide support for boosting tourism avenues in the North East region, he added.

Secretary, Ministry of DoNER, Shri Naveen Verma and other senior officials of both ministries were also present.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh was presented here today a Research Report on Assam Floods, prepared by the Delhi Alumni Association of Assam (DAAA).

 

While appreciating the initiative by the academicians of Assam region, Dr Jitendra Singh said that floods in Northeast, particularly in the States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur have virtually become a perpetual phenomenon, occurring year after year, and causing tremendous loss to lives and property. A serious and comprehensive future strategy to avoid such occurrences again and again is urgently called for, he said.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh disclosed that the Ministry of Development of Northeastern Region (DoNER) has, on its own initiative, helped in setting up ""Brahmaputra Study Centre"" at Gauhati University, Assam. The Centre has also started functioning, he said, and informed that the first major research study, already initiated for the last few months, deals with the ways and means to control and prevent the occurrence of floods. For this purpose, he said, experts of international repute are also being involved for their inputs.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Government under the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has always been in the forefront in coming to the aid of flood related hardships of the people of Northeast. This, he said, is borne out by the fact that last year, in the month of July/August, when there was extraordinary damage caused as a result of unprecedented rainfall, Prime Minister undertook a visit to the Northeast, where he personally reviewed the flood situation, particularly pertaining to the States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur, and also announced on-the-spot financial assistance of Rs.2,000 crores.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh suggested to the members of Alumni Association to share their findings and inferences with NITI Aayog also, since now there is an exclusive NITI Aayog Forum for Northeast. He said that he would arrange a meeting to discuss the findings of the research report by the senior officers of the Ministry of Northeast (DoNER), who can then, at their level, also discuss the same with the representatives of the NITI Aayog.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, a number of options have been suggested in the past for prevention of flood-like situation. These include embankments along river Brahmaputra, dredging for de-siltation in large rivers, construction of a high gravity concrete Dam, etc. However, he said, a final call can be taken only after studying the various aspects, including feasibility, cost-effectiveness and sustainable viability of any future arrangement.

He said, the centre will act as a cultural convention and information hub of the northeastern region in Delhi. He said that Centre is being built on 1.32 acre land at Sector-13, Dwarka, New Delhi under the North Eastern Council (NEC) for the purpose of construction of North Eastern Cultural and Information Centre. He said that this Centre will act as a cultural and convention, information hub of the North Eastern Region in Delhi. The Minister said it will have a library-cum-reading room with material on North Eastern Region, an art gallery showcasing the North East, Exhibition hall, Research centre, Sale outlets as well guest houses. He said, currently architecture, design and planning for the project are in process. The project is expected to be completed soon at an estimated cost of Rs. 50-55 crores, he added. He said this Centre will be one of its kind in the country and will be a state-of-the-art project. 

Keeping in view the large number of NE students studying in various educational institutes, hostels are being set up for NE students. These hostels are being set up in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and a hostel exclusively for girl students from Northeast in Bengaluru University.

                Eminent actor, Shri Akshay Kumar, today launched an advertisement campaign for the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) in the capital. The campaign was launched at a Collectors Convention for Toilet Technology organized in the capital. The campaign focuses on promoting the twin pit toilet technology in rural India, and also features actor, Ms Bhumi Pednekar along with Shri Kumar.

In his welcome address, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, spoke about the contribution made by Shri Akshay Kumar to the Swachh Bharat Mission. He said that right from his movie, Toilet Ek Prem Katha, which was seen and appreciated by rural and urban people across the country, to his participation in the twin pit toilet advertisement campaign for the Swachh Bharat Mission, Shri Kumar has been a strong supporter of the sanitation movement underway in the country

Shri Akshay Kumar interacted with Swachh Bharat Mission officials, district collectors, communication experts and members from the media on the occasion. During his interaction, he spoke about the need for influencers of society to talk freely about toilets, and empty toilet pits around the country to destigmatize cleaning of one’s own toilet by members of the family itself. 

The District Collectors and field officials, during the interaction, spoke about the power of women in leading the sanitation mission in rural areas, and the role played by the movie, “Toilet Ek Prem Katha” in leading this behavior change. It was also announced by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation on this occasion that the producers of Toilet Ek Prem Katha have given rights to all State and District teams of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) to screen the movie in villages on a non-commercial basis.

The twin pit toilet technology was invented in India and is the most well-suited toilet technology for rural India, and is recommended by Government of India and the World Health Organization. It is scientifically proven that:

1.         A pit in a standard twin-pit toilet model fills up in roughly 5 years for a 6-membered family

2.         The waste may then be easily re-directed to the second pit

3.         In 6 months to 1 year, the waste in the filled pit decomposes completely 

4.       This decomposed waste is safe to handle and rich in NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) nutrients which makes it ideal for use in agriculture

The States are continuously encouraged by the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) to include awareness generation about the above facts as part of their grassroots information, education and communication (IEC) efforts.

The advertisement campaign launched today is an effort, supported by the World Bank, towards encouraging this technology using mass media. The film can be found on the YouTube channel of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) (link: tinyurl.com/sbmgramin). It will be translated in several regional languages, and the Hindi version will start airing on television channels with immediate effect.

                The Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Shri ‎Rajiv Mehrishi, and Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer emptied a toilet pit from a twin pit toilet in rural Maharashtra early this morning. Senior sanitation officers from States across the country, including Additional Chief Secretaries of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, followed suit to encourage use of twin pit toilets in rural India, and to de-stigmatize emptying of toilet pits by the household themselves. 

The twin-pit toilet is the safest toilet technology most suited to large parts of rural India and is recommended by the World Health Organization as well as the Government of India. Research has shown that one of the reasons rural households might hesitate in building and/or using this low-cost technology is the stigma associated with emptying of the pit. 

However, it is scientifically proven that a pit in a standard twin-pit toilet model fills up in roughly 5 years for a 6-membered family. The waste can then be easily re-directed to the second pit, and it becomes safe-to-handle compost in 6 months to 1 year, and is rich in NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) nutrients which makes it ideal for use in agriculture. In many parts of India, this is also known as sonakhaad (golden fertilizer) because of high nutritious content.

Today’s pit-cleaning exercise in Pandharewadi gram panchayat, Daund block of Pune district was a step towards dispelling these myths, biases and stigmas. Several State Principal Secretaries (Sanitation), senior officers of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin), and senior officers of Maharashtra government joined in this exercise. 

All officers then held up the compost in their hands. Commemorative jars full of the compost were taken home by all present at the event.

The pit-emptying exercise was a part of an ODF-Sustainability workshop. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) has made significant progress in the three and a half years since its launch. The rural sanitation coverage has more than doubled since the launch of the mission from 39% to nearly 84%. Over 7 crore toilets have been built across rural India under the Mission. As an outcome, over 3.6 lakh villages and 385 districts have been declared Open Defecation Free (ODF), across 17 States and Union Territories.

With over half the country declared ODF, the Mission is also working on sustaining the ODF status in these areas. To that end, detailed ODF Sustainability Guidelines have also been issued, and a workshop was conducted with ODF States and districts in Pune over the last two days. 

Speaking at the workshop, the Secretary, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, said that along with declaring the country ODF, the Mission is working with States towards sustaining this ODF status over the years and decades to come. For this, he said, sustained behavior change efforts had to be undertaken at all levels, and the Swachhagrahis had a critical role to play in this. He also announced that the Mission will soon be launching a mass media campaign to promote twin pit toilets in rural India, featuring leading actors, Shri Akshay Kumar and Ms Bhumi Pednekar.

                The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan has announced that the State will be declared as open defecation free (ODF) by Gandhi Jayanti this year. This will mean that the State will become ODF one year before the national timeline of October 2nd, 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

 

The announcement was made at a public ceremony at Bhopal, which was also attended by Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation, Sushri Uma Bharti, State Ministers, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri ParameswaranIyer, and other senior officials.

 

Addressing more than 5000 people who came from various parts of the State, the Chief Minister also spoke about how the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) has become a jan andolan – a people’s movement – in the State. He went on to emphasize the role of people’s participation in making a sanitation movement like this successful, and said that he looked forward to the continued support of the people of the State in achieving as well as sustaining ODF status in the State.

 

In her address to the gathering, the Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation, Sushri Uma Bharti shared that the national sanitation coverage has risen to over 83%, a more than double increase from the baseline coverage of 39% at the time of the launch of the Mission in October,2014. She underlined that Swachh Bharat is ultimately a movement for the people, by the people and of the people and that is what has made it a true jan andolan.

 

She shared that over 3.7 lakh villages, 383 districts and 17 States/UTs of the country have already been declared ODF, and stressed upon the need to also start focusing on ODF-plus activities as well. To this end, the GOBAR-dhan scheme was also launched in Madhya Pradesh at the event.

 

 

 

 Announced in the Union budget this year, the scheme aims at positively impacting village cleanliness and generating wealth and energy from cattle and organic waste. The first among such projects in Madhya Pradesh will be implemented in Kodsa village in Narsingpur District and Chiruli village in Gwalior District. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri ParameswaranIyerlauded the role played by Swachhagrahis, the foot soldiers of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) in the progress made across the country. He called upon them to keep behavior change at the focal point of their activities at the grassroots and sustain their efforts even after the State is declared ODF.

 

Swachhagrahis, people’s representatives and grassroots officials associated with the implementation of Swachh Bharat in the State were also felicitated along with the launch. These State level awards were given for the exemplary work done in the areas of toilet construction, geo-tagging, conversion of dysfunctional toilets, behaviour change and sustainability.

                Nearly Rs 16.5 thousand crores have been earmarked by 71 Ministries/Departments of Government of  India to take up swachhata activities within their own spheres during the FY 2018-19. This earmarking is over and above the budget of Ministries in-charge of sanitation in the country, i.e. Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation for Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs for Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban). The Swachhata Action Plan (SAP) 2018-19 was launched by the Cabinet Secretary, Shri P.K Sinha in New Delhi today at a meeting of Union Secretaries and senior officials. The SAP Compendium 2018-19 was also released on this occasion. Several Ministries are in the process of increasing their commitment of funds.

Swachhata Action Plan (SAP) is a part of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision that Swachhata has to be everyone’s business in order for the nation to realize its collective vision of a Clean India. This inter-ministerial collaborative project commenced in April 2017, whereby Ministries and Departments were advised to go beyond business as usual and implement innovative and outcome-based Swachhata activities.

The Committee of Secretaries led by the Cabinet Secretary today reviewed the implementation of SAP 2017-18 by Union Ministries/Departments. During the last year, Union Ministries had allocated over Rs18 thousand crores. At the review, the Cabinet Secretary underlined that efforts under SAP need to be sustained by the respective Ministries. The Cabinet Secretary emphasized that all Secretaries need to personally monitor implementation of SAP on a regular basis. He further suggested that each Ministry should look beyond its own programmes and schemes and bring innovation in implementation of SAP with more enthusiasm and energy. He called for a higher allocation of funds and higher utilization in SAP.

Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer gave a presentation on the performance of the Swachhata Action Planfor the year 2017-18. He also presented a brief on SAP 2018-19, which will be implemented by Ministries and Departments during the current FY.

Selected Ministries/ Departments who had performed well in SAP last year also presented their success stories at the review meeting.

                The Union Minister for Human Resource Development,Shri Prakash Javadekarlaunchedthe ‘SamagraShiksha’ - an integrated Scheme for school education extending support to States from pre-school to senior secondarylevels for the first timein New Delhi today. The Scheme is a paradigm shift in the conceptual design of school educationby treating ‘school’ holistically as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary and senior secondary levels. 

Speaking on this occasion, Shri Javadekar said that in keeping with Prime Minister’s commitment of providing of ‘SabkoShikshaAchchiShiksha’,The Ministry of HRD has taken a landmark step and completely overhauled the existing Schemes in School Education to treat schooling as a smooth transition from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary and senior secondary level. It focuses on improving quality of education at all levels by integrating the two T’s – Teachers and Technology.He elaborated that ‘Samagra’ means  a holistic approach to treat education  as a wholeand the Scheme is very aptly named as it sees school education holistically without segmenting it into various levels of education.

Shri Prakash Javadekarsaid that earlier the budget on the three schemes ie SSA, RMSA and Teacher Education wasRs. 28,000 crore in 2017-18. But the budget outlay on the new scheme will be now Rs. 34,000 crore in 2018-19 and  toRs. 41,000crore in 2019-20 i.e. an increase of 20% which shows Central Government’s commitment for Education. He said that about one million schools will get library grant of Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 20,000to strengthen the libraries to ensure that “Padhega Bharat Badhega Bharat”.

He further said every school will get sports equipment under the SamagraShiksha, at the cost of Rs. 5000 for Primary, Rs. 10,000 for Upper Primary & up to Rs. 25,000 for SSC & HSC schools to inculcate & emphasize relevance of sports to realise the dream of “Khelega India Khilega India”. Shri Javadekar saidKasturba Gandhi BalikaVidyalaya (KGBV) to be expanded from Class 6-8 to Class 6-12 with allocation of Rs. 4385.60 crores in 2018-19 & Rs. 4553.10 crores in 2019-20 to fulfil Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s commitment to BetiBachaoBetiPadhao.

He said that thescheme will build on the grade-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomesand the largest National Achievement Survey (NAS) conducted in 2017-18 to strategize district level interventions for improving quality of education. This approach would help to shiftthe focus of student learning from content tocompetencies. The Scheme envisages active participation of all stakeholders especially the parents/guardians, School ManagementCommittee (SMC) members, community and the statefunctionaries towards the efforts to ensure quality education to children.

Shri Javadekar said that a teacher is the fulcrum of the school education system. Scheme will focus on strengthening this crucial pillar by making SCERTs and DIETs the nodal agencies for teacher training. These institutions would be strengthened to emphasize the integration of in-service and pre-service training structures in States to make it need-focused and dynamic.  This would strengthen the quality of teaching in schools across levels. 

He said that this will enable reaping the benefits of technology and widening the access of good quality education across all States and UTs and across all sections of the Society.“DIKSHA”- the national digital platform for teachers would put high quality teaching learning resources for ready use of teachers. The Scheme will support ‘Operation Digital Board’ in all secondary schools over a period of 5 years, so as to enhance the use of digital technology through smart classrooms, digital boards and DTH channels. The Digital initiatives like ShaalaKosh, Shagun, ShaalaSaarthi will be strengthened. 

The Minister also announced a competition over myGov to design an apt logo for the scheme which signifies a holistic approach for holistic development of children.

Shri Upendra Kushwaha in his address said that it is a new beginning in the field of education and SamagraShiksha will integrate schemes through a single school education development programme covering grades pre-school to 12thwhich would help in looking at a school as a unit. He pointed out that it is the Endeavour of the Government to equip our children with all-round skills – academic, extracurricular and vocational- so that they lay a strong foundation for the future development of India.He further said that the Integrated Scheme is a paradigm shift in conceptual design of school education envisaging to integrate teacher, technology and student learning.He furthersaid thatfocus will be on teachers’ training and technologyto improve the quality education. 

Shri Prakash Javadekar also unveiled the brochure and website of the Samagra Shiksha Scheme. The brochure gives an insight into the major features of the Scheme and how the Scheme focuses on improving quality of education, enhancing the Learning Outcomes and using technology to empower children and teachers.

The Website provides details about the Scheme for information of the States/UTs, teachers, children, institutions and public at large. It details out the interventions for which financial support is provided under the Scheme to States and UTs. All notifications, correspondences and circulars are uploaded on the website for ready reference of States and UTs. An online Project Monitoring System is linked to the website which measures progress against targets and monitors processes of implementation of various interventions of the Integrated Scheme.

Shri Anil Swarup, Secretary, Department of School Education and Literacy, Ms. Rina Ray, Special Secretary, Department of School Education and Literacy,  and senior officials of the HRD Ministry were also present on this occasion.

The programme began with the beautiful rendition of SaraswatiVandana by the children of National Bal Bhawan.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its in-principle approval for establishing a Central University by the name of “Central University of Andhra Pradesh” in Janthaluru Village of Ananthapur District, Andhra Pradesh. A provision of funds worth Rs. 450 crore has been approved for meeting the first phase expenditure towards establishment of the said University.

 

          The Cabinet also approved the proposal for operationalization of the Central University in the transit campus, initially by forming a society under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 in order to give a legal status to it till the amendment to the Central Universities Act, 2009 is enacted and to enable commencement of academic activities from the Academic Year 2018-19. The Central University would be mentored by an existing Central University till its governing structure is in place. 

 

          The approval would increase access and quality of higher education and help in minimizing the regional imbalances in education facilities, and give effect to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014.

                The last date for registration for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship, a privileged scheme for the country’s youth to associate formally with Swachh Bharat Mission and also earn career benefits, has been extended. Students of Higher Education institutions and members of NYKS can now register for the internship till 15thJune 2018. Earlier the last date for registration was till 15th May 2018.

Students and NYKS youth can, now, continue to sign up for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship by logging on to the portal (www.sbsi.mygov.in). Under this scheme the interns, are required to complete at least 100 hours of sanitation related work in villages. This would qualify them for Swachh Bharat Certificates. Those who complete the internship with additional, specified outputs would also gain 2 curriculum credits specially allowed by UGC. Additionally, top performers would receive awards at various levels. The period for taking up Swachh Bharat Summer Internship has been kept any time before 31st July 2018.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, announced the launch of Swachh Bharat Summer Internship (SBSI) during his Mann Ki Baat address on 29th April 2018. Following his call, thousands of college students and NYKS youth have already joined the programme to contribute to the cause of Swachh Bharat.

                This is in response to some reports appearing in the online press that no action has been taken on the 80,000 bogus teachers who have been identified after introducing Aadhaar  number verification on the Gurujan portal of AISHE.

The HRD Ministry has clarified that the fact mentioned in the report that no action has been taken is incorrect and it is not reflecting the actual position in the matter. All the 80,000 names have been shared with both AICTE and UGC – the regulators, for taking up with the respective institutions and verify the reasons for incorrect entries. Both the regulators are still on the job since the number of cases is very high. It is also to be clarified that in this case an opportunity is being given to the institutions to rectify mistakes if any in showing entries in Aadhaar numbers. This facility has been opened in the AISHE portal for making the corrections.

10. The news about ,a case where a child from Tamil Nadu claimed that he had been forced to go to Udaipur center by CBSE was wrong, because his online application records show that the child had himself opted for Udaipur as an option for exam center. Similarly, news about depriving Tamil Nadu candidates of attempting question paper in Tamil. was also wrong. In fact, all candidates, who had opted Tamil as medium were given centres within Tamil Nadu, and were given question papers in Tamil.
In 4 out of 2255 centers in India, during the conduct of examination, when it came to notice that the medium of Question paper was not correct for the candidates, CBSE immediately responded by providing them question paper in the language of their choice.
11. CBSE has been successful in conducting these high stakes exams largely due to the cooperation of the student and parent community through the years.
12. The media has also unconditionally supported the Board’s initiatives to curb the menace of adoption of unfair means by candidates.
13. CBSE shall continue to endeavor to strengthen these exams further every year and bring in as much facilitation for the students as possible for taking these exams, and also for ensuring fairness, transparency, authenticity and sanctity of NEET exams.

                The students of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas run by Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti under Union Ministry of Human Resource Development have shown excellent results in Joint Entrance Examination Main 2018 conducted by Central Board of Secondary Education. Joint Entrance Examination is conducted for admission to premier institutes like IIT/NITs in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.  In a tweet today HRD Minister said that “this year 4360 Rural Students of Navodaya Vidyalaya have qualified for JEE Advanced as against 3563 students last year, which is an impressive 22% increase. Kudos to them. This is also a testimony of govt's focus on quality education.”  

Out of 11653 Navodaya students appeared in JEE main this year, 4360 have qualified to appear in Advance Examination to be conducted on 20 May, 2018. This accounts for 37% of success rate, which is much beyond any group of schools. In the previous year 9757 JNV Students appeared in JEE Main examination and 3563 qualified for JEE Advance examination. Out of 4360 students qualified for Advanced examination 444 students were trained with special coaching with the help of NVS alumni network and NGOs. NVS Alumni connect has also been established, through which the alumni are encouraged to support and hand hold the students of NVS.  

With this feat students have crossed their first step in securing admission in good institutes like IISc, IITs, NITs and other premier institutes. Navodaya Vidyalayas were started in 1986 to provide modern quality education to the Talented children predominantly from rural areas and that have produced, for many years, excellent results. NVS mentioned it as a proud moment for the organisation and congratulated all Navodaya students. There are 625 JNVs functioning across the country except Tamil Nadu. Entire cost of education and the living is incurred by the government.

Given the number of candidates qualified in JEE main, the performance of students of Navodaya Vidyalayas is much ahead.

				Rainfall over the country as a whole for the 2018 southwest monsoon season (June to September) is most likely to be NORMAL (96% to 104% of long period average (LPA)).
				Quantitatively, monsoon season (June to September) rainfall for the country as a whole is likely to be 97% of the LPA with a model error of ±4%.
				Region wise, the season rainfall is likely to be 100% of LPA over North-West India, 99% of LPA over Central India, 95% of LPA over South Peninsula and 93% of LPA over North-East India all with a model error of ± 8 %.
				The monthly rainfall over the country as whole is likely to be 101% of its LPA during July and 94% of LPA during August both with a model error of ± 9 %.
			
			
			
		
	


 

 

 


	Background


 

India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued the first stage operational long range forecasts for the 2018 southwest monsoon season (June-September) rainfall over the country as a whole on 16th April. IMD has now prepared the 2nd Stage Long Range forecast of the seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole, forecasts for the monthly rainfall for July & August over the country as a whole, and forecasts for the seasonal rainfall for the 4 broad geographical regions of India (Northwest India, Northeast India, Central India and South Peninsula). The 2nd stage forecasts for the southwest monsoon season (June-September) rainfall over the country as a whole was prepared using a 6-parameter Statistical Ensemble Forecasting System (SEFS) and the operational Monsoon Mission Climate Forecast System (MMCFS).

 


	Sea Surface Temperature Conditions in the Pacific & Indian Oceans


 

The moderate La Nina conditions developed in the equatorial Pacific in later part of the last year weakened to weak La Nina conditions early this year and currently have turned to neutral ENSO conditions. The MMCFS & other global climate models indicate conditions over the Pacific likely to continue to be Neutral during most part of the monsoon season and turn to weak El Nino conditions after the monsoon season.


At present, the warm neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are prevailing over the Indian Ocean. The MMCFS and other global climate models indicate weak negative IOD conditions are likely to develop during the middle of the monsoon season and continue to persist till the early part of the post-monsoon season.

 


	Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System (MMCFS)


 

The latest experimental forecast based on the MMCFS suggests that the monsoon season rainfall during the 2018 monsoon season (June to September) averaged over the country as a whole is likely to be 102% ± 4% of LPA.

 


	The Operational Second Stage Forecasts for the 2018 Southwest Monsoon Rainfall


 


	
	
		Season (June-September) Rainfall over the country as a whole
	
	


 

Quantitatively, the season rainfall for the country as a whole is likely to be 97% of the long period average (LPA) with a model error of ±4%. The LPA rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1951-2000 is 89 cm.

 

The 5 category probability forecasts for the Season (June to September) rainfall over the country as a whole is given below.

                Southwest monsoon has set in over Kerala, today, the 29th May 2018


	
	
		Today, the southwest monsoon has further advanced into remaining parts of southeast Arabian Sea, Comorin – Maldives area, entire Lakshadweep, most parts of Kerala, some parts of Tamil Nadu and some more parts of southwest, central and northeast Bay of Bengal.
		Thus the southwest monsoon has set in over Kerala, today, the 29th May 2018, 3 days ahead of its normal date.
		The Northern Limit of Monsoon (NLM) passes through Lat. 120N/ Long 600E, Lat 120N/ Long 650E, Lat.120N/ Long 700E, Kannur, Coimbatore, Kodaikanal, Tuticorin, Lat. 090N/ Long 800E, Lat. 130N/ Long 850E, Lat.180N/ Long 900E, Lat. 210N/ Long 930E. Figure-1 shows the Northern Limit of Monsoon (NLM) as on today.
	
	


 

Prevailing meteorological conditions leading to onset of monsoon over Kerala.

 


	Widespread rainfall occurred over Kerala, during the past 3-4 days. The 14 rainfall monitoring stations for Monsoon onset over Kerala have reported more than 60% rainfall from 25th May. (Fig-2).
	Westerly winds have strengthened in the lower levels (more than 30 knots) and deepened with Westerly/ West-southwesterly winds upto 600 hPa (approximately upto 4.5km) over the south Arabian Sea (equator to Lat. 10oN and Long. 55oE to 80oE) from today morning.
	There is persistent convection (cloudiness indicated by Outgoing Long-wave Radiation values <200 Wm-1) from 23rd May. The Satellite (INSAT-3D) derived Outgoing Long wave Radiation value in the box confined by Lat. 5-10oN, Long. 70-80oE is 187 W/m2. (Fig-2).
	In addition to the above features, the following developments are also noticed:
	An east-west shear zone runs roughly along latitude 120N (across south peninsula) at 3.1 km above mean sea level.
	A well marked low pressure area lies over southeast and adjoining eastcentral Arabian Sea off north Kerala- Karnataka coasts.
	Another well marked low pressure area lies over eastcentral and adjoining northeast Bay of Bengal. It is likely to concentrate into a Depression during next 12 hours.


 

Further advance during next 48 hours

Conditions are favorable for further advance of Southwest Monsoon into some parts of central Arabian Sea, remaining parts of Kerala, some parts of coastal and south interior Karnataka, some more parts of eastcentral and northeast Bay of Bengal, and some parts of northeastern states during next 48 hours.

1. Background

 

Southwest monsoon sets over Kerala on 1st June with a standard deviation of about 7 days. The event marks the start of the rainy season over the region and as the monsoon progresses northward, relief from scorching summer temperatures is experienced over the areas. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been issuing operational forecasts for the date of monsoon onset over Kerala from 2005 onwards. An indigenously developed state of the art statistical model with a model error of ± 4 days is used for this purpose. The 6 Predictors used  in the models are: i) Minimum Temperatures over North-west India, ii) Pre-monsoon rainfall peak over south Peninsula, iii) Outgoing Long wave Radiation (OLR) over south China Sea, (iv) Lower tropospheric zonal wind over southeast Indian ocean, (v) upper tropospheric zonal wind over the east equatorial Indian Ocean, and (vi) Outgoing Long wave Radiation (OLR) over the south-west Pacific region.

IMD’s operational forecasts of the date of monsoon onset during the past 13 years (2005- 2017) were proved to be correct except in 2015. Forecast verification for the recent 5 years (2013-2017) is given in the table below.

2. Advance of monsoon over the Andaman Sea

 

The southwest monsoon advances over the Andaman Sea normally around 20th May with a standard deviation of about one week. Conditions are likely to become favorable for the advance of southwest monsoon into some parts of Andaman Sea and southeast Bay of Bengal around 23rd May 2018. Past data suggest that there is no association of the date of monsoon advance over the Andaman Sea either with the date of monsoon onset over Kerala or with the seasonal monsoon rainfall over the country.

 

3. Forecast for the 2018 Monsoon Onset over Kerala

 

The southwest monsoon is expected to set in over Kerala on 29th May 2018 with a model error of ± 4 days.

                Bhubaneswar becomes the fourth National data centre of National Informatics Centre (NIC) after Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune.The new cloud-enabled National Data Centre aims to offer round-the-clock operations with secure hosting for various e-governance applications of Central and State Governments and has ability to support 35,000 virtual servers.

 

Unveiling the data centre Union Minister of Electronics & IT, Sh. Ravi Shankar Prasad said that this data centre in Bhubaneswar is of global standards. Emphasizing the significance of the new national data centre, Sh. Prasad further said that Data centre is important because data sanctity is important and in the IT ecosystem, data centre adds to the digital clout of a State or location and raises its global profile. Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Sh. Dharmendra Pradhan was also present on the occasion.

 

""With a slew of Government apps including mygov, eWay bill, public finance management system, eHospials all being hosted by NIC, the demand for computing and storage has increased many folds,"" Neeta Verma, Director General of NIC said at the launch.NIC currently has 4,500 people across India in its various operations and will hire 800 professionals in the next one year, including for 355 cyber security experts,to tackle rising risks of cyber security. NIC provides technology support to all governance services and hosts nearly 10,000 websites of the Government

 

The new cloud-enabled National Data Centre will provide benefits like on-demand access to ICT (Information and Communication Technology) infrastructure for easy availability and quick deployment of applications and standardized platforms of deployment. In the traditional model, Departments have to budget and procure infrastructure at the commencement of the project, leading to either over provisioning of infrastructure or under-sizing of the requirements whereas the cloud service offerings of NIC would allow departments to provision infrastructure and add to the computing capacity ""on demand"".

                National Informatics Centre has set up a new state-of-the-art cloud enabled National Data Centre at Bhubaneswar. The data center to be inaugurated by Union Minister of Electronics & IT and Law & Justice, Sh. Ravi Shankar Prasad in the presence of Union Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Sh. Dharmendra Pradhan willoffer 24*7 operations with secure hosting for e-Governance applications of the Government and its departments. The unified and shared infrastructure is flexible enough to rapidly respond to Infrastructure requirements and also accommodate future technology enhancements, distributed applications, database applications running on bare metal, virtualized applications running in multi-hypervisor environments, and cloud-based applications that are available on demand. 

 

A centralized cloud environment has been established to host multiple applications with simplified operations and increased application responsiveness to support the new generation of distributed applications while accommodating existing virtualized and non-virtualized environments. The Data Centre and Cloud Services are being offered from the Data Centres established by NIC.

 

The ICT Infrastructure at Bhubaneswar will be energized in the modular fashion with software defined ICT Infrastructure. This will facilitate provisioning of services over Cloud with more agility and will also integrate with the NIC National Cloud Services. 

 

The National Cloud Services Bhubaneswar will provide following benefits:

•       On-demand access to ICT Infrastructure to ensure easy availability and quick deployment of applications. 

•      Standardized platforms of deployment to deliver ICT systems that are compliant to government policies and enable easy sharing of data across applications.

•       Service-oriented approach for sharing ICT infrastructure to achieve economies of scale.

•      Cost-effective, service-oriented approach for sharing computing resources.

 

Release of NIC Services

During the Inaugural event, the following portals will be released under NIC Offerings:

 


	All districts of Odisha has been converted into SwaaS websites: In a major boost, all districts of Odisha have migrated into NIC's S3WaaS platform (Secure, Scalable & Sugamya Website as a Service).


Districts are the key entities in the government structure where actual execution of schemes and programmes take place and district level websites is an implicit cyber space and an important link between the administration and citizen. S3Waas has been envisaged to bridge this gap and built with an objective to empower the District administrations to generate, configure, deploy and manage secure, scalable and accessible websites for publishing district specific information and services without much effort and technical knowhow.

 


	Launch of E-Saubhagya- Mobile Application


 

With the launching of NDC Bhubaneswar Cloud service offerings of NIC would allow departments to provision infrastructure and add to the computing capacity on demand and release them when not required. This elastic nature of the cloud allows departments not only to bring the solution to deployment quickly but also to scale up based on the demand of peak or low loads. In the traditional model departments has to budget and procure infrastructure at the commencement of the project, this results in either over provisioning of infrastructure or under sizing of the requirements which leads to scalability challenges. This would result in waste of resources and refreshing technology would take longer.

 

The Data Centres are the ideal solutions for offering a robust & highly available infrastructure with adequate redundancy enabling government to render effectively the e-Governance services to the citizens. Realizing the importance of Data Centres, National Informatics Centre (NIC) has established National Data Centres at Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune.

                Union Minister for Electronics & IT and Law Justice, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad said today that the Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) have played a major role in revolutionizing Common Service Centre Movement in the country. Inaugurating the two days workshop on “Tele- Centre Entrepreneurship Course” today, he said time has come when these entrepreneurs have to be the main drivers of shaping new India as envisaged by the Government. 

He appreciated the efforts of the enterprising VLEs in providing key services at the grassroots level and announced introduction of rewards at both central and regional level for the best performing entrepreneurs. He said next year onwards best performing VLE will get cash reward of one lac rupees. These awards will also be on regional basis and there will be 5 activity based awards.

The Minister said, “When our government came into existence, there was 83,000 CSCs in India, now, we have 2.92 lakh CSCs across the country. 54,000 women VLEs are working hard to achieve the goals of Digital India mission in rural areas. In just 4 years, the total transactions of VLEs have increased from just one Cr (in year 2013-14) for an amount of 180 Cr to 17.83 Cr for an amount of Rs. 19,000 Cr in 2017-18. CSCs have given employment to more than 10 lakh people in India. I am confident that, all VLEs will be able to achieve the turnover of Rs. One Crore during the current year.”

Appreciating the strength of VLEs in mobilizing rural citizens under Digital India mission, the Minister said: “I have great expectation from CSC VLEs. Our VLEs are change makers of India. I am happy to note that CSCs are training auto drivers for using BHIM and encouraging them for Cashless India movement. I congratulate our VLEs who are running Sanitary Napkin manufacturing units in various part of country and contribution in women’s health and hygiene. Swachh Bharat and Swastha Bharat must be mass movement through CSC.”  

He added, “We want to take our Digital Economy to Rs. one lakh Crore. In next few days, expansion of railway reservations would be done through CSCs. CSCs has opened 31 BPOs in India and the plan is to open more such BPO in CSC.”

The Minister was addressing 700 VLEs at a two days training workshop organised by CSC SPV on “Tele- Centre Entrepreneurship Course”. The main objective of the Telecentre Entrepreneur Course (TEC) is to inculcate the skills of entrepreneurship among the Village level Entrepreneur (VLE) and train them on various government and other services provided by Common Services Centers.

The Minister also asked to explore the possibility of involvement of CSCs in health insurance scheme and support the citizens in availing this unique initiative of the government.

Sh. Ajay Prakash Sawhney, Secretary, MeitY, said, “CSC movement has great significance in Digital India mission. I want to congratulate VLEs for their tremendous role. CSC VLEs are enabling the disbursement of entitlement and pension to various citizens living in far flung areas of the country.”  He added, “The VLEs should encourage citizens and merchants for using BHIM app through BHIM QR code in their day to day transactions. Today, we have 110 Micro Manufacturing Units of sanitary pads. It’s a matter of pride for all of us. This is magic of entrepreneurship, that VLEs have converted their turnover to more than Rs. One Crore We would support CSCs in setting up 10 seater BPOs.”

Sh. Pankaj Kumar, Additional Secretary-MeitY said, “CSCs are playing a central role in the government’s Digital India program. The government is encouraging women to set up CSC. CSCs are regarded as change of social change.”

While welcoming the participants to the workshop, Dr. Dinesh Tyagi, CEO, CSC SPV said, “VLEs like Samkit Jain (Rajasthan), Padma (Andhra Pradesh), Dhanlakshmi (Tamil Nadu), Sonu Bala (Haryana), Ramshida (Kerala), Snehlata (Rajasthan), Gokul Saini (Rajasthan) are doing wonders through their hard work. CSC will make 6 Crore people digitally literate in India as well as build the Gram Swaraj in India. Today, government has a lot of expectations with CSC. We have to work hard to fulfill the mission of empowerment of Rural India.”  

The two day workshop will also cover: Topics of entrepreneurship relevance by experts in the field as Prof. MM Pant, Prof. Alok Pandey and Bijay Bhattacharya (from Tally).

The Minister presented awards to VLEs who successfully passed Tele-centre Entrepreneurship Course exam. On the occasion, a special publication highlighting Top 500 transacting VLEs of CSC and film on Rural Entrepreneurship through CSC also launched by the Minister.

                Union Minister of Electronics & IT and Law & Justice, Sh. Ravi Shankar Prasad said today that for the Indian Government, freedom of media is integral to polity, duly recognized by the Constitution and reinforced by Judiciary in series of judgements. Addressing the 15th Asia Media Summit here today, Shri Prasad said that the media has full right to inform, circulate, criticize, advice and counsel. The rights of Media under the Constitution are also subject to reasonable restrictions.

On misuse of data, the Minister said India will not allow the country to become a centre of data pilferage, and that data commerce through collusive methods cannot be used to influence its electoral process. Shri Prasad said all the online companies which are in the business of data commerce must understand the nuances of accountability. He said that when the recent controversy surrounding data privacy surfaced, the Government took a very firm stand on these issues. Shri Prasad further said that accountability is integral to democracy and all institutions – the Government, the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Media – have to adhere to this principle. Referring to India becoming a very big centre of data analysis, he said that there is a need to have a proper coordination on data availability, data utility, data innovation, data anonymity and data privacy. He said that a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge is looking into these issues and soon the Government would enact a data protection law.

Dwelling upon the issue of Ethical Journalism, the Law Minister said that it must be fair, true, properly presented highlighting sights and counter sights and empowering the consumers of news in a decent and independent fashion. The Minister wondered whether the media today, under the garb of sensationalism, paid news, fake news, too much of other insidious practices is addressing to this large issue. This is a matter of debate, the Minister added.

Supporting the principle of self-regulation by the media, Shri Prasad said that the IT act mandates that the content going through the intermediary is not dangerous, libelous and does not impinge upon the security and integrity of the country nor should it encroach upon the copyrights. On sanctity of privacy, the Minister noted that the Supreme Court had upheld privacy as part of the Fundamental Rights. But, he added that the plea of privacy cannot become a shield for the corrupt and the terrorists. The Minister elaborated that on the issues of terrorism, propagation of hatred and communalization and on the issue of promoting extremism, there has to be a global consensus that needs to be properly enforced.

Dwelling on the challenges of social media, Shri Prasad said that the Government is committed to the freedom of press but there is a need to segregate the real from the dangerous. He said many in the Government today had fought against the emergency where freedom was trampled upon. The Minister said that the Government respects social media as it empowers the common man but the language used sometimes in this medium is a cause of concern.

Shri Prasad further said that the internet cannot become a tool of neo-imperialism. Referring to internet as one of the finest creations of human mind, he said that it cannot remain the monopoly of a few. He said that if Internet has to be global, it must have linkages with local ideas and culture.

Other dignitaries presenting their views on Media Regulation during the session included H.E. Mr. Hasanul Haq Inu, Minister of Information, Bangladesh, H.E. Dr. Khieu Kanharith, Minister of Information, Cambodia, Mr. Sam Seog Ko, Standing Commissioner, Communication Commission, Republic of Korea and Justice C.K. Prasad, Chairman Press Council of India. The session was moderated by Dr. Venkat Iyer, Barrister, UK.

In all the presentations, there was a consensus on a host of issues including ensuring freedom of expression and healthy development of an independent media, while respecting individual privacy. At the same time, all the speakers highlighted the challenge of fake news and misuse of expanding cyber space for propagating cyber crimes and terrorism. The speakers also underlined the issues of cyber piracy, patent and copyright violations and a consensus was reached to tackle these problems through cooperative dialogue among different countries.

                Expressing confidence that a perceptible and measurable difference in the country will be brought about on plastic pollution and other environmental issues in the run-up to World Environment Day 2018, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan today appealed to the people to give up single use of plastic. Addressing a curtain raiser ahead of the World Environment Day on June 5 here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan pointed out that the fight against plastic menace did not require any big actions, but only minor behavioural changes to adopt Green Good Behaviour. “Every individual has a Green Social Responsibility”, he said.  The Minister stated that it is our collective responsibility to do our duty and protect the rights of children of future generations. He added that the celebrations are not a one-day activity, but a continuous process.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan exhorted the media to effectively wield the pen and educate, as well as urge people to adopt one Green Good Deed every day.   He also emphasised that as part of World Environment Day celebrations, schools that become plastic-free will be awarded and issued certificates of being Green Schools.

 

Highlighting the menace posed by plastic, Dr. Harsh Vardhan pointed out that 25, 940 tonnes of plastic waste is generated every day in the country, with 40% of plastic waste being uncollected and 60 million tonnes of solid waste is generated in one year.  “Plastic bottle takes between 450-1000 years to decompose”, the Minister added.

The World Environment Day celebrations will be held from June 1-5, 2018 in New Delhi and across the country. Some of the events organised in New Delhi include “The Knowledge Coalitions” – international conversations to be held on June 1. Some of the themes to be discussed at the Knowledge Coalitions include – air pollution, Himalayan ecosystem, plastic pollution, marine litter strategy, new plastic economy and waste to resource.   The technology exhibition – “Sambandh” will be held on the back lawns of lawns India Gate from June 2-4.  The conference of State Environment Ministers - “Green India” will take place on June 4, besides conferences, workshops and seminars on various environmental subjects.  On June 5, the Plenary session will be chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, where all the State Environment Ministers will also be present.

The pan-India events include - cleanliness campaigns by state governments, cleaning of 24 beaches and 24 rivers in 19 states, making national parks and sanctuaries plastic free, media as well as social media campaigns and organising “Envithon” – mini-marathons in five other cities, besides Delhi.   About 10, 000 children will participate in ‘Run for plastic litter free environment’ in New Delhi on June 3.   

The objectives behind the campaigns are to enhance the global visibility of India as a leader in sustainability actions, support the efforts to Clean India ahead of Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary in October 2019, expand/consolidate public engagement on India’s environmental agenda, inculcate private sector leadership to address plastic pollution and urge citizens to take a pledge to change their behaviour around waste management and highlight India’s leadership in the cause of marine litter and beach cleaning.  India is hosting the World Environment Day for the second time. MoEF&CC is hosting the World Environment Day 2018, in collaboration with UN Environment.  India hosted the event in the year 2011, with the theme: ‘Forests: Nature at your Service’.  

In the run-up to the World Environment Day 2018, Dr. Harsh Vardhan had written to Environment Ministers of more than 150 countries to celebrate the day globally and take pledge to cut the use of single-use plastics.

More than 10, 000 missed calls have been received in the “Missed Call Campaign” titled #BeatPlasticPollution.  A pledge to beat plastic pollution can be taken by placing a missed call on 1800 137 1999.

Secretary, MoEF&CC, Shri C.K Mishra, Director General (Forest) and Special Secretary, MoEF&CC, Dr. Siddhanta Das, Additional Secretaries, MoEF&CC, Shri A.K Jain and Shri A.K Mehta, Chairman, Central Pollution Control Board, Shri S.P.S Parihar, UN Environment, Head, Country office India, Shri Atul Bagai, Joint Secretary, MoEF&CC, Smt. Manju Pandey and senior officers of MoEF&CC were present on the occasion.   Representatives from United Nations Environment (UNEP) and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) were also present on the occasion. 

BACKGROUND OF WORLD ENVIRONMENT DAY: 

5th June was designated as the World Environment Day by the UN General Assembly to commemorate the opening of the Stockholm Conference on Human Development. Annual celebrations of World Environment Day began in 1974.

June 5 provides an occasion for responsible conduct by individuals, enterprises and communities in preserving and enhancing the environment. Every action counts, and when multiplied by people across the world, its impact becomes exponential.  Over 150 countries are celebrating World Environment Day, particularly for promoting the environmental dimensions of the Sustainable Development Goals.  

During the last three years, the themes of World Environment Day celebrations included – “Seven billion dreams, one planet, consume with care” in 2015 in Rome, Italy, “Zero tolerance for the illegal wildlife trade” in Luanda, Angola, in 2016 and “Connecting people to nature – in the city and on the land, from the poles to the equator” in Ottawa, Canada, in 2017.

                The International Day for Biodiversity (IBD) 2018 was celebrated all over the country today. The celebration of the IDB under the theme - “Celebrating 25 years of action on biodiversity” provides an opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of and threats to biodiversity, while highlighting its contribution to sustainable development.  The celebrations have been organised to mark the 25 years of coming into force of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The national-level celebrations were held at Prof. Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) Auditorium in Hyderabad.

Speaking on the occasion, Governor, Andhra Pradesh & Telangana, Shri E.S.L Narasimhan highlighted that India has been conserving its rich biodiversity for ages. “We worship trees, animals and rivers because we want to protect them. The celebration today reminds us to go back to our roots to conserve nature in our traditional ways. For us in India it is not the 25th year of conservation, as we should be celebrating thousands of years of conserving nature and living in harmony”, Shri Narasimhan said. He also cautioned that environment protection is of utmost importance today, as the only inheritance our children seek from us is, clean environment for good health.   “We need to protect the nature, if we want nature to protect us”, he added. 

Addressing the gathering, Minister of Environment, Forest, Science & Technology, Telangana, Shri Jogu Ramanna, underlined the efforts taken by Telangana in conserving biodiversity. He also highlighted the effective functioning of Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) at the community level for conserving the biodiversity. 

In his opening remarks, Additional Secretary, MoEF&CC, Shri Arun Kumar Mehta pointed out that managing the living environment is a much more complex issue than managing the physical environment. He stated that India has contributed significantly towards achieving the global Aichi Biodiversity Targets 11 and 16. However, he also cautioned that the continuing loss of species may perhaps lead to the sixth mass extinction. Shri Mehta added that the Government is committed to conserve the biological resources to ensure a better living environment for human beings. 

Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DACFW), Shri S K Pattanayak, highlighted the high production of foodgrains, production of fruits and vegetables in the country.  He referred to biodiversity as the fundamental substratum upon which food security of India stands. Advances in technology, especially towards climate smart agriculture would not have been possible, but for the conservation of wild varieties by the people. The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights (PPVFR) Act provides for protection of the genetic resources conserved by the farmers/ community traditionally for ages. He called upon collective action by MoEFCC and MoA&FW for guarding against genetic erosion. 

Chairperson, National Biodiversity Authority, Dr. B. Meenakumari, highlighted that conserving biodiversity is for securing our own future. “Our actions can be small, yet significant, towards conservation of biodiversity”, Dr. Meenakumari said. 

The UNDP Country Director, Ms. Marina Walter, in her address highlighted that conservation of biodiversity in India will have a global impact and it will be central to the achievement of multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to food security, health, livelihood security, poverty alleviation among others.

Secretary, DACFW, Shri SK Pattnayak,  Chief Secretary, Telangana Shri SK Joshi,  Special Chief Secretary, Telengana Shri Ajay Mishra, Vice Chancellor of PJTSAU, Dr V Praveen Rao, Chairperson, National Biodiversity Authority, Dr. B. Meenakumari, and Country Director, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Ms. Marina Walter were among the distinguished ones in the gathering,.  Senior officers from Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, National Biodiversity Authority, Telangana State Biodiversity Board, UNDP, representatives from other states, officers and scientists from Central and State Government institutes, State Forest Departments, civil society organisations, academic institutes, students, local communities, and biodiversity enthusiasts also attended the event.  

The IBD 2018 celebrations have been organised by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, in coordination with National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) and Telangana State Biodiversity Board.

                India has called for a judicious use of resources amidst concerns over resource depletion and scarcity.  Addressing the 4th BRICS Ministerial meeting in Durban, South Africa today, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that a decrease in global materials, or at least stabilization at present levels, demand major reductions in metabolic rates in the Asia-Pacific region, especially India.   He pointed out that this can become possible only through Resource Efficiency (RE) not only throughout the material life cycle, but also at the post-consumption stage.  The Minister added that secondary resources (waste materials) need to be brought back into production, adopting a Circular Economy (CE) approach.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan emphasised that Resource Efficiency (RE) and Circular Economy (CE) are key elements of Sustainable Development and impact resource efficiency and that is why there is a global commitment to achieve it.   

 

Reiterating India’s commitment to building responsive, inclusive and collective solutions, Dr. Harsh Vardhan underlined that BRICS nations face similar environmental concerns such as air pollution, waste management, resource crunch and climate change.   “BRICS countries should together emphasize on the cooperation in air pollution control through technology transfer and requisite capacity building”, Dr. Vardhan said.   He urged BRICS nations to commit to cooperation and collaboration on technology transfer, capacity building and knowledge transfer at the country, regional and global levels.  “BRICS countries can complement, facilitate access to and provide adequate information on existing science, technology and innovation platforms, avoiding duplications and enhancing synergies,” he averred.   The Minister added that India will be pleased to contribute and provide further recommendations to the BRICS Environment Working Group on the modalities of Partnership for Urban Environmental Sustainability Initiative (PUESI). Dr. Vardhan expressed the confidence that the proposals on BRICS Environmentally Sound Technology (BEST) platform, clean river umbrella, circular economy, ocean economy, biodiversity and integrated water resources management will further strengthen the cooperation for sustainable development. 

 

Outlining the contours of the Green Good Deeds movement in India, Dr. Vardhan said, “We are asking people to alter their behaviour to Green Good behaviour to fulfil their Green Social Responsibility”.  He urged the BRICS countries to jointly help in the development of a social movement that can be emulated by the rest of the world.

 

Minister of Water and Environment Affairs, South Africa, Ms. Bomo Edith Edna Molewa, Vice-Minister for Environment, Energy, Science and Technology of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Brazil, Mr J.  Antonio Marcondes,  DG, International Cooperation Department of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation, Mr. Nuritdin Imanov, Vice-Minister of Ecology and Environment, China, Mr.  Huang Runqiu and representative of United Nations Environment  (UNEP), Mr.  Jorge Laguna-Celis were among the distinguished ones present on the occasion.

Speaking after launching the Mobile App of Green Skill Development Programme (GSDP) at the Ministry premises here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan pointed out that more than 30 programmes have been identified, which will be conducted in 84 institutions across the country. He also stressed that such an initiative will complement the vision of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, of skilling India’s youth and strengthening the resolve to conserve and protect the environment.

 

The Minister said that the number of people to be employed under GSDP will be increased to cover 2.25 lakh people next year and to about 5 lakh people by the year 2021.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan pointed out that the objective of GSDP is skilling the youth of India, especially dropouts and in increasing the availability of skilled workforce.  Recalling his positive experience from the interactions with the people who underwent training as part of the pilot project during his recent visit to Botanical Survey of India (BSI) and Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), Kolkata, Dr. Harsh Vardhan underlined that those who imparted the training skills and those who received it were highly enthused.  “The programme will be modified and strengthened from time to time”, he averred.

 

Addressing the gathering, Senior Economic Advisor, MoEF&CC, Dr. Anandi Subramanian said that 31 percent of children are dropouts from school after the secondary stage itself. She said that skill development is one of the key priorities of the Government, with the objective to develop skill sets with employability linkage. Dr. Subramanian said that while there is a need for skilled workforce, there is also a shortage of middle-level workforce.

Realizing the need for developing the green skills, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) is utilising the vast network and expertise of Environmental Information System (ENVIS) hubs and Resource Partners (RPs). The Ministry has taken this initiative for skill development in the environment and forest sector to enable India's youth to get gainful employment and/or self-employment. The programme endeavours to develop green skilled workers having technical knowledge and commitment to sustainable development. It will help in the attainment of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), National Biodiversity Targets (NBTs), as well as Waste Management Rules (2016).

 

The pilot project of GSDP was launched in June, 2017, for skilling Biodiversity Conservationists (Basic Course) and Para-taxonomists (Advance Course) of 3 months duration each at 10 locations, spread over 9 bio-geographic regions of the country. 94 trainees successfully completed the basic course qualifying as skilled Biodiversity Conservationists and 152 Trainees completed the Advanced Course qualifying as skilled Para-taxonomists. ENVIS RPs in Botanical Survey of India (BSI), Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) and their respective regional offices were the nodal Centres for the pilot programme.

 

Based on the feedback received from the stakeholders, the GSDP is being scaled up to an all-India level.  More than 30 skilling programmes will be conducted during 2018-19.  The skilling programmes cover diverse fields such as pollution monitoring (air/water/soil), Sewage Treatment Plant, Effluent Treatment Plants and Common Effluent Treating Plants (STP/ETP/CETP) operation, waste management, forest management, water budgeting, auditing, conservation of river dolphins, wildlife management, para taxonomy, including Peoples’ Biodiversity Register (PBRs), mangroves conservation, bamboo management and livelihood generation. The duration of the courses ranges from 80 hours to 560 hours approx. In the first stage, a pool of Master Trainers/Specialists is being created, who can further train the youth across the country. All courses will be National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) compliant. The Ministry will give Certificates indicating the skilling levels to all successful candidates.

 

Economic Adviser, MoEF&CC, Shri Yashvir Singh made a presentation on GSDP on the occasion. The programme was also attended by senior officers/officials of MoEF&CC, as well as representatives of the ENVIS RPs located in Delhi.

                Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that the Botanic Garden of Indian Republic (BGIR) Noida, will be developed as one of the most distinct botanic gardens with modern-day landscape.  Speaking at the foundation-stone laying ceremony of the development and upgradation of the Botanic Garden at Noida yesterday, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the Garden is being developed and upgraded with the objectives of collection of plant species, research, training, environment education, public awareness, aesthetics and entertainment through the protection of plant biodiversity.   He added that this is also being done with a view to make the Botanic Garden, Noida, a centre of excellence in the preservation of (Rare, Endangered and Threatened(RET) and local plant species.  Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that another objective is the creation of public awareness through education on plant biodiversity and its need.                 

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State, MoEF&CC, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, said that this is the largest Botanic Garden project in Delhi-NCR, which will become a fountain head of knowledge for a large number of youth and students. Dr. Sharma said that the creation of a virtual museum on the Garden’s premises will also provide the youth of the nation information on botany and the endangered plant species will also get protected.  He pointed out that it is estimated that the ambitious project will cost around Rs. 400 crore. “The cost of the first phase will be completed by 2018”, Dr. Sharma stated.  He reiterated the pledge to complete this projectin a time-bound manner, though the project has been delayed for almost 20 years. “This garden will be developed as an important tourist spot in the Delhi-NCR region”, Dr. Sharma said.

Protection of plant biodiversity and natural resources is the need of the hour in the present-day context of climate change.  In order to meet this objective,   the Botanical Garden of India Republic (BRIG) project was started, which could help preserve the endangered vegetation in the country. The landscape of this park, spread over 163.5 acres, will be transformed. A gene bank, seed bank, herbarium unit, orchid house, cactus house, nursery, plant biodiversity, research facility, education and maintenance will be developed in the Botanic Garden. 

Uttar Pradesh Minister Shri Dara Singh Chouhan and local MLA, Shri Pankaj Singh were among others present at the foundation-stone laying ceremony.

                          A section of the media has carried reports today, quoting a World Health Organisation study that has highlighted the problem of air pollution till 2016 and has inferred that 14 most polluted cities in the world are located in India.  The WHO report indicates that Delhi is placed at no. 6 with an annual average Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5  concentration as 143 micrograms per cubic metre in 2016.    However, the Government has made serious efforts to deal with air pollution.  Data for the year 2017 for PM 2.5 shows an improvement over 2016 and so far in 2018, it shows a further improvement, as compared to 2017.   The Government has also taken several bold initiatives, including leap-frogging from BS-IV to BS-VI.  

In the context of air pollution, CPCB data based on Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) indicates that the annual average PM 2.5 concentration in the year 2016 as 134 micrograms per cubic metre and as 125 micrograms per cubic metre in the year 2017.  Similarly, for PM 10 the figures were 289 micrograms per cubic metre in the year 2016 and 268 micrograms per cubic metre in the year 2017.  Therefore, even PM 10 levels have come down in the year 2017 against 2016.

The improvement in Particulate Matter concentration in Delhi has happened in spite of episodic events in two successive years in November 2016 and November 2017. During these months, in addition to local emissions, there was substantial contribution from regional sources, including smoke due to stubble burning in neighbouring states and dust from Gulf countries.

The newspaper reports also highlight observations by various experts suggesting that action similar to that in Delhi and NCR be also taken in other polluted cities.  

 

Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has already taken action in the matter. In July 2016, all non-attainment cities were given a set of 42 action points for improving on air quality.  As a follow-up, 94 non-attainment cities were also asked to prepare detailed action plans for improving upon air quality depending on their local conditions.  CPCB also organised seven workshops at various locations in different states, in which guidelines for preparing these plans were disseminated.   Subsequently, out of 94 non-attainment cities, action plans for 61 cities have already been received and concerned States have been requested to steer implementation of action plans in these cities.

Given that most of the polluted cities are located in and around Delhi and along the Indo-Gangetic plain, it is critical that the state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal are further sensitised to take up urgent action on cleaning air in cities under their jurisdiction.  

Significant action has been taken in Delhi and NCR, including the formulation of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) by CPCB.   Other measures taken include - a comprehensive action plan by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change; ban on petcoke in Delhi and NCR; strict surveillance over coal-fired plants; strict action against construction activities; regular field surveillance by CPCB teams starting from September 2017; augmentation of air quality monitoring stations in Delhi and NCR; upgradation of Central Control Room in CPCB; integration of data on air quality from stations of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD); Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB); launching a Mobile App called SAMEER for grievance redressal; coordinate action at national-level through a high-level task force in the PMO; Central government scheme to encourage in-situ management of crop residue and reduce stubble burning; regular monitoring and directions by the Minister and Secretary, MoEFCC.

Besides, National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) was launched by MoEFCC in April, 2018 and this was preceded by Clean Air Programme in Delhi in February 2018 to sensitise the public in general and implementing agencies in particular.  It is noteworthy that almost 1 million vehicles are added on the roads of Delhi every year and in spite of increased construction activities and vehicular movement, air quality in Delhi is showing signs of improvement.  

With similar intervention in other polluted cities and active participation of ULBs and state governments, air quality is expected to improve further.

                While India is making significant strides in Water and Sanitation Sector, what is needed is holistic  and integrated approach and public participation in sustainability of outcomes opined various experts at the two-day thematic seminar on Water and Sanitation which began in Pune, Maharashtra today. This was hosted by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India in collaboration with Research and Information System (RIS) for Developing Countries as Knowledge Partner along with Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA). Given Pune’s importance of successful intervention in sanitation, this city has been selected for hosting the two-day deliberations.  Thethematic Conference on Water and Sanitation is one of the eight events being organized by the Ministry of Finance and 7th in the series in a lead-up to the AIIB’s 3rd Annual Meeting which ,in turn, is scheduled to be held in June 2018 in Mumbai.

 

The Panel Discussions included various experts in the fields relating to water and sanitation sector who deliberated on various issues including efficient water management, drinking water, sanitation infrastructure and waste management, financing and regulatory issues amongst others. Mr. Parameshwaran Iyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India, Dr Bindeshwar Pathak, Founder Sulabh International, Dr. Seshadri Chari, Member Governing Council, RIS, Dr Kumar V Pratap Joint Secretary (IPF) Ministry of Finance, Government of India, Professor Amitabh Kundu , Distinguished Fellow , RIS and ex Dean JNU, Mukund Vasudevan Co - chair FICCI Water Mission, Ms Jyoti Vij Deputy Secretary General FICCI were present among others on the occasion. 

 

Mr. Parameshwaran Iyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in his Lead Presentation discussed how Swachh Bharat Mission has made significant changes in the sanitation sector with pioneering bold initiatives by various States to tackle the menace of open defecation. The biggest game changer was the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi putting Swachh Bharat on the top of the Development Agenda. He said that the mission is unique with a focus on not just building infrastructure but also on bringing about behavioral change and a shift in focus from output to outcome. There is also focus on verification and sustainability of program with expert group looking at independent verification. He said that this is a peoples’ movement. Mr. Iyer said that over 7.5 crores toilets have been built in last 3.5 years. 3.7 lakh villages, 385 districts in 17 States have been declared Open Defecation Free (ODF). He said that the economic and health impact of sanitation program is significant. The Government will move towards outcome based financing and shall focus on functionality approach, he added. Highlighting the innovative successes in sanitation sector in India, he referred to the wide use of Twin-pit toilets which are the most well-suited toilet technology for large parts of rural India, recommended by the Government of India and the World Health Organisation.

 

With respect to water management, Mr. Parameshwaran Iyer said that Government of India recently launched 'Swajal’ - a community led drinking water project aimed at providing sustainable and adequate drinking water in an integrated manner in rural areas. This project aims at empowerment of village communities and is based on the principle that services should be delivered at the lowest appropriate level. The Government will play the role of facilitator and will provide the necessary technical and financial assistance. for this will be provided by the Government. 

 

Earlier, speaking on the occasion, Dr. Kumar V Pratap, Joint Secretary (IPF), Ministry of Finance, Government of India said that water is unique amongst all the infrastructure sectors with 85 % water utilities worldwide being publicly  owned and operated. It is a difficult sector for private players to get in. He said that the worldwide, minimum private investment has come in water and sewage sector. In India, cost recovery is less than 20 percent in urban areas which is a challenge. However, there have been successful PPP projects in developing countries like Philippines. It is important to price water rightly to achieve financial and social objectives. Poor do not benefit from low user charges. The subsidies must be on connections and not actual consumption/usage of water. 

 

In his Opening Remarks, Dr.Amitabh Kundu said that India has 2.4 percent of global habitable land, and 4 percent of water resources, but has a huge challenge of feeding 17 percent of the world population. There are challenges to be addressed with regard to cropping pattern, infrastructure and investment.   

 

Dr. Seshadri Chari, Member, Governing Council, RIS in his address said that the problem of water and sanitation is becoming acute as the development process goes forward. There is no alternative to water, even though we have alternative to use of water. He said that we need to become more serious about the nature of the problem. We need more institutions like FICCI to partner with the Government on this issue which touches everybody's lives. Conservation of water is an age old value in India, alluding to this, Mr. Chari stressed on ‘Jal hi Jeevan Hai’ or the importance of water for all.  

 

Mr. Mukund Vasudevan, Co- chair, FICCI in his Welcome Address said while there are a lot of commendable initiatives undertaken in the area of water and sanitation by institutes and individuals, the scale of multi-pronged problems should be highlighted. There exists supply, demand and infrastructure issues for which the Government interventions are required as nobody can match the scale at which the Government can execute programs. With increasing awareness, enabling infrastructure, getting funding, addressing problems using viable technologies and the Government’s support, this is a solvable problem. He said that FICCI has constituted the water mission to catalyse a dialogue and work with Government on policy changes.

                The Government of India and the World Bank today signed a $500 million loan agreement to provide additional financing for the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) Rural Roads Project, implemented by Ministry of Rural Development, Govt. of India, which will build 7,000 km of climate resilient roads, out of which 3,500 km will be constructed using green technologies. 

The World Bank has supported PMGSY since its inception in 2004. So far it has invested over $1.8 billion in loans and credits mostly in the economically weaker and hill states across North India - Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh. It has built and improved about 35,000 km of rural roads and benefited about eight million people with access to all-weather roads. 

The Loan agreement for the Project was signed by Shri Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India and Mr Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, World Bank India, on behalf of the World Bank in the presence of Ms. Alka Upadhyaya, Joint Secretary (RC), Ministry of Rural Development. 

“The PMGSY over the years has brought about a paradigm shift in the way rural roads are mapped, designed, monitored and built, involving communities especially women,” said Shri  Khare. “The additional finance will bring a new shift in construction technology using green and low carbon designs and climate resilient construction techniques. Now more rural communities will have access to better economic opportunities and social services.” ,  Shri Khare added . 

Adequate maintenance of the existing 4.6 million km of road network is emerging as a major challenge. Many parts of the existing road network are either vulnerable to or have already suffered damage from climate induced events such as floods, high rainfall, sudden cloud bursts and land-slides. 

“To support the rural economy and communities and households that depend on rural livelihoods, it will be critical to ensure that infrastructure is built and maintained to withstand climatic changes,” said Mr Junaid Ahmad, World Bank Country Director in India. “This project will demonstrate how climate resilient construction can be integrated in the strategy and planning of rural roads,” he added. 

The PMGSY and the Bank’s involvement under this additional financing, will emphasize on managing the rural road network through green and climate-resilient construction using green, low-carbon designs and new technologies – far beyond merely funding civil works. This will be done through the following measures: 


	Climate vulnerability assessment during the design process to identify the critical locations affected by floods, water-logging, submergence, cloud bursts, storms, landslides, poor drainage, excessive erosion, high rainfall, and high temperatures. 
	Special treatment for flood-affected areas through adequate waterways and submersible roads to allow easy passage of water, use of concrete block pavements, and improved drainage; 
	Use of environmentally optimized road designs and new technologies which uses local and marginal materials and industrial by-products such as sand, local soils, fly ash, brick kiln wastes, and other similar materials in place of crushed rocks; 
	Innovative bridges and culverts through use of pre-fabricated/pre-cast units for roads and bridges having better ability to withstand earthquakes and water forces such as continuous beams, bearing free construction, and river training works; 
	Use of hill cutting material in hill roads ensuring its productive use and resolving its disposal problem, use of bio-engineering measures, improved drainage and other treatments for landslide prone areas and providing adequate slope protection. 


The Additional Financing will also fill the gender gap by creating employment opportunities for women in construction and maintenance. The earlier project had piloted community-based maintenance contracts through women self-help groups (SHGs) for routine maintenance of 200 km of PMGSY roads in Uttarakhand, Meghalaya and Himachal Pradesh. SHG-run maintenance contracts will now be extended to about 500 km roads over 5 states. 

“All components of the project will have substantial climate co-benefits and help road agencies in India to substantially minimize GHG emissions. Improving road conditions alone will result on an average in direct savings of 2.68 million tons annually in GHG emissions and minimize the annual losses of about $9 billion in the road asset value and an equal amount by way of high vehicle operating costs,” said Shri Ashok Kumar, Senior Highway Engineer and World Bank’s Task Team Leader for the project. 

The $500 million loan, from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 3-year grace period, and a maturity of 10 years.

                Terms of Reference (TOR) does not inhibit the Finance Commission in assigning appropriate weight to multiple variables on devolution (of which population is one) and in a combination of rewards and incentives which does not penalise the states which have made significant progress on population front, said the Chairman, Shri N K Singh while addressing a Press Conference in Thiruvananthapuram. Based on the TOR received, Commission is committed to addressing them. It is committed to an even handed position in regard to centre and states and viewing them in totality without any bias. He said that Commission will give a report which is fair, rational and reasonable. It has to balance the compulsions of equity and efficiency in terms of a combination of rewards and incentives.

Kerala has made enormous progress in terms of per capita income and in Human Development Index, recognised the Chairman. Chairman placed on record the Commission's appreciation for adoption of SDGs in the developmental priorities of the state. He appreciated the sate govt. for ensuring high GDP growth rate, dramatic poverty reduction and setting up a model in local self govt institutions. Kerala has set a benchmark in triple devolution of funds, functions and functionaries to the third tier of governance by creating a strong network of neighbourhood groups.

Notwithstanding, the Commission observed some deficiencies in non-utilization of funds leading to lapsing of resources and perhaps a better implementation mechanism. Commission also sought more information regarding implementation of 5th State Finance Commission recommendations. There was a strong plea that within three tiers, District Panchayat which was left out by 14th FC should be revisited for ensuring the resources to perform obligatory functions. State has also made significant progress in other social indicators like electrification and eliminating open defecation. Commission observed following challenges which the state govt needs to tackle:


	To sustain a rate of growth to deal with enormous expenditure outlays that Kerala is required to make.
	To manage its high debt to GDP ratio as per the FRBM Act of the State
	Capital expenditure needs to be enhanced.
	Kerala has problem of increasing ageing population which increases its liability.
	Fiscal deficit as well as revenue deficit of Kerala has gone up.
	Challenge of managing public sector undertakings especially State Transport Corporation and state electricity board.


Kerala looking forward for a generous and fair allocation of Resources – State suggests an alternative formula for devolution based on population

              Chief Minister Shri Pinarayi Vijayan and Finance Minister Dr. T.M Thomas Issac welcomed the Commission and thanked the members for their visit to Kerala in the early stages of deliberations. In their detailed presentations on state finances, officials emphasised on enhancing the devolution to the states, including a criteria of ‘Demographic Goals Achievement’, continuation of Revenue Deficit grants and compensating the State for the opportunity cost of preserving forest cover, among others.

The Chief Minister submitted a detailed Memorandum to the Commission. An additional memorandum would also be submitted for consideration of the sectoral needs of the State. Chairman complemented the Govt. of Kerala for making an illuminating presentation to the commission regarding the opportunities and challenges in all the sectors of the economy of the state. He also stated that the issues raised would receive appropriate consideration during deliberation in the Commission.

Commission also sought views of the leaders from various political parties, local bodies and representatives from Trade and Industry. They focussed on giving some grant for backward areas in addition to performance grants and skill development of manpower of Local Bodies.

15th Finance Commission is on a 4 day visit to the state of Kerala from 28th May 2018. It also made field visits to Nutrimix Unit at Koratti, Kodali Govt. LPS, Green Army, Vadakkancherry, Waste Management facility in Kunnamkulam Municipality, all in Thrissur on 30th May. Commission concludes its visit by visiting Kochi Metro on 31st May. The Commission appreciates the constructive and useful suggestions made by the State Govt for the development of the state and appreciated the warm hospitality extended by the State Govt. The Commission also looked forward to continuing interaction with the State Government. The Commission will finalise its recommendations by October 2019 after completing its discussions with all the State Governments, the Government of India and relevant stakeholders.

                Refunds of GST have been a concern for both the Government and Trade for the past several months. Till now, the Government has sanctioned more than Rs 30,000 crore as GST Refund. This includes an amount of Rs 16,000 crore of IGST and Rs 14,000 crore of ITC. The figures of ITC include sanction by both the Central and State Governments. Contrary to the press reports that there has been a dip in refund sanction after the first Refund Fortnight in March 2018, the refund sanctioned during May 2018 is to the tune of Rs 8,000 crore. Refund claims to the tune of Rs 14,000 crore (Rs.7,000 crore on the IGST side and Rs 7,000 crore on account of ITC) are pending with the Government as on date, as against the figure of Rs 20,000 crore projected by FIEO in the press reports. In order to liquidate the pendency, Government is starting a second “Special drive Refund Fortnight” from 31st May 2018 to 14th June 2018. This time the “Special Drive Refund Fortnight” would facilitate all types of Refund claims in which Customs, Central and State GST officers will strive to clear all GST refund applications received on or before 30.04.2018. This will include refunds of IGST paid on exports, refunds of unutilized ITC and all other GST refunds submitted in FORM GST RFD-01A.

 

The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) is implementing a solution whereby the refunds held in GSTN, in cases where the exporters have mistakenly declared their export supplies as domestic supplies, would now be transmitted to Customs EDI System. A Circular No 12/2018 dated 29-05-2018 has been issued in this regard. On receipt of the records from GSTN, the Customs System would automatically process the refunds for sanction, if no other errors are committed by exporters. 

 

Circular No 45/19/2018-GST has been issued on 30-05-2018 clarifying matters related to refund claims by an Input Service Distributor, composition dealer, exports of services and supplies made to SEZ. The circular also clarifies issues related to requirement of LUT in cases of export of exempted or non-GST goods and scope of restriction imposed under Rule 96(10).

 

All claimants may note the refund application in FORM GST RFD-01A will not be processed unless a copy of the application, along with all supporting documents, is submitted to the jurisdictional tax office. Mere online submission is not sufficient.

 

All GST refund claimants are encouraged to approach their jurisdictional tax authority for disposal of any of their refund claims submitted on or before 30.04.2018, which are still pending. In case the jurisdiction (i.e. Centre or State) has not been defined for a particular claimant, he/she can approach either of the jurisdictional tax authorities.

 

All IGST refund claimants may register on ICEGATE website, if not already done, to check their refund status. Customs field formations have been directed to gear up for anticipated response of the exporters by diverting additional manpower and infrastructural resources. Exporters are requested to come forward and avail of the opportunity to get the refunds sanctioned during this special drive.

                        No change in the GST law and taxation relating to farmers since July, 2017; Support Services to agriculture, forestry, fishing or animal husbandry are exempt from GST;  Agriculturists are also exempted from taking GST Registration.

 It has been reported in certain section of the Press that certain changes have been made in GST law relating to farmers, which will come into force with effect from 1st June, 2018 according to which farmers would be required to take registration and pay GST of 18% when they lease out their land.  

 

             This news is factually incorrect and misleading. There has been No Change in the GST law and taxation relating to farmers since July, 2017, when GST was implemented.  Support services to agriculture, forestry, fishing or animal husbandry are exempt from GST.  Such exempted support services include renting or leasing of vacant land with or without a structure incidental to its use. Thus, renting or leasing of land by farmers for agriculture, forestry, fishing or animal husbandry on batai (share cropping) or otherwise is

​also ​
exempt from GST.

 

 

               Further, agriculturists are also exempted from taking GST registration.  Agriculturist has been defined to mean an individual or an HUF who undertakes cultivation of land-

·         by own labour

·         by the labour of family

·         by servants or wages payable in cash or kind or by hired labour under personal supervision or the personal supervision of any member of the family.

                The Fifteenth Finance Commission of the Government of India is visiting the state of Kerala from 28th to 31st May 2018. The Commission led by the Chairman Shri N.K.Singh, Members – Shri Shaktikanta Das, Dr. Anoop Singh, Dr. Ashok Lahiri, Dr. Ramesh Chand and Secretary Shri Arvind Mehta along with other officials will assess the state of the finances of Kerala and the progress made in socio-economic field. Ahead of this visit, Commission understood various aspects of it from Accountant General of Kerala in New Delhi.

Kerala is the 10th largest economy in India and contributes around 4.2% of India’s GDP. Its GSDP growth rate was around 7.4% at constant price in 2016-17. State has one of the highest per capita GSDP and per capita income. In the absence of a substantive pick up in agriculture and manufacturing, the Kerala economy is largely supported by a booming service sector. The high wages (above national average) (both male and female field labour) has a bearing on cultivation and other economic activities.

NRI remittances have a major role to play in Kerala’s economy. Emigration and emigrant’s remittances continue to sustain much of the Kerala economy. Other activities in the State, particularly, in the fields of trade, real estate, and construction are also weakened by any decline in foreign remittances.’ 

Kerala has been one of the most developed and progressive states in terms of development indicators like poverty ratio, health parameters, education parameters as well as per capita income. Kerala scores better in almost all aspects vis-à-vis national averages.

Population in the working age group 15-59 years have been growing at lower rate. Hence, due to increased life expectancy and better healthcare, population above 60 years of age will be larger in near future. Therefore, social security spending of the State government will be a matter of concern.

Kerala’s literacy level is the highest amongst all the states at 94% of the population. However, learning outcome is not commensurate.

Kerala is somewhat different from the other South Indian states in that the mainstay of the public transport system in the state is the private stage carriages (PSC). Whereas PSC is a very small percentage of the total number of stage carriages in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, it accounts for about three fourths of the total number in Kerala.

The Finance Commission needs to make an in-depth Study of the recent developments and future possibilities of economic growth and development of Kerala. This will be based on the various interactions and meetings that the Commission is scheduled to have in Kerala during its visit. Kerala is the first state in the southern India that will be visited by the Fifteenth Finance Commission. 

The Commission will have meetings with Chief Minister, Ministers and other officials of the state. Detailed presentations will be made on the finances of the State Government. The Commission will also meet leaders of various political parties, Representatives of Trade and Industry. There will also be an interactive session with Urban Local Bodies and Panchayati Raj Institutions.

                Central Tax, GST Delhi East Commissionerate arrested a Shahdara based father son-duo on 22.05.2018 in case of fraudulent issuance of Input Tax Credit invoices involving evasion of approximately Rs. 28 Crores relating to Copper industry. It is the first case of arrest in Delhi, under the new tax regime that came into force on 1st July, 2017.

Searches were conducted at several places during which various incriminating documents and evidence were found. Investigation that followed revealed involvement of the father and son. Both were arrested under Section 69 (1) of CGST Act and Hon’ble CMM, Patiala House remanded them to judicial custody for 14 days.

As per Section 132 of the CGST Act, issuance of an invoice or bill without supply of goods and wrongful availment or utilization of input tax credit is a cognizable and non-bailable offence if the amount involved is over Rs 5 Crores. 

Further investigations are underway and the quantum of evasion is likely to go up. Officers are not ruling out the possibility existence of several other fake firms as the investigation moves ahead.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Turkey on trade in poppy seeds to ensure quick and transparent processing for import of poppy seeds from Turkey.

 

Details:

 

The MoU provides that –

 


	
	
		Turkish Grain Board (TMO) shall maintain an online system to enable regulation of export of poppy seeds from Turkey to India. Exporting companies shall submit application through the Agean Exporters Association (EIB) (responsibility given by law) to TMO for obtaining membership of the online System.
		Each year, the quantity of poppy seeds which shall be imported by India from Turkey shall be decided by Government of India in consultation with Government of Turkey taking into account the production of poppy seeds in Turkey in a crop year, balance from previous crop years and domestic or other export requirement of Republic of Turkey.
		The exporting companies shall get registered with the TMO. Each sales contract entered into by the exporting company with Indian importer shall be registered with TMO through the online system referred. It shall be the responsibility of TMO not to register sales contract in excess of the quantity referred to in Para 2 above.
		Taking into account the quantity as referred to in Para 2 above, every year both parties may consider to set a quantity to be imported by any Indian importer in a crop year.
		The Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN) will register the sales contract registered by TMO as per details accessed on the online system maintained by TMO in accordance with guidelines for registration laid down by Ministry of Finance, Government of India. The CBN shall upload the details of sales contract so registered by it on the online system. TMO shall allow the export in respect of only those contracts so registered by CBN.
		The TMO shall provide a legal production certificate for the poppy seeds to exporters following the submission of sales contract and the completion of other necessary procedures.
	
	


 

The MoU will promote quick and transparent processing of quota allocation and prior authorization for poppy seeds import from Turkey. In this way genuiness of import contract can be easily ensured as well as many litigation matter resulting in delay in the import can be avoided.

 

The MoU will ensure continuous availability of poppy seeds in domestic market of India and ultimately Indian consumers of poppy seeds will be benefited.

 

Background:

 

Import of poppy seeds from Turkey got withheld due to litigation resulting in great hike of price of poppy seeds in domestic market of India and hoarding of the same by some importers. Various stays given by the Court and repeated adjournment of hearing graves the situation and resulted in less availability of poppy seeds in the country leading to a great problems to the consumers. To avoid such legal complication, price rise and hoarding, an alternative mechanism needs to be evolved by way of an MoU between Government of India and Government of Turkey in which real time data can be exchanged to ensure the quantity of poppy seeds imported from Turkey is genuine and legally produced in Turkey.

                The Minister of New and Renewable Energy, Govt. of Madhya Pradesh (MP), Shri Narayan Singh Kushwah inaugurated the one day Regional Conference on the theme of “New and Renewable Energy” in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh yesterday. This was sixth such Regional Conference in the series in a lead-up to 3rd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) which is being hosted by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India in collaboration with AIIB, Government of Maharashtra, RIS and CII among others in Mumbai on 25th and 26th June, 2018. The one day Seminar in Bhopal was also organized by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India in collaboration with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) and the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI).

 

In his Address, the Minister of New and Renewable Energy, Govt. of Madhya Pradesh (MP), Shri Kushwah said that the Government of MP is putting a lot of focus on the infrastructure development for promoting the New and Renewable Energy in the State. He said that Madhya Pradesh is among the front runners in the country as far as generation of power through renewables is concerned. Shri Kushwah mentioned that the State of Madhya Pradesh is generating about 3,900 MW of power through renewables at present and contributing about 18% of the total consumption of power in the State while it was generating only 438 MW in 2012. The Minister said that the theme of the Conference “Clean and Renewable Energy” will provide an opportunity to do an in depth analysis of the infrastructure related issues to this sector. He thanked the Ministry of Finance, Government of India for choosing Bhopal for this Conference and hoped that the discussions there in will help in resolving various technical, financial and Regulatory issues related to this important Sector.

 

  Following are the major outcomes of the discussions held during different Sessions of the one day Conference on ‘Clean and Renewable Energy’ in Bhopal :

 


	There exists immense transformative potential of renewable energy in India both in view of meeting rising energy demand and from the well-being of the society.


 


	Power sector is experiencing profit in certain segments even though the sector as a whole requires a major turnaround.


 


	Per capita energy consumption is rising in India; hence the renewable energy sector would be a supplementary source of energy in the country.


 


	Stringent rigidities in this Sector have to be addressed for better outcomes.


 


	Due to various tax incentives and new initiatives of the Government of India in last 3-4 years, investment in Renewable Energy Sector has increased manifold.


 


	A rational view of markets needs to be taken while planning for any energy transition. In other words, market forces have to be respected.


 


	Besides cleaner sources of energy, the clean parameters apply equally to transmission and consumption as well.


 


	Solar and wind prices have gone down substantially which is good to consumers. Unlike the usual case, investments in the sector have not fallen due to fall in rates.


 


	Renewable energy has become more economical in the recent years than before.


 


	Bankability of projects is the key to attract sustained flow of capital to the RE sector. It is estimated that the sector may utilize the $3 trillion potential investment in the sector provided that the projects are bankable.


 


	Payment Security Fund may be created to deal with the delays in DISCOM payments.


 


	Public Private Partnership (PPP), inventing storage technologies and capacity development etc would be critical for success of investments in the Sector.


 


	International Solar Alliance focuses on massive deployment of technology which would contribute significantly to energy transition and the future energy mix.


 


	Climate change adaptation and mitigation are being factored into energy projects.


 


	Issues in roof-top solar have to be addressed amicably.


 


	Instead of project-based bonds, innovative instruments like bridge equity, patient capital, green bonds may be explored.


 


	De-risking of projects is necessary.


 


	Governance, predictability and rate of return are three pillars that determine the flow of capital to the RE sector. It is not just the rate of return but the governance and predictability part is equally important for the success of investment in RE>


 


	Concentration of RE projects in some states necessitates proper RE policy in other states as well.


 


	Viability of distributed panels needs to be addressed.


 


	Integrating different sources of renewable energy is an efficient model of meeting energy demand at affordable prices.


 


	The idea of socializing a part of the costs of RE may be thought of.


 


	Distribution companies can take the responsibility of payment assurance. Likewise, other innovations may be explored.

                The permissible limits on borrowings under Fiscal Consolidation roadmap needed to be equally applicable to Centre and States in the context of overall macroeconomic framework, opined the leading economists in a meeting with Fifteenth Finance Commission held here today. Economists further opined that it would be realistic to use contemporary population data but weightage should be assigned to population and also rewards for population stabilization policy. It could be appropriately determined by the commission. Commission needs to balance equity with efficiency.
The Fifteenth Finance Commission continued its interaction with economists and domain experts today. Significant issues raised today included:

New context post abolition of Planning Commission which has altered the traditional system of resource allocation and consequently abolition of distinction between Plan and Non-Plan funds
Furthermore, issues of uncertainty pertaining to GST needed to be fully factored in.
Issues of rewards for past performance needed to be balanced with incentivizing future performance.
Inadequacy of data and its reliability constituted a significant handicap in realistic revenue projectionand other key variables like employment as well as in determining measurable criteria.
The taxation capacity of states and any formula on devolution needed to be formed by equity, justice and uniformity.
While the TOR were broad ranging, the commission has significant latitude defining its own procedure of work under the Constitution.
There were several key challenges in making robust projections on GDP, pension liability, revenue realization and availability of resources beyond devolution for grants-in-aid.
State finances were stressed inter alia due to the behavior of Power Sector and implication of UDAY bonds on interest liability of states.
The future of Centrally Sponsored Schemes remained problematic with changing pattern of funding and a holistic view needs to be taken. 

The Chairman summing the discussion felt that continued engagement with Domain Experts over the coming months will help commission in firming up the approach before reaching tentative conclusions both on the vertical and horizontal devolution of revenue. Besides an approach for local bodies and panchayats which were both realistic and would genuinely deliver the intended resources to the beneficiaries.

                The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has has approved the signing and ratification of Agreement between India and Brunei Darussalam for the Exchange of Information and Assistance in Collection with respect to Taxes.

Details:


	The Agreement enables the competent authorities of India and Brunei Darussalam to provide assistance through exchange of information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the two countries concerning taxes covered by this Agreement.    



	The information received under the Agreement shall be treated as confidential and may be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts or administrative bodies) concerned with assessment, collection, enforcement, prosecution or determination of appeals in relation to taxes covered under the Agreement. Information may be disclosed to any other person or entity or authority or jurisdiction with the prior written consent of the information sending country.
	The Agreement also provides for automatic exchange of information between India and Brunei with respect to categories of cases.
	The Agreement also enables assistance in collection of tax revenue claims between both countries.
	The Agreement provides for Mutual Agreement Procedure for resolving any difference or for agreeing on procedures under the Agreement.
	The Agreement shall enter into force on the date of notification of completion of the procedures required by the respective laws of the two countries for entry into force of the Agreement.


The Agreement will stimulate the flow of exchange of information between India and Brunei for tax purposes which will help curb tax evasion and tax avoidance. It will also enable assistance in collection of tax revenue claims between both countries.

As such, the Agreement does not have any financial implications. Only in the event of extraordinary costs exceeding USD 500 as per Article 9 of the Agreement, the same will be borne by the Government of India. India has similar provisions in other such tax information exchange agreements.

Background: 

The Central Government is authorized under section 90 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to enter into an Agreement with a foreign country or specified territory for exchange of information for the prevention of evasion or avoidance of income tax chargeable under the Income Tax Act, 1961. Negotiations for entering into an Agreement for the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes were conducted at Brunei from 10th  to 11th January, 2017.  Pursuant to the same, the Governments of India and Brunei Darussalam have agreed on the text of the Agreement.

                 “Instead of connecting different cities and urban centers in the remote and less-developed areas, the ideal approach should be to develop it in the framework of corridors for regional development. The time has come that there should be a dedicated think tank for the North Eastern Region (NER) at the Central Government level”, said Prof. Sachin Chaturvedi, Director General, Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS), today on the final day of the two day Regional Conference on the theme of “Physical and Social Infrastructure for Regional Development” being organized by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India in Guwahati, Assam. 

 

     Discussing on the salient takeaways from the consultation of the two day, Prof. Chaturvedi said, “There were several important recommendations discussed in the two day Conference which are essential for physical and social infrastructure in the North Eastern Region (NER)”.

 

      The First Point was low integration due to the land-locked nature of the Region. Historically, the North East had strong trade linkages with the countries in South-East Asia and was a prosperous region. Post-Independence, the connectivity links were broken due to the creation of independent nations in the South Asian region. As a result, the NER became land-locked which stalled the pace of development. However, with fresh initiatives there is a greater recognition of opening of the arteries of connectivity both within NER and with neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, etc.

   

   Secondly, the NITI Aayog has recently launched the ‘NITI Forum for the North East’ which envisages that development projects in the NER will be based on the concept of “HIRA” (Highways, Inland Waterways, Railways and Airways) as spelled-out by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. Emphasis will also be made on Education, Health and Skill Development in the region. Assam 2030 is a case in point. In addition, Horticulture, Tourism, Food Processing, use of Bamboo and Made in North-East will be developed through Five Mission Mode Projects in a time-bound manner. There is a need to revive and restore maximum routes, including air strips, for better connectivity. Focus is also on connecting with Bangladesh (4 projects), Nepal (2 projects) apart from Trans Asians Railway line on which three projects are being undertaken and for two lines survey is on. 

 

       Water is a great strength in NER and should be leveraged in the most optimum manner. India has around 111 waterways. Out of 20 waterways in NER, nearly 15 are in Assam. Waterway would significantly lower transportation cost and promote trade. Dredging and maintenance of dredging is required to develop the waterways. Moreover, Inland Waterways (IWT) projects could able to mop up financial resources from the market through issue of bonds. Three ‘I’s are important: Institutions; Information and Infrastructure.

 

      Digital connectivity is the biggest challenge for the NER because of mountain terrain. Hence, special attention needs to be paid for extending digital connectivity across the region especially digital solutions for remote areas.

 

      Apparently, supply-driven approach to infrastructure development has overlooked the local developmental aspirations in NER. Besides mega infrastructure projects, micro-interventions like e.g. storage facilities could help optimize the utilization of local resources for promoting entrepreneurship and job creation. In this regard, the important point is to have a bottom-up approach rather than the top-down approach for developing the required infrastructure. Maximum vale addition at the doorstep is required. For example, single-crop agriculture in lower Assam restricts the choice of reaping the benefits of regional value chains.

      Keeping in view the special geographical dimensions of the region, there is need to have in place grass root R&D facilities at par with global standards. Local engagement is the key.

 

     Local industries in NER are losing their competitiveness due to global competition, poor infrastructure and unfavorable government rules and regulations. Proper pricing, efficient supply of raw materials and product diversification can support the local industries to catch-up. Agri-based value chains have higher prospects in the NER.

 

     NER has great potential for developing Green and Clean Energy based on generating Solar Energy.

 

       MDBs like World Bank, ADB, etc fund projects in developed States like Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and so on whereas the States like Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim those need resources for infrastructure development continue to face the problem of low resource mobilization. There should be provisions for addressing the specific financing requirements of the aspirational areas so as to ensure balanced regional development in the NER.

 

      Prof. Chaturvedi also added, “The time has come that there should be a dedicated think tank for the NER at the Central Government level. The recent initiative of NITI to establish a special forum for NER is a step in the right direction. However, I would like to add that RIS is also taking initiative to put in place a special institutional mechanism of the experts from the NER to articulate what NER needs for ensuring its holistic economic and social growth”.

   

      The Valedictory Session of the concluding day was chaired by Prof. Bhupen Sarmah, Director, Omeo Kumar Das Institute of Social Change and Development. Shri P R Jaishankar, Chief General Manager, Indian Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL), Shri Dipok Kumar Barthakur, Vice-Chairman, State Innovation & Transformation Aayog and many other dignitaries were present in the occasion.

                            The Governor of Assam, Prof. Jagdish Mukhi inaugurated the two day Seminar being organized by the Ministry of Finance on the theme of “Physical and Social Infrastructure for Regional Development” in Guwahati, Assam today. The Seminar is organized by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India in collaboration with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) and the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI).

 

             In his Inaugural Address, the Governor of Assam said, “The Government is putting a lot of focus on the infrastructure development for the all-round development of the Region. The theme of the Seminar “Physical and Social Infrastructure for Regional Development” provides an opportunity to do an in depth analysis of the core infrastructure related issues of the North Eastern States.” He added that Assam is at the heart of the Centre’s Act East Policy and the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has put Assam in resurgent growth momentum.

 

            Speaking further on the occasion, the Governor of Assam, Prof. Mukhi said that the North East also has the best reputation of being the hub for industrial communication due to its proximity to the South Asian countries. He said that successful Regional Development hinges on connecting remote areas through physical infrastructure as well as by making greater investment in social infrastructure including in health and education. He said that taking into account the relatively high female labour force participation in regions such as the North East, priority needs to be given also to policy efforts ensuring greater participation of women in the development process. Prof Mukhi said that such approaches can help take forward the goal of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ (collective efforts for inclusive growth) to its legitimate conclusion.

 

            In his Concluding Remarks, the Governor emphasized that different initiatives like UDAN, Single Window Clearance for Trade, Inland Waterways and efficient Private Sector participation etc. must be utilized for the maximum development of the region.

 

     On this occasion, a detailed presentation on AIIB was given by Miss Laurel Ostfield, Head of Communications, AIIB. She talked about the importance of what we do now that will determine the future world, we and our children will live in. Talking about AIIB’s core values, “Lean, clean and green”, she said that the goals for a greener and cleaner tomorrow have been set. She also talked about the shareholding structure of AIIB. India is the Founding Member and the second Largest Shareholder as well as a big beneficiary of AIIB. 

     In his Special Address, Shri Ravi Capoor, Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Industries and Commerce, Government of Assam pointed-out that from a historical perspective, North East was a very prosperous area in the pre-independence time. It was possible due to the fact that excellent trade routes were there during that time. He said that Assam exported tea, oil, timber and coal to the rest of the world by various rail and water routes like the Brahmaputra River then. Over 50 years in the post-independence time, river routes were completely stopped. In the recent years, Shri Capoor said that efforts have been made to make it operational again. He said that its high time for us to look for better projects for connectivity so that development can take place. It’s also time to rejuvenate rail lines to different neighborhood Asian countries. Only then, we can boost our connectivity and link it to development, Shri Capoor concluded.

     Earlier speaking at the event, Shri. P. D Sona, Principal Secretary (Tourism), Government of Arunachal Pradesh said that any policy regarding the North East has to take into account the various challenges being faced by the Region, and sought to take forward the HIRA policy (of Highways, Internet, Railways and Airways). He wanted Multilateral Finance Institutions like the AIIB to take-up the innovative projects in the region, including the ones that use clean and green energy. He added that the biggest concern of the North Eastern region is lack of digital connectivity along with other issues. He urged the AIIB to have a clear agenda regarding the development of the North Eastern Region.

          Prof Amitabh Kundu, Distinguished Fellow, RIS pointed-out the need to make the right kind of investments in the right kind of regions to reduce regional disparities. Adding to Prof Kundu's remarks, Mr Seshadri Chari, Member, Governing Council, RIS said that despite huge allocation of funds, some areas remain poor, adding that there is a need to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor regions.

      After the Inaugural Ceremony, a Session on the topic of “Infrastructure needs in Aspirational Areas” was organized in which various panelists discussed on myriad issues pertaining to the topic. Prof. Sebastian Morris from the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad gave the lead presentation. He discussed about the agriculture and its link to Regional Development as well as about human development and social movements.

       Shri. P. D Sona, Principal Secretary (Tourism), Government of Arunachal Pradesh, Shri Ravi Capoor, Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Industries and Commerce, Government of Assam, Shri Manab Majumdar, Deputy Secretary General (DDG), FICCI, Prof. Amitabh Kundu, distinguished Fellow, RIS, Miss Laurel Ostfield, Head of Communications, AIIB, Shri Seshadri Chari, Member of the Governing Council, RIS, and many other dignitaries were present in the Inaugural Function.

             Imports and exports by post are the 6th highest cited citizen grievances under CPGRAMs. Customs and Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) have worked together since a year to liberalise, reform and align laws relating to imports by Post. Since 2016, e-Commerce exports had been allowed through FPOs under MEIS incentives from the post offices at Chennai, Mumbai & Delhi. Now, Customs may be leading the reform race by permitting e-commerce exports through all FPOs, though without MEIS benefits for now. One of the major bottlenecks in the Postal System is the absence of Professional Logistics Companies which can facilitate SMEs going global through online presence and leaving postal logistics to third parties. In order to cater to the SMEs and what may come as a major boost to the Make in India program, Customs are proposing new simplified procedures for exports through India Post. In a progressive move, Amazon and DHL had been invited for making presentations on global best practices and identifying bottlenecks faced by exporters in India.“From a private sector perspective, it was great to see customs and posts coming together to find solutions for Indian e-commerce”, said Dr. Pritam Banerjee, Director (South Asia) from DHL. Chief Commissioner of Customs, Shri Sunil Sawhney, said that improvement in infrastructure at Foreign Post Offices and leveraging strengths of postal department’s pan-India outreach can unlock massive export potential. 

            Customs is planning some of these initiatives on the back of introducing non-intrusive technologies like x-ray scanning at Foreign Post offices to expedite release of goods. These measures are also likely to control smuggling of narcotics, as evidenced from the recent seizure of 300,000 tablets of psychotropic substances. In order to strengthen law enforcement, Customs will scan mail bags at the airports itself for identifying suspect consignments and contraband items.

                The Second Quarterly Crisidex Survey shows Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) had a better January-March 2018 (called the Survey Quarter, or SQ), driven by gains in the

​Manufacturing ​S​ector, compared with October-December 2017. CriSidEx is a sentiment index based on a diffusion index of 8 parameters (5 ​M​anufacturing and 3 ​Services) that have equal weights. It measures business sentiment among MSEs during the ‘​S​urvey ​Q​uarter’ (SQ, or January-March 2018) and the ‘​N​ext ​Q​uarter’ (NQ, or April-June 2018) on a scale of 0 (extremely negative) to 200 (extremely positive).

As in the First Survey, the Second Survey also gathered parametric feedback from 1,100 MSE respondents across India and sectors.

The CriSidEx score increased to 121 in SQ​ (January-March 2018)​ from 107 in October-December 2017, which validates the expectation of higher optimism made by the first quarterly survey.For April-June 2018 (called the next quarter, or NQ), expectations continue to be positive.

Within Manufacturing, Chemicals, Auto Components, and Engineering and Capital Goods-related MSEs reported strongly positive sentiment in SQ, while segments with a significant presence of unorganised enterprises such as leather & leather goods, and gems & jewellery were subdued.

MSEs in Auto Components, Chemicals, and Engineering and Capital Goods were the most optimistic about NQ.

The Services Sector also is largely optimistic. IT/ITeS, traders and health care providers had a healthy showing in SQ, but not so in logistics and construction/real estate-based MSEs. Traders, health care providers, and human resource services firms are expected to continue doing well in NQ.

Mr. Mohammad Mustafa, Chairman and Managing Director, SIDBI said that in terms of legal constitution, companies were marginally more positive than firms. Unorganised players, or micro enterprises with less than 10 employees, had a marginally larger share of respondents citing a subdued SQ.

Mr Ashu Suyash, Managing Director & CEO said that Overall, MSEs in manufacturing are slightly more optimistic than their services sector counterparts. In terms of order book, production and capacity utilisation, MSEs expect the situation to improve further in April-June 2018, and we see that corroborated in the feedback on hirings.

Unorganised MSEs also reported a slight improvement in performance. About 13% of them, with less than 10 employees, reported a bad SQ compared with 22% in October-December.

 Meanwhile, lenders hold a neutral view for NQ, with 9 out of 10 saying the overall business situation will be satisfactory.

As many as 7 out of 10 lenders did not find any change in the situation of MSE non-performing assets (NPA) accounts in SQ and majority of lenders do not expect an increase in NPA accounts in NQ.

                Despite high consistent growth clocked by Haryana in the past couple of years, sustainability of its growth will depend on how fast it is able to reduce its inter-district disparity. Addressing a Press Conference after the detailed meeting with Govt of Haryana on a wide ranging issues, acting Chairman of 15th Finance Commission, Dr. Ashok Lahiri said that Haryana has improved its fiscal management and implemented IFMS and PFMS but the state has a long way to go to ensure appropriate quality of expenditure particularly capital expenditure which is necessary to fill the gap in expenditure needs for infrastructure.

He placed on record the Commission's appreciation for adoption of SDGs in the developmental priorities of the state, however there was a continued need to improve the sex-ratio and increase expenditure in health and education sector. Though the results of GST implementation are yet to be seen fully, Haryana is doing reasonably well in its collection despite the complexity of the system. Haryana stands 3rd in GST collection. Govt of India has assured 14% revenue buoyancy for four years which covers the first year of the award period of the 15th Finance Commission. New financing mechanism needs to be evolved due to the abolition of the Planning Commission and distinction between plan and non-plan funds.

Commission noted that significant improvements have been made in the working of the power sector in achieving targets of UDAY by both the DISCOMs and state govt. The endeavor to switch to solar energy for meeting the energy needs of agriculture and also to supply the feeder is encouraging.

 

Haryana needs Equity and Efficiency based model for financial devolution 

 

Chief Minister Shri Manohar Lal and Finance Minister Capt. Abhimanyu welcomed the Commission before a detailed and pointed presentation on state finances were made by the officials. Presentation went on for more than 3 hours. In his welcome remarks, Chief Minister thanked the members for their positive and focused approach in understanding various issues related to the state. In his speech, Chief Minister highlighted the result oriented approach of the state govt. in reaching the last man with the philosophy of Ántyodaya. He said - 


	State govt is committed to double farmers' income by 2022.
	Govt has launched a new scheme to protect the farmers from distress sale and glut in the market.
	State has become ‘Kerosene Free’ from 1st April 2017 resulting in saving of about Rs 300 crore annually on subsidies.
	State stands first among North Indian states in Ease of Doing Business.


Finance Minister said that all fiscal parameters except revenue deficit are within the limits of the FRBM Act. Development of infrastructure is one of the priority areas for the govt. He sought more funds for development of infra projects of national importance, particularly considering that 40% of the state is part of NCR. He also emphasised the special requirements of grants for disaster management in NCR region considering the high population density, high rise buildings, inadequate scientific study for emergency operations and the fact that the region is in seismic Zone IV. 

 

State Govt. emphasized on following:


	Equity and efficiency based model for financial devolution.
	To consider parameters like disparities in development among the districts, capital expenditure, adoption of PFMS, improvement in Sex Ratio and Younger Demographic Profile for devolution. 
	To consider along with forest area, cropped area and irrigated area also for devolution.
	To consider scientific interventions and therefore more funds in agriculture specially for eliminating stubble burning there by reducing pollution. Also consider micro irrigation in Dark Zones . 
	There is a need to move from crop agriculture to Peri-Urban agriculture to increase the income in agricultural sector.


The Chief Minister submitted a detailed Memorandum to the Commission. Chairman complemented the Govt. of Haryana for making an illuminating presentation to the commission regarding the opportunities and challenges in all the sectors of the economy of the state. He also stated that the issues raised would receive appropriate consideration during deliberation in the Commission. 

 

Important suggestions by representatives of Political Parties, Local Bodies and Trade and Industry


Commission also sought views of the leaders from various political parties, local bodies and representatives from Trade and Industry. They emphasised some important points like :

 


	Reversing the harmful effects of the green revolution.
	Ecological preservation
	Problem of unemployment
	Education infrastructure
	Protected Agriculture by making available money for inputs
	Developing commercial livestock.
	Infrastructure and incentives for industries

The Commission appreciates the constructive and useful suggestions made by the State Govt towards empowerment of the states and their development and appreciated the the warm hospitality extended by the State Govt. The Commission also looked forward to continuing interaction with the State Government. Commission will finalise its recommendations by October 2019 after completing its discussions with all the State Governments, the Government of India and relevant stakeholders.

                Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) is established by the Government of India for regulation and development of Pension Sector in order to protect the old age income security of subscribers. PFRDA takes various initiatives from time to time in order to simplify and improve the operational issues in National Pension System (NPS) like new functionality development under NPS architecture, simplification of account opening, withdrawal, grievance management etc.

 

In this regard, during the recently held Board Meeting some important decisions were taken to improve the operational and regulation issues in National Pension System (NPS). Some of the decisions taken in the Board Meeting are as follows:

 

·         Budget announcement- Rating criteria for investments- Proposal on changing the investment grade rating from ‘AA’ to ‘A’ for corporate bonds was approved. The change is subject to a cap on investments in ‘A’ rated bonds to be not more than 10% of the overall Corporate Bond portfolio of the Pension Funds. This initiative will enlarge the scope of investment for the Fund Managers while ensuring credit quality.

·         Introduction of a Common Stewardship Code: The proposal on adoption of Common Stewardship Code, as a measure of good Corporate Governance, was approved. Further, it was also approved that the Principles enumerated in such code shall be circulated to all Pension Funds for compliance and implementation. Adoption of these Principles by Pension Funds will improve their engagement with investee companies and benefit subscribers.

·         Modification in Partial Withdrawal rules under NPS: Partial withdrawals will now be allowed to NPS subscribers who wish to improve their employability or acquire new skills by pursuing higher education/ acquiring professional and technical qualifications. Further, individual NPS subscribers who wish to set up a new business/ acquire new business will also be allowed to make partial withdrawals from his contributions. Other terms applicable to partial withdrawals will remain unchanged.

·         Increasing cap on equity investment in active choice to 75% from current 50% for Private Sector Subscribers: Presently there is a cap of 50% on equity investment under active choice in NPS. The proposal on increasing cap on equity investment in active choice to 75% from currently 50% has been approved by the Board. However, it comes with a clause of tapering of the equity allocation after the age of 50 years.

·         Currently, NPS and APY have a cumulative subscriber base of over 2.13 crore with total Asset Under Management (AUM) of more than Rs. 2.38 lakh crore.

                The Goods and Services Tax Network - Special Purpose Vehicle (GSTN-SPV) was created as a private limited, not-for-profit company under Section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956 (Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013) by Govt. of India on 28th March, 2013 with an objective to provide shared IT infrastructure and services to Centre and States Governments, tax payers and other stakeholders for implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the country. 

 

Presently, the Central Government and State Government are holding 24.5% equity shares respectively and the remaining 51% are held by non-Governmental institutions and through various mechanisms, GSTN is under strategic control of government. Majority of the GST processes including registration, filing of returns, payment of taxes, processing of refunds is IT driven and GSTN is handling large-scale invoice level data of lakhs of business entities including data relating to exports and imports. Considering the nature of ‘state’ function performed by GSTN, Council felt that GSTN be converted into be a fully owned government Company.

 

In view of the above, GST Council in its meeting held today decided:

 

Acquisition of entire 51% of equity held by the Non-Governmental Institutions in GSTN amounting to Rs. 5.1 crore, equally by the Centre and the States governments and allow GSTN Board to initiate process for acquisition of equity held by the private Companies; and

GSTN Board shall be allowed to continue the existing staff at existing terms and conditions for the a period upto five years, and shall have the flexibility of hiring people through contract on the terms and conditions similar to those used by GSTN till now while hiring regular employees.

 

The existing financial commitments given by Centre and States to GSTN to share the capital and O&M cost of the IT Systems shall continue.

                GST Council today in its 27th meeting approved principles for filing of new return design based on the recommendations of the Group of Ministers on IT simplification. The key elements of the new return design are as follows – 

 


	Onemonthly Return:All taxpayers excluding a few exceptions like composition dealer shall file one monthly return. Return filing dates shall be staggered based on the turnover of the registered person to manage load on the IT system. Composition dealers and dealers having nil transaction shall have facility to file quarterly return.


 


	Unidirectional Flow of invoices: There shall be unidirectional flow of invoices uploaded by the seller on anytime basis during the month which would be the valid document to avail input tax credit by the buyer. Buyer would also be able to continuously see the uploaded invoices during the month.There shall not be any need to upload the purchase invoices also. Invoices for B2B transaction shall need to use HSN at four digit level or more to achieve uniformity in the reporting system.  


 


	Simple Return design and easy IT interface: The B2Bdealers will have to fill invoice-wise details of the outward supply made by them, based on which the system will automatically calculate his tax liability. The input tax credit will be calculated automatically by the system based on invoices uploaded by his sellers.   Taxpayer shall be also given user friendly IT interface and offline IT tool to upload the invoices.


 


	No automatic reversal of credit: There shall not be any automatic reversal of input tax credit from buyer on non-payment of tax by the seller. In case of default in payment of tax by the seller, recovery shall be made from the seller however reversal of credit from buyer shall also be an option available with the revenue authorities to address exceptional situations like missing dealer, closure of business by supplier or supplier not having adequate assets etc. 


 


	Due process for recovery and reversal: Recovery of tax or reversal of input tax credit shall be through a due process of issuing notice and order. The process would be online and automated to reduce the human interface.  


 


	Supplier side control: Unloading of invoices by the seller to pass input tax credit who has defaulted in payment of tax above a threshold amount shall be blocked to control misuse of input tax credit facility. Similar safeguards would be built with regard to newly registered dealers also. Analytical tools would be used to identify such transactions at the earliest and prevent loss of revenue. 


 


	Transition: There will be a three stage transition to the new system. Stage I shall be the present system of filing of return GSTR 3B and GSTR 1. GSTR 2 and GSTR 3 shall continue to remain suspended. Stage I will continue for a period not exceeding 6 months by which time new return software would be ready. In stage  2, the new return will have facility for invoice-wise data upload and also facility for claiming input tax credit on self declaration basis, as in case of GSTR 3B now.


 

During this stage 2, the dealer will be constantly fed with information about gap between credit available to them as per invoices uploaded by their sellers and the provisional credit being claimed by them. After 6 months of this phase 2, the facility of provisional credit will get withdrawn and input tax credit will only be limited to the invoices uploaded by the sellers from whom the dealer has purchased goods.  

 

Content of the return and implementation: Return shall be simplified also by reducing the content/information required to be filled in the return. The details of the design of the return form, business process and legal changes would be worked out by the law committee based on these principles. Government is keen to introduce the simplified return design at the earliest to reduce the compliance burden on the trade in keeping with the philosophy of ease of doing business.

The 4th Regional Conference on ‘Futuristic, Resilient and Digital Infrastructure’ organized by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India in collaboration with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) concluded in Bengaluru today. The 2-day Conference is a lead-up event to the 3rd Annual Meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) which is going to be hosted by the Government of India on 25th and 26th June 2018 in Mumbai. The Conference saw eminent delegates representing partner institutions, academia, civil society organizations and experts from various fields expressing their views on how to bring about institutional approaches for futuristic and digital infrastructure in India.

 

The two day Conference mainly gave thrust on three (3) broad areas including the Challenges as well as Opportunities in the context of need for Futuristic, Resilient and Digital Infrastructure, Resource Mobilisation and Emerging Challenges among others.

 

The idea behind this particular Conference was to work simultaneously on these 3 focus areas for holistic understanding of a sustainable future in so far as infrastructure development is concerned. Integration (in urban planning and multi-modal transportation), inclusion, resilience were covered in the first 3 Plenary Sessions. Keeping in mind the enormous opportunities that digital technologies and the Fourth Industrial Revolution have in terms of promoting infrastructure development with focus on integration and resilience in infrastructure design and operations, as well as in influencing the very behavioral patterns of citizens and their response. It was pointed-out that Digital Infrastructure is the ‘infrastructure for infrastructure’.

 

Congestion being treated as negative externality – Experts gave lot of stress was on use of futuristic smart technologies to decongest, emerging digital technologies, satellite based services, intelligent traffic and city management much beyond real time data generation and dissemination

 

Resilience – Much is understood in terms of damage protection and minimization in times of disasters – primarily natural as well as man-made like conflicts and terrorism. 

 

The Futuristic Vision on Resilience should be able to focus on hazards, governance and institutions. Examples like – special design for hospitals to prevent inundation in times of flood; early warning systems not only for storms, tsunamis and cyclones but also for heat stress. The idea of creating Utility Maps for disaster preparedness would be futuristic and should be part of integrated planning. Community level partnerships and initiatives would be important in this regard.

 

Use of Digital Technologies would be effective for Early Warning Systems and reach maximum people. Information gathered needs to be coordinated and analysed in shorter time frames to prevent the adverse impact of both natural and man made disasters. Social cost of over-protection and hardships on preventive actions need to be factored in.

 

Integration and Agglomeration – These concepts were alluded to over and over again across different Sessions in the context of rapid urbanization. Integrated city planning holds key to inclusive development and minimizing exclusions.

 

Such integration does not only refer to having robust master-plans for city expansion but also take into account cultural and anthropological parameters characteristic of the geography. Integrated city planning also leads to design in integration of multi-modal transportation. 

 

Use of technologies, particularly digital technologies would be critical for integration and future in terms of multi-modal transportation.

 

The twin challenges of infrastructure development is to enhance agglomeration, but at the same time reduce congestion. 

 

Agglomeration economies rooted in urbanization is expected to drive productivity. However, debates rage on the futility of exclusive urban centric approach vis-à-vis a more decentralized planning and approach. Bottoms-up infrastructure development has been discussed from that stand point. 

 

However, urbanization is an outcome of people’s choices and hence policy planning needs to have realistic vision on urbanization and economic opportunities. It is becoming increasingly clear that urban expansion is rapidly happening in the suburbs and Tier-2 cities.

 

Sustainability of urban landscape would be critical from the perspective of land use, design of transportation and buildings, commute time, vertical versus horizontal city expansion (as evidence suggest that geographical expanse needed for sustainable living habitat for vertical city growth may not be substantially smaller). 

 

In terms of future of mobility –scope of high speed railway, metro railway, resource efficient public transportation, dedicated corridors etc. were analysed thread bare. Apart from considerations like current needs versus future needs technically such projects are subjected to analysis on parameters like energy consumption and emission. Usually such assessments help in planning and adoption of new modes of transportation.

 

Technological Solutions, Digital Infrastructure and Digital Economy – As already highlighted, these have enormous potential to address the above three concerns in terms of minimizing social costs and improving well being. 

 

Ubiquitous presence of digital technologies have created massive opportunities in the digital space. This is also the best way to leverage the creativity and innovation of all citizens. 

 

Devices and connectivity form the backbone of the future. Supply chains are getting transformed, inventory monitoring, assessment of depreciation and wear and tear can also be monitored in a precise way and customization is bringing more opportunities to production of goods and services. 

 

The fundamental issues around Industry 4.0 going ahead will be the capability to produce, ability to connect and capacity to use. Policy framework ignoring any one of this would result in sub-optimum and even adverse outcomes.  In this framework, trade policy regime in the context of ITA has been elaborated that has created unequal gains across countries and led to muted production of ICT goods in many countries including India. China have benefitted most among developing countries.

 

 

B. Issues of Financing

 

Beyond the existing PPP models in practice, experts suggested that the futuristic Infrastructure can be funded through land value capture – allowing land value to first increase then leveraging it for revenue apart from using pooled savings in the form of insurance and pension funds. Hence urban planning must precede transport planning. In order to make some of the future transportation projects viable, medium capacity transit systems has to be adopted more widely. This also has implications for electrification of public transportation beyond current focus on private electric vehicles.

 

Rapid technological change carries obsolescence risk where yesterday’s cutting edge technology is tomorrow’s discard. This structural risk can slow down the adoption of socially beneficial technologies. Slow adoption can also be engineered by those who stand to lose their investments from new technologies.  This may require public action in terms of financing models and regulatory oversight.

 

While commenting on the paradigm of infrastructure financing it was discussed, that the earlier focus on assessment of infrastructure gaps is fast shifting towards financing growth centres that promote agglomeration in the positive sense. Increasingly, infrastructure for competitiveness is being mainstreamed by multilateral banks like the ADB has adopted this model. VCIC and Eastern Corridor were presented as examples.

 

 

Emerging Challenges

 

Security and privacy in the context of digital technologies.

 

Future of Work –No direct answer, depends on the technological opportunities and sectors, for India wage based competitiveness would still remain relevant counter-actingthe job replacement effects

 

Market failures in positive, futuristic and relevant innovations – This issue is a major concern for disaster resilient infrastructure for obvious reasons.

 

Technology Choices and Effectiveness – Broadband versus Wireless Mobile communication has huge implications for connectivity and digital empowerment. Much of India’s expenditure on telecom infrastructure is in the domain of spectrum procurement. The Government has made tremendous progress in laying down country wide network in the form of Bharat Net. It has been pointed-out that the threshold data delivery speed is sub-optimal and serviceability of the infrastructure needs improvement.

 

Bottoms-up Approach – Experts stressed on bottoms-up approach leading to improvement of capacity at the grassroots level. This should be the focus of digitisation. Rural-urban gaps in internet access need to be plugged as soon as possible.

                A first by 15th Finance Commission - Conference on Agriculture sector

 

R&D, use of ICT and integration of service sector and MSMEs with agriculture are the key to doubling farmers income - thoughts that were echoed by the participants of the Agriculture Conference in Chandigarh, moderated by Dr. Ramesh Chand, Member, 15th Finance Commission. 

         Ahead of its meetings with Haryana Govt on 4th May, 15th Finance Commission today held an interactive session on Agriculture. Eminent agriculture scientists from State Agriculture Universities from across the country and agriculture economists along with other agencies like NABARD, Punjab Farmers Commission etc. attended it.

 

R&D, use of ICT and integration of service sector and MSMEs with agriculture are the key to doubling farmers income 

 

        Various luminaries of the likes of Prof. Sardara Singh Johl and Prof. Abhijit Sen participated. Prof Johl said General universities need to be roped in alongwith Agricultural Universities to strengthen agricultural research as well as basic research. It can not be left only to private agencies. ICT should be used to develop knowledge centres in villages. Prof Abhijit Sen complimented the Commission for holding the conference on Agriculture, a first by any Commission. He said that structural reforms are required in this sector. Planning needs to be based on resources and agro-economic zones. 

Addressing the media after the conference, acting Chairman of the Commission Dr. Ashok Lahiri said that as such Commission is not mandated to consider any sectoral allotments but needs of the Indian Economy can not be understood holistically without understanding the needs of the agriculture sector. He emphasised that Equity, Efficiency and Sustainability are the key considerations for the Finance Commission. He highlighted the salient points, which were discussed as follows:


	Resource need evaluation in agriculture is required.
	Challenge of climate change affecting all the facets of agriculture.
	Impact of price support and market mechanism.
	Role of land ownership and crop diversity


Participants discussed a wide ranging spectrum of issues pertaining to agriculture. Agricultural productivity, cropping patterns, crop diversity, climate resilience, focus on small and marginal farmers, agriculture subsidies, private sector investment, strengthening the agricultural universities across the country were the issues discussed.

                The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has entered into one Unilateral Advance Pricing Agreement (UAPA) during the month of April, 2018. With the signing of this Agreement, the CBDT has achieved another milestone of having signed its 200th UAPA. The total number of APAs entered into by CBDT has gone up to 220, which, inter alia include 20 Bilateral APAs. The UAPA signed in this month also happens to be the first APA in the current financial year. 

 

The UAPA entered into during April, 2018 pertains to provision of sourcing support services.

 

The progress of the APA scheme strengthens the Government’s resolve of fostering a non-adversarial tax regime. The Indian APA programme has been appreciated nationally and internationally for being able to address complex transfer pricing issues in a fair and transparent manner.

                The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has entered into one Unilateral Advance Pricing Agreement (UAPA) during the month of April, 2018. With the signing of this Agreement, the CBDT has achieved another milestone of having signed its 200th UAPA. The total number of APAs entered into by CBDT has gone up to 220, which, inter alia include 20 Bilateral APAs. The UAPA signed in this month also happens to be the first APA in the current financial year. 

 

The UAPA entered into during April, 2018 pertains to provision of sourcing support services.

 

The progress of the APA scheme strengthens the Government’s resolve of fostering a non-adversarial tax regime. The Indian APA programme has been appreciated nationally and internationally for being able to address complex transfer pricing issues in a fair and transparent manner.

                The total Gross GST revenue collected in the month of April 2018 is Rs.1,03,458 crore of which CGST is Rs18,652 crore, SGST is Rs.25,704 crore,  IGST is Rs. 50,548 crore (including 21,246 crore collected on imports) and Cess is Rs.8554 crore (including Rs.702 crore collected on imports).  The total number of GSTR 3B Returns filed for the month of March up to 30th April, 2018 is 60.47 lakh as against 87.12 lakh, who are eligible to file the Return for the month of March, which is 69.5%. 

 

April was also the month for filing of Quarterly Return for Composition Dealers.  Out of 19.31 lakh Composition Dealers, 11.47 lakh have filed their Quarterly Return (GSTR 4) which is 59.40% and have paid total tax of Rs.579 crores, which is included in the above figure of Rs.1.03 lakh crore of total GST collection.

 

The buoyancy in the tax revenue of GST reflects the upswing in the economy and better compliance.  However, it is usually noticed that in the last month of the Financial Year, people also try to pay arrears of some of the previous months also and, therefore, this month’s revenue cannot be taken as trend for the future.

 

The total revenue earned by the Central Government and the State Governments after settlement in the month of April, 2018 is Rs.32,493 crore for CGST and Rs.40,257 crore for the SGST.

                Following directions of the Union Health Minister, Shri J P Nadda, a multi-disciplinary Central Team led by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is presently in Kerala constantly reviewing the situation of the Nipah Virus Disease. 

After reviewing the cases of all the patients who have lost their lives, the Central High-level Team is of the view that the Nipah virus disease is not a major outbreak and is only a local occurrence. The Team has also further fine-tuned the draft guidelines, case definitions, advisory for healthcare workers, information to the general public, advisories for sample collection and transportation accordingly.   

The Central Team held meetings with the District Collectors and the medical and para-medical staff of the hospitals today also to review the condition of the admitted patients and to consider further course of action to be taken to prevent the disease from spreading.  The efforts taken so far for containment of the disease have been fruitful as the disease has not spread to new areas.  The contact tracing strategy adopted has also been successful.  It has been found that all the reported cases including the suspected cases had direct or indirect contact with the first casualty/his family prior to contacting the disease.

General awareness among the general public has been encouraging.  They have been asked to follow safe hygiene practices, not to consume fruits/vegetables partly eaten by birds/animals and steps to be taken while going near the infected persons/areas. The State Government has also issued advisories in the vernacular.  The continued round-the-clock presence of the Central and State Teams in the affected areas right from day one of the outbreak and the surveillance and preventive actions taken by them, have instilled confidence among the public.

The Team also reviewed/discussed with the hospitals the management and treatment of the patients.  The treatment procedure adopted by the hospitals for the patients with specific/non-specific symptoms has been found effective.  The suspect cases admitted in the Kozhikode Medical College and Trivandrum Medical College are under observation.

All healthcare workers have adopted safe practices for dealing with the patients.  The Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare is closely monitoring the situation.

Details of cases and deaths, as on 24.5.2018, are as under:

Total number of confirmed cases: 14 

Total number of suspected cases: 20

Total number of deaths:  12 (9 from Kozhikode and 3 from Malappuram)

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for restructuring of balance sheet of Scooters India Limited, Lucknow (SIL) by way of:

 


	reduction of equity of Rs. 85.21 crore in the share capital of SIL held by Government of India against accumulated losses. The reduction would be deemed to have taken effect as on 31.03.2013 and 
	freezing the interest on the Non-Plan loan of Rs. 1.89 crore released to SIL during 2012-13 from the date of its release to the company and conversion into equity of the outstanding principal amount of Rs. 1.89 crore.


 

With this approval, the balance sheets of Scooters India Limited from 2012-13 onwards will be regularised and further restructuring will be effected accordingly. This is also expected to clear a hurdle in the process of disinvestment of the company.

                The Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare, Shri J P Nadda is closely monitoring the situation arising out of reported cases and deaths due to Nipah Virus in Kerala. He has reviewed it with Secretary (HFW) Ms. Preeti Sudan and DG (ICMR) Dr.Balram Bhargava and has directed for all support to be extended to Kerala in its prevention and management. Following directions of the Union Health Minister, a multi-disciplinary Central team from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is presently in Kerala constantly reviewing the situation. The Central team includes Dr.Sujeet K Sing, Director, NCDC; Dr. S K Jain, Head Epidemiology, NCDC; Dr. P Ravindran, Director, Emergency Medical Relief (EMR);Dr Naveen Gupta, Head Zoonosis, NCDC; Dr Ashutosh Biswas, Prof Internal Medicine, AIIMS; Dr. Deepak Bhattacharya, Pulmonologist, Safdarjung Hospital along with two clinicians and one expert from Ministry of Animal Husbandry.

The NCDC team visited the house in Perambra from where the initial death was reported.  The team found many bats housed in the well from where the family was drawing water.  Some bats have been caught and have been sent for lab examination to confirm whether they are the cause of the disease or not. 60 different samples have been collected from the spot and sent for examination. There are two confirmed cases with history of contact with the index case. They were admitted in the Calicut Medical College Hospital and died due to Nipah virus.

The Ministry has mobilized a public health team from NCDC Branch Kozhikode to assess the extent of problem, for risk assessment and risk management.  They are assisting the State Level Team already deployed at the epicentre.  So far, seven patients have been admitted in Baby Memorial Hospital and in the Govt. Medical College at Kozhikode and at the Amrutha Medical College, Ernakulum.

Union Minister for Health, Shri J P Nadda has urged citizens not to believe in rumours posted on social media and not to spread panic.  

 

The field team has advised hospitals to follow intracranial pressure (ICP) guidelines, use personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers and sample collection; assist in enhancing active fever surveillance in the community; strengthen contact tracing in close contacts of cases, relatives, health care workers; ensure isolation facilities, ventilator support and hospital infection control practices; and coordinate with animal sector and enhance surveillance for unusual illness and deaths in animals.

The Ministry has ensured availability of diagnostic kits, personal protective equipment and risk communication materials. High quality personal protection equipment has been provided to health care personnel. A total of nine individuals are currently under treatment. Isolation wards have been opened in many hospitals in Kozhikode. Hospitals in public and private sector have been provided with personal protective equipment. Appropriate steps to contain this virus have been taken among domestic animals such as pigs. Since all the contacts are under observation and steps to avoid exposure through animal vectors have been taken there is no reason for people to panic. This appears to be a localisedoccurrence.

With early and efficient containment measures undertaken jointly by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and Government of Kerala, the outbreak is unlikely to spread. The Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory at Manipal Hospital and the National Institute of Virology, apremier institute for research in virology, are geared up to meet any diagnostic challenges that may arise.

                “India is firmly committed to achieving universal health coverage for its citizens as has been articulated in our National Health Policy 2017.” This was stated by Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare during his addresses at the Plenary Meeting of the 71st World Health Assembly, at Geneva today. The Health Minister spoke on the theme: Health for All: Commit To Universal Health Coverage.

Reiterating the commitment of the government, the Union Health Minister said that India has fast-tracked many initiatives aimed at achieving all the tenets of Universal Health Coverage i.e strengthening health systems, improving access to free medicines and diagnostics, reducing catastrophic health care spending to translate our vision of achieving UHC. The Union Health Minister further said that our Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has recently launched Ayushman Bharat. The programme rests on the twin pillars of Health and Wellness Centres, the provision of comprehensive primary healthcare services and the Prime Minister’s National Health Protection Mission for secondary and tertiary care for 100 million families covering 500 million individuals. “We are reaching out to approximately 40% of the country’s population who will be provided an insurance cover of Rs 500,000 per year. This will be the world’s largest government funded health protection scheme in the world” Shri Nadda added.

Shri Nadda further said that to reduce the burden of NCDs, India has already initiated universal screening for prevention and management of five common NCDs: hypertension, diabetes and three common cancers – those of the oral cavity, breast and cervix for individuals at pan India level. We have also started providing medicines for cancers, cardiovascular diseases and cardiac implants at significantly reduced prices,” Shri Nadda elaborated. 

Shri Nadda informed the participants that in line with India’s ambitious plan to end TB by 2025, the Government has started the implementation of the National Strategic Plan for TB and allocated 550 million dollars. “Apart from rapid scale up of diagnostics and treatment, we have introduced supplementary nutrition for patients for duration of treatment,” Shri Nadda said.

 

Earlier, Shri J P Nadda also addressed the Commonwealth Health Ministers Meeting on the sidelines of the 71st World Health Assembly and spoke about the global fight against Non-Communicable Disease (NCDs). He said that interventions for prevention and control of NCDs are to be prioritized and are to be integrated at all levels of health care delivery systems.  He said that for comprehensive management of lifestyle related disorders, a pilot project on ‘Integration of AYUSH with National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS)’ has been initiated. Synergy is being harnessed between Allopathy system under NPCDCS and alternative systems of medicine under AYUSH, for prevention and management of ‘lifestyle-related’ common NCDs, he added.

In another address at the Commonwealth Health Ministers’ Meeting, Shri Nadda spoke on the Universal Health Coverage Funding Mechanisms in the Commonwealth. Shri Nadda said that both developed as well as developing countries are aspiring to achieve Universal Health Coverage through either a purely tax-funded regime, or risk pooling under social health insurance mechanisms or a mix of both. India has followed a mix of these strategies and so far, revenues from general taxation are the primary source of government funding, since coverage under the social health insurance is low due to low proportion of organised workforce. “India’ s National Health policy, 2017 commits to achieving a target of raising public health expenditure to 2.5% of the GDP in a time bound manner by 2025 and the government is committed to providing the resources for achieving Universal Health Coverage,”

Shri J P Nadda also inaugurated ‘Walk the Talk’ event and gave a call ‘Health for all, Yoga for all’. He also led the yoga session ahead of 71st World Health Assembly. Delegates from across the world participated in the yoga session. Shri Nadda said that Yoga can help in several medical conditions and want to spread it globally and be embraced by people so that they can benefit from it.

The Union Health Minister also held bilateral meetings with his counterparts from UK, Brazil and Sweden on the side-lines of World Health Assembly.

The Hon’ble Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today addressed the Annual Convocation of Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) in presence of Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Smt Anupriya Patel, Ministers of State for Health and Family Welfare.

 

Addressing the participants, the Vice President of India stated training of young professionals in the sciences and art of medicine is one of the most sacred duties one can ever perform. “You are not only imparting knowledge and helping students imbibe skills but you are also facilitating the internalization of a set of values. Patience, understanding, empathy, soothing expression and skillful assessment are crucial for a successful career in medicine,” the Vice President said.

 

In his address, the Vice President further stated that the private sector must not only supplement the efforts of the government in bridging the urban-rural divide in the health sector, but must adopt a more humane and philanthropic approach and ensure that healthcare is affordable and accessible. Shri Naidu also lauded the government for Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Swasthya Suraksha Mission (PMRSSM) that will provide universal health care to 50 crore poor and vulnerable people.

He urged the students to maintain the highest standards of ethics and integrity at every stage. “I am sure that all the students of the Lady Hardinge Medical College will carry on the legacy of this prestigious institute and contribute towards building a healthy India,” the Vice President added.

 

Congratulating the students, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare said that the students graduating today must not stop learning and should always enhance their skills and knowledge. They must not also forget their responsibility towards the society and the patients they are treating. “The main aim of your training is to serve people and poverty should never come in between. “The advice you give to your patients should not result in destitution. No person should be left without treatment due to lack of money,” Shri Choubey said.

 

Highlighting the initiatives of the Ministry, Shri Choubey stated that the Government has increased the age of retirement of doctors to 65 years and is setting up of more medical and nursing schools. He further said that the government is multi-skilling doctors to overcome the shortage of specialists. Shri Choubey said that the introduction of National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) would benefit students’ fraternity across the country as they will not have to appear in multiple entrance exams and such an exam will lead to greater transparency, reduce the burden on prospective students, mitigate litigation in various courts of law with respect to the examination process and ensure better standards of Medical Education.

 

Shri Choubey further said that suitable amendments have also been carried out in the Graduate Medical Education Regulations and Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations for making common counseling for admission in Medical Colleges mandatory and existing medical colleges are being upgraded by setting up of Super Specialty Blocks in 70 such medical colleges in the entire country.

 

Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey awarded degrees to 81 post graduates and 175 graduate students. He also gave away 38 medals and prizes to the meritorious students.

 

Dr. Promila Gupta, DGHS and Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Additional Secretary (Health) and Dr Rajiv Garg, Director, LHMC, along with the senior officers and faculty of the Institute were also present at the function.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, was the Chief Guest at the International Nurses Day Celebrations organized by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare at Rashtrapati Bhawan, here today. At the function, Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare conferred the Florence Nightingale Awards to 35 nurses from across the country in presence of Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare and Smt Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health). 

The President congratulated the award winners and said that the awardees display India’s unity in diversity. He further stated that nursing plays a very vital role in keeping the country healthy. “Any nurse, in a remote village, who is helping a person fight a serious illness, is a nation builder,” the President said. 

The President also appreciated the Health Ministry for its efforts and initiatives to improve and enhance the nursing education in the country. The President stated that in the past few years, the number of institutions for nursing education has increased. As a result, the number of registered nurses and other health workers had crossed 27 lakh till March 2017.

Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Shri J P Nadda congratulated the award winners and appreciated their exemplary services. Acknowledging the strong caring and compassionate attitude of the nursing community, the Health Minister said that we are proud of all the winners and wish that they will be an inspiration for all the nursing personnel in the country and motivate them to provide quality nursing services and standards. 

Speaking at the function, the Health Minister stated that the Government strongly believes that health is a human right.  “This belief was the cornerstone for genesis and introduction of world’s largest healthcare scheme- the ‘Ayushman Bharat’, by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji, earlier this year,” Shri Nadda said.

Stating several initiatives of the Health Ministry, Shri Nadda said that the Health Ministry has approved and rolled out the curriculum of nurse practitioner programs developed by Indian Nursing Council (INC) and has initiated the development of a technology platform called the Indian Nurses Live Register in collaboration with INC and development partners, which would help the Government for optimum manpower planning and making policy level decisions for the nursing professionals in India.  He also appealed to nurse leaders in both education and service sectors to train nurses to deliver world’s best quality education and nursing care based on educational and practice standards of INC and in line with regional, national and global health needs.

Shri Nadda further said that the Government is committed to developing the capacities of healthcare professionals, especially nurses by; establishing nursing schools in every large district or cluster of districts with about 20- 30 lakh population, improving the quality of nursing education, developing specialized nursing training courses, establishing cadres like Nurse Practitioners and Public Health Nurses and rolling out Nurses Registration and Tracking System (NRTS).

Florence Nightingale awards were instituted in the year 1973 by the Government as a mark of recognition for the meritorious services rendered by nurses to the society. These awards are given on 12th May every year. A total of 35 awards i.e. 20 for Nurses, 12 for Auxiliary Nurse Mid-wives and 3 for Lady Health Visitors are being awarded to outstanding Nursing Personnel. The award carries a medal, a certificate, a citation certificate and Rs. 50,000/-in cash to each of the awardees. 

Also present at the award ceremony were, Shri Arun Singhal, Additional Secretary (Health), Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Additional Secretary (Health) and Dr RK Vats, AS & DG (CGHS)  along with other senior officers and invitees.

                A two day national consultation conference on operationalizing the Health and Wellness Centres (HWC) for provision of Comprehensive primary health care under Ayushman Bharat was organized by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare with technical support from the National Health Systems Resource Centre, recently.  Participants included the Principal Secretaries and Mission Directors of NHM from states, National Knowledge Partners, representatives of the Innovation and Learning Centres for CPHC and development partners. The consultation was also chaired by Dr. Vinod Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, Smt Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health) and Shri Manoj Jhalani, AS&MD.

The key objective of the meeting was to come to a shared and common understanding of the multiple components to enable HWC to deliver comprehensive primary health care, and obtain inputs to the draft Operational Guidelines.

Workshop proceedings started with an overview presentation of the various components of Comprehensive Primary Health Care.  It emphasized the critical importance of selecting motivated candidates as Mid-Level Health Providers and strengthening the Primary Health Care team including the Multi-Purpose Workers (male and female) and ASHA.  The importance of the shift from selective to comprehensive primary health care, the uninterrupted availability of medicines for chronic diseases, and the criticality in establishing a seamless continuum of care, to build trust and confidence in the public health system and in reducing out of pocket expenditure were highlighted. The presentations also drew attention to the platforms created under the National Health Mission which could be effectively leveraged to operationalize and scale up HWC.   In addition, the importance of integrating active case finding for tuberculosis in HWC to meet the national commitment of TB elimination was emphasized. 

State participants worked in groups on the following themes: Infrastructure and planning for HWCs, human resources, and institutionalizing the Mid-Level Health Provider, inputs required for HWC in urban areas, organizing referrals and continuum of care, making IT systems work for primary health care, expanding access at primary health care level to essential medicines and diagnostics, and financing.  The workshop also provided an opportunity for the participants to seek clarification on various issues.   

States were asked to develop state specific action plans indicating timelines. In the first year of the implementation, States were urged to prioritize all PHCs as HWCs in the selected blocks and districts, where infrastructure and HR were already in place. Aspirational districts were to be prioritised. Concurrent strengthening of Sub Health Centres as HWC  (HWC-SHC) would also be undertaken in a phased manner so as to meet the commitment of operationalizing 1,50,000 HWC by 2022. However, it was emphasized that the screening, prevention, control and management of non-communicable diseases, which is one of the packages of expanded services under CPHC, should be widely offered at HWC-SHC in order to address the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. 

States were asked to provide inputs to the draft operational guidelines which are expected to be finalized soon, and to undertake orientation of state and district teams on the concept and vision of delivering Comprehensive Primary Health Care through the Health and Wellness Centres.

                Shri Indu Bhushan, CEO, Ayushman Bharat-PMRSSM along with Shri Alok Saxena, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Dr. Dinesh Arora, Director (Ayushman Bharat) held consultations with representatives from leading general and standalone health insurance companies, and hospitals (Super speciality, General, Multi-speciality and hospitals from Tier 1 and Tier 2 towns). Representatives from industry bodies such as CII, FICCI, IRDA, NABH, NatHealth and QCI also participated in the consultations and provided valuable inputs to the discussion. 

The representatives were appreciative of the initiative being undertaken in PMRSSM and of the substantial engagement of all the stakeholders covering all the aspects like operational guidelines, model tender document, empanelment criterion, package details and rates etc.

Shri Indu Bhushan emphasized that, “We need to design the scheme to ensure that the targeted beneficiaries get maximum benefits and we can expand access to quality health services in rural areas and Tier-2 and 3 cities. This can be done only when Government, hospitals and insurance companies work together as partners” 

The deliberations with the insurance companies were focussed on how to get the most competitive rates without compromising the quality of healthcare services and prevent frauds. Representatives from hospitals highlighted the need for timely payments for their services by insurance companies/ trust. They were appreciative of the claim management process that has been incorporated in the Mission.

Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has invited comments/inputs on the model tender document and the guidelines. The stakeholders have sought extension keeping in view that the issues raised are complex and requires detailed deliberations. In view of the requests, it has been decided to extend the last date for submission of comments to 5th May, 2018.

PMRSSM has been designed to provide financial protection and prevent catastrophic health care expenditures to over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families and endow a cover for cashless hospitalization services of up to Rs. 5 lakh per family per year.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister ShriNarendraModi has given its approval for continuation of  PradhanMantriSwasthyaSurakshaYojana (PMSSY) beyond 12th Five Year Plan for a period 2017-18 to 2019-20 with a financial outlay of Rs. 14,832 crores.

Expressing gratitude to the Prime Minister for his constant support, Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare said that the Government is consciously working towards improving health infrastructure as well as health manpower in the country. “Setting up of new AIIMS would not only transform health education and training but will also address the shortfall of health care professionals. Construction of new AIIMS is fully funded by the Central Government and the Operations and Maintenance expenses on new AIIMS are also fully borne by the Central Government,” ShriNadda elaborated. 

ShriNadda further stated that setting up new AIIMS in various states will lead to employment generation for nearly 3000 people in various faculty and non faculty posts in each of the AIIMS. He said that indirect employment generation will take place due to facilities and services like shopping centre, canteens, etc. coming in the vicinity of new AIIMS. The Union Health Minister added that for each functional AIIMS established under PMSSY, a total of 4089 posts were created for a 960 bedded hospital.  “The same number of posts will be created for a 960 bedded hospital for the new AIIMS that are being established under PMSSY. So far, for new AIIMS at Mangalagiri, Nagpur and Kalyani, a total of 1144 posts have been created with the approval of Ministry of Finance,” ShriNadda mentioned.

Highlighting the benefits of the scheme, ShriNadda said that each new AIIMS will add 100 UG (MBBS) and 60 B.Sc (Nursing) seats, 15-20 Super Specialty Departments and around 750 hospital beds. He further said that in each GMC up-gradation project, 8-10 Super Specialty Departments get added on an average and an up-gradation project also gives benefit of adding of around 15 new PG seats on an average. “As per data of current functional AIIMS, it is expected that each new AIIMS would cater to around 1500 OPD patients / day and around 1000 IPD patients / month,” ShriNadda said.

The Union Health Minister said that PMSSY aims at correcting regional imbalances in the availability of affordable/reliable tertiary healthcare services and also at augmenting facilities for quality medical education in different regions of the country.He said that that various initiatives under PMSSY will lead to development of apex level medical education and nursing education and connected research facilities. It will also lead to creation of tertiary level health care infrastructure through establishment of new AIIMS and will improve the referral system and enhance cross linkages between primary, secondary and tertiary level health care facilities.

ShriNaddaemphasized that schemes under PMSSY will result in reduction of disparities to access quality health services between the States and regions. He further stated that the scheme will also address imbalances in human resources development and in the availability of quality trained medical, nursing manpower for public health care delivery system through establishment of medical and nursing colleges. The schemes will lead to improvement in health outcomes through adequate and timely intervention of medical/health services, ShriNadda said.

                          In a major boost to the expansion of healthcare infrastructure in the country, the Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the continuation of Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) beyond 12th Five Year Plan to 2019-20.  The financial outlay for this purpose is Rs 14,832 crore.  Under this scheme, new AIIMS are established and Government medical colleges are upgraded.

Objectives:

The PMSSY, a Central Sector Scheme, aims at correcting the imbalances in the availability of affordable tertiary healthcare facilities in different parts of the country in general, and augmenting facilities for quality medical education in the under-served States in particular.

Impact: 

Setting up of new AIIMS would not only transform health education and training but also address the shortfall of health care professionals in the region. Construction of new AIIMS is fully funded by the Central Government. The Operations & Maintenance expenses on new AIIMS are also fully borne by the Central Government.

Upgradation programme broadly envisages improving health infrastructure through construction of Super Specialty Blocks/Trauma Centers etc. and procurement of medical equipment for existing as well as new facilities on Central and State share basis.

Employment Generation: 

Setting up new AIIMS in various states will lead to employment generation for nearly 3000 people in various faculty & non-faculty posts in each of the AIIMS. Further, indirect employment generation will take place due to facilities & services like shopping centre, canteens, etc. coming in the vicinity of new AIIMS.

The upgradation programme is carried out in selected Government Medical Colleges (GMCs) by agencies appointed by the Government of India under the direct supervision of the Central Government. Post-Graduate seats and additional faculty posts as per norms will be created and filled up in these GMCs by the respective State/UT Governments.

The construction activity involved for creation of the physical infrastructure for the various new AIIMS and Government Medical Colleges' upgradation projects being undertaken under the scheme is also expected to generate substantial employment in the construction phase as well.

Background:

The PMSSY was announced in 2003 with objectives of correcting regional imbalances in the availability of affordable/ reliable tertiary healthcare services and also to augment facilities for quality medical education in the country. PMSSY has two components -


	Setting up of AIIMS-like institutions; and
	Up-gradation of existing State Government Medical College (GMCs).

                          The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given approval to accede to the Protocol under World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on tobacco control to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products. It will be applicable to both smoking and chewing or smokeless tobacco (SLT) forms as  negotiated and adopted under Article 15 of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC).  India is a party to WHO FCTC.

Details:

The protocol lays down obligations of the parties. It spells out supply chain control measures that must be adopted by the parties viz. licensing of manufacture of tobacco products and machinery for manufacturing of tobacco products, due diligence to be kept by those engaged in production, tracking and tracing regime, record keeping, security; and measures to be taken by those  engaged in e-commerce, manufacturing in free-trade zones and duty free sales. 

The protocol lists out offences, enforcement measures such as seizures and disposal of seized products. It calls for international cooperation in information sharing, maintaining confidentiality, training, technical assistance and cooperation in scientific and technical and technological matters.

Impact:

Elimination of illicit trade in tobacco products through strengthened regulation will help in strengthening comprehensive tobacco control, leading to reduction in tobacco use which in turn, will result in reduction in disease burden and mortality associated with tobacco use.

Accession to such treaty will provide actionable alternatives against such prevailing practices that are affecting public health at large. India, being at the forefront of tobacco control, would be able to influence the international organizations including World Custom Organization in controlling such illicit trade.

The protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products is a path breaking initiative in strengthening global action against tobacco and is also a new legal instrument in public health. It is a comprehensive tool to counter and eventually eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products and to strengthen legal dimensions for international health cooperation.

Background:

          The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is the first international public health treaty negotiated under the auspices of the WHO. The objective of FCTC is to provide a framework for supply and demand reduction measures for tobacco control at the national, regional and global levels.

          One of the key tobacco supply reduction strategies contained in Article 15 of WHO FCTC envisages elimination of all forms of illicit trade and tobacco products, including smuggling, illicit manufacturing and counterfeiting. Accordingly, the said Protocol was developed and adopted by the Conference of Parties (COP) which is the governing body of FCTC. The protocol is divided into 10 parts and contains 47 Articles.

                The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has has approved the strengthening of the mechanism for resolution of commercial disputes of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) inter se and also between CPSEs and other Government Departments/Organizations. The Cabinet decision is based on recommendations of the Committee of Secretaries (CoS). The decision will put in place an institutionalized mechanism within the Government for speedy resolution of commercial disputes of CPSEs without the matter being referred to the Courts of law.

Details:


	A new two-tier mechanism will be put in place of the existing Permanent Machinery of Arbitration (PMA) mechanism to resolve commercial disputes (excluding disputes concerning the Railways, Income Tax, Custom & Excise Departments) between CPSEs inter se and CPSEs and Government Departments/Organizations, outside the Courts of law.
	At the First level (tier), such commercial disputes will be referred to a Committee comprising of Secretaries of the administrative Ministries/Departments to which the disputing CPSEs/Parties belong and Secretary-Deptt. of Legal Affairs. The Financial Advisors (FAs) of the two concerned administrative Ministries/Departments will represent the issues related to the dispute in question before the above Committee. In case the two disputing parties belong to the same Ministry/Department, the Committee will comprise Secretary of the administrative Ministry/Department concerned, Secretary-D/o Legal Affairs and Secretary-Department of Public Enterprises. In such a case, the matter may be represented before the Committee by the FA and one Joint Secretary of that Ministry/Department.


Further, in case of a dispute between CPSE and State Government's Department/Organization, the Committee will be comprised the Secretary of the Ministry/Department of the Union to which the CPSE belongs and Secretary-D/o Legal Affairs and a senior officer nominated by the Chief Secretary of the State concerned. In such a case, the matter may be represented before the Committee by concerned Principal Secretary of the State Government's Department/ Organization.


	At the Second level (tier), in case the dispute remains unresolved, even after consideration by the above Committee, the same will be referred to the Cabinet Secretary, whose decision will be final and binding on all concerned.
	For the prompt disposal of disputes, a time schedule of 3 months at the first level has been prescribed.


Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) will issue guidelines immediately to all CPSEs through their administrative Ministries/Departments and State Governments/UTs for compliance.

The new mechanism will promote equity through mutual/collective efforts to resolve commercial disputes thereby reducing the number of litigations regarding commercial disputes in Court of Law and also avoid wastage of public money.

                Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said the Central Government during the last 48 months has achieved notable successes. Addressing a press conference in Bhopal today, Shri Rajnath Singh said we see a renewed hope and belief in international community regarding India's economic growth prospects. In last four years India's standing in international fora and our economic stature has increased manifold, he added.

“There was a time when India’s GDP growth rate used to hover around 3 percent and it was called “Hindu Rate of Growth”. After Independence for decades India's GDP growth was very less. International community doubted our ability to register impressive growth. It was during the tenure of the former Prime Minister Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee Indian economy realised its true potential and our GDP crossed 8 percent,” said Shri Rajnath Singh.

As a result of fiscal prudence, Shri Rajnath Singh said the fiscal deficit is under check and the Current Account Deficit in fact has been bridged to the extent that we are now Current Account Surplus. 

Admitting there is some pressure due to rising US dollar and crude oil prices, Shri Rajnath Singh assured the government is seriously thinking on issues related to rising oil prices. However, there is no crisis because our forex reserves at $400 billion are very comfortable, he added. 

Stating that there is a big change and faster growth in the infrastructure development, Shri Rajnath Singh said our Government has made 27 kms of highways everyday for four years compared to 12 kms previously. Rural road connectivity has also improved vastly from 56 percent to 82 percent of villages during the period. 

The Union Home Minister said it is our firm resolve that by 2022 farmers incomes will double and towards this end the Union Government has taken many initiatives. The Prime Minister’s Crop Insurance Scheme is a big step towards farmers’ welfare. Our Government is conscious of bringing down input costs while farmers are being extended loan at low interest rates. The e-NAM (e-National Agriculture Market) has enabled linking of 585 “mandis”, Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), across the country. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said the JAM- Jan Dhan accounts, Aadhar and Mobile connectivity- which facilitated direct transfer of subsidies to beneficiaries, has ensured the various benefits reach the poor directly and leakages are plugged. Rs 69,815 crores has been distributed among 20 crore beneficiaries. By implementing Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) we have ensured that there are no leakages in distributing benefits to people. This helped the Government save around 70,000 crore rupees. Of the total banks accounts opened in the world in last four years, 55 percent were opened in India under the PM Jan Dhan Yojana. 

“I specially mentioned about Jan Dhan accounts because the subsidy money that people are receiving through direct money transfer has been made possible by opening of these accounts,” he said.

Shri Rajnath Singh said our Government has introduced ‘Ayushman Bharat’ scheme to provide health cover to ten crore poor families of our country. Poor people will get benefits upto Rs 5 lakhs under this Health Insurance scheme.  “It is the largest state-run medical scheme in the world, excelling even the famed Obama Care scheme,” he said.

The Union Home Minister said we have taken some strong decisions to tackle corruption. “I am not saying that we have eradicated it completely. But by ensuring transparency in system we have made serious efforts to curb it in a big way,” said Shri Rajnath Singh.

On Women’s Safety, the Union Home Minister said amendment has been made to provide death penalty for rape of minors below 12 years of age. He said there is marked improvement in LWE scenario as well. “While 76 districts were affected by LWE violence in 2013, that number has come down to 58 now,” said Shri Rajnath Singh. In Jammu and Kashmir, our Government has successfully eliminated 619 terrorists in four years, compared to 413 terrorists killed during the period 2010-13.

Shri Rajnath Singh said the people have seen Governments working before also but it has happened only under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi that an elected Government has every year presented details of the work done by them in front of public. 

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shri Shivraj Singh Chauhan also attended the press conference.

                Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said the Union Government during the last 48 months has achieved many wonderful successes. It has worked in a transparent manner with complete determination and pure intentions. 

Addressing a press conference in Lucknow today, Shri Rajnath Singh said the Indian economy is now among the top seven largest economies of the world. And according to some studies, it will break into the top five within the next few years. Stating that the fiscal deficit is under control, Shri Rajnath Singh however admitted there is some pressure due to rising US dollar and crude oil prices. The government is seriously thinking on issues related to rising oil prices, he added. He said there is no crisis because our forex reserves at 400 billion USD are very comfortable. Due to the attractive economic policies, 156 billion USD foreign investment flowed into the country. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi created a revolution with JAM- Jan Dhan accounts, Aadhar and Mobile connectivity- which facilitated direct transfer of subsidies to beneficiaries. Rs 69,815 crores was distributed among 20 crore beneficiaries, he said. There are no leakages now and complete benefits are reaching people directly, he added.

The Union Home Minister said there is a big change and faster growth in the infrastructure development. Construction of Express highways increased from 12 km per day earlier to 27 km per day now. There is going to be heavy investment- 4 to 5 trillion USD in Indian infrastructure sector by 2040. Rural roads were also built at a rapid pace to increase coverage from 56 percent of villages four years ago to 82 percent now. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said, by 2022 farmers incomes will double and towards this end the Union Government has taken many initiatives. Our government has introduced ‘Ayushman Bharat’ scheme to provide health cover to ten crore poor families of our country, he said. It is the largest state-run medical scheme in the world. Poor people will get benefits upto Rs 5 lakhs under this Health Insurance scheme, he added. 

The Union Home Minister said we have brought in tough laws to deal with economic offenders- Benami Transaction Act was notified. Now economic wealth of offenders will be confiscated both in India as well as abroad. 

As far as Ministry of Home Affairs is concerned, a multi-pronged strategy has been adopted resulting in marked improvement in the Internal Security across the country. He said the situation in the North East has improved. From 1997 to 2017, there has been a decline of 85% in incidents and 96% decline in deaths. AFSPA has been withdrawn from Meghalaya and also from some areas of Arunachal Pradesh. Shri Rajnath Singh said there is marked improvement in LWE scenario as well. While 76 districts were affected by LWE violence in 2013, that number has come down to 58 now. In Jammu and Kashmir, our Government has successfully eliminated 619 terrorists in four years, compared to 413 terrorists killed during four years of UPA Government for the period 2010-13.

He said there is great progress in the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) project and it has also been lauded abroad. In 2014 73% Police Stations were linked on the network, now this covers almost 100% Police Stations. Border security further improved with the launch of the Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS). He said the E-Visa facility has been extended to cover 165 countries, resulting in a surge in foreign tourist arrivals.

On Women’s Safety, the Union Home Minister said amendment has been made to provide death penalty for rape of minors. On Centre-State relations, Shri Rajnath Singh said we completed the onerous task of deliberations on all the 273 recommendations of the Punchhi Commission report. The long pending amendment to the Enemy Properties Act was also carried out, which enabled the Government gain control over properties worth more than Rs.1,00,000 crore.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and MP from Chandoli, Dr Mahendranath Pandey also attended the press conference.

MHA has approved Rs.105 crores in March, 2018. These two battalions would be raised from the people living within 0 – 10 kms of IB/LoC. Besides, 5 India Reserve Battalions (IRB) are also being raised. 4,690 youth have been recruited for this, who will start joining next month. Also, 6,689 SPOs have been appointed out of a total of 10,000 new posts sanctioned. The possibility of filling up of the vacancies of SPOs from Border living community may be explored.

The Home Minister was informed that 1,079 youth have been selected during a Special recruitment drive for CAPFs and Assam Rifles in 2016-17 while 7,302 youth were inducted into the Army during the period 2014-2017.

In order to address offences against women particularly rape in a holistic and time bound manner, the Division would focus to enhance capacity of the existing administrative, investigative, prosecution and judicial machinery, along with appropriate measures for rehabilitation of victims and bringing attitudinal changes in society.

It was considered to create a National Mission for the safety of women, with participation of stakeholder Ministries/Departments, who would undertake specified actions in a time bound manner. These included setting up of Special Fast Track Courts (FTCs), strengthening of forensic set up and building up of National Registry of Sexual offenders, appointing additional Public Prosecutors, and providing appropriate medical and rehabilitation facilities to victims. Issues like sensitization of children through appropriate changes in school curriculum, a media campaign for raising awareness, checking proliferation of pornography materials and online contents etc. will also be addressed.

The National Mission for Safety of Women would result in following:

• For giving a credible response to emerging situation of crimes against women, especially minor girls

• Focus on time bound implementation of measures with tangible impact on women safety

• Improved coordination by Stakeholder Departments; Justice, MHA, WCD,
School Education, Health, Deity, Legal Affairs, Information & Broadcasting
• Improved Monitoring at Mission level of the time bound prosecution and
investigation in cases of rape and other matters related to women safety

 

It may be recalled that Union Cabinet on 21.04.2018 had approved Ministry of Home Affairs' proposal for promulgation of Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 and a number of other measures for effective implementation of the amended provisions of criminal laws aimed at enhancing women safety. The Cabinet had approved the Promulgation of Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 to amend the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, (Cr.Pc), with consequential amendments in the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences, 2012 (POSCO) and the Indian Evidence Act 1872. The said Ordinance was promulgated on 21.04.2018. In order to effectively implement amendments made in criminal law, the Cabinet has also approved following measures :‑

a) Setting up of Fast Track Special Courts: A Centrally funded scheme will be launched to set up fast-track special courts to exclusively decide rape cases and to strengthen such courts where they already exist. Such a scheme will cover strengthening of the physical infrastructure and manpower for Fast Track Special Courts, etc. in consultation with the High Courts and State Governments concerned.

b) Strengthening of the Prosecution Machinery:    On similar lines, the prosecution machinery in States/UTs will be strengthened and a dedicated capacity will be created for effective and timely prosecution of the cases for the Fast Track Special Courts, by sanction of additional posts for public prosecutors, office infrastructure and supporting manpower.

c) Improving the Quality of Investigation: The rate of conviction in cases of rape depends crucially on the quality of evidence collected by the investigating agencies. Adequate provision of special forensic kits for rape cases should be made in all police stations as well as hospitals where such medico-legal cases are handled to improve the quality of forensic evidence and thereby strengthen the case of the prosecution. Dedicated and trained manpower will be provided for investigation of sexual offences in a time bound manner.

d) Special Forensic Laboratories:    One or more specialized Forensic Laboratories adequately staffed and equipped, will be set in each State/UT to exclusively deal with the forensic needs of the rape cases, in an efficient and time bound manner.

An important aspect in investigation of rape cases concerns tracking of the accused persons and sharing of information with the concerned agencies in this regard. National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) will maintain database and profile of sexual offenders at the national level and share it with the States/UTs on regular basis. NCRB data will be used by the police for verification of antecedents for prospective employers and would from part of the CCTNS. The preparatory work for creating this database urgently has commenced.

The new Division in MHA will oversee the implementation of the above measures in a focussed way.

                MHA has issued orders, authorizing the Engineering Wings of CAPFs to function as Public works organizations. This will enable them execute construction works upto Rs. 15 crore for execution of Major Works and Rs.1 crore for Minor Repair Works. This power will be exercised by the Technical Officers with requisite technical qualifications/experience, as provided in the Recruitment Rules and subject to observance of CPWD Manual.

This would result in speedy execution of important Projects and will go a long way in solving the problem of delay in execution of the construction works of the CAPFs. The construction works of the CAPFs are widespread, mostly in remote areas. Now, with the Engineering Wings of CAPFs being authorized to execute works, the CAPFs will be able to construct their essential infrastructure like Barracks, Border Out Posts (BOPs) and other security infrastructure on their own.

CAPFs have significant presence in high altitude and inhospitable terrain, where they were experiencing difficulties in developing and maintaining authorized infrastructure due to meager presence of Public works organizations in such areas. The Ministry of Home Affairs, therefore, undertook an exercise to empower the CAPFs to execute construction works on their own, with the help of their Engineering Wings, which have many qualified technical officers, who are capable of rendering technical service. The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) had been sanctioned Engineering Wings but as per the extant General Finance Rules (GFR), they were unable to execute works on their own, making them dependant on CPWD/other Public Works Organizations (PWOs). This decision would go a long way in improving satisfaction of essential infrastructure for improving living conditions and operational capability of the Central Armed Police Forces.

Today’s meeting concluded successfully after over two hours of deliberations. In his concluding remarks, Shri Rajnath Singh expressed satisfaction that the Standing Committee of the ISC, over a series of meetings since 2017, has completed deliberations on all the 273 recommendations of the Punchhi Commission Report. These recommendations of the Standing Committee finalized in the earlier two meetings as well as in today's meeting will be placed before the Inter-State Council for decision. Shri Rajnath Singh expressed gratitude to his Cabinet colleagues as well as the Ministers from the States for their active participation and cooperation in the successful conclusion of the deliberations. With this, the work on Punchhi Commission Report, that had been pending for the last eight years, has been completed. It may be noted that the ISC meeting in 2016 was held after a gap of 10 years. Under the chairmanship of Shri Rajnath Singh, the institutions of ISC Standing Committee as well as Zonal Councils were rejuvenated and regular meetings held to promote harmonious Centre-State relations.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has directed all concerned officials to maintain constant vigil and security on the borders. At a review meeting here today, he took stock of the progress of construction of border fencing, roads and outposts along India's borders with neighbouring countries. Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba, Special Secretary (Border Management) Shri BR Sharma, Joint Secretaries of Border Management, other senior officers of MHA and senior officers from Central Armed Police Forces were present.

With regard to the Indo-Pakistan border, Home Minister expressed satisfaction that 97% of the sanctioned border fencing work has been completed. Shri Rajnath Singh also reviewed implementation of pilot projects on Comprehensive Integrated Border Management Systems (CIBMS) on non­physical barriers. He also stressed to utilize the space technology for strengthening the border guarding and policing.

He stressed that coastal security is of utmost importance and appreciated action taken by State Governments and UTs for operationalization of 194 Coastal Police Stations duly equipped with boats and other equipments. He underlined the need for better cooperation among various agencies engaged in maintaining coastal security.

He directed that the next phase of the coastal security scheme should be expedited in consultation with stakeholders like Navy, Coast Guard, State Governments, etc. He complimented proactive role being played by Central Armed Forces and Navy and Coast Guard and directed that vigil may be maintained on all borders including coastal areas while protecting all legitimate and humane considerations of local population.

Identifying that land acquisition remained an issue, he called for expediting the same especially along the country's Eastern borders.

Expressing satisfaction over the working of six newly established Integrated Check Posts, Shri Rajnath Singh called for construction of 13 more ICPs along Indo-Nepal, Indo-Bangladesh and lndo-Bhutan borders. These Integrated Check Posts will facilitate cross border trade and movement of people.

HM also reviewed working of Border Area Development Plan and directed that all border States should send their annual action plans to MHA for release of funds quickly and all schemes and projects under BADP should be implemented at fast pace.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh presented the Police Medals for Gallantry and Meritorious Services to the BSF personnel at an Investiture Ceremony held here today. Out of the 14 Police Medals for Gallantry, four were awarded posthumously.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Rajnath Singh said that the country is proud of the sacrifices made by the Security Forces while defending the country. Appreciating the supreme sacrifice made by the BSF jawans in the line of duty, he said there is no sacrifice bigger than laying down one’s life for the nation. He said that unity, sovereignty and integrity of the nation is most important for us and there would be no compromise on it.  

Shri Rajnath Singh said that national self-esteem is very important for anybody along with personal self-esteem. The national self-esteem cannot be compromised when any foreign power tries to disturb peace at our borders. He said that it is India which gave the message of peace to the world and we always aspire to maintain peace with our neighbouring countries but one of our neighbours does everything to disturb peace. He said that our forces have been restrained not to fire first but in case of any assault they know how to retaliate.

Shri Rajnath Singh said that he would call the BSF not as the “First line of defence’ but as our “First wall of Defence”. Underling the role of BSF in defending our borders, he said that to defend our borders is our responsibility but responsibilities have no borders. He also lauded the BSF for its role in curbing smuggling and fake currency notes across the borders. 

The Union Home Minister said the Government is considering giving 'Operational Casualty Certificates' to Paramilitary Forces on the lines of Battle Casualties in the Armed Forces which will entitle families of those CAPF jawans who die during border skirmishes or in action against militants or terrorists to several benefits. Shri Rajnath Singh appreciated the BSF for its Civic Action Programme. He also said that a web portal has been launched to redress the grievances of the CAPF personnel. 

Speaking on the occasion, the DG, BSF, Shri K K Sharma said that the BSF jawans are making supreme sacrifices for security of the nation. He said that BSF is also fulfilling its social responsibilities. A documentary film titled “Beyond the Call of Duty” depicting the welfare work being done for the BSF jawans and their families  was screened during the function. On the occasion, Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh released  four books  and a postal stamp. Director, IB, Shri Rajiv Jain, former DGs and senior officers of BSF and Ministry of Home Affairs were also present on the occasion.

                The Vice-President of India Shri Venkaiah Naidu will lay the Foundation Stone of Southern Campus building of the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) Tuesday (May 22, 2018) at Kondapavuluru Village, Gannavaram Mandal, Krishna District of Andhra Pradesh. The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju and other Central & State Government officials will attend the ceremony.

 

The National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) is a premier institute of the Government under Ministry of Home Affairs. The NIDM, in pursuance of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act 2014, has established a Southern Campus in Andhra Pradesh.  An interim setup of NIDM Southern Campus is currently operating in the State from Andhra Pradesh Human Resource Development Institute (APHRDI) Campus at Bapatla, Guntur.  The State government has allocated 10 acres of land to NIDM for establishment of its permanent Southern Campus at Kondapavuluru Village. The Central Government has approved construction of the South Campus at a total cost of Rs. 36.76 crores. 

 

The NIDM’s Southern Campus would be focusing more on ground level issues, district and local planning, last mile connectivity and mainstreaming disaster management into Sustainable Development Goals through its training and capacity building programmes as relevant to the region. 

 

The NIDM Southern Campus will function to support the overall goal of resilience and capacity building of various stakeholders through its programs. There will be programs designed and developed with special emphasis on the disasters specific to southern States. The South Indian geography plays a vital role in designing the NIDM programs specially Coastal Areas, Rocky terrain of Deccan Plateau and Western Ghats. It would be vital for the NIDM Southern Campus to focus more on the needs of South India hazard profile and develop it as a Centre for Excellence for this region.  

 

India is a signatory to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) adapted by the United Nation’s member states and the Prime Minister’s 10 point agenda on Disaster Risk Management is aligned to its strategy and ground implementation.  Capacity Building including training - education, research, knowledge management and mass awareness hold the key to success in achieving the targets of Sendai Framework as understanding disaster risk, enhancing disaster preparedness   and “Build Back Better” still remain the most important input in saving lives, property and environment from natural and man-made disasters. NIDM has taken big strides in building the capacity of stakeholders, but the gaps, demand and expectations are huge. Hence, partnership, collaborations and networking across geographies, states, institutions and international agencies and private player are the need of the hour.

 

A two-day National Workshop on “Forging Partnership: Capacity Building for DRR” also began today at Vijayawada to bring the multiple stake-holders, agencies, donors and governments to deliberate, discuss and share experience and to explore cooperation opportunities. The aim of the workshop is to discuss and deliver a roadmap for making India a disaster resilient country by enhancing and building the capacity of the state institutions by encouraging partnerships between the various stakeholders. International and National experts and senior officials would be participating in addition to National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) officials, State Disaster Management Authority (SDMAs) and State Disaster Management Institutes (SDMIs), NGOs and professionals working in the areas of disaster management.

                Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir has said the Government, responding to public sentiment, recently issued Ordinance regarding Amendment to Article 376 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) making provision for stricter punishment to deal with Crimes Against Women. Addressing the inaugural session of the National Conference on “Gender Justice in Criminal Law” organized by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D), here today, Shri Ahir said while laws can be made more harsh, swift disposal by Criminal Justice System can only check the crimes and also act as a deterrent to prevent its recurrence. The low conviction rates, however, continue to be a matter of grave concern, he added.

Stating that the Government is sensitive to Women’s Safety, the Minister said the law was last amended after the horrific Nirbhaya incident but since the society at large was outraged over the recent spate of Sexual Crimes Against Minors, the Government has introduced harsher punishment including capital punishment to deal with such offences. Shri Ahir said the Government has also set stiff timeframe for investigation and swift disposal of cases by fast track courts. Under the Police Modernization programme, the Government has laid emphasis on improving the Forensic Laboratories and improve efficiency of prosecution agencies, he added.

Speaking on the occasion, the Director General, BPR&D, Dr AP Maheshwari said the recommendations arrived at the conclusion of the daylong Conference will be placed before the Government on how to effectively deal with Crimes Against Women and Minors. In his address, Dr Ish Kumar, Director, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) said the NCRB is in the process of creating a national registry of Crimes Against Women. The records are being sourced from the CCTNS and an agency is being hired to prepare the database. The crime rate per lakh population in India is very low at 7-8%, as compared to 27-30% in the US and 132 in South Africa, he added.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh attended the passing out parade of 241 Bastariya Battalion of CRPF in Ambikapur, Chhattisgarh today. 

 

Addressing the gathering on the occasion, the Home Minister lauded the efforts of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the State Police in combating the Left Wing Extremism (LWE). 

 

He pointed out that the Naxal leaders ensure their children receive education in reputed universities, while they mislead the children of poor tribal communities. 

 

He added, “The Left Wing Extremists want tribal people to remain poor forever as this suits their scheme and narrative. However, lifestyle of some Naxal leaders displays immense wealth and riches. While children of the Naxal leaders are studying in foreign universities, they mislead children of poor. But we have decided that all those Naxal leaders who have amassed ill gotten wealth by using poor people and manipulating their innocence, will be punished in severe manner”.

 

“Naxalism is a challenge, but I want to say that this menace is now shrinking and is losing ground. The casualties in security forces have declined by almost 53 to 55 percent. Geographical expanse of Naxalism has also diminished by 40 to 45 percent. The credit for this achievement goes to the CRPF jawans and State Police”, added the Home Minister.

 

Stressing that development is the most potent weapon to fight the sinister intent of Naxals who mislead people, Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh said, “I know that Dr Raman Singh, Chief Minister, Chhattisgarh is trying to ensure overall development of the State. He is focused on developing the remotest areas of the State to ensure inclusive development”. However, Maoists do not want these areas to develop as they very well know that if development takes place, their sinister plan will never succeed.

 

He added, “We have been ensuring road connectivity, electricity and other infrastructure to every village in the State. Some villages are still deprived of electricity and the people are suffering due to hurdles created by the Naxals. But I want to assure that no obstacle  can stop the development process in these areas”.

 

Appreciating the work done and sacrifices made by the security forces, Shri Rajnath Singh said, “No amount of money can compensate the loss of life of our jawans. But we have certain responsibility towards the families of those who sacrifice their lives in the service of the nation. Keeping this in mind we decided that not less than one crore rupees should be given to the family of the martyred jawan as a token of our gratitude”.

 

The ‘Bastariya Battalion’ that came into existence on 1st April 2017, has been created to enhance local representation in CRPF’s combat lay-out in the Bastar area besides providing the ‘Bastariya’ youths a full-proof platform for employment. Accordingly, its recruitment process too carried some unique features. While the physical standards of height and weight were relaxed to give a fair chance to the local aspirants, CRPF also walked yet another extra mile to provide pre-educational and physical training to the local youths through Civic Action Programmes so as to maximize their ability and eligibility for induction into the special formation.

                The much awaited ‘Bastariya Battalion’ of CRPF is ready for Anti Naxal operation’s (ANO) in Chhattisgarh. Soon after the Passing Out Parade (PoP)of the new recruits to be held in Ambikapur in Chhattisgarh tomorrow.The ‘Bastariya’ jawans will be deployed in core area to add teeth to the anti-naxal operations of CRPF in the naxal-infested Bastar division of Chhattisgarh. Numbered 241, this new  battalion of CRPF carries the moniker ‘Bastariya Battalion’ for the special reason  that it comprises  of youths, mostly scouted from the four highly naxal infested Bijapur, Dantewada, Narayanpur and Sukmadistricts  of Chhattisgarh. Another remarkable feature of the battalion is itsaqequate female representation which is in sync with the Government’s policy of 33% reservation for women.

Though the sanctioned strength of this innovative battalion is 743, yet in the first phase as many as 739 candidate were selected in a special recruitment drivebetween mid-October 2016 to late January 2017, conducted by the CRPF in the Bastar region. However, finally a total of 534 candidatesincluding 189 female recruits underwent specialized training at ATC Bilaspur and ATC Ambikapur spanning over 44 long weeks. The training includedguerilla warfare, camouflage, living off the land and all those tricks of the trade that involve jungle operations. These jawans, after the PoP, will be deployed in the core areas of Chattisgarh to fight the naxals alongside the normal GD Bnsand CoBRABns of CRPF.

The ‘Bastariya Battalion’ that came into existence on1st April 2017, has been created to enhance local representation in CRPF’s combat lay-out in the Bastar area besides providing the ‘Bastriya’ youths a full-proof platform for employment. Accordingly, its recruitment process too carried some unique features. While the physical standards of height and weight were relaxed to give a fair chance to the local aspirants, CRPF also walked yet another extra mile to provide pre-educational and physical training to the local youths through Civic Action Programmes so as to maximize their ability and eligibility for induction into the  special  formation .

Armed with about a year’s rigorous training and so many years of geo-spatial experience of their own soil, these combat-ready jawans of CRPF are all poised to switch from their training ground to the battle ground in Bastar.

                Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba has asked all concerned officials of Central and State governments to be better prepared so as to minimize losses due to natural disasters such as floods, cyclones, earthquakes etc.  In his inaugural address at the annual conference of relief commissioners/secretaries, he said we have to build our capacities through better weather forecast, conducting mock drills and improved resource management.  Citing figures, he said on an average during the decade from 2005 -14, India suffered economic losses of approximately Rs. 60,000 crore per annum due to different kinds of natural disasters of which the maximum damage was caused by floods.  

Shri Gauba said India is flood prone as bulk of precipitation takes place in a short time but we can reduce our losses through better preparation. Though continued efforts over the last several years have managed to reduce the impact of natural disasters, still there is room for improvement, he added.   He hoped that the deliberations at the conference would help in sharing experiences, improving coordination etc. While assuring the States that Home Ministry’s assistance would continue, Shri Gauba urged them to build their own capacities and gradually reduce dependence on the Centre. He also emphasised the importance of building capacities at the city and district levels and involving communities.

In his address, Shri R. K. Jain, Member, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), said that the Centre and the States should continue their coordinated efforts to minimise losses due to floods and cyclones.  He said, deaths due to heat waves which were about 2200 in the year 2015 scaled down to about 220 in 2017 primarily due to the ground work done on dissemination of information, better awareness etc.  

Director General, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Shri Sanjay Kumar said last year more than 35 NDRF teams were airlifted for rescue operations in flood-hit areas and they rescued more than 3000 people and evacuated more than one lakh people.  He said, twelve battalions of NDRF are stationed all over the country for quick deployment in times of emergency. 

The one-day conference was attended by relief commissioners of State governments and Union Territories and officials of  IMD, Geological Survey of India, Defence Ministry and Central Water Commission.

                Unity in Diversity is India’s unique strength.  All religions and communities have always received full respect in India.  India’s basic philosophy has been to respect every school of thought, inspired by a desire for universal peace and welfare.

The holy month of Ramzan is commencing from tomorrow, which is observed by Muslims all over the world.  It is a matter of regret that over the last few years, terrorists have indulged in large scale bloodshed not only in India but also in other parts of the World, even during this holy month.  This has caused immense suffering to peace loving Muslims adhering to the true tenets of Islam.  People belonging to other communities have also suffered.

Ramzan is in true sense, the month of worship, purity and peace.  It should be our collective endeavour to isolate those, who bring a bad name to Islam by their senseless acts of terror and violence.  Government of India wants that during the ensuing month of Ramzan, no section of society and in particular, the peace loving Muslim community should face any difficulty.  It is important that all peace loving people should come together to isolate the terrorists and motivate those who have been misguided to return to the path of peace.  

Government has been trying to create an environment free of terror and violence to enable the Muslim brothers to observe Ramzan in a peaceful manner and in conducive environment so that terrorists do not exploit their religious sentiments.  

Motivated by this consideration, Government has issued instructions to the security forces and army not to undertake offensive operations during the period of Ramzan in Jammu & Kashmir.  However, if it is essential for protecting the life of the common people, the security forces will be compelled to take appropriate action.  It is expected that all Muslim brothers and sisters following the true tenets of Islam will cooperate in ensuring the success of this initiative during the holy month of Ramzan.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reviewed the situation in the wake of the thunderstorms, lightning and squall that recently hit various parts of the country, for better early warning and preparedness.

In a video conference held with various stakeholders yesterday, the Authority enquired about the timeliness and adequacy of early warning messages issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). States expressed satisfaction over the accuracy of these messages and informed that the timely warning enabled them to put preparedness measures in place, and save many lives. 

Assessing the damage and destruction caused by the recent incidents, the meeting also discussed ways to reduce the impact of such events in future. NDMA also asked the States to share a report on the relief measures taken by them. 

IMD now shares localised and specific warnings with the States, which are widely disseminated using various modes of communication such as mass SMSes, radio, Television and social media. Some State governments have been able to send out these warnings right up to the Panchayat levels by leveraging the mobile numbers available in voter databases. 

Simple Do's and Don'ts for thunderstorms and lightning are also widely circulated. NDMA has also shared short audio-video awareness generation material with States. These Do's and Don'ts as well as the videos have been translated by the States into their local languages and are being used for creating greater public awareness.

Representatives of Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Jharkhand, Tripura, Chandigarh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Delhi and West Bengal attended the meeting. 

Relief Commissioners of Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal, - the states which reported the maximum damage during the lightning strikes and thunderstorms on Sunday, 13th May participated in the meeting through videoconferencing. 

Representatives from Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), IMD, Central Water Commission (CWC) and Doordarshan were also present. 

This is the third meeting conducted by NDMA for management of thunderstorms, lightning and squall. Earlier, two meetings were held on May 11, 2018 and May 4, 2018, which has resulted in improvement of early warning and preparedness measures.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) conducted a meeting with 17 heat wave-prone States here today to review their preparedness and mitigation measures. In view of the recent incidents of thunderstorm and lightning, preparedness measures relating to these hazards were also assessed.

 

In the meeting conducted through video conference, Shri R. K. Jain, Member, NDMA, requested the States to run extensive public awareness campaigns in local languages to educate people about the simple ways of mitigating the impact of heat waves and lightning. 

He also asked the States to work on developing thresholds at local levels and ensure wider dissemination of early warnings.

 

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) informed that besides the regular five-day forecasts, it now comes out with a special heat bulletins at 0730 hrs to help people plan their day accordingly.

 

A detailed review of the preparedness of the States in terms of having Heat Action Plans up to the district level, providing shelters, drinking water, rescheduling work timings to avoid peak heat impact for labourers, medical treatment, etc. was carried out.

 

NDMA underlined the importance of training all stakeholders to build local capacities and ensure better response in an emergency. The Authority also asked the States to share a report on the activities carried out by them so that best practices followed by one State can be suitably adapted by others.

 

Besides, NDMA has been running an all-out awareness campaign on social media on the do’s and don’ts of heat wave, thunderstorms and lightning. NDMA's  “Beat The Heat India” campaign is being widely used and publicised by various other stakeholders.

                The two-day national workshop on Data Requirements for Disaster Risk Reduction Database successfully concluded here today setting the stage for creation of a national-level disaster database. 

Developing this integrated database with locally obtained and validated data is crucial for tracking our risks and progress towards resilience without which India will not be able to meet its developmental goals. It will also play a vital role in implementing the Prime Minister’s 10-point agenda to address disaster risks, outlined during the Asian Ministerial Conference on DRR (AMCDRR) in November, 2016.

The workshop was organised by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in collaboration with United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR).

Group presentations and discussions were held on hazards to be included in the database, data collection templates and IT platform for data entry, validation, management and analysis. 

During the technical session on issues and challenges in setting up a damage and loss baseline, using data from 2005-2015, existing gaps in disaster loss data and ways to address them were discussed.

Discussions at this workshop will lead to the formation of a Steering Group to oversee the setting up of the database, and guiding trainings and capacity building for operating, maintaining, updating and using the database. The Group will also identify pilot States and draw a roadmap for implementation of the project.

Officials from NDMA and representatives of concerned Central Ministries and Departments, State Governments, UN agencies, Administrative Training Institutes (ATIs), Disaster Management Institutes and Universities participated in the workshop.

                Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba here today launched the online Event Clearance System (https://conference.mha.gov.in) for grant of security clearance to the conference/seminar/workshop organized in India. This will enable the Indian Missions abroad for issuance of Conference Visa to foreign nationals/delegates intending to attend such events organized by a Ministry or Department of the Government of India, State Governments or UT Administrations, Public Sector Undertakings, Central Educational Institutions, Public Funded Universities or private institutions or NGOs. 

With the introduction of the online module, Shri Rajiv Gauba said the whole process has become paperless and standardized resulting in effective monitoring and timely disposal. Various officials involved in the process can access the online application and documents and take a proper decision to facilitate the organizers and participants of such conferences. 

Shri Gauba complimented officials of the Foreigners Division for bringing out recently several successful initiatives relating to FCRA, FRRO, OCI etc that made the work processes faster, transparent and paperless. He urged them to continue to work in the same direction.

Prior to the introduction of online module, obtaining clearances for organizing a conference/seminar/workshop for issue of Conference Visa to foreign delegates was an offline procedure. The organizers were required to apply for the clearances in the physical form along with documents. The processing of event clearance was also an offline procedure. Clearances were being issued by the Ministry in a physical format.

Indian Missions are authorized to issue conference visas to delegates on production of an invitation to a conference/seminar/workshop being organized in India. However, prior reference is required to be made to the Ministry of Home Affairs before granting conference visas to foreigners participating in conferences/ seminars/ workshops etc. in India in the following cases:-

(i)         If the participants are nationals of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Sudan or foreigners of Pakistani origin or Stateless persons; and/or

(ii)        If the participants of conferences /seminars/workshops are required to visit 'Restricted' or 'Protected' areas in India, or areas affected by terrorism, militancy and extremism etc. viz. Jammu & Kashmir and the North Eastern States (other than the States of Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland).

                The Task Force constituted by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) presented its report on “Establishing a Coalition on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)” to the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh here today. The Task Force was constituted by the MHA with approval of Union Home Minister on 18th August, 2017, headed by Ms. Preeti Saran, Secretary (East), Ministry of External Affairs. 

The report provides a step-by-step implementation plan and analysis in order to build and operationalise a Coalition. The study includes:

	Preliminary design of the coalition
	Roll – out plan


During the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) held in New Delhi in November 2016, the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi outlined a 10-point Agenda for disaster risk reduction. Under the first agenda, the Prime Minister said that “India will work with other partner countries and key stakeholders to build a coalition or centre for promoting disaster resilient infrastructure in the region. This will help generate new knowledge for hazard risk assessment, disaster resilient technologies and mechanism for integrating risk reduction in infrastructure financing”. 

With a view to take this agenda further forward, a Task Force was constituted by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Besides the chairperson Ms. Preeti Saran, Secretary (East), Ministry of External Affairs, the Task Force comprised of members namely Shri Kamal Kishore, Member, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Shri Sameer Kr. Khare, Joint Secretary (MI), Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Shri Sanjeev Kumar Jindal, Joint Secretary (DM), Ministry of Home Affairs and Dr. Ila Patnaik, Professor, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP). The Task Force was mandated to prepare its report by 30th April, 2018 on “Establishing a Coalition on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)”. The officers of MEA and other Ministries were also co-opted by the Committee on need basis. 

In total, the Committee met seven times to work out the report. One International Workshop on “Disaster Resilient Infrastructure” was also held as per the advice of the Task Force on 15-16 January, 2018 in New Delhi to get inputs from potential partner countries. More than 180 delegates including experts from 21 countries, Multilateral Development Banks, the United Nations, the private sector, academics and National representatives of Central Governments and State Governments participated in the workshop.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said that religion is a personal choice and it should always remain free from any coercion or allurement. He was inaugurating the civic reception in Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala) accorded to honour Philipose Mar Chrysostom Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan on completion of 100 years of age. Shri Singh pointed out that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi runs a government at the Centre which firmly believes in taking every section of our society along and build a New India. The goal is Development with unity and the dream of making our nation great again can be realised only when the people of India stand united. 

 

The Home Minister said that India has been united not because one religion or some theological thought held the political power or exercised control over the system. This great nation is united because it provides space to peaceful coexistence of multiple thoughts and theologies. The problems faced by this country had always been addressed through a unique interplay of ideas and the biggest living proof of this interplay of ideas is our Constitution. 

Shri Rajnath Singh said that the ‘Sarva Dharma Sambhav’ should be maintained in this country and continue cementing the pillars of United India. He said unity is our strength and we all must work to strengthen the bonds of unity, amity and harmony in our society. Shri Singh said this should be our resolve today when we are celebrating the birth centenary of Mar Chrysostom. 

The Union Home Minister said the life and work of Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan is an inspiration not only to the people of Kerala or to the Christian community, but to the entire nation. His life is a shining example of how God can be worshipped through selfless service for the society and the humanity. Mar Chrysostom has endeared himself to all sections of Kerala Society through his inspiring words and works. The basic quality of Mar Chrysostom Metropolitan is his attitude of universal goodwill and his concern for the development and wellbeing of the entire community of citizens, transcending any narrow sectarian consideration. Considering his valuable contributions to Indian society for well over six decades, the Government of India has conferred Mar Chrysostom by awarding the ‘Padma Bhushan’ this year. By felicitating him with ‘Padma Bhushan’, the Government has not only shown respect towards him but also recognised his tremendous contribution, said Union Home Minister. While remaining true to his own Faith Mar Chrysostom has been able to raise himself above all sectarian considerations and divisions. He has motivated all sections of our society to love each other for the common good.

Shri  Rajnath Singh pointed out that Mar Chrysostom is a man of prayer and he also works as a social reformer. His contribution towards the empowerment of weaker sections of our society is also noteworthy. He has dedicated his life to God through service of fellow human beings.

 

The Chief Minister Shri. Pinarayi Vijayan presided over the function. Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Prof. P.J. Kurien, Minister for Tourism and Co-operation Shri. Kadakampally Surendran, Leader of Opposition Shri. Ramesh Chennithala, Shri. Shashi Tharoor (MP), Shri. V. Muraleedharan (MP), Mayor Shri. V.K. Prashanth and a host of other dignitaries including Philipose Mar Chrysostom Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan were present on the occasion.

Earlier, Union Home Minister inaugurated the 19th Navaoli Jyothirdinam celebrations at Santigiri Ashram in Thiruvananthapuram. Speaking on the occasion, Shri. Rajnath Singh lauded the activities of Santigiri Ashram which not only spreads the light of spirituality but also take care of comprehensive healthcare of the society. 

Shri Rajnath Singh offered floral tributes at the lotus Parnasala at Santigiri Ashram and interacted with Ashram inmates. Bahrain Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Khalid Bin Abdullah Al Khalifa was the Chief Guest at the function.

                Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State(I/C) for Housing & Urban Affairs has said that “The National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM), which seeks to reduce poverty and vulnerability of the urban poor through access to gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, has expanded its ambit to cover some additional sectors in the informal economy”. “In addition to providing social security, strengthening tenure security and improving basic infrastructure and public services in informal settlements where urban poor are concentrated, these initiatives are likely to reduce vulnerability and improve working conditions”, he further said.  He was addressing a Workshop on “Making Cities Work for All: Integrating the informal economy organised by National Institute of Urban Affairs in collaboration with Women in the Informal Employment, here today.

            While complimenting the National Institute of Urban Affairs for organizing this event, the Minister said that focusing on waste pickers, street vendors, brick-kiln and home based workers which together form the largest proportion of informal workers, this workshop intends to address informality with all its diversity and identify the barriers and opportunities in informal ‘place of work’ with a focus on women. The challenges and innovations; the role of city planning and the question of ‘formalisation’ will be deliberated. Finally, a roadmap shaping the future of ‘work in India’ will be worked out exploring the role of National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM) and National Missions in widening employment opportunities and creating appropriate policies for the urban informal workforce.

Earlier referring to the issue of informal employment, the Minister that this includes all those workforce who are neither covered by any social security net nor have any form of job security and the informal sector includes enterprises that take the form of unincorporated partnerships and proprietorships (having less than 10 workers). Together, these individuals and enterprises form an informal economy which is so pervasive that it is estimated to provide livelihood (subsistence) to around 80 percent of the urban workforce in India. This is why the Economic Survey 2017-18 acknowledges the fact that the employment sector in India poses structural challenges because it is dominated by informal workers.  He also stressed on the need to acknowledge the interlinkage between formal and informal sectors 

Sh.Puri emphasised on the significant contribution made by the waste-pickers in the domain of solid waste managementbut who are invariably informal labour working under hazardous conditions, and mostly women and children belonging to disadvantaged communities. These informal waste pickers and recyclers play a critical role in managing urban waste and helping us achieve the Clean India Mission. These workers reclaim, reprocess and recycle 81 percent of the solid waste generated in cities – that would otherwise be disposed of in open unsanitary dumps or burned in incinerators. 

Shri Puri also acknowledged the important contribution made by the organisations like SEWA, WIEGO and the Tata Trusts in supporting women in the informal sector.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that cities are the drivers of economic growth and all sections of people living in the cities need to be provided with adequate housing and other essential amenities. He was addressing the gathering after laying foundation stone for the World Trade Center at Nauroji Nagar and redevelopment of Netaji Nagar General Pool Residential Accommodation Colony, here today. Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs (I/C), during his address stated that the adoption of holistic approach to urbanisation for upscaling urban infrastructure is underway.  Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary, M/o Housing & Urban Affairs and CMD, NBCC were also present on the occasion.  

 

Speaking after laying the foundation stone, Shri Puri said that “It is yet another proud moment for us today - a bold step in our voyage towards realising the prudent vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister for a ‘New India’ that holds the dream of a sustainable and inclusivedevelopmentof the Nation, creating world class infrastructure, energy-abundant solutions, elevated trade and business environment opportunities in the country.”

“As the idea of New India initiative goes, today’s Foundation Stone laying of Redevelopment of GPRA Colony, Netaji Nagar and the World Trade Centre in Nauroji Nagar into finest housing complexes and commercial hubs by Hon’ble Vice President, is a watershed event”, he added.“We are indeed grateful to Hon’ble Venkaiah Naidu Ji,for gracing this important occasion which shall be a great source of inspiration for all of us in future.Indeed, it was under his dynamic leadership as the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister that great strides were made in redefining the urban landscape of the country and new initiatives in redevelopment of Government colonies, promoting metro rail network in the country and great impetus in nation missions like Housing for All, Swachh Bharat Mission, AMRUT, Ease of Doing Business and other such flagship programs was witnessed”, he further said.

NBCC, which is entrusted with the task of implementing the Netaji Nagar and Nauroji Nagar projects besides the Sarojini Nagar GPRA project, is also executing a smart sub-city in the shape of East Kidwai Nagar which is fast nearing completion. The CPWD has been entrusted with the task of implementing the 04 GPRA projects at Mohammad Pur, Kasturba Nagar, Thyagraj Nagar and Sriniwaspuri.  We hope to hold the foundation laying ceremony of Mohammadpur soon. 

Expressing gratitude to Hon’ble Vice President for his gracious presence on this occasion and for consenting to lay the foundation stone of these 2 projects today, Shri Puri assured him that the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs would keep on exploring many more such possibilities all over India, by undertaking a holistic approach to urbanisation in order to upscale the urban infrastructure and housing stock in the entire nation.

                This is with reference to the article “Only 22% funds utilised in six Housing Ministry schemes” published on 12th May 2018 in a newspaper which was based on the information given to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban development. This is a misinterpretation of the statistics relating to funds released/utilisation regarding schemes/missions being implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, resulting in incorrect inferences. While funds released/utilisation is part of the normal government financial procedures to ensure proper accounting systems, it is not a true barometer of the physical progress and speed of the implementation of the mission targets/objectives. Most of the schemes have large capital intensive projects with a completion time range of 1-3 years for the project. 

 

The Ministry of Housing and Urban affairs has been able to achieve substantial milestones in both physical and financial terms in so far as mission objectives/targets are concerned. The utilization certificates are required to be submitted within 12 months of the closure of the financial year in which the grants were released. Thus,during the year 2017-18, while the total cumulative grants released was Rs.46,663 crores, Utilization Certificates were due only for the grants released upto March 2016, i.e. for approximately Rs.10,365 crores.  The utilization figures, given to the Standing Committee pertained mostly to funds released upto 2015-16 as only this was due in 2017-18.  In fact, at the closure of the year 2017-18, as against the due amount of Rs.10,365 crores for utilisation certificates (UCs), actual UCs for an amount of Rs.15,403 crores were received in the Ministry.This figure also included some UCs which were due in the next financial year i.e. 2018-19.  

Mission wise progress of funds released, projects progress and utilisation status, etc. is given below:

Smart Cities Mission

 

Smart City Mission has lots of convergence with other missions like AMRUT etc. and some of the projects are implemented under Public Private Partnerships.  1,333 projects worth Rs. 50,626 crores have been completed or under implementation / tendering. Overall projects worth Rs.2,03,979 crores have been identified for all 99 smart cities across the country.

                In a major boost to public transport infrastructure in NOIDA, the Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved extension of Delhi Metro corridor from Noida City Centre to Sector-62, Noida Uttar Pradesh covering a length of 6.675 k.m. at the total completion cost of Rs.1,967 crores. Gol liability will be Rs. 340.60 crore on account of Grant and Subordinate Debt.

Details:


	Approval for Extension of Delhi Metro corridor from Noida City Centre to Sector-62, Noida, Uttar Pradesh covering a length of 6.675 k.m. 



	Total completion cost of the project is Rs.1,967 crore.
	Project will be implemented by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC), the existing Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) of the Government of India and Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi.
	Project will be covered under the legal framework of Central Metro Acts, Metro Railways (Construction of Works) Act, 1978 and the Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002, as amended from time to time.


Major Impact: 

The extension of Delhi Metro corridor from Noida City Centre to Noida Sector 62 is the extension to Dwarka-Noida City Centre line of Delhi Metro system which will result into people being assured about their mobility and thus more people will like to move to this satellite town of Delhi, thus decongesting Delhi. As a result, more residential and commercial complexes will develop in this region. With metro rail in place, there will be less vehicular traffic on roads leading to less congestion, less time and cost of journey, less consumption of fossil fuel and less environmental pollution.

The population of Noida and people of surrounding areas will be greatly benefitted by the extended line. At the project site, approximately 800 staff including Engineers and other staff have been engaged. Further, DMRC has started the procedure for recruitment of around 200 employees for Operation & Maintenance of this corridor. 

About 81% progress of civil work and 55% of overall financial progress of the project have been achieved.

Background: 

The Noida city, located in Gautam Buddha Nagar District of Uttar Pradesh State, was created under the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development Act. It possess all modern amenities and is considered to be one of the most modern suburbs of Delhi in the National Capital Region (NCR). The population of Noida as per 2011 Census of India is about 6.42 lakhs. Due to lush green and open area in the city, more and more people from Delhi and surrounding area are preferring NOIDA as their settling place.

The trend of urbanization of Noida is upward. Number of Industrial and Institutional units is also being established in this city. Noida mainly has road linkages with Delhi and the adjoining areas of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana State. People come for work to Noida from other places and vice versa. These factors will lead to increment of traffic demand and need for an efficient pollution-free mass rapid transport system. Noida is connected by Metro rail and trains are running upto Noida City Centre (Sector 32 Noida). It is proposed to extend the Metro Corridor from Noida City Centre to Noida Sector 62 by a length of 6.675 Km with six stations. Noida does not have railway station and the nearest railway station is Hazarat Nizamuddin, New Delhi which is at a distance of about 15 km. The nearest airport Delhi is at about 35 km from NOIDA. The population is expected to grow exponentially in Noida region in the coming years.

The convergence of all the best practices in Smart city missions across the country on a single platform will help the city leaders to not waste time in 'reinventing the wheel' but use the collective learning to accelerate the progress of work. 

The plenary sessions will feature panel discussions and presentations by Smart City CEOs highlighting their high impact projects under Mission, which can be disseminated as learning for other cities. Further, the way forward for the city level project implementation will be discussed. There will also be an exhibition showcasing the different projects being undertaken by Cities under Smart Cities Mission.The two-day Apex Conference also provides an opportunity for the participating Smart City CEOs to visit the locations and appreciate the smart city projects implemented by Bhopal Smart City Limited.

The Apex Conference is being organized with an objective to provide momentumto the cities anda platform for cross-learning, sharing and disseminating the experience gained over the past two and a half years. The exhibition and presentations by the CEOs will provide useful insights for accelerating project implementation and enable cross learning among Smart Cities. Such knowledge sharing will help the cities to convert ideas into concrete actions as the outcome of the conference.

                The Film Facilitation Office is in the process of establishing a dedicated web portal that will disseminate information on filming locations and the facilities available in India for production/post production.  Accordingly, the portal will help potential production companies looking to shoot in India to obtain permissions, explore potential benefits (tangible and non-tangible) and obtain an overview of various locations in India that could benefit the storyline of the film under consideration.

Application - The portal will facilitate the acceptance of application for shooting feature films / TV & Web Reality shows and series and / or TV & Web shows and series in India, along with online payments and issuing permissions. Foreign Audio Visual Agencies intending to shoot documentary films / AV commercials in India would link to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Web portal. 

Locations – The portal would also provide information on locations and link to all State portals. It would capture detailed information pertaining to a particular location, resources or facilities available in a standardized format that would include basic location description, map, best time to shoot, connectivity, photographs, digital walk tour, permissions required, previous movies shot etc. 

Enlisting of Information - The portal would provide information on all Co-production treaties, shooting guidelines of various Central and State agencies, permission process, link to all trade associations.

Resources and Facilities Directory - The portal would have a holistic database of the resources available in the Indian film industry including DOP, cast, crew, casting agents, line producers, service / facility providers as well as producers. This would not only help build reliability for the Indian producers who shoot abroad but also enhance their profile internationally, thus leading to greater international tie-ups and engagements. It will also link all trade associations like Producers Guild, FFI, CII, FICCI, etc.

Co-production of Films: Financial incentives will be provided to film makers for production of films under Audio Visual Co-production treaties other countries. Support for funding will be taken from the dedicated corpus funds. Policy guidelines for optimum and effective use of funds are being prepared. 

These are main activities to be undertaken by the Films Wing of the Ministry of I&B, Gov. of India, as a Champion Sector (Audio-Visual Services).

Smriti Zubin Irani today said that time has come to put laws, ethics and rules into place which will help in balancing the media industry so that one dominant player cannot rule the roost.

How do we attract, retain and develop talent which frees good content from the trappings of revenue needs and brings about a balance in media institutions, the Minister further asked.

The 15th Asia Media Summit is being hosted by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India, jointly with the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), New Delhi and Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL), from 10th -12th May, 2018 in New Delhi.

We have a vibrant media industry which has a direct established impact of Rs 1.35 lakh crore and indirect and induced benefits of Rs 4.5 lakh crore, with close to 4 million people associated with it.”

The Minster expressed hope that the Asia Media Summit will throw up new ideas so that we can look at pathways to strengthen media institutions for a better mankind.

                Union Minister of Electronics & IT and Law & Justice, Sh. Ravi Shankar Prasad said today that for the Indian Government, freedom of media is integral to polity, duly recognized by the Constitution and reinforced by Judiciary in series of judgements. Addressing the 15th Asia Media Summit here today, Shri Prasad said that the media has full right to inform, circulate, criticize, advice and counsel. The rights of Media under the Constitution are also subject to reasonable restrictions.

On misuse of data, the Minister said India will not allow the country to become a centre of data pilferage, and that data commerce through collusive methods cannot be used to influence its electoral process. Shri Prasad said all the online companies which are in the business of data commerce must understand the nuances of accountability. He said that when the recent controversy surrounding data privacy surfaced, the Government took a very firm stand on these issues. Shri Prasad further said that accountability is integral to democracy and all institutions – the Government, the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Media – have to adhere to this principle. Referring to India becoming a very big centre of data analysis, he said that there is a need to have a proper coordination on data availability, data utility, data innovation, data anonymity and data privacy. He said that a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge is looking into these issues and soon the Government would enact a data protection law.

Dwelling upon the issue of Ethical Journalism, the Law Minister said that it must be fair, true, properly presented highlighting sights and counter sights and empowering the consumers of news in a decent and independent fashion. The Minister wondered whether the media today, under the garb of sensationalism, paid news, fake news, too much of other insidious practices is addressing to this large issue. This is a matter of debate, the Minister added.

Supporting the principle of self-regulation by the media, Shri Prasad said that the IT act mandates that the content going through the intermediary is not dangerous, libelous and does not impinge upon the security and integrity of the country nor should it encroach upon the copyrights. On sanctity of privacy, the Minister noted that the Supreme Court had upheld privacy as part of the Fundamental Rights. But, he added that the plea of privacy cannot become a shield for the corrupt and the terrorists. The Minister elaborated that on the issues of terrorism, propagation of hatred and communalization and on the issue of promoting extremism, there has to be a global consensus that needs to be properly enforced.

Dwelling on the challenges of social media, Shri Prasad said that the Government is committed to the freedom of press but there is a need to segregate the real from the dangerous. He said many in the Government today had fought against the emergency where freedom was trampled upon. The Minister said that the Government respects social media as it empowers the common man but the language used sometimes in this medium is a cause of concern.

Shri Prasad further said that the internet cannot become a tool of neo-imperialism. Referring to internet as one of the finest creations of human mind, he said that it cannot remain the monopoly of a few. He said that if Internet has to be global, it must have linkages with local ideas and culture.

Other dignitaries presenting their views on Media Regulation during the session included H.E. Mr. Hasanul Haq Inu, Minister of Information, Bangladesh, H.E. Dr. Khieu Kanharith, Minister of Information, Cambodia, Mr. Sam Seog Ko, Standing Commissioner, Communication Commission, Republic of Korea and Justice C.K. Prasad, Chairman Press Council of India. The session was moderated by Dr. Venkat Iyer, Barrister, UK.

In all the presentations, there was a consensus on a host of issues including ensuring freedom of expression and healthy development of an independent media, while respecting individual privacy. At the same time, all the speakers highlighted the challenge of fake news and misuse of expanding cyber space for propagating cyber crimes and terrorism. The speakers also underlined the issues of cyber piracy, patent and copyright violations and a consensus was reached to tackle these problems through cooperative dialogue among different countries.

                Some very important decisions were taken towards improvements in service delivery mechanism of ESIC in 174th meeting of ESI Corporation in New Delhi yesterday under the Chairmanship of Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Union Minister of State for Labour & Employment (I/C). 

 

To strengthen medical services in all the districts of the country, the decision for opening of one ESIC Dispensary cum Branch Office (DCBO) in every district of the country was taken in the meeting. The DCBO will provide primary medical care, referrals for secondary medical care, scrutiny of bills of secondary care referrals, etc. besides distribution of drugs to Modified Employer Utilization Dispensary, IMPs in the district, payment of cash benefits, survey work for coverage in the district. The ESIC will bear the establishment and operational cost of DCBO, without sharing, in the similar manner of expenditure of ESIC Hospitals.

 

During the meeting, the decision for starting a Nursing Internship program in ESIC Hospitals was also taken. The program would be open to duly registered fresh graduate Nurses who are looking to update their skill in real work setting under supervision of regular staff.  ESIC would offer practical work experience to graduate Nursing pass outs, focusing on application of Nursing theory and knowledge to actual Nursing tasks in medical settings. A stipend (consolidated) of Rs.22,000/- could be provided for duration of the internship.  The selection would be based on merit and no. of positions for internship could be around 20% of the sanctioned strength of Staff Nurses for the ESIC hospital. 

 

ESI Corporation has given in principal approval to Modified Insurance Medical Practitioner (IMP) Scheme, 2018 to make IMP Scheme more attractive on pilot basis. This Scheme may further be expanded in the new areas as well as existing areas as per need. In an area, where ESI does not have its medical establishment,  or in newly implemented area, Primary Medical Care is provided cash less through tie up arrangement, with Insurance Medical Practitioner (IMP).  ESIC shall utilize the services of private practitioners (as IMPs) for delivery of primary care services (except for lab tests & medicines) to IPS.  

 

The Decision of Construction of 100 bedded ESI Hospital in Bahadurgarh, Haryana; 50 bedded additional facilities for Super Speciality treatment at ESIC Hospital, Varanasi, UP;  and starting of 100 beds medical facilities in ESIC Medical Hospital,  Bihta, Patna, Bihar were also taken in the meeting. 

 

Besides this, the  proposal for upgradation of existing ESIC Hospital at Bibvewadi, Pune from 50 to 200 beds (upgradable to 500 beds) and  enhancement of bed strength of ESIC Hospital, Namkum, Ranchi from 75 to 200 beds and construction thereby of   200 bedded ESIC Hospital at Ranchi, Jharkhand were approved.

 

The meeting was also attended by Sh. Heera Lal Samariya, Secretary, Labour & Employment, ESI Corporation Members representing Members of Parliament, Employees’ & Employers’ Federation/Association, Representatives of State Governments and officers of MoL&E & ESIC.

In this regard, it is informed that warnings regarding vulnerabilities in data or software is a routine administrative process based on which the services which were rendered through Common Service Centres have been discontinued w.e.f. 22nd March 2018. The news is relating to the services through common service centres and not about EPFO Software or data centre. No confirmed data leakage has been established or observed so far. 

 

As such, there is nothing to be concerned about the news item.  EPFOis continuously monitoring and will continue to be vigilant about it in future.

                          The Union Cabinet chaired by chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Restructuring of the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) by upgradation, creation and abolition of certain posts of Joint Secretary-level and above. The total cadre strength of Indian Bureau of Mines has been maintained at the existing strength of 1477.

          The restructuring would help in enabling the IBM to effectively discharge its function to help reform and transform the regulation of the mineral sector. It will enable the adoption of IT and space technology by the IBM to improve its effectiveness in mineral regulation and development. Further, the posts entail a great deal of decision-making and accountability in the functioning of the organization.

Impact:

                    The proposal will create direct employment opportunities for technical personnel with higher responsibility for contribution in faster development of mineral sector, thereby generating more employment avenues in the sector as a whole. The improved and enhanced performance of IBM would benefit the mining sector.

Details:

          The upgradation, creation and abolition of certain posts of Joint Secretary-level in IBM consists of:

 


	Creation of 1 post of Chief Controller of Mines in Level 15 and 3 posts of Controller of Mines in Level 14;


 


	Upgradation of 11 posts i.e. 1 post of Controller General from Level 15 to 16, 2 posts each of Chief Controller of Mines and Director (Ore-Dressing) from Level 14 to 15 and upgradation of 8 posts (5 posts of Controller of Mines,        1 each of Chief Mineral Economist, Chief Ore-Dressing Officer and Chief Mining Geologist) in the existing Level of 13A to 14; and


 


	Abolition of 1 existing cadre post of Deputy Director General (Statistics), an officer of Indian Statistical Service in Level 14 in pay matrix.


Background:

          IBM was set up by the Government of India on 1st March, 1948 under the Ministry of Works, Mines and Power, primarily as an advisory body to help in formulation of policy and legal framework for mining sector and advising Central and State Governments on development and utilization of mineral resources. The role and responsibility of IBM have changed with emerging needs of the sector as facilitator and regulator of mining sector (other than coal, petroleum and atomic minerals).

 

          Ministry of Mines had constituted a Committee for comprehensive 'Review and Restructuring of the Functions and Role of IBM' in the light of the 'National Mineral Policy' (NMP) 2008 The Committee submitted its report on 04.5.2012 which was accepted in the Ministry.

          The Ministry of Mines has taken a number of initiatives through IBM for effective facilitation and regulation of the mineral sector:


	implementation of the Sustainable Development Framework (SDF) and Star Rating of Mines for their efforts and initiatives encompassing the scientific, environmental and social aspects of the mining activity;
	development of Mining Surveillance System (MSS) in association with Bhaskaracharya Institute of Space Application & Geo-informatics (BISAG) to detect illegal mining within 500 metres zone of lease boundary of major minerals using satellite imageries; and



	thrust on R&D activities on mineral processing including process development for upgradation of low grade ore; (iv) development of IT enable Mining^ Tenement System (MTS) for computerizing the mineral sectors activities.         


  The restructuring of IBM was essential to enable it organisationally to take up the responsibilities entrusted in the role with the recent changes in the policy and legislations, revised charter of function of IBM and the new activities and initiatives undertaken by IBM. IBM is also engaged in handholding the States for auction of mineral blocks for greater transparency in allocation of mineral concessions. IBM is helping the States in preparation of auction blocks, publishing of average sale price, assisting in post auction monitoring and approval process.

The relocation of offices of IBM has already been effected for carrying out the responsibilities given to IBM. New Regional Offices at Raipur and Gandhinagar have been opened and the sub-regional office at Guwahati has been upgraded to Regional office. The existing Regional Offices at Kolkata and Udaipur have been upgraded to the Zonal office (East) and Zonal Office (North). For the purpose of Skill Development, an Institute of Sustainable Development Frame Work' at Udaipur and 'Remote Sensing Centre' at Hyderabad and National Level Training Centres 'Institute of Sustainable Mining’ at Kolkata have been opened and Skill Development Centre at Varanasi is also shortly being opened.

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said that ""secularism, social-communal harmony and tolerance"" is in the DNA of India and compared to the entire world, constitutional, social, cultural and religious rights of minorities are more safe and secure in India.

 He said that the Government has broken every barrier including caste, religion, region and it is moving forward towards “inclusive growth” to ensure that not a single Indian is deprived of the light of development. He added that the government is committed to protect all constitutional institutions, democratic values and religious rights of all sections. Shri Naqvi called for caution against those forces who want to disturb the atmosphere of trust and development due to their “prejudiced mindset and vested interests”. He said, that social-communal harmony is our culture and tolerance is our commitment and we all have to work together to protect and strengthen this culture and commitment.

Shri Naqvi said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is working for all religions and castes without any discrimination. The  Government's “Jan Dhan Yojana”, ""Skill India"", ""Start Up India"", ""Stand Up India"", ""Mudra Yojana”, ""Ujjwala Yojana"" have benefited a large number of poor, weaker sections, minorities and women. The Minister said that the work done for the socio-economic-educational empowerment of minorities in the last 48 months had not been done even in 48 years. Programmes such as ""Garib Nawaz Kaushal Vikas Yojana"", ""Hunar Haat"", ""Nai Manzil”, “Seekho aur Kamao”, ""Begum Hazrat Mahal Girls Scholarship"", ""Nai Udaan”, “Naya Savera” etc have proved to be the milestone for the empowerment of minorities.

The Minister said that he regularly meets with various delegations of Minority communities to take a stock of ground reality to ensure that schemes aimed at their socio-economic-educational empowerment are implemented effectively.

The thirteen member delegation, led by Revd. Dr. Suresh Kumar, vice-president of Diocese of Delhi (CNI), comprised of people from various fields such as- Revd. Kamal Jerald Rodgers Mall, Revd.

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that the Ministry of Minority Affairs has been putting effective efforts for “promotion and progress” of meritorious youth from Minority communities.

 

Shri Naqvi felicitated the youth belonging to the Minority communities who have cleared civil services 2017 with the help of Minority Affairs Ministry’s free-coaching programmes in New Delhi today. Stating that the Minority Affairs Ministry, in collaboration with reputed institutions/organisations of the country, is running free-coaching programmes for civil services, medical, engineering, other administrative services and banking exams for meritorious youths from Minority communities, he said this is to ensure that not even a single deserving youth from these weaker sections is deprived of best coaching and a chance to get a better job.

 

Shri Naqvi said the youth, successful in the UPSC, are a “role model” for youth from Minority and other weaker sections of the society. He said that there is immense talent in minority communities, especially Muslim youths and  efforts have been undertaken  to create such an environment which would give them confidence. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's Government has given an atmosphere to protect and promote talent of youths from Minority communities which has resulted in such a large number of youths of the Minority community being selected in the top administrative services.

 

Shri Naqvi said that the Central Government’s policy of ""Development with Dignity”, without any discrimination, has ensured that this year, for the first time after the Independence, record 131 minority communities’ youth  including 51 Muslims have been selected in Civil Services. Shri Naqvi said that last year also, 126 youths belonging to minority communities, including 52 Muslims, had been selected in the prestigious civil services. He said that last year, 1099 people were selected in the Civil Services which include 52 Muslim youths, it was 4.5 per cent of the total selected. In percentage terms, 5.15 per cent of the total 990 successful candidates are Muslims this year. This year, there are 6 Muslims including 3 women, who have secured ranks in top 100.

 

The Minister said that the Ministry of Minority Affairs has been running a large scale free-coaching programme for meritorious youths belonging to notified minority communities preparing for UPSC examinations. Through various institutions and organisations, the Ministry has been running coaching programmes such as “Nai Udaan”, “Naya Savera” for minority youths preparing for Civil Services, other UPSC examinations, medical, engineering and administrative examinations. During 2017-18, 105 youths from the notified minority communities who qualified prelims of Civil Services Exams, have been provided financial support under the “Nai Udaan” scheme. 

An awareness campaign is also going on for the youths belonging to minority communities to ensure they participate in these examinations, through television channels, newspapers and different institutions and organisations. This year, free-coaching will be provided to more than 15,000 youths from across the country. After overwhelming response and encouraging results of free-coaching schemes during the last three years, these free-coaching schemes more easy, convenient, accessible and encouraging for meritorious youth. “Nai Udaan” and “Naya Savera” schemes have been revised during last year and rate of financial assistance on qualifying UPSC prelims has been increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Under “Naya Savera” programme, the Ministry of Minority Affairs has also been working with reputed institutions and organisations to provide free-coaching to Minority youths.

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said that under “Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karykram” (PMJVK), the Minority Affairs Ministry will construct schools, colleges, ITIs, skill development centres, multi-purpose community centres “Sadbhav Mandap”, “Hunar Hub”, hospitals, business centres etc on waqf properties across the country. This will be for the first time after the Independence of the country.

 

In his address at a day-long National Waqf Conference in New Delhi, Shri Naqvi said that last week, the Union Cabinet approved “Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karykram” which has provision to utilise Waqf properties for various infrastructure for socio-economic-educational empowerment of the society.  308 districts, 870 blocks, 331 towns and thousands of villages have been covered under “Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karykram”. He said that PMJVK will accelerate the utilisation of Waqf properties for the benefit of the society. There are around five lakhs seventy one thousands registered waqf properties across the country.  

 

Shri Naqvi said that the Waqf rules are being made easy and effective to ensure better utilisation of Waqf properties and to free these properties, several of these entangled in   disputes for several decades, from disputes.  Waqf properties in several states are not being utilised properly due to complicated rules. He said that the Central Government will award those “Mutawallis” who will perform well in management of waqf properties to ensure utilisation of these properties for betterment of the society especially educational empowerment of girls. This award programme will be held every year. Shri Naqvi said that “Waqf Mutawallis” are the “custodian” of waqf properties across the country and they should ensure that these properties are being utilised for betterment of the Muslim community.

 

Shri Naqvi said that Central Waqf Council is providing financial help to state waqf boards for digitalisation of waqf records so that state waqf boards can complete digitalisation work within decided timeframe as 84 per cent waqf properties already have been digitised. Remaining waqf properties will also be digitised soon. Two legal support officers, 2 Zonal waqf officers, 2 surveyors are being appointed by Central Waqf Council in state waqf boards for preservation, maintenance, development of waqf properties and related legal matters. 

 

Shri Naqvi said that the Ministry of Minority Affairs and Central Waqf Council is also helping those institutes which are being established and those who are running on waqf properties and are engaged in educational activities especially educational empowerment of girls.

 

Member of Parliament Shri Hussain Dalwai, J&K Minority Affairs Minister Choudhary Zulfikar Ali, Secretary, Minority Affairs Ministry, Shri Ameizing Luikham, Jt. Secretary Shri Jan-e-Alam, Central Waqf Council Secretary Shri B M Jamal, Chairmen and CEOs from all state waqf boards and other officials were present on the occasion. The National Waqf Conference was organized to review the progress of the implementation of Waqf Act 1995 as amended, Waqf Properties Lease Rule’ 2014 and “Qaumi Waqf Board Taraqqiati Scheme”. 

 

The conference also reviewed the status of “Quami Waqf Board Taraqqiati Scheme” implemented by Central Waqf Council. Two schemes, which were implemented separately as “Computerisation of the Records of State Waqf Boards” and “Scheme of Strengthening of State Waqf Boards” by CWC and NAWADCO respectively, have now been clubbed together for achieving optimum results to make the State Waqf Boards self-reliant leading to better implementation of their welfare activities for betterment of the community. 

 

About Rs 48 crore have been earmarked for the ""Quami Waqf Board Tarakkityat Yojana"" and transparent digital record of waqf properties and to free them from encroachment through GIS/GPS mapping of the waqf properties.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today has approved the proposal for renaming and restructuring of Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP) as Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK).  CCEA has also approved its continuation during the remaining period of the 14th Finance Commission.

Impact:


	The restructured programme would provide better socio economic infrastructure facilities to the minority communities particularly in the field of education, health & skill development as compared to the present situation, which would further lead to lessening of the gap between the national average and the minority communities with regard to backwardness parameters. The flexibility introduced in the programme will enable addressing important issues that would result in speedier implementation leading to greater inclusiveness of the minority communities.
	The criteria for identification of Minority Concentration Towns and Clusters of Villages have been rationalized by lowering the population percentage criteria of Minority Communities and fulfilment of backwardness parameters in the following manners:-



	Earlier only those Towns which were found backward in terms of both in Basic Amenities and Socio-economic parameters were taken up as MCTs. Now, the Towns which were found backward in either or both of the criteria have been taken up as MCT.
	Earlier only those Cluster of Villages which were having at-least 50% population of Minority Community were taken. Now the population criteria has been lowered to 25%.


· These   rationalization   of criteria  would  facilitate   the   inclusive  growth  of communities and social harmony, 


	The area to be covered under PMJVK would be 57% more as compared to the existing MsDP.  
	The MsDP covered 196 district of the country whereas PMJVK will cover 308 districts of the country.


Expenditure:

Funding of the scheme would be from budgetary provision of the Ministry. The Expenditure Finance Committee, Department of Expenditure has recommended for the continuation of the programme as PMJVK at the cost of Rs. 3,972 crore as per layout below:

(*The Budgetary allocation of Rs.1200 crores was received in 2017-18. The programme was implemented on the same format as approved by Cabinet for implementation during 12th Plan period)

As stipulated in the scheme, the recurring/maintenance expenses will be borne by the State Government/UTs/Organization.

Beneficiaries:

The Programme aims to address development deficits in the identified minority concentration areas. The identification of minority concentration areas has been done on the basis of presence of substantial population of notified Minority Communities based on Census, 2011. The inclusion of Minority Concentration District Headquarters along with the Minority Concentration Towns having population more than 25,000, Minority Concentration Blocks and Cluster of Villages as per Census, 2011 data, will extend the coverage of population of minority communities.

States/Districts covered:


	The PMJVK will be implemented in Minority Concentration District Hqrs(MCD Hrs), Minority Concentration Block(MCBs), Minority Concentration Towns(MCTs) falling in 308 districts of 32 States/UTs.
	The unit area for implementation will include 109 MCD Hqrs, 870 MCBs and 321 MCTs.
	Moreover, the scheme will also be implemented in Backward Clusters of Minority Concentration Villages(CoMCV). These CoMCV will be identified on the proposal of the States/UTs as per criteria of PMJVK.
	The PMJVK would now cover five more States/UTs namely Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Nagaland, Goa and Pondicherry.
	Minority Concentration Areas of 61 districts out of 115 Aspirational districts have been covered under PMJVK.


Areas identified by data of Census 2011

 


	Unit area of implementation has been further broadened by including Minority Concentration Districts Headquarters in addition to the minority concentration Blocks, Minority Concentration Towns and cluster of minority concentration villages.  
	As compared to MSDP, the PMJVK would now cover five more States/UTs namely Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Nagaland, goa and Pondicherry.  All States/UTs earlier covered under MsDP have also been included under PMJVK.
	Under PMJVK Minority Concentration Blocks (MCBs) and Minority Concentration Towns (MCTs) falling in 308district of 32 States have been covered.
	The area covered under PMJVK will have 109 MCD Hqrs., 870 MCBs and 321 MCTs.


Special focus by earmarking funds:

 

(i)         80% of the resources under the PMJVK would be earmarked for projects related to education, health and skill development.

(ii)       33 to 40% of resources under the PMJVK would be specifically allocated for women centric projects.

 

Monitoring of the Programme strengthened:

(i)        Provisions related to Monitoring Mechanism, Transparency and Publicity of Information have been further strengthened by including an online module along with geo-tagging. 

(ii)      A provision to bring all implementing agencies under Public Finance Management System(PFMS) and its effective use ensured to monitor fund utilization has been made in PMJVK.

Background:

>      MsDP has been identified as one of the Core of the Core Schemes under National Development Agenda in the Report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalization of Centrally Sponsored Schemes, which was constituted by NITI Aayog. The programme was launched in the year 2008-09 in 90 identified Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs) having at least 25% minority population and below national average with respect to one or both of the backwardness parameters with the objective of developing assets for socio-economic and basic amenities. The MCDs were identified on the basis of census 2001 data. The programme continued during 11th Five Year Plan.

>      The MsDP was restructured in June 2013 for implementation during 12th Five Year Plan and the area of implementation was replaced by Minority Concentration Blocks (MCB), Minority Concentration Towns (MCT) and Clusters of Villages. Total MCBs - 710, MCTs - 66 in 196 Districts. The MsDP is currently in operation in 27 States/UTs.

>      MsDP has been designed primarily to address the developmental gaps/deficits in identified backward minority concentration areas by topping up of existing Centrally Sponsored Schemes of various Central ministries/departments without any change in the norms, guidelines and the funding pattern.

>      The projects considered are additional class rooms, laboratories, school buildings, hostels, toilets, buildings for Polytechnics, ITIs, Community Health Centres, Primary Health Centres / Sub-centres, Anganwadi Centres, Rural Housing etc.

>      In addition to gap filling projects, MsDP also provides for taking up innovative projects which are not covered by any of the existing CSS of various ministries and these are funded in the ratio of 60:40 and for NE and Hilly States at 90:10 between the Centre and States. This includes Sadbhav Mandap, Market shed etc.

 

Details and progress of scheme if already running

 


	Since inception of the Programme, projects for construction of 16 Degree Colleges, 2019 School Building, 37,267 Additional Classrooms, 1141 Hostels, 170 Industrial Training Institutes(ITIs), 48 Polytechnics, 38,736 Anganwadi Centres, 3,48,624 lAY(PMAY) houses, 340 Sadbhavna Mandaps, 67 Residential Schools, 436 Market sheds, 4436 Health Projects etc. were sanctioned.


 


	MsDP has made substantial progress in achieving its target for the identified areas and has created useful infrastructures/assets for the people in the areas with substantial minority population. However, the development deficit identified in the selected areas has not been fully addressed.

                Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has issued National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy here today. The objective of the policy is to provide a framework for promotion of large grid connected wind-solar PV hybrid system for efficient utilization of transmission infrastructure and land. It also aims at reducing the variability in renewable power generation and achieving better grid stability.

 

On technology front the Policy provides for integration of both the energy sources i.e. wind and solar at AC as well as DC level. The Policy also provides for flexibility in share of wind and solar components in hybrid project, subject to the condition that, rated power capacity of one resource be at least 25 per cent of the rated power capacity of other resource for it to be recognised hybrid project.

 

The Policy seeks to promote new hybrid projects as well as hybridisation of existing wind/solar projects. The existing wind/solar projects can be hybridised with higher transmission capacity than the sanctioned one, subject to availability of margin in the existing transmission capacity.

 

The Policy provides for procurement of power from a hybrid project on tariff based transparent bidding process for which Government entities may invite bids. Policy also permits use of battery storage in the hybrid project for optimising the output and further reduce the variability. It mandates the regulatory authorities to formulate necessary standards and regulations for wind-solar hybrid systems.

 

With significant capacity additions in renewables in recent years and with Hybrid Policy aiming at better utilisation of resources, it is envisaged that the Hybrid Policy will open-up a new area for availability of renewable power at competitive prices along with reduced variability. A scheme for new hybrid projects under the policy is also expected shortly.

During the Swachhata Pakhwada, the Department carried out time-bound activities viz. recording, reviewing and weeding out of old records, initiating action for auction of old and obsolete items, cleaning of fans, furniture and other electronic items. Office premises, canteen, toilets, and surrounding areas adjacent to the building have been cleaned and potted plants have been put to create an eco-friendly environment. A poster/slogan competition was organised on the theme of Swachh Bharat. An appreciation certificate will be awarded for the best workstation in the Department. The Department has implemented 100% e-office. All records have been digitized and the physical files, which were not required to be retained, have been removed. The Department has replaced plastic bottles by glass bottles. The gents toilet has been renovated. The DARPG spent the entire Rs.6 lakhs sum allocated to it during 2017-18. The allocation has been enhanced to Rs.10 lakhs during the current financial year.

                 The Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) Shri K.V. Chowdary has called for preventive vigilance to check occurrence of corrupt practices.  Speaking at the inauguration of a workshop on “Preventive Vigilance- Dissemination of Good Practices” here today, he said, this can be achieved by identifying and plugging vulnerable areas through systemic improvements and structural remedies. He said these measures fulfil the objective of preempting corrupt practices and further enhance the organisational efficiency.  

Shri Chowdary said while probable vulnerable areas are unique to organisations, few commonly occurring corrupt practices are in areas like procurement, sale of goods and services, human resource management, delivery of services to public and enforcement.  He called for improving existing systems, reviewing processes for simplification, leveraging technology, reducing personal discretion, effective control and supervision, educating citizens and training for bringing about transparency and accountability in organisations.

The one-day workshop has five sessions where government organisations and Public Sector Undertakings including Financial Institutions gave presentations and shared good practices adopted by them. Some of the themes for discussion included IT-based recruitment system, use of geospatial technology for infrastructure and planning, vehicle monitoring system, leveraging technology for preventive vigilance, digitisation of land records and systemic improvements in concept of concurrent audit.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) conducted a meeting with 17 heat wave-prone States here today to review their preparedness and mitigation measures. In view of the recent incidents of thunderstorm and lightning, preparedness measures relating to these hazards were also assessed.

 

In the meeting conducted through video conference, Shri R. K. Jain, Member, NDMA, requested the States to run extensive public awareness campaigns in local languages to educate people about the simple ways of mitigating the impact of heat waves and lightning. 

He also asked the States to work on developing thresholds at local levels and ensure wider dissemination of early warnings.

 

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) informed that besides the regular five-day forecasts, it now comes out with a special heat bulletins at 0730 hrs to help people plan their day accordingly.

 

A detailed review of the preparedness of the States in terms of having Heat Action Plans up to the district level, providing shelters, drinking water, rescheduling work timings to avoid peak heat impact for labourers, medical treatment, etc. was carried out.

 

NDMA underlined the importance of training all stakeholders to build local capacities and ensure better response in an emergency. The Authority also asked the States to share a report on the activities carried out by them so that best practices followed by one State can be suitably adapted by others.

 

Besides, NDMA has been running an all-out awareness campaign on social media on the do’s and don’ts of heat wave, thunderstorms and lightning. NDMA's  “Beat The Heat India” campaign is being widely used and publicised by various other stakeholders.

                Jammu & Kashmir Minister for Health & Medical Education, Dr Devinder Kumar Manyal,  called on Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and discussed a wide range of issues related to healthcare and medical education in the State.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh brought to the notice of the Health Minister, the widely prevalent complaint of non-availability of doctors at various Primary Health Centres and also at several district hospitals. He was of the opinion that a judicious policy will have to be adopted to ensure the presence of doctors at their respective places of posting. To overcome the shortage of doctors at peripheral health centres, he suggested that a mechanism could be adopted wherein such Medicos who had obtained admission in medical colleges against RBA or LOC quota could be strictly asked to go back and serve in the same area for the initial years of their service.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh also referred to the Maharashtra pattern where any Medico, who wishes to leave the State after obtaining MBBS or MD degree from a State Medical College, is expected to deposit a heavy amount as compensation to the State ex-chequer, in lieu of the loss caused as a result of his departure from the State after obtaining a degree.

 

In view of the Government of India's drive to set up Dialysis units for kidney patients across the country, Dr Jitendra Singh said, it may not be practically possible to have so many Nephrologists available and therefore, the State Government could depute its Physicians for short-term training to carry out dialysis. He said, he had done this experiment in the Northeast by introducing a new initiative two years ago, wherein, from each of the eight States of the region, the Ministry of DoNER deputes one physician and one surgeon each for a six months' training in Oncology at the country's leading Adyar Cancer Institute in Chennai, so as to be able to cater to a very high prevalence of cancer, particularly head and neck region cancer, in the North Eastern States. On the same lines, short-term trainings could also be arranged to gain expertise in Radiology, Ultrasonography and other clinical streams, he added.

 

During the meeting, the issue of having more transparency and accountability in allotment of fair price shops within hospital premises also came up.

 

Dr Manyal requested Dr Jitendra Singh to use his  good offices for arranging Central funds for purchase of latest hi-tech equipment including latest generation MRI machines, etc. for the State-run hospitals. He also sought Dr Jitendra Singh's advice and support in opening up a chain of generic medicine outlets at affordable prices and said that since Dr Singh was himself a renowned clinician, he could also offer his professional inputs in this regard.

 

Dr Manyal also gave Dr Jitendra Singh an update about the current status of the teaching faculty in the Government Medical Colleges of the State.

                Smt. Meenakshi Lekhi, MP (Lok Sabha), New Delhi and Member, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice launched the “Swachhata Abhiyan” of the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG), Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, here today. The DARPG is observing the ‘Swachhata Pakhwada’ at its premises at Sardar Patel Bhawan from May 16 to 31, 2018 to renew and reinforce the concept of cleanliness among the officers and staff of the Department.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Smt. Lekhi said cleanliness helps improve productivity, making governance responsive and attentive to the people at large. On the other hand, unclean and dirty office environment impacts attitude and results in a casual approach to work, she added. Smt. Lekhi said the DARPG, dealing with Public Grievances, represents the front office of the entire Government set up and hence cleanliness assumes more significance in its premises. Smt. Lekhi suggested that all ladies toilets in government offices should have sanitary pad dispensers and incinerators. She also advocated replacing plastic pad with organic pads like those made of banana fibres, cotton cloth and reusable materials so as not to precipitate environmental pollution.

 

Earlier, the Secretary, DARPG and Secretary, Department of Pensions & Pensioners’ Welfare, Shri KV Eapen said the Department has prepared a chronological plan of activities during the ‘Swachhata Pakhwada’.  Various activities have been planned on a daily basis during the fortnight in which the staff will be encouraged to participate, he added.

 

Giving details of the modernization programme of the DARPG, Joint Secretary, DARPG, Smt. Smita Kumar said the Department has implemented 100% e-office and digitised all records.

 

The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh and a senior officer from M/o Drinking Water & Sanitation are scheduled to visit the office premises on May 29, 2018 to inspect the implementation of the Swachhata Action Plan.

                A delegation of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), represented by its Pratiraksha (Industrial) unit called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and discussed wide range of issues related to Central Government employees, including Insurance, Pension, promotions and other matters.

 

In a memorandum presented to the Minister, the delegation submitted that the Central Government Employees Group Insurance Scheme was notified on 1st November 1980 and came into effect from 1st January 1982. The scheme is intended to provide Central Government employees, at a low cost, on a wholly contributory and self-financing basis, the twin benefits of an insurance cover to their families in the event of death in service and a lump-sum payment to augment their financial sources on retirement. However, the BMS demands that the government should immediately notify the customized Group Insurance Scheme for Central Government employees with low premium and high risk cover.

 

The memorandum also expressed discontentment of a section of employees for being left out from the provision of minimum guaranteed pension under National Pension Scheme (NPS). It requested that a minimum pension be guaranteed equivalent to 50% of the employee's last drawn Basic Pay plus Dearness Relief for neutralization of price rise.

 

Among other issues raised by the delegation was the demand for one-time relaxation for compassionate appointments. This has become important because a large number of wards are waiting for their appointment on compassionate grounds to look after their family.

 

The delegation also demanded the framing of an appropriate transfer policy in all cadres in favour of single woman/single mother employees. They requested that whenever such women are given postings, it should be mandatorily ensured that they are placed at stations closest to their hometown or the place of their choice.

 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that he will direct the DoPT to process the issues related to them, while other issues related to other Ministries will be referred for the perusal and views of the respective Ministries.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh, who is also a nationally renowned Diabetologist, released here a compilation of ""Indian Guidelines for Management of Diabetes Mellitus"", prepared by ""Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India"" (RSSDI).

At a function held here today and attended by RSSDI National President-Elect Dr Rajeev Chawla, National Secretary Dr B.M. Makkar and all the National Executive Members, MoS Dr Jitendra Singh, while releasing the book, congratulated the RSSDI office bearers for having come out with a comprehensive updated version of Indian guidelines for management of Diabetes Mellitus. He recalled his nearly three-decade long association with RSSDI, which he served in different capacities as Executive Member as well as Scientific Chairman, and said that the set of Indian guidelines released today is a befitting tribute to the legacy which we had inherited from the founding fathers of RSSDI including Prof. V. Vishwanathan, Prof. Sam G.P. Moses, Prof. B.B. Tripathi, Prof. H.B. Chandalia, Prof. M.M.S. Ahuja and Prof. V. Seshiah.

Dr Jitendra Singh recalled that possibly the first set of Indian guidelines for management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus was prepared way back in 1990s by a team of medicos, of which he himself was also a member and the team was headed by Prof. B.K. Sahay of Usmania Medical College, Hyderabad. These guidelines, he said, were published in a special issue of ""Journal of Association of Physicians of India"" (JAPI).

In one of the RSSDI Annual meets nearly two decades ago, Dr Jitendra Singh recalled, the theme was ""Screening for complications at the time of diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus"" and expressed satisfaction that the new guidelines released today have devoted sufficient emphasis and elaboration to this aspect. He also recalled a paper published by him and others under the title ""Economic Burden of Diabetes"" which too was published in JAPI over a decade ago and said, he was happy to note that the issue of cost effectiveness in the management of Diabetes had also been discussed in the guidelines released today.

Referring to the Government's sensitive approach towards the healthcare in contemporary India, Dr Jitendra Singh made a special mention of the decision taken under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to have a country-wide setting up of Kidney Dialysis Units in Government set-up and also provide health insurance cover under Ayushman Bharat. He said, it was Prime Minister who realized the importance of Yoga in the management of widely prevalent diseases like Type2 Diabetes Mellitus and successfully persuaded the United Nations Organization (UNO) to observe the International Day of Yoga annually.

With more than 70% of India's population below the age of 40 years, Dr Jitendra Singh said, a tight management of Diabetes Mellitus, particularly in the young, has become a national priority.

Makkar and all the National Executive Members, MoS Dr Jitendra Singh, while releasing the book, congratulated the RSSDI office bearers for having come out with a comprehensive updated version of Indian guidelines for management of Diabetes Mellitus. He recalled his nearly three-decade long association with RSSDI, which he served in different capacities as Executive Member as well as Scientific Chairman, and said that the set of Indian guidelines released today is a befitting tribute to the legacy which we had inherited from the founding fathers of RSSDI including Prof. V. Vishwanathan, Prof. Sam G.P. Moses, Prof. B.B. Tripathi, Prof. H.B. Chandalia, Prof. M.M.S. Ahuja and Prof. V. Seshiah.

Dr Jitendra Singh recalled that possibly the first set of Indian guidelines for management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus was prepared way back in 1990s by a team of medicos, of which he himself was also a member and the team was headed by Prof. B.K. Sahay of Usmania Medical College, Hyderabad. These guidelines, he said, were published in a special issue of ""Journal of Association of Physicians of India"" (JAPI).

In one of the RSSDI Annual meets nearly two decades ago, Dr Jitendra Singh recalled, the theme was ""Screening for complications at the time of diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus"" and expressed satisfaction that the new guidelines released today have devoted sufficient emphasis and elaboration to this aspect. He also recalled a paper published by him and others under the title ""Economic Burden of Diabetes"" which too was published in JAPI over a decade ago and said, he was happy to note that the issue of cost effectiveness in the management of Diabetes had also been discussed in the guidelines released today.

Referring to the Government's sensitive approach towards the healthcare in contemporary India, Dr Jitendra Singh made a special mention of the decision taken under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to have a country-wide setting up of Kidney Dialysis Units in Government set-up and also provide health insurance cover under Ayushman Bharat. He said, it was Prime Minister who realized the importance of Yoga in the management of widely prevalent diseases like Type2 Diabetes Mellitus and successfully persuaded the United Nations Organization (UNO) to observe the International Day of Yoga annually.

With more than 70% of India's population below the age of 40 years, Dr Jitendra Singh said, a tight management of Diabetes Mellitus, particularly in the young, has become a national priority.

During the event, Dr Jitendra Singh welcomed and congratulated all the successful candidates and described them as “architects of the New India”. He urged them to utilise the opportunities available during their long careers for building a ‘New India’, which is going to be a super power. He noted that out of the 20 top rankers, 14 have engineering background and 2 medical background. Many of them had early education from Government schools in small towns. This indicates that educational opportunities to excel are not just limited to the metro cities, he added.  He said that it has been a learning experience to interact with the young achievers during the felicitation, which is being organised by the Government for the last four years. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, during the last few years, Government has initiated the practice of posting IAS officers early in their careers as Assistant Secretaries to be mentored for a period of 3 months in different Ministries/Departments of Government of India. It introduces the officers to various aspects of the functioning of the Central Government, he said. He wished all the candidates a great success for their future.

Addressing the toppers, Secretary, DoPT, Shri C. Chandramouli said that the young officers have a lot to learn during their long tenure in civil services where they will meet various challenges in due course. He expressed confidence that they would find innovative solutions to these challenges. He wished the toppers best in their future career. 

Senior officers of Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and parents & guardians of the young achievers were also present on the occasion.

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production 

 

 

Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall have been given in following sub-sections:

 


	
	
		Crude oil production by ONGC during April, 2018 was 1777.33 TMT which is 1.36% higher than the monthly target but 3.78% lower when compared with April, 2017.  
		Crude oil production by OIL during April, 2018 was 274.33 TMT which is 1.65% lower than monthly target but 0.24% higher than production in April, 2017. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
	
	
	
	
		Less than planned contribution from old wells – Rise in water cut in wells and decline in total liquid production of wells of Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari Fields. 
	
	
	Less than planned contribution from work over wells.


 


	
	
		Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2018 was 863.33 TMT which is 2.64% higher than the monthly target and 5.48% higher than April, 2017. Shortfall in production was mainly due to closure of 2 wells in D1D3 and 1 well in MA field KG-DWN-98/3 and well B6 ceased to flow on 30/4/2018 due to low reservoir pressure.  
	
	


 

Natural Gas 


	Natural gas production during April, 2018 was 2662.97 MMSCM which is 0.95% higher than the target for the month and 5.10% higher when compared with April, 2017. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II.

Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production

 

 


	
	
		Natural gas production by ONGC during April, 2018 was 1972.04 MMSCM which is 4.93% higher than the monthly target and 10.11% higher when compared with April, 2017. 
	
	


 


	
	
		Natural gas production by OIL during April, 2018 was 221.42 MMSCM which is 6.81% lower than the monthly target and 8.23% lower than April, 2017. The shortfall in gas production is primarily due to temporary suspension of supply to NEEPCO for about 8 days due to pigging and cleaning of their delivery line by the transporter M/s. AGCL. Upliftment of gas by M/s. BVFCL also suffered due to unscheduled maintenance work at their Namrup-II & III plants.
	
	


 


	
	
		Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2018 was 469.51 MMSCM which is 9.85% lower than the monthly target and 6.36% lower when compared with April, 2017. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
	
	


 


	Sohagpur West CBM Block: Underperformance of CBM wells. (RIL)
	AAP-ON-94/1: Production lowered due to less consumer demand. (HOEC)
	Raniganj East CBM block: Some wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs. Major customer 'Matix' under operational shutdown. (ESSAR)
	KG-DWN-98/3: Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 and 1 well in MA field.  In D1D3 field, well A13 on 15 Dec 2017, A5 on 24 Jan 2018 B6 on 30 April 2018 ceased and well A20 stopped flowing from 18 Feb to 10 March 2018 due to low reservoir pressure. (RIL)

Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production 

 

 

3.1    CPSE Refineries’ production during April, 2018 was 11635.25 TMT which is 0.59% lower than the target for the month but 4.20% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


	
	
		
		
			IOCL, Paradip: Lower due delay in stabilization post M&I shutdown.
			HPCL, Visakh: Lower due to unplanned CDU shutdown..
			CPCL, Manali: Lower due to FCCU / DCU shutdown.

                Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, along with H.E. Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, UAE Minister of State and ADNOC Group CEO witnessed the loading of first consignment of 2 million barrels of ADNOC crude for Mangalore Cavern today. Minister Pradhan is visiting UAE to follow up on the February 2018 state visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During the visit of PM, Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL) signed an agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) of UAE under which ADNOC will store about 5.86 million barrels of crude oil in India’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) facility at Mangalore at its own cost.

ISPRL has built 5.33 million tonnes (around 39 million barrels) of strategic crude oil storage at three locations located at Vishakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur. Vishakhapatnam storage has a capacity of 1.33 million tonnes (9.77 million barrels) of crude oil, Mangalore has a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes (11 million barrels) and Padur can stock 2.5 million tonnes (18.37 million barrels).Government of India can use the entire available crude oil stored by ADNOC in the Mangalore SPR facility during an emergency situation. The Agreement with ISPRL also allows ADNOC to sell part of the crude oil to Indian refineries on commercial basis while adhering to mutually agreed minimum crude storage which is for exclusive use of the Indian government. 

During the day, Minister Pradhan also held bilateral meeting with H.E. Dr. Jaber. Minister Pradhan was accompanied by Ambassador Navdeep Suri, senior officials and CEOs for Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum. Both sides discussed on the ongoing cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector and explored ways to further enhance the engagement. They had detailed discussions on the Indian downstream sector and explored the various opportunities for participation of UAE companies in the mega petroleum sector infrastructure projects in India. Minister Pradhan also invited UAE companies to participate as preferred partners in the entire hydrocarbon value chain of India.

The Minister also had an interactive session with over 250 Indian professionals, business leaders and community representatives working in the UAE. The event was organised by the Embassy of India in Abu Dhabi in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi Chapter of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and IBPG-Abu Dhabi.

                This is in reference to some news reports on increase in LPG prices in the recent months which is not based on facts. In this connection, it is clarified that the retail selling price of LPG (non-subsidized price) at Delhi has come down from Rs.747/- in the month of December, 2017 to Rs.650.50/- in the month of May, 2018, a fall of Rs.96.50/-. This is the price at which a consumer purchases the cylinder refill and the subsidy gets transferred to his account.

 

Effective cost to consumer after subsidy has also come down from Rs.495.69/- in December, 2017 to Rs.491.21/- in May, 2018. This is the actual cost the consumer bears for a LPG refill.

                Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmednra Pradhan has said that, “LPG penetration in the State of Odisha has reached 58.55 % by 1st May 2018 which was at 20% level in June 2014 and the government has set a target of providing gas connections to 80.0 lac household by the end of December 2018. Pradhan added that 24.23 lacs connections have been released under Prime Minister Ujjwala Yojna and 1000 new LPG distributors will be added to the list  in the last two years which shows the enhanced LPG penetration in the state. 

Speaking at the Pradhan Mantri LPG Panchayat held today at Mangalajodi in Tangi Block of Khorda district of Odisha as part of the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan Pradhan said that, currently 4 bottling plants are existing in the state of Odisha (2nd Carousel added at Balasore Bottling Plant & 2nd Shift started at Jharsuguda Bottling Plant Last Year) and three new bottling plants are being planned to be set up in Khorda, Bolangir and Rayagada districts in the state. 

The Union Minister said that, “400 villages saturated with LPG connections and other benefits under Gram Swaraj Abhiyan and 670 LPG Panchayats conducted on Ujjawala Diwas on 20th April and 400 LPG Panchayats were conducted from 3rd-5th May under Gram Swaraj Abhiyan and LPG Penetration in Khurda district is 100 %. as on May 1st 2018” 

LPG Panchayats are being observed to promote learning through peer group interaction - Kuch Seekhein, Kuch Sikhayein, where apart from experience sharing, it also aims at safe and sustained usage of LPG, to maximize customer is demonstrated.

Women who have experienced the benefits of cooking with LPG can now boost the confidence of other women about adopting this clean, green cooking fuel safely and without any reservations or misconceptions. Sharing of experiences by actual users on how to use LPG safely, as well as spread the message of its multiple benefits, like health, environment and empowerment of women and learning through peer group interaction are the objectives of LPG Panchayats.

                The OALP Bid Round – I was successfully concluded on May 2, 2018.  This was the first ever auction of blocks under the Open Acreage Licensing Programme (‘OALP’) in India. Path breaking Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (‘HELP’), which was approved by the Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, in March 2016, has been the centre-piece of upstream Oil and Gas sector reform process in the country. OALP under the aegis of Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) is meant to steer India as a global E&P investment destination. 

Investors had submitted Expression of Interest (EoI) for fifty-five blocks spread across the country for carrying out Exploration and Production activities. Sh. Dharmendra Pradhan, Union Cabinet Minister in charge of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas inaugurated the National Data Depository and opened OALP process in June 2017. 55 EoI’s received were put on bid in the month of January 2018. These 55 blocks spread across 10 sedimentary basins of India were on offer, spread across Onland, Shallow Water (offshore), and Deepwater areas, cover around 60,000 sqkms.  The blocks are spread all across the Indian sedimentary areas, namely, Assam-Arakan (19), Mumbai Offshore (2), Cambay (11), Rajasthan (9), KG (5), Cauvery (3), Kutch (2), Saurashtra (2), Himalayan Foreland (1) and Ganga (1) basins. 

HELP policy paradigm on which OALP is based has following reform components: 


	Based on Revenue Sharing Contract
	Provides Unified Licensing for Conventional and Unconventional Hydrocarbons
	Blocks have been carved out by investors based on data from National Data Repository (NDR)
	Market Pricing and free access to the market for the product 
	Low regulatory burden


MoPNG and DGH undertook interactive sessions and road-shows in India (Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Hyderabad and Kolkata) and abroad (Houston, London/Aberdeen, Istanbul, Abu Dhabi) to disseminate the process and the benefits of OALP to the E&P investor community, under the guidance and leadership of the Minister, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan. Further digital marketing campaign was carried on several websites globally during the bidding period for attracting the attention of global fraternity. Round the clock support was provided by DGH facilitation desk and the bid platform service provider, to clarify any issues the prospective bidders faced. 

Since inception of NELP, when bidding at such a large is taking place, this is the highest number of bids since 2009. After the success of Discovered Small Field (DSF) bid round- 2016, this is the first time that the bids were invited under the new Revenue Sharing Regime for the exploration blocks, where bidders quoted Revenue Share and their Work Programme commitments, with no need for audits for their expenses and with clearly defined timelines for exploration and development. 

In spite of challenging global market environment, where E & P investments are in consolidation mode, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) received 110 e-Bids for the 55 blocks on offer by the deadline of 1200 Hours (IST) on 02 May 2018. Despite the above challenges, the response to OALP Bid Round-I has been very favourable and reaffirmed the investor sentiment in the Indian E&P sector. The overwhelming response received from the investor community is a testament of Investor’s confidence in the renewed policy framework chronicled by Government. A measure of competition can be gauged by the fact that only two blocks received single bids. Rest all, received two or more than two bids.

 Hitherto 87% of Mining lease area was controlled by National Oil Companies, but with the advent of HELP and DSF new private players have shown considerable interest in Indian E & P sector thereby leading to further private investments in this sector.  Also, this bid round sees a huge accretion of 60,000 sq.km to the exploration area. This is about 60% of the area presently under exploration.

Out of the total 110 e-bids received, 92 e-bids were received for inland blocks and 18 e-bids were received for offshore blocks. As many as 9 companies (Individually or as member of the bidding consortium) have participated in the bid round. The response to the OALP Bid Round has been overwhelming as compared to the last round of E&P auctions under the NELP regime in 2009-10, largely credited to the new policy reforms which have improved the ease of doing business by introducing a transparent regulatory framework. It is pertinent to mention that all the 55 blocks offered in OALP Bid Round – I have been bid and it is a 100% success. Out of 55 blocks on offer 46 blocks are on onland 8 blocks are in shallow water and one block in deep water.

The technical bid documents (online and hard copies) were opened on 02 May 2018 at DGH’s Noida office in the presence of the bidders. The evaluation of the bids would be undertaken in a time bound manner and decision on award would be taken by Empowered Committee of Secretaries and Group of Ministers, after the commercial bids are opened.

The Government endeavours to award the blocks by June 2018, so as to expedite the exploration activities to establish some part of the huge prognosticated conventional hydrocarbon resources of the order of 230 billion barrels of O+OEG in the “Yet-to-Find” category in India. 

The award of these blocks would lead to significant uptick in the E&P activities in India. In the long run, discoveries from these blocks would go towards enhancing domestic production and reduction of the import dependence of India. As OALP is a continuing process, success in this bid round is likely to spur many new investors for second and subsequent Rounds.

Bhalla, Secretary, Power said NTPC is the flagship company of the whole country and complemented the management for bringing in the spirit of innovation to tackle these issues for a clean environment. The conference is an ideal platform for all stakeholders to collate and interact on imperatives and issues facing the sector and use them at power projects on Pan-India basis.

In its effort to curb air pollution, the NTPC had invited tender for procurement of agro residue based biomass pellets. It has been successful in obtaining the commitment for receiving approximately 200 metric tonnes per day of agro residue based fuel at NTPC Dadri. It will generate approximately 150 MU of renewable electricity annually. 

NTPC is actively working to find out the solution for Agro residue and Municipal Solid Waste to Power the workshop is deliberating issues amongst policy makers, pellets manufacturers, regulators, financiers and power professionals, waste to energy experts and companies in the field of waste to energy.

                Shri R K Singh, Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Government of India, laid the foundation stone of the Underground Cabling Project in the Kumbh area of Haridwar today. The project is very significant as Haridwar is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in India and a large number of devotees visit this holy city round the year.

 

Speaking after the foundation laying ceremony, Shri RK Singh said that millions of devotees come to Haridwar during Kumbh. This project will ensure the safety of pilgrims and enhance the aesthetics of the divine city. The project will benefit the citizens of Uttrakhand by way of reduced electricity losses. Roads will also become wider once overhead electric poles are removed.

This project will be implemented in Haridwar under the Government’s flagship scheme ‘Integrated Power Development Scheme’ (IPDS). Underground cables have several advantages e.g. – reduced losses, low chances of developing faults and low maintenance costs. Whereas overhead lines are vulnerable to lightning strikes which may lead to interruption.

Several dignitaries from Power Ministry and Uttarakhand Government graced at the occasion.

                Village electrification targets under‘Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojna’ (DDUGJY) have been achieved well before time.The Union Government, State agencies and all other stakeholders involved directly or indirectly in this program deserve appreciation and applause for putting in unprecedented efforts to ensure completion of task within the targeted time frame.

It is worthwhile to mention that most of the remaining villages were located in remote and inaccessible areas with difficult hilly terrain, deep forest areas, Left Wing Extremism affected areas and therefore probably remained neglected for electrification. 

The progress of village electrification in three years from 2012-13 to 2014-15, prior to commencement of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojna (DDUGJY), on an average was only 1730 villages per year, including lowest ever figure of 1197 villages in 2013-14.

There are reports in some sections of media that some villages are still un-electrified, contrary to the Governments’ claim of achieving 100 per cent village electrification. In this connection, it may be reiterated that the Government had taken up electrification of remaining un-electrified census villages, duly identifiable as per census code, reported by the States as on 01.04.2015, under ‘Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana’ (DDUGJY). Electrification of all these villages has been reported complete by all the concerned States. Some of the households in sub-village units viz. habitations/hamlets/Dhanis/Majras/Tolasmay not be having electricity as of now, and it is felt that certain news agencies are reporting about such habitations. 

The Government has already launched ‘Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana’- ‘Saubgaya’ to provide last mile connectivity and service connections to all remaining households in both rural and urban areas to achieve universal household electrification.All the remaining households including located in the habitations/hamlets/Dhanis/Majras/Tolas associated with the Census villages and households attached to urban settlements would be covered under ‘Saubhagya’.

Most of the villages reported in the news reports are in fact habitations / hamlets / Dhanis / Majras / Tolasand not the Census village, as described below-

(i) Madhya Pradesh

The 3 villages in Alirajpur District namely Jhandana, Amba and Chameli are situated in submerged areas of SardarSarovar. The villagers have been shifted to Kakrana village which is electrified but some villagers have shifted to another nearby locality which is a habitation not yet electrified.

In Raisen District, Khananpura village is already electrified and intensive electrification in associated Tola is under progress. The other 5 villages of Raisen district namely Jaitgarh, Bili, Pond, Ramgarha and Gopalpur are forest villages wherein households have been electrified with solar power.

(ii) Rajasthan

All inhabited revenue / census villages in Dholpur district are reported to be electrified. The names of villages reported in the news articles are in fact Dhanis and not the revenue / census village. Intensive electrification works of GolekaPura and Shankar PuraDhanis have been completed and in remaining Dhanis, namely Ghuraiya Hera, Hathiyakhar, KehrikaNagla, Haripura, and Thakur Pura, the intensive electrification works are in progress.

The Rajghat village is presently covered under municipal area of Dholpur and as such the households in urban areas are having access to electricity unless disconnected.

(iii) Jharkhand

The Saprumvillage reported in the news reports is an electrified village but power is disrupted since long.

                Ministry of Railways has revised its passenger reservation form to benefit the passengers booking tickets through PRS Counters across the nation. Now, the VIKALP scheme option will also be available on booking made through reservation windows and not just through online bookings. 

In the revised reservation form, passengers are given an option either to avail the option of VIKALP scheme or not to avail it, where they may give their preference by ticking the column Yes or No. If the option of VIKALP is availed by passengers, he/she would have to mark his/her choice of alternate train departing within 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours. Also, passenger is given an optional choice to mention their Aadhar number in the reservation form.

It is noteworthy that with a view to provide confirmed accommodation to waitlisted passengers and also to ensure optimal utilisation of available accommodation, a scheme called Alternate Train Accommodation Scheme – VIKALP had been conceptualised and was introduced w.e.f. 01.11.2015 initially only for the tickets booked through internet as a pilot project for six months, on Delhi-Lucknow and Delhi-Jammu sectors of Northern Railway. Later on this scheme was extended in all sectors across Indian Railways. In this scheme, wait listed passengers of a train can opt for confirmed accommodation in alternate trains. 

Now, the benefit of Vikalp option has also been made available through PRS counters and not just online bookings.

                Ministry of Railways conducted a one day workshop “Mission Raftaar” aimed at raising the average speed of freight trains and coaching trains in New Delhi.  The workshop was inaugurated by Shri Rajen Gohain, Minister of State for Railways & Shri Ashwani Lohani, Chairman,Railway Board. All the members of Railway Board along with General Managers of Zonal Railways & Senior Railway officers were present on the occasion.

 

On this occasion, Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of Railways & Coal  said, “This workshop is an exercise with the top management of Indian Railways to brainstorm about the increase in speed of freight and passenger trains. Also, host of issues ranging from punctuality, rolling stock, removing bottlenecks in terms of traffic, elimination of Unmanned Level crossings were discussed. Indian Railways is enthusiastically taking up all the issues with the determination to find the solution in a time bound manner.” He also stated that coal loading was highest i.e. 555 MT in 2017-18. In last three months, 18.7%  increase is witnessed in coal loading. Ministry of Railways & Coal is coordinating well so as to ensure there is no shortage of coal in power plants. He added that demand for coal has also witnessed an increase due to less imports. He complimented Coal India Limited for increasing supply of coal in last three months.

 

Earlier in the day, in the inaugural remarks, Shri Rajen Gohain, Minister of  State for Railways said, “Indian Railways has been emphasizing on capacity building and lot of work has been done, now the time has come to address the bottlenecks so the speeds of trains can be increased. Railway officials have the best expertise to come up with solutions to implement Mission Raftar.”

 

Shri Ashwani Lohani, Chairman, Railway Board in his inaugural remarks said, “This workshop aims to address the futuristic needs of Indian Railways. Indian Railways have been prioritising safety of its passengers and Indian Railways have considerably achieved the best figures in safety record. It is the time to ponder over the challenges which have been a constraint in providing speed to the trains, also a strategy needs to be devised & implemented.”

 

About Mission Raftar:

 

It aims at doubling the average speed of freight trains and increasing average speed of coaching trains by 25kmph over a five year period.

 

Average freight train speeds are ~24kmph and average passenger train speeds (excluding suburban trains) is ~44kmph.Increasing average speed of trains is considered essential for reducing the travel time for passengers, transit time for cargo, operational cost, improving revenues and railway’s market share.

 

This is part of the strategy to keep pace with the growing competition from the competing modes viz. road and airlines etc.  In the national perspective, rail share of ~45% in the transport basket is considered desirable in view of railways being environment friendly and economical mode of transport.

 

Major constraints to mobility such as non uniform sectional speeds, level crossings, low speed turnouts, low speed/ acceleration/ deceleration of passenger trains, adequacy of horse power of trains, time response of braking system etc. have been identified and a multi-pronged strategy has been developed to overcome the existing impediments due to fixed infrastructure, movable infrastructure, operational practices and institutional mechanisms. 

 

Specific Actions and Policy Decisions have been initiated on the railways for addressing different factors inhibiting average speeds. Principal routes of the railways on Golden Quadrilateral along with diagonals (Delhi – Mumbai, Delhi – Howrah, Howrah- Chennai, Chennai – Mumbai, Delhi – Chennai and Howrah – Mumbai) which carry approximately 58% of freight traffic and 52% of coaching traffic with a share of only 15% of the network taken up for initial emphasis.

                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (earlier Victoria Terminus) has completed 130 years of its construction on 20th May 2018. The present day Headquarters building of Central Railway popularly known as Victoria Terminus (now Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus) is an architectural marvel. This magnificent monument was originally planned as the office of GIP (Great Indian Peninsular) Railway. This is the most photographed building after Taj Mahal, and was designed by Frederick William Stevens, a consulting architect. Thus taking almost a decade to built it at a princely sum of Rs. 16,13,863/- Stevens designed the monumental Terminus which was the largest building then erected in Asia and which even today is a standing testimony of his innovative talent. 

 

The construction started in 1878 and on jubilee Day in 1887, it was named after Queen Empress Victoria. Later in 1996, it was renamed as Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. It was again renamed as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in July 2017. In 2004, UNESCO has enlisted this building as World Heritage Site for its architectural splendour. From December 2012, this heritage building has been opened for public viewing on working days.  

 


	Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (earlier Victoria Terminus) was constructed at a cost of Rs.16.14 lakh and is designed in Gothic style adapted to suit Indian context. It is a C shaped building planned symmetrically about the east west axis. The crowning point of the whole building is the central main dome carrying up a colossal 16’-6’’ high figure of lady pointing a flaming torch upwards in her right hand, and a spoked wheel low in the left hand, symbolizing `Progress’. This dome has been reported to be the first octagonal ribbed masonry dome that was adapted to an Italian Gothic style building. 


 

The station was constructed with 6 platforms at a cost of Rs.10.4 lakh and in 1929, the first remodeling took place to have 13 platforms. Further modifications were done to the yard and the station had two more platforms thus making it a total of 15 platforms in 1994. Today it has 18 platforms with a spacious east side entry as well. In April 2018, a heritage gully was inaugurated adjacent to platform no.18, wherein Sir. Leslie Wilson, the GIP Heritage Electric Loco, and other heritage items are displayed.

 

During Centenary celebrations of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus Building, a postal stamp was released. In 2013, when the building celebrated quasi-centennial (125 years) anniversary, a special postal cover was released on the occasion.

                In line with Government’s priority to provide connectivity to Northeast region and empowering local industries of this region particularly, Northeast Frontier Railway has started operating one lease Parcel Cargo Express Train (PCET) on fortnightly basis,  connecting Northeastern part of the country to the West Coast. The route of this Parcel Cargo Express Train lease is : New Guwahati in Assam to Kalyan in Maharashtra with stoppages at New Jalpaiguri, Kalumna Goods Shed. This move would enable farmers to market their products like tea, betal nuts, pineapple, jute, horticulture products, cane furniture etc. at the retail markets in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Nagpur, Pune etc. This initiative will not only promote industries of the region particularly but will also provide sustainable job opportunity to the local youths including unskilled labour.  

 

Parcel Cargo Express Train has emerged as a business tool and this has been done without any additional strain on the resources of the railways. These leased PCETs will also generate substantial revenue to the Indian Railways in their contractual periods of 6 years each. The Unit transportation cost through PCET will be relatively less than the cost of road transportation. So, the transporters as well as ultimate consumers will be benefited on account of less transportation cost.   A single PCET can carry consignment equivalent to 52 nos. of trucks. This will ensure less Carbon Emission which will contribute for Green India & saving of foreign exchange on account of purchasing of fuel. 

             

Several other zonal Railways have also taken initiatives to lease out Parcel Cargo Express Train(PCETs) on round trip

                The Union Minister of Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal chaired a detailed review meeting with Shri R.K. Singh, Minister of State (IC) Power and New & Renewable Energy and with top officials of Ministries of Coal, Railways and Power in New Delhi today.

In the meeting, review of Power supply requirement during the ongoing summer and forthcoming winter season was carried out. Various short term, medium term and long term measures were discussed in detail to improve the coal stock position in Power Plants of the country.  

Comprehensive review of targets for coal production and dispatches by the coal companies is carried out.  

Shri Piyush Goyal stressed on the necessity to increase Plant Load Factor (PLF) of various Power Plants of the country. He said that all pithead plants with sufficient coal supply should run at 100% PLF. He expressed the desire to hold fortnightly meeting of the ministries involved, to review the power situation in the country.

He stressed on the need for States located far from mines to use provisions under “Flexibility of utilization of Coal” rules, so that this coal can be used by those power stations near the coal source . Gujarat and Maharashtra have already been using these provisions. This will enable cheaper power to the respective States and efficient utilization of rolling stock enabling coal supply for other power stations.

He gave clear instructions to the officials of the three ministries to keep a close vigil on the power production and supply situation in the country and to keep in close touch with Chief Secretaries and Power Secretaries of the States for this purpose.

Shri Goyal expressed the need to improve the turnaround time of rakes by better scheduling of trains and optimum utilization of traffic blocks. He expressed the need to rationalize operational and maintenance practices on the high density routes of Indian Railways.  

He stressed on reducing terminal detention of wagons inside Power Plants and Coal sidings to generate extra capacity. 

Last but not the least, he emphasized that team effort, better coordination between Ministries involved and the rationalization of work procedures will lead to generation of extra capacity within the existing system and ensure 24X7 power supply for the people of India.

Conservation of water in enroute consumption is not only an effective way to avoid enroute watering complaints in coaching trains but is also a small but significant step in conserving the precious resource of water. Bhusawal Division of Indian Railways has fitted specially designed aerators in available basin-taps of Tejas Express (Train No. 22119/22120) as a step towards conservation of water. The aerators through their fine pores break the stream of incoming water into fine water sub-streams. Hence, while the outflowing water is sufficient for utilisation towards cleanliness, the aerators prevent wastage of water by reducing excess water flow.

 

        

 

 

 

 

The aerators are to be fitted as a one-time measure and have been fitted in existing taps of Tejas Express (22119/22120) without any modification or replacements of available taps. The initiative reduces water consumption of each tap by 1/4th and hence is a significant step towards water conservation.

                A “Guidebook for Creating a Child Friendly and Protective Environment for Children in Contact with Railways’, developed by National Commission for protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) in collaboration with Railway Children India, was launched at an event held at the Habitat World today. The document will serve as a framework to develop child friendly environment at all Railway Stations. 



 

In the same event, Information Education Communication (IEC) Materials on child protection for children in contact with Indian Railways developed by NCPCR in consultation with Indian Railways and those developed by “Save The Children” were also launched to create awareness/alertness among the people and stakeholders. 

Shri Ashwini Lohani, Chairman, Railway Board, emphasised that the issue of care and protection of distressed children needs to be handled with sensitivity. There is an urgent need to create mass awareness about this issue. He mentioned that in this direction, a large scale awareness campaign on sensitisation of the entire railway staff and other stake holders like porters and vendors at stations would be launched from 8thJune 2018 in collaboration with NCPCR. 

 



 

On this occasion, Ms. Stuti Kacker, Chairperson, NCPCR expressed that ‘there is a need to protect children who have run away from abusive situations at home or are lost and have reached railway platforms as they are extremely vulnerable to abuse by strangers’. The Guidebook for Creating a Child Friendly and Protective Environment for Children in Contact with Railways will fill the gap in the whole ambit of child protection at railway stations. 

Shri Dharmendra Kumar, Director General (RPF), acknowledged the training workshops being conducted by RCI. He highlighted that the RPF monitors this activity on daily basis and has rescued nearly 35,000 children in last four years.  Shri Kumar also shared the work and services offered by Child Help Desk at various railway stations. 

Shri Navin Sellaraju, Director, Railway Children India emphasised on the need to leverage all strengths of civil society organisation, NCPCR and Railways for strengthening child protection mechanism at railway stations. 

It is estimated that every five minutes, a child arrives alone at a railway station in India. As a result, he/she is vulnerable and exposed to several risks and abuse. It is important, therefore, to strengthen the existing child protection mechanisms at railway stations.The launching of ‘The Standard Operating Procedure for Railways to ensure care and protection of children in contact with Railways’ (herewith SOP) by Indian Railway, MWCD and NCPCR to address the protection of ‘children who are in contact with railways’ in 2015 served as a pioneering document in successfully protecting children. However, there are many stations where the SOP is still to be launched and the guidebook will fill up this gap.

                As part of its plans to innovate coach designs, now, ICF (Integral Coach Factory, a production unit under Ministry of Railways) has turned out one LACCN (LHB 3 Tier AC) Coach with continuous windows, by providing additional glasses on vertical pillars. This will provide the Air-conditioned coach an aesthetically pleasing and very good appearance from outside. It has been planned to provide such continuous windows in all AC coaches in a phased manner. 

 



 



 

The LHB Coaches made by ICF at present have been provided with split windows of size 1100 mm (L) x 680 mm (H).

However, there will be no change in the interior of the coaches that will be maintained as before.

                An artificial intelligence module has been developed by IRCTC to find anomalies in standard operating procedure using CCTV footage. With this module base Kitchens will be monitored pan India.  The Artificial Intelligence module realises the value of their videos and photos with vision computing. It can detect an unexpected change or an event that does not conform to the expected pattern using their machine learning algorithms.

 

To begin with, 16 base kitchens of IRCTC have been installed with high definition cameras connected to huge monitors for AI vision detection. Live streaming of 16 base kitchens is played all the time. The system detects anomalies of head gear, uniforms, rodents and mopping across kitchens and raises issues to be dealt accordingly with by IRCTC.

 

The AI system will be used to improve upon catering units. The system is capable of tracking any anomaly in the entire operation of catering. Suppose if a chef or any kitchen supervisor is not wearing their uniform, including the mandatory cap, the AI system will track that and automatically raises a report to the concerned contractor immediately. If the matter is not addressed within certain time, it will further be reported to IRCTC authorities in charge.

 



 

 



 

Once an issue has been captured through Artificial intelligence, a ticket will be created automatically by the system. An alert for the same will be sent to all concerned via email as well as through portal for necessary action. Escalation matrix will be followed as per predefined procedure. Base-kitchens performance over a period of time can be viewed through reports given in the online platform provided.

 

The module has been developed in association with New Delhi based company called WOBOT.

On 5th May Indian Railways has a special reason to cheer and celebrate for the women commuters. The first ever Ladies Special train in the world was started between Churchgate and Borivali on 5th May, 1992. 5th May 2018 will go down in the annals of history as the 26th anniversary of introduction of this milestone of Indian Railways dedicating an entire train to women commuters. The First Ladies special train, flagged off on Western Railways, was initially run between Churchgate and Borivali and further extended upto Virar in the year 1993. 

The ladies special has been a boon for the working women who had to earlier struggle to board the ladies compartment in the regular trains. Dedicating an entire train to women meant they could travel more comfortably, which was the primary aim of the services. Running successfully for 26 years on one of the busiest suburban lines it is considered a blessing by all women commuters. 

To instill a sense of safety & security amongst the women passengers, Indian Railways has come up with various other novel initiatives & measures since then.  CCTV cameras has been installed in many of the ladies coaches. Talk-back System is a new security measure introduced by Western Railway last year, on the occasion of International Women’s Day. In this system, a two way communication is established between a commuter in any of the ladies coach and the guard of the train in the event of any emergency by pressing a button on the unit. This benefits lady passengers, especially, during any exigencies such as security or medical issues.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will attend the commencement of work on Zojila Tunnel on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway at an event in Jive-tsal in Leh tomorrow. He will also lay the foundation stone for Srinagar Ring Road and Jammu Ring Road at separate events at Sher-e-Kashmir International Conference Centre (SKICC), Srinagar and at General Zorawar Singh Auditorium in Jammu the same day. Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari will also be present at the events. 

The 14 km long Zojila tunnel will be India’s longest road tunnel and Asia’s longest bidirectional tunnel. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, had approved the  construction, operation and maintenance of this 2-lane bi-directional tunnel with Parallel Escape (Egress) tunnel between Baltal and Minamarg on the Srinagar-Leh section of  NH-1A at a total cost of Rs 6800 crore earlier this year.

The construction of this tunnel will provide all weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh. This route remains snow-bound for a large part of the year, and is ravaged by frequent avalanches. As a result, road connection to places in the Laddakh region stands disrupted for long periods, preventing even essential supplies from reaching people, shutting down businesses, affecting healthcare and education. The tunnel will bring relief to the people of this region by providing all weather connectivity. It will also cut down the time taken to cross the Zojila pass from the present 3.5 hours to just 15 minutes, besides making the drive much safer and convenient.  

The construction of the tunnel is expected to bring about all round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions. In addition to direct jobs generated during construction, it will also lead to massive indirect and spinoff jobs due to acceleration of economic growth. The government is committed to development of manpower skilled for tunnelling jobs in Jammu & Kashmir. The project has strategic and socio-economic importance, and will be an instrument for the development of the economically backward districts in Jammu & Kashmir.

The Zojila tunnel has been planned as a smart tunnel. It will have latest safety features like fully transverse ventilation system, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), Tunnel Emergency Lighting, CCTV Monitoring, Variable Message Signs (VMS), Traffic Logging Equipment, Over Height Vehicle Detection, Tunnel Radio System, etc.  It will have pedestrian cross passages at every 250 meter and motorable cross passages and lay-bys at every 750 meter.  It will have emergency telephones and fire-fighting cabinets at every 125 meter. 

The Ring Roads and Srinagar and Jammu are aimed at reducing traffic congestion at these cities and making road travel safer, faster, more convenient and more environment friendly. 

The 42.1 Km, 4 lane Srinagar Ring Road will link Galandar in West Srinagar to Sumbal. Being built at a cost of Rs 1860 crore, this road will provide a new route from Srinagar to Kargil and Leh, and reduce travel time. There will be a major bridge, three flyovers, 23 tunnels and 2 via-ducts on this route. 

The 58.25 km, 4-lane Jammu Ring Road, being built at a cost of Rs 2023.87 crore, will link Jagati (western Jammu ) to Raya Morh. There will be 8 large bridges, 6 flyovers, 2 tunnels and 4 via ducts on this route.

                Union Minister for Road Transport, Highways, Shipping, Water Resources and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari will inaugurate the upgraded 4-lane NH-15 from Amritsar to Bhatinda and NH-64 from Zirakpur to Bhatinda, and will lay the foundation stone of 2-laning with paved shoulders of the Munak-Jhakhal-Budhlana section of NH-144B in Punjab tomorrow.

The 175 kilometre NH-15 stretch has been completed in 24 months at a cost of Rs 2893 crore. It will benefit the commuters as it will now take only two hours to travel between Amritsar and Bhatinda. The Harike bypass on the NH will also reduce the traffic and resultant pollution in the Harike city. Three ROBs, five flyovers, 12 underpasses and 31 large junctions have been constructed under the project.

Similarly, the 216 kilometre NH-64 stretch has been completed in 24 months at a cost of Rs 2264 crore. The NH will benefit the tourists travelling to Bhatinda, Amritsar and Simla, as the time taken for travelling between Chandigarh and Bhatinda will reduce to three hours only. District Headquarters like, Mohali, Patiala, Sangrur, Bhatinda, Faridkot and Amritsar will get connected by a 4-lane highway. The project includes an ROB, 12 flyovers, 22 underpasses and 42 large junctions.

The 45.89 kilometre 2-laning with paved shoulders of the Munak-Jhakhal-Budhlana section of NH-144B will be completed in 18 months at a cost of Rs 293 crore. It will reduce the travel time between Bhikhi and Tohana by an hour, and will smoothen the travelling between Haryana and Punjab. The project involves construction of a flyover in front of Guru Nanak College and a grade separator near football chowk of Buldhana. It will have five kilometres of service roads, two VUPs and six small bridges.

Three ROBs, five flyovers, 12 underpasses and 31 large junctions have been constructed under the project.

Similarly, the 216 kilometre NH-64 stretch has been completed in 24 months at a cost of Rs 2264 crore. The NH will benefit the tourists travelling to Bhatinda, Amritsar and Simla, as the time taken for travelling between Chandigarh and Bhatinda will reduce to three hours only. District Headquarters like, Mohali, Patiala, Sangrur, Bhatinda, Faridkot and Amritsar will get connected by a 4-lane highway. The project includes an ROB, 12 flyovers, 22 underpasses and 42 large junctions.

The 45.89 kilometre 2-laning with paved shoulders of the Munak-Jhakhal-Budhlana section of NH-144B will be completed in 18 months at a cost of Rs 293 crore. It will reduce the travel time between Bhikhi and Tohana by an hour, and will smoothen the travelling between Haryana and Punjab. The project involves construction of a flyover in front of Guru Nanak College and a grade separator near football chowk of Buldhana. It will have five kilometres of service roads, two VUPs and six small bridges.

                Emphasising that technology is destiny, the President, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has said that technology must also be equity and its fruits must be accessible to all.  Addressing the 20th National Technology Day celebrations at Vigyan Bhawan here today, the President said that finances and resources must be available to all technologists who wish to turn entrepreneurs and to migrate from the lab room to the shop floor.  The President pointed out that gender equity must be integrated with technology production.  

Shri Kovind highlighted that the new technologies have three common attributes – (i) they offer solutions that are necessary in the Indian context and contribute to the social and economic needs of our people, (ii) they achieve all this at competitive price points and (iii) they do not compromise on quality.  

“The Government has proposed to establish Centres of Excellence to train young technologists in robotics, artificial intelligence, digital manufacture, big data analytics, quantum communication and Internet of Things.  The Government is also pursuing demonstration and deployment of successful technology solutions for clean energy options”, President Kovind said.  

         Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan gave a call to renew the pledge to empower the citizens through rapid growth of inclusive technology.   “National Technology Day is an occasion to remind ourselves of the transformative power of science & technology for the nation and society”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said.  The Minister added that such technological innovations, among others, will aid the government’s efforts to provide clean and green electric mobility.  

         Striking a note of caution against complacency, Dr. Harsh Vardhan recalled the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s message to the scientific community at the 105th Indian Science Congress in Imphal and to do research leading to development.  The Minister pointed out that building on the strengths, we must let the innovation become the engine and technology as the driver for national growth.   Recalling the former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s slogan of “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and Jai Vigyan”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that in fact, ‘Vigyan’ (science) provides muscle to the Jawans and farmers of the country alike.

         The President, Shri Ram Nath Kovind presented awards of the Technology Development Board in three categories.  The categories and the awards include –

         In his welcome address, Secretary, Department of Science & Technology, Prof. Ashutosh Sharma said that the awards present stories of compelling innovative technology.  Referring to the 20th year of the celebrations, Prof. Sharma pointed out that the 20th year is important in human life, as it provides opportunities to build upon the preparation of the teen years.  

The theme of this year’s National Technology Day celebrations is “Commercializing indigenous Technologies: Journey from Benchside to Business”.

National Technology Day: A brief background

The celebration of National Technology Day symbolizes India’s quest for scientific inquiry, technological creativity & innovations; and the integration of these developments into national socio-economic benefits and global presence.   The day recognizes technological innovations and their successful commercialization, making fruits of research reach available to the people by awarding scientists, technocrats and companies, encouraging others to emulate them and creating micro & macro-ecosystems conducive for persistent endeavors towards technological excellence.  The Day has a historical perspective, as it was on the May 11, 1998, that India achieved a major technological breakthrough by successfully carrying out nuclear tests at Pokhran. Further, the first indigenous aircraft ""Hansa-3"" was test-flown at Bangalore on this day and India also performed the successful test firing of the Trishul missile on the same day. Since 1999, the day is being celebrated as the “National Technology Day”.

Technology Development Board on behalf of the Ministry of Science & Technology celebrates May 11 of every year as the “National Technology Day” to commemorate achievements of Innovations and Technological Excellence in the country. 

National Awards of Technology Development Board 

Technology Development Board (TDB) recognises the achievements of those who have commercialised their innovations successfully with an outreach to the masses for the benefit of the Society. In order to encourage innovations and to nurture technologies flow to industry for product excellence so that our Nation has the competitive edge leading to our cherished vision of developed India, TDB gives Awards every year on Technology day.

The first National Award was instituted in the year 1999, for successful commercialization of indigenous technology by an industrial concern. Thereafter two more awards have since been introduced. There are two broad categories of Awards: One is for successful commercialisation given to an Industrial Concern and other is for Technology Start-ups for their technologies having potential for commercialisation.

In the first category, two Awards are given:  One award is given for the successful commercialisation of innovative indigenous technology:  Cash award of Rs. 25 lakh and a trophy to an industrial concern which has successfully developed & commercialized an indigenous technology. In case the technology developer and commercializing organizations are different, each one would be eligible for cash prize and a trophy.  The second award is for the Micro Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME’s) that have commercialised a product based on indigenous technological innovation. This award carries a cash prize of Rs. 15 lakh and a trophy each to a Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise that have successfully commercialized a product based on indigenous technology.

In the second category, Awards are given to technology Start-ups for promising new technology with potential for commercialization.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for waiving of Penal Interest on Government Loans to Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) as per following:


	Waiver of Penal Interest amounting to Rs. 250.89 crore in respect of VPT as on 31.03.2017 and further accruals thereon till date of approval of waiver; 
	VPT to pay penalty @0.25%of Penal Interest as on date of approval of waiver of Penal Interest; 
	VPT to pay the outstanding Principal of Rs. 44.69 crore and outstanding Interest as on the date of approval of waiver, in one single instalment in the Financial Year 2018-19.


Background:

Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) had availed Rs. 110.41 crore of loan at different points of time beginning from 1970-71 to 1984-85 to finance its Outer Harbour Project to accommodate deep draft vessels of 100,000 DWT for Iron Ore exports. Each loan had a moratorium period of 5 years from the date of sanction. VPT made payments towards interest for the period of moratorium on various loans till 1978-79. However, it could not be continued with the repayment during the period from 1979-80 to 1989-90 due to revenue losses to the Port. It started repayment of loan amount (both principal and interest) with effect from 1990-91 onwards. As on 31.03.2017, VPT has a total loan liability of Rs. 354.23 crore (Rs. 44.69 crore towards defaulted Principal, Rs. 58.65 crore towards defaulted Interest and Rs. 250.89 crore towards Penal Interest).

Further, the Port has a future fund requirement of around Rs. 2671.79 crore for different upcoming developmental projects and employees’ pension liabilities upto 2018-19. Therefore, the Port is not in a position to repay the total loan liability of Rs. Rs.354.23 crore.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for waiving of Penal Interest on Government Loans to Paradip Port Trust (PPT) as per following:


	Waiver of penal interest amounting to Rs.1076.59 crore in respect of PPT as on 31.03.2017 and further accruals thereon till date of approval of waiver.
	PPT to pay penalty @ 0.25% of Penal Interest as on the date of approval of waiver of penal Interest.
	PPT to start the re-payment of outstanding principal of Rs. 387.74 crore and outstanding interest as on date of approval of the waiver and the re-payment to be completed in two instalments in 2018-19 and 2019-20.


Background:

Paradip Port Trust (PPT) had availed Rs.642.69 crore of loan under different heads at different points of time beginning from 1967 to 2002 to finance its various infrastructure projects. Each loan was to be repaid in 20 yearly installments with a five year moratorium period. PPT was incurring losses upto the year 1987-88 and there was huge deficit in revenue account due to insufficient cargo. As a result of which  PPT could not start its repayment as per schedule. As on 31.03.2017, PPT has a total loan liability of Rs. 1743.69 crore (Rs.387.74 crore towards defaulted principal, Rs.279.36 crore towards interest and Rs. 1076.59 crore towards penal interest). 

Further, the Port has a future fund requirement of around Rs.6,695 crore for different upcoming developmental projects and employees’ pension liabilities upto 2018-19. Therefore, the Port is not in a position to repay the total loan liability of Rs.1,743.69 crore.

                Taking ahead the bilateral relations between India & Republic of Indonesia, Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Shipping,  Road Transport & Highways and Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation met General (Retd.) Luhut Binser Pandjaitan, Coordinating Minister of Maritime Affairs of Indonesia, in New Delhi yesterday.

 

Ahead of the visit of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to Jakarta in May 2018, General (Retd.) Pandjaitan, who is on a 2-day visit to India met Shri Gadkari to discuss bilateral cooperation in the maritime sector between the two countries. The bilateral talks covered a wide range of topics including river rejuvenation, wastewater treatment, generating revenue streams from waste, enhancing shipping linkages between the two countries, developing ports and airports, training on light house technology and development of navigational aids.

 

Developing a cruise tourism circuit between Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Indonesia and thus implementing Govt of India’s vision to put India on the global cruise market both for ocean & river cruises under its Sagarmala programme was highlighted. Cooperation for developing alternative fuels such as natural gas and methanol for ships also featured in the talks.

 

For developing collaboration in Maritime Training & Education between India & Indonesia, both the ministers were keen to draw up an MOU between Indian Maritime University & Indonesian institutes for maritime studies.

 

It was decided by both Ministers to take up these areas of work in a proactive manner by arranging for exchange of information soon and establishing contact between technical teams on both sides. It was also decided that technical teams from Indonesia would visit India at the earliest to look at the experience of the Indian side on Ganga rejuvenation, development of National Waterways and training in the maritime sector.

 

The meeting was attended by a 10-member high level delegation comprising of senior officials of Department of Maritime Affairs, Indonesia, Chairman of Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) and the Ambassador of Indonesia to New Delhi along with senior officials from the Ministry of Shipping.

                            The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) will involve banks for ensuring availability of financing options for the private players engaged in Inland Water Transport (IWT) sector. Financing and funding for Operation and Maintenance of IWT assets is a challenge for shippers, vessel operators and asset management firms as the banking sector is not yet ready with any customized financing option for the sector.

            Addressing the day-long Stakeholders Conference on Emerging Business opportunities in Inland Water Transport Sectorwas organized by IWAI at New Delhi,the IWAI chairperson Smt. NutanGuha Biswas said that the banking finance is needed for the emerging business opportunities that private players are inclined to be involved with.Smt. Biswas said that lots of investment are being done to develop the waterway sector which is going to complement railways and roadways and we have started working on eight new National Waterways, in addition to five others on which work had been on in full swing. 

            Shri Rajat Sachar, Advisor in the Ministry of Shipping, sought recommendations from private players for policy changes to make Inland water transport a vibrant sector. Referring to the Jal Marg Vikas Project being implemented between Varanasi and Haldia on river Ganga, he said, the government has decided to invest Rs 5369 crore on one National Waterway. He also appealed to the financial institutions to offer products for private sector investment in IWT sector where annual government funding has increased by 12 times in the last 4 years.

            The MD&CEO of theBank of Baroda Shri PS Jayakumar said that banks can provide flexible scheme for financing, like providing the moratorium period for loans on existing as well as the new projects.He added that issue of bonds can be the alternative source for long-term loan capital financing ship-owners.  

            The Government is developing National Waterways as a key transport intervention, as part of an integrated transport network strategy, which will help correct the transport modal mix that imposes huge logistics costs on the Indian economy. At present the cost of logistics in India, at 15 per cent of GDP, are about twice those in the United States.

                All traditional skills need to be formally recognized under Skill Development and proper training needs to be imparted in these work-of-art translating into the further economic growth of the State and its people said Skill Development & Entrepreneurship and Petroleum & Natural Gas Minister Shri Dharmendra Pradhan.Addressing the inaugural session, of the ‘Odisha Skill Conclave’ Shri Pradhan expressed, “Odisha has abundant natural resources and a large coastline. The state has emerged as the most preferred destination for overseas investors, owing to its natural wealth which includes production of one fifth of India's coal, a quarter of its iron ore, a third of its bauxite reserves and most of the chromite. It has a rich heritage and culture, and is known for its handicraft, handloom and temples. “Skill development is a national dialogue and there have been isolated efforts to promote skill development in the State thus far; but it is our endeavour now to join the dots and have a concrete, comprehensive and collective effort with respect to skill development,” he further added.

In line with the Prime Minister’s vision of “SabkaSaathSabkaVikas”, the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship organized Odisha Skill Conclaveat Jatni near Bhubaneswar to define a roadmap to develop Odisha as a skill development & entrepreneurship hub of India. The two-day event has gathered more than 100 experts, industry veterans, academicians and professionals from skill ecosystem to deliberate on challenges and opportunities for skill development in the state. 

The galaxy of experts from national/international organizations like NALCO, Indian Oil, Reliance, ACC, Aditya Birla, InternationalLabor Organization among others assembled at the Conclave to discuss the local complexities of the State, weaving the discussion and integrating them into the national skill ecosystem. The sessions on day one, highlighted the key challenges and opportunities that exist in the State, identification of cluster/areas with high demand for skills based on investments, credit off-take and mapping geographical areas of economic activities.  

The event gave all participating dignitaries a comprehensive picture of the socio-economic background of the State with respect to its population demographics, proportion of youth, education averages, labour force participation and labour mobility. There are 631 ITIs today in Odisha with a seating capacity of 1, 67,753 and utilization of 54.96%. Approx. 80,000 have been trained under MSDE’s flagship program Pradhan MantriKaushalVikasYojana (PMKVY) 2016-20, which has translated into placement for nearly 50% candidates. Over 1 million people from Odisha have migrated to other parts of the country in search of jobs. Nearly, half of Odisha’s population, is in age groups below 25 years. Only 6% labour force has diplomas, certificates or a graduate-and-above degrees. Odisha’s incremental skill gap for 2011-2026 is expected to be around 4 million. Odisha’s estimated labour demand for 2018-19 is highest in sectors like chemicals, transport, logistics, retail trading, power and healthcare.  

The discussions also established that the social aspect should be accounted for while planning skill development programs. The tribal community accounts for nearly 30% of Odisha’s population, the women population and their participation in economic growth, and traditional skill sets in the State all need to be considered for preparing the action plan for Odisha. It was also discussed that there is a need for synergy between those who regulate the laws on specific skills and those who train so that there is a concrete outcome to all training endeavours. Job roles for driver training and tourism guides can secure license from the government. 

“India’s private sector has become extremely exploitative, they need to come out of this mind-set which has linkage to the depressed wage across industries and our focus should be on increasing employability and thus reward them appropriately for their contribution. We also need sensitive good quality counselling for the youth and their parents.” said Shri SubrotoBagchi, Chairman, Odisha Skill Development Authority, one of the experts at the conclave.

On this occasion, Shri Pradhan also released a study report on Skill Development & Employability on tribal in Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.  The study has been conducted by Functional Vocational Training and Research Society (FVTRS) Bangalore in association with Centre for Youth Skill Development (CYSD), Bhubaneshwar.

                The Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar has promised that the centre would provide financial assistance worth Rs 6 Lakh for cochlear implant of all children with hearing impairment hailing from the economically weak sections of the Sikkimese society. He made the announcement after a group of hearing impaired and specially-abled school children gave a heart-warming performance in the opening ceremony of the 'Samajik Adhikarita Shivir' organised at Chintan Bhawan, Gangtok today. He took a group photograph with the children and presented them with tokens of appreciation.

 

Shri Gurjar directed the state officials present in the event to draw an inclusive list of children suffering hearing impairment and submit it to his ministry at the earliest.

 

The camp was organised by the Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India in collaboration with the district administration and the Ministry of Social Welfare, Government of Sikkim with the main intent of distributing free-of cost ‘assisted living devices’ (ALD) to pre-identified beneficiaries of East Sikkim under the Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana (RBY).

 

A total of 794 beneficiaries were presented with ALDs ranging from wheelchairs, walking sticks, digital hearing aids, walking sticks ect. More than 200 beneficiaries were physically present in the function to receive the devices from the hands of the honourable MoS. The BDO offices will distribute the remaining devices within a week to their respective beneficiaries who could not make it to the camp. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Gurjar appreciated Sikkim for making tremendous efforts in implementing the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act adopted by the centre in 2016. “Earlier, the centre recognised only seven types of disabilities. Under the new law, people with 21 types of disabilities can avail benefits of government schemes meant for the disabled. Under the able leadership of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyaan has been successfully launched all over the country. Since December 2015, when the campaign was launched, at least 100 buildings in 50 cities have been made disabled-friendly and Sikkim has pitched in considerably to make the effort fruitful.”

 

Shri Gurjar also stressed on the need for providing normal life facilitating assistance to the senior citizens whose age-related problems go unnoticed and uncared for. He urged the government of Sikkim to draw another list of senior citizens of poor background in need of assisted living devises while promising to conduct such free distribution camp in the near future as well. “Not a single beneficiary should be left out. It is our duty to take care of the senior citizens of this country and the government will leave no stone unturned to help them in every capacity,” the MoS said.

 

He proudly announced that the government has ensured local manufacture of advanced artificial limbs in collaboration with German and British manufacturers at the various manufacturing facilities of ALIMCO.

 


	camp held at the Chintan Bhawan, Gangtok, was graced by Smt Tulsi Devi Rai, Minister for Social Justice, Empowerment and Welfare Department, Government of Sikkim. In her address, the minister underscored the schemes undertaken by the government of Sikkim for the specially-abled and senior citizens. She informed that the state has been making concerted efforts to make buildings and public places barrier-free and that the centre’s help in the initiatives will go a long way in making the entire state of Sikkim disabled-friendly. “People with disabilities need our support, not sympathy,. 


 

The camp was attended by Shri AK Shrivastava, Chief Secretary, Government of Sikkim, Smt Dhan Jyoti Mukhia, Special Secretary, Government of Sikkim, Shri Surendra Singh Meena, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Social Welfare and Justice, Government of India, officials and staff members of ALIMCO, and advisors of Government of Sikkim and other dignitaries.

                The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is having the commitment to uphold the rights of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) and to ensure the accessible and inclusive assets are created in the country. Chairing the ‘1st Sensitization Meeting of Stakeholders to make Delhi a Model Accessible City’ here today, Smt. Shakuntala D. Gamlin, Secretary, DEPwD said that the Department has taken up the initiative to coordinate the meeting of all key stakeholders, sensitize them about the legal mandates and would hold supervisory role in this entire journey. 

Secretary, DEPwD said that Delhi being the capital city of the country is proposed to be selected for this drive. The rationale for selecting Delhi is that it is assuming increasing eminence among the great cities of the world. Growing at an unprecedented pace, the city needs to be able to integrate its elegant past as well as the modern developments into an organic whole, which demands a purposeful transformation of the socio-economic, natural and built environment. Due to daily influx of visitors and representatives from different parts of the country, a capital city which is also a prime example of “Barrier free environment” and “Inclusivity”, would enhance visibility of the campaign and would also serve as a replicable model for others to follow.Apart from critical issues such as land, physical infrastructure, transport, ecology and environment, housing, socio-cultural and other institutional facilities, the cornerstone for making Delhi an Accessible city is the planning process itself and related aspects of governance and management. This needs a co-ordinated and integrated approach amongst several stakeholders and participatory planning involved with providing services such as Health, Education, Banking, Recreation, Sports etc.The process will commence with: Identification of important built-spaces, public transport infrastructure, services, recreational areas, tourism sites etc. in Delhi; Categorization of the infrastructure and spaces; and Selection of the key executing bodies.

It is a well-established fact that, disability is caused by the way society is organised, and not the person’s limitations and impairments. The physical, social, structural and attitudinal barriers prevent People with Disabilities (PwDs) from participating equally in the socio-cultural and economic activities. A barrier-free environment facilitates equal participation in all the activities and promotes an independent and dignified way of life. India ratified United Nations Conventions on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) 2007. This convention required that India make a number of changes to its laws, policies, regulations, notifications, programs, and schemes. As a part of the process of bringing the legal instruments of India into compliance with the UNCRPD, the process of enacting a new legislation in place of the Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995 (PWD Act, 1995) began in 2010. Meanwhile, Accessible India Campaign (AIC) was launched on December 3, 2015 and subsequently the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016 was enactedreplacing the PwD Act 1995. The AIC has the vision to build an inclusive society in which equal opportunities are provided for the growth and development of PwDs so that they can lead productive, safe and dignified lives. As a nation-wide flagship campaign for creating universal accessibility for PwDs in Built Environment, Transport system, and Information & Communication Technology (ICT) eco-system, objectives were set up to enhance the proportion of accessible government buildings, accessible public transport and accessible websites.

Further, RPwD Act 2016 mandates that all the Establishments/institutions should ensure barrier free spaces and services for rightful inclusion of PwDs in the society. The Act lays stress on non-discrimination, full and effective participation and inclusion in society, respect for difference and acceptance of disabilities as part of human diversity and humanity, equality of opportunity, accessibility and equality. Section 40- 46 of RPwD Act 2016, lays down clear mandates, timelines and punitive actions to foresee the vision of creation of accessible environment and services for all.

                Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar, Minister of State for Social Justice & Empowerment has said that 1149 Cochlear Implant Surgeries have been conducted successfully during the last 4 years (from 2014-15 to 2017-18). Ali Yavar Jung National Institute for Speech and Hearing Disabilities (AYNISHD), Mumbai is the Nodal Agency for Cochlear Implant Surgeries and the Government has empanelled 172 Hospitals (both Government & Private) throughout the country for Cochlear Implant Surgeries. He was addressing after inaugurating the ‘Cochlear Implant Awareness Programme’ entitled ‘Swar Swagtam’ organized by Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in association with Indian Red Cross Society and Sarvodaya Hospital and Research Centre in Faridabad, Haryana today.

The Minister said that under ADIP Scheme of the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan), there is a provision for Cochlear Implant surgeries of Hearing Impaired children’s up to the age of 5 years at the cost of Rs.6.00 Lakhs per unit.After successful Cochlear Implant Surgeries, the child is able to hear and speak like normal Children. He opined that such awareness programs are of great importance for creating awareness among the public about the Cochlear Implant Programme under ADIP Scheme of the Department.

Smt. Shakuntala Doley Gamlin, Secretary, DEPwD (Divyangjan); Dr Ashok Kumar Sinha, Director NIHH; Dr. Prabodh Seth, Joint Secretary, (Divyangjan); Shri D.R. Sareen Managing Director, ALIMCO; Shri D. R. Sharma, General Secretary, Indian Red Cross Society (Haryana State); Dr Rakesh Gupta, Chairman, Sarvodaya Hospital; and Dr Ravi Bhatia, HoD, Centre for ENT & Cochlear Implant, Sarvodaya Hospital also addressed the gathering.

Cochlear Implant is a modern technology to help young children who have severe to profound deafness in both ears. Because of hearing impairment, they are not able to speak. Cochlear Implant provides such children to hear normally in one ear and with post surgical rehabilitation they are able to speak also. Cochlear Implants are costly and were not affordable by all. Keeping in mind “Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas”, the DEPwD, Ministry of SJ&E is providing benefit of modern technology to poor persons also. It is in this direction, the Ministry has introduced Cochlear Implant programme under revised Scheme of Assistance to Disabled Persons for Purchase/Fitting of Aids and Appliances (ADIP) for the poor and needy young children.

With the implementation of Cochlear Implant program by the Ministry of SJ&E through Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Speech and Hearing Disabilities (Divyangjan), Mumbai, around 1149 surgeries (916 under ADIP Scheme and 233 under CSR) have been conducted across India. The Applicants have to apply based on advertisement/details on the website to AYJNISHD, Mumbai: adipcochlearimplant.in. 

All the children are undergoing post-operative rehabilitation. The Ministry has empanelled 172 hospitals all over India to conduct the cochlear implant surgery. Most important outcome of this program is reduction in the cost of implantation and empowers children with deafness to hear and develop speech. 

Sarvodaya Hospital & Research Centre, Faridabad has been part of this scheme and has operated 30 kids from different parts of North India. Dr Ravi Bhatia, Senior Consultant, Sarvodaya Hospital & Research Centre is doing Cochlear Implant for last 2 years.

Cochlear Implant is a modern technology to help young children who have severe to profound deafness in both ears. Because of hearing impairment they are not able to speak. Cochlear Implant provides such children to hear normally in one ear and with post surgical rehabilitation they are able to speak also. Cochlear Implants are costly and were not affordable by all. Keeping in mind “Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas”, the DEPwD, Ministry of SJ&E is providing benefit of modern technology to poor persons also. It is in this direction, the Ministry has introduced Cochlear Implant programme under revised Scheme of Assistance to Disabled Persons for Purchase/Fitting of Aids and Appliances (ADIP) for the poor and needy young children.

With the implementation of Cochlear Implant program by the Ministry of SJ&E through Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Speech and Hearing Disabilities (Divyangjan), Mumbai, around 1149 surgeries (916 under ADIP Scheme and 233 under CSR) have been conducted across India. The Applicants have to apply based on advertisement/details on website to AYJNISHD, Mumbai: adipcochlearimplant.in. All the children are undergoing post-operative rehabilitation. The Ministry has empanelled 172 hospitals all over India to conduct the cochlear implant surgery. Most important outcome of this program is reduction in the cost of implantation and empowers children with deafness to hear and develop speech. Sarvodaya Hospital & Research Centre, Faridabad has been part of this scheme and has operated 30 kids from different parts of North India. Dr Ravi Bhatia, Senior Consultant, Sarvodaya Hospital & Research Centre is doing Cochlear Implant for last 2 years.

                The Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation has released the report on Employment Outlook of the country covering the period September, 2017 to March, 2018. It is based on the administrative records available with selected government agencies to assess the progress in certain dimensions.

This is the second in this series of employment statistics. The Ministry brought out the first release of employment related statistics in the formal sector in April, 2018 covering the period September 2017 to February, 2018, using information on the number of subscribers who have availed benefits under three major schemes, namely, the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPFO), Employees’ State Insurance Scheme (ESIC) and the National Pension Scheme (NPS). In this release, the Ministry is also including information for the persondays of work generated under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA). 

As mentioned in the earlier series, the levels of employment are from various sources, there are elements of overlap and the estimates are not additive. Detailed information is separately published on the respective organizational websites for the period September, 2017 till March, 2018. The information is based on the number of subscribers and as the schemes provide for earlier payments, the tables reflects a dynamic status.

                In response to the need for ensuring quality in the Official Statistics being produced in all levels of Government so that public trust in official statistics is maintained, the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation has notified “General Guidelines on Quality Assurance for Official Statistics” in Government of India Gazette Extraordinary No. 124 of 6th April, 2018. This can be accessed at http://mospi.nic.in/sites/default/files/main_menu/gazette_notification/notification_6apr18.pdf also. These Guidelines are for use and voluntary compliance by all the offices dealing with statistical matters including administrative statistics.

These Guidelines are useful to producers of official statistics in designing any statistical collection or product. These are also helpful to users in making informed decisions regarding the use of statistical products since the framework enables an assessment whether the statistics produced are fit for use, or are of an acceptable level of quality for their purposes.

All statistical agencies at the Centre and in the States/UTs have been advised to follow the guidelines, and bring these to the notice of all line Departments and Local Governments to improve the quality of their official statistical products. The agencies have also been advised to place in the public domain the manner of compliance with the Guidelines.

                After the launch of the Van Dhan Vikas Kendra atBijapur by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi on 14th April, 2018 and his call to converge Jan Dhan, Van Dhan and Govardhan Schemes, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA), Government of India proposes to expand Van Dhan Vikas Kendras in Tribal Districts across the country.  A meeting chaired by Secretary, M/o Tribal Affairs,  Ms. Leena Nair, Secretary, was held recently to formulate the arrangements to decide the modalities. 

As per the plan,TRIFED  will facilitate establishment of MFP-led multi-purpose Van Dhan Vikas Kendras, a cluster of 10 SHGs comprising of 30 tribal MFP gatherers each, in the tribal areas. This initiative is aimed at mainstreaming the tribal community by promoting primary level value addition to MFP at grassroots level.Through this initiative, the share of tribals in the value chain of Non-Timber Forest Produce is expected to rise from the present 20% to around 60%. About 3000 such Van Dhan Kendras are proposed to be set up in two years in the forested Tribal Districts of the country.To begin with, this initiative is proposed to be taken up on priority in the 39 Districts with more than 50% tribal population and to then gradually be expanded to other Tribal Districts in India. 

The scheme will be implemented through Ministry of Tribal Affairs as Nodal Department at the Central Level and TRIFED as Nodal Agency at the National Level. At State level, the State Nodal Agency for MFPs and the District collectors are envisaged to play a pivot role in scheme implementation at grassroot level. Locally the Kendras are proposed to be managed by a Managing Committee (an SHG) consisting of representatives of Van Dhan SHGs in the cluster.

The initiative aims to promoteMFPs-centriclivelihood development of tribal gatherers and artisans. MFP or what may be  more aptly referred to as Non Timber Forest Produces (NTFPs) are the primary source of income and livelihood for about 5 crore tribal people in the country.  Notably, most of the tribal Districts in India are forested Districts. Tribals have enormous traditional skills in the processes involved in collection and value addition of NTFPs. Based on local skills and resources the ideal model of tribal development has, therefore, to be NTFP centric.  

In the past, the Government of India has brought in certain reforms in the sector through Provisions of Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 and the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 which conferred ownership rights on tribal Gram Sabhas in respect of MFP found in their area. In 2014, the Scheme of MSP for MFP was introduced which provides minimum support price to MFP gatherers for selected MFPs. While the steps are in right direction, however, most of the trade related to the MFPs is unorganized in nature, which has led to low returns to the gatherers and high wastages due to limited value addition. Thus, a more holistic approach with robust institutional mechanisms is required for strengthening the backward and forward linkages of MFP supply chain and particularly for mainstreaming thetribal community. 

The Prime Minister while launching the pilot project at Bijapur District, Chattisgarh on 14.04.2018 stated that the “Van Dhan, Jan Dhan and Govardhan would be the basis for transforming the rural and tribal economy in the future”.  Matching with his vision, concerted actions are being put in place to achieve these desired outcomes. 

Key Highlights of Van Dhan Initiative


	At unit level, aggregation of produce would be done by SHGs having about 30 members each forming Van Dhan Vikas ‘Samuh’. The SHGs would also undertake primary value addition of the MFPs using equipment such as small cutting and sieving tools, decorticator, dryer, packaging tool etc based on MFPs available in the area. 
	A typical Van Dhan Vikas Samuh would have the following facilities: 



	Provision for required building/ infrastructure support to be established in one of the beneficiary’s house/ part of house or Government/ gram panchayat building
	Equipment/ Tool Kit comprising of equipment such as small cutting and sieving tools, decorticator, dryer, packaging tool etc. based on MFPs available in the area
	Fully equipped training facilities for a batch of 30 trainees with provision for raw material for training purpose and supply of trainee kits (comprising of bag, scribbing pad, pen, brochures, training manual, booklet etc)
	Provisioning of working capital for the SHGs through tie up with financial institutions, banks, NSTFDC etc 


· A cluster of ten such SHGs within the same village shall form a Van Dhan Vikas Kendra. Subject to successful operations of the samuhs in a Kendra, common infrastructure facilities (pucca Kendra) may be provided to the Kendra in the next phase in terms of building, warehouse, etc. for use of the samuh members 

· An illustrative list of major MFPs which may be covered under the initiative are tamarind, mahua flower, mahua seed, hill broom, chironjee, honey, sal seed, sal leaves, bamboo split, myrobalan, mango (amchur), aonla (churan/candy), seed lac, tez patta, cardamom, black pepper, turmeric, dry ginger, cinnamon, coffee, tea, sea buckthorn tea, etc. Apart from these, any other MFP with potential for value addition may be included.

                 The water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on May 31, 2018 was 27.659 BCM which is 17% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs. This percentage was at 18 for the week ending on May 24, 2018. The level of water storage in the week ending on May 31, 2018 was 82% of the storage of corresponding period of last year and 89% of storage of average of last ten years. 

 

The total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 161.993 BCM which is about 63% of the total storage capacity of 257.812 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. 37 Reservoirs out of these 91 have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW.

                Director General, National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) Mr. Rajiv Ranjan Mishra today reviewed the progress of projects under Namami Gange programme in Uttar Pradesh. 

DG, NMCG requested Chief Secretary, U. P Government, for active involvement of 26 District Ganga Committees to be constituted for the cause of Ganga Rejuvenation.    

While reviewing all 30 sewerage projects being undertaken in Uttar Pradesh under Namami Gange programme, NMCG urged the UP government to complete 8 of the 10 ongoing projects by December 2018 and start work on the remaining sanctioned projects at the earliest. In addition, the UP administration was also asked to complete the repair/rehabilitation/construction work of 87 ghats by March 2019. 

During the meeting, a detailed discussion on preparations of Mahakumbh 2019 at Allahabad took place. NMCG asked the UP government to expedite the process of cleaning all 35 drains in Allahabad that meets river Ganga upstream through bioremediation so that projects could be implemented well before the Mahakumbh begins. 

NMCG urged the government of Uttar Pradesh to focus on tributaries of Ganga and send proposals for cities of Meerut, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Lucknow, Jaunpur so that work on cleaning of tributaries like Hindon, Ram Ganga, Kali, Gomti etc may begin at the earliest. 

NMCG also raised the important issue of Solid Waste going into Ganga through drains with the government of Uttar Pradesh. UP government was requested to direct the Urban Local Bodies along river Ganga to prepare an action plan to provide adequate arrangements in the drains, stretching at least a kilometre from the river’s confluence, to tap the solid waste entering into the river.      

The project of Composite Ecological Task Force Battalion (Ganga Task Force) which has taken off under the aegis of Namami Gange programme was also discussed during the meeting. A Ganga Task Force will be deputed in three important towns of Allahabad, Varanasi and Kanpur to assists Ganga Rejuvenation efforts. The orientation meetings with the administration are being held. Principal Secretary, Environment and Forest, Ms Renuka Kumar while explaining the massive greening “Ganga Haritama Abhiyan” going on in Uttar Pradesh assured NMCG that necessary training shall be imparted to Ganga Task Force by the Environment Department and UP Pollution Control Board. She also suggested in the meeting to have some common training and orientation for Ganga Task Force and Ganga Praharies, a group of self-motivated volunteers along river Ganga, to maximize public participation. 

The meeting was also attended by Executive Director (Projects), NMCG Mr. Hitesh Kumar S. Makwana, Chief Secretary, Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Rajiv Kumar, Principal Secretary (Urban Development), Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Manoj Kumar Singh and Principal Secretary (Environment & Forest), Uttar Pradesh, Ms. Renuka Kumar.

                After considerable success in sanctioning projects for main stem of river Ganga, the Centre has now shifted focus to the entire Ganga basin. Not only are new projects being taken up on the tributaries of Ganga, the existing approved projects on river Yamuna are also being expedited. 

Just five days after the Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari along with CM Delhi Shri Arvind Kejriwal took a review meeting of projects on Yamuna in Delhi; two projects were awarded today in the Board meeting of the DJB. These projects are laying of pumping mains of 8137 m in Kondli area at an estimated cost of Rs. 59.13 crore and rehabilitation of rising mains in Rithala area at an estimated cost of Rs. 45.40 crore. The work on four other projects under Yamuna Action Plan-III (YAP-III) is already going on. These projects include rehabilitation of trunk sewer lines of 8498 m in Kondli, rehabilitation of trunk sewer of 7715 m in Kondli, rehabilitation of sewer lines of 5090 m in Rithala and rehabilitation and upgradation of existing 182 MLD in Rithala in Delhi. 

In the 12th Executive Committee meeting of NMCG held today, a proposal for interception and diversion of 5 drains (having cumulative flow of 5 MLD) merging into river Saryu in Ayodhya has been approved by the Executive Committee at an estimated cost of Rs. 37.67 crore. It is noteworthy that in Ayodhya a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) of 12 MLD already exists and is operational. This project will ensure that the existing STP will be fully utilized as the intercepted drains, which now merge into river Ganga, will be diverted to the STP for treatment and would not be carrying sewage directly into Saryu river.  

In West Bengal, one project costing Rs. 68.47 crore has also been approved in which 13 interception and diversion structures will be created, besides two sewage treatment plants (5 MLD in Raghunath Ganj and 8 MLD in Jangipur). A laboratory for effluent testing and online monitoring is part of the proposal. Jangipur comes under the historical Murshidabad district which used to be the capital of West Bengal before Kolkata.

                Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari instructed senior Delhi Jal Board (DJB) officials to speed up all the projects of YAP-III Projects while chairing a review meeting yesterday in New Delhi.

 

The meeting was attended by Delhi Chief Minister Shri Arvind Kejriwal, Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Dr. Satyapal Singh along with all the contractors, consultants and senior officials of DJB and NMCG.

 

National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has approved eight packages in YAP-III at estimated cost of Rs. 1656 crores. These include four projects in Kondli (K1, K2, K3 and K4), three projects in Rithala (R1a, R1b and R2) and construction of 564 MLD STP in Okhla, Kondli and Rithala projects are regarding rehabilitation of Trunk Sewer and Rising Main. The contracts of four packages i.e. K1, K2, R1a and R2 have been awarded; tenders are under finalisation for three packages i.e. K3, K4 and R1b while bid is to be received for one i.e. Okhla STP. 

 

Shri Gadkari expressed dissatisfaction on very slow progress of these projects. He said that before issuing contract and work order all the formalities like sight survey, tender process, topo graphical survey, land acquisition etc. shall be complete. He said that centre is ready to give all the support but DJB will have to speed up the process. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and DJB senior officials assured that significant progress has been made in last three months in awarding of projects and they will sincerely make efforts to complete all the projects before schedule. 

 

 

Review of construction of 318 MLD (70 MGD) STP at Coronation Pillar and Interception Sewer Project was also done. Likely time of completion of STP at Coronation Pillar is September 2019 while most of work in interception sewer project will be complete by December 2018. It was decided in the meeting that dredged up material and silt may be used in roads by NHAI and meeting with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh officials should be done for Nallas which are polluting Yamuna.

 

Review meeting concluded with a resolution to speed up and complete all ongoing projects before scheduled time so that Yamuna, the life line of Delhi, may become healthier & cleaner.

                Prime Minister of Netherlands Mr. Mark Rutte inaugurated the Indo-Dutch Ganga Forum to take forward the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Government of India and the Ministry of Infrastructure & Environment of the Netherlands  in June last year. 

Addressing the gathering, Mr. Rutte appreciated the efforts being made under Namami Gange programme and acknowledged the vastness of the task at hand. He said that local governments, the financial sector and the private sector as well as communities will need to join hands with the Indian and the Netherlands governments. He also advocated waste-to-wealth approach to encourage sustainability of projects.

Minister of Water and Infrastructure, Netherlands, Ms. Cora van Nieuwenhuizen also advocated trash-to-cash approach. She expressed the Netherlands government’s keenness to work closely with National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). 

Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri U.P Singh said that there are more than 2,000 aquatic species in river Ganga and around 2 million people bathe in it every day.  He also said that cleaning river Ganga is a continuous process.  

Director General, NMCG Mr. Rajiv Ranjan Mishra gave an overview of the Namami Gange programme and said that the work is being done expeditiously to achieve the herculean task of Ganga cleaning. He added that more innovations are being brought-in to have more efficiency and transparency and also to keep in mind life cycle costs. 

The inauguration of the Indo-Dutch Ganga Forum was followed by a technical session on “Innovative Financing Models for Indo-Dutch PPP Projects” during which a detailed discussion on Hybrid Annuity based PPP mode took place. NMCG shared with the Dutch delegates the efforts made by NMCG to start two projects under Hybrid Annuity mode in Varanasi and Haridwar which was appreciated by Netherlands government. NMCG expressed its willingness to adopt proven international experience and technologies in waste water treatment sector. 

Executive Director (Projects), Mr. Hitesh Kumar S. Makwana briefed the gathering about the status of various projects under Namami Gange programme and the challenges ahead. Mr. Makwana apprised the audience with innovative models like Hybrid Annuity based PPP model and One-City-One Operator concept and explained that the funds for the projects under Hybrid Annuity are given through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed for individual project to build confidence.

The subsequent sessions saw discussions on themes “Dutch Approach to Partnership in Public Utilities in India” and “Innovative Dutch Solutions for Urban Water Challenges” and Techniques like Dutch triple-helix model were contemplated for Barapullah drain project as well.  

The Netherlands government also shared the experiences of their collaboration with Uttar Pradesh government to reduce water consumption and employ cleaner technologies in tanneries in Kanpur.

                Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari released the report on “Status of Conservation of Select Aquatic Species” in river Ganga in New Delhi today. He also inaugurated a day-long workshop organized by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) on the theme “Ganga and its Biodiversity: Developing a Road Map for Habitat and Species Conservation”. A database of Ganga Praharis’, a self-motivated cadre, being created by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) was also launched by the Minister. 

Addressing the gathering, Shri Gadkari emphasized the need to approach the challenges of cleaning river Ganga through an “integrated approach and with synergy between development and ecology. Mentioning successful examples like making paper from bamboo, Shri Gadkari said: “Such activities will not only generate employment in areas near river Ganga but will also encourage local communities, some of whom have joined the clean Ganga mission as Ganga Praharis and Ganga Mitras, to ensure conservation of river’s biodiversity. We are increasing activities like plantation on river bank, boating, construction of Mukti Dhams and Ghats. These will increase employment opportunities and will mobilise public participation of the local residents in the task of cleaning Ganga”.

Shri U.P. Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation said: “Ganga still has about 2,000 aquatic species and with the participation of one and all the difficult task of restoring Ganga’s biodiversity can be achieved.” He also pointed out that both aviralta and nirmalta of river Ganga are important and the government is committed to achieve both. 

Thanking Ganga Praharis and Ganga Mitras for their voluntary support, DG, NMCG Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra said: “I hope that these volunteers which now number about 400 will increase to thousands and lakhs and Clean Ganga Mission will become a mass movement.” He hoped that discussions during today’s workshop between experts will yield some valuable suggestions and recommendations which will be fruitful for policymaking. 

The Ganga Praharis’, a self-motivated volunteer cadre from local communities have been trained and taken on board by National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to make Clean Ganga Mission a mass movement. This cadre has been created to ensure the sustainability of efforts in conservation of the biodiversity in river Ganga. So far, 427 Ganga Praharis across five main stem Ganga basin states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal have been involved in this project. 

The first-of-its-kind report “Status of Conservation of Select Aquatic Species” which was released by the Minister present the status of select species of river Ganga and synthesize the information from available literature as well as from the data generated through the rapid biodiversity assessment of the river. This would make valuable contribution for making a baseline for these species.   

The Minister also released another publication “Ganga Biodiversity-At a Glance” which gives species with details, along with their depiction and maps. 

These reports have been prepared by Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun as part of the “Biodiversity Conservation and Ganga Rejuvenation” project being sponsored by National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) under the aegis of the Namami Gange programme. The project aims to develop a science-based aquatic species restoration plan for Ganga by involving multiple stakeholders.  

The technical session focused on “Developing a Five and 10 year strategies for Ganga aquatic biodiversity conservation”. Six biodiversity hot spots have been identified covering 50% of the stretch of river Ganga with high conservation values. Discussions during the day-long workshop focused on developing appropriate strategies for these areas.  

During the rapid biodiversity assessment made under the project, species, such as Siebold’s smooth scaled water snake (Enhydris sieboldii), were observed after a gap of 70 years in river Ganga. The biodiversity assessment team also reported new nesting ground of Indian Skimmer (Rhynchops albicolis), a globally threatened bird, between Allahabad and Mirzapur, positive signs for the river’s biodiversity.  

An exhibition was also put up during the event on Biodiversity Conservation in river Ganga depicting the journey so far and road map ahead.

                The Director General of the  National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) Shri  Rajiv Ranjan Mishra  inspected the Yamuna River Front Development (RFD) project being implemented by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) today, and  asked officials to expedite the work.

Yamuna RFD project aims to restore, revive and rejuvenate the river’s floodplains and make them accessible to the people of Delhi. River Front “walks”, a major component of the project, will enable people to develop a relationship with river Yamuna. 

A special focus of the project is on reviving the river’s bio-diversity in the National Capital. 

Shri Mishra along with other officials visited the sites that fall in the area being developed as first phase of the project on the western bank of Yamuna spreading from Old Railway Bridge to ITO Barrage. Followed by a detailed inspection of area near Vijay Ghat, the inspection team took stock of the progress of work at locations near DTC depot and the abandoned Rajghat power plant.  A tree plantation activity was also undertaken on the occasion.  

The comprehensive project to restore, rejuvenate and revive Yamuna floodplains was approved by the Principal Committee constituted by the Hon’ble NGT. The project is given the name “Asita” which is another name of river Yamuna.

The project envisages creating a green buffer area approx. 300mts wide along the river edge with species of riverine ecology. Besides, a wide belt of 150mts along the peripheral roads will be developed as greenways for public amenities that will include a continuous trail of pathways and cycle tracks. 

To revive the ecosystem of the floodplains, wetlands will be created to store the flood waters and also to improve the groundwater recharge which will eventually result in flourishing of biodiversity in the floodplains. 

An environmentally conscious approach for integration of the river into the urban fabric of the city has been adopted. A people-friendly bio-diversity zone will be created for people to interact freely with the river’s eco-system. 

Executive Director (Projects), NMCG, Mr. Hitesh Kumar S. Makwana, Additional Commissioner, Landscape, Ms. Poonam Diwan, Chief Engineer, East Zone, DDA, Mr. Sanjeev Arya, Principal Commissioner, Horticulture & Landscape, Mr. Shri Pal and Advisor to Vice-Chairman, DDA Ms. Savita Bhandari were also part of the inspection team.

 “We hope to clean 70 to 80
percent Ganga by March 2019. It is a general perception that nothing significant
is being done under Namami Gange Programme but this is not correct. 251 Gross Polluting
Industries (GPI) have been closed and closure directions have been issued to non
complying GPIs”. This was stated by Union Minister for Water Resources, River
Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri Nitin Gadkari while addressing a press
conference in New Delhi today. The Press conference was also linked to Patna,
Varanasi, Lucknow and Kanpur through video.  The Minister said, real time
monitoring of pollutions is being done in 938 industries. 211 main ‘Nallas’
have been identified which are causing pollution in Ganga and 20 modular STPs
are being deployed to treat Nalla water. Regular review meetings with all the
states government officials, contractors, consultants are being done and
obstacles regarding DPR’s, Tendering Process, finalisation of design, Payment
to contractors are being removed for speedy completion of Projects.  

 

            Addressing the press
conference Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation Sushri Uma Bharti
said that almost all the 4470 villages on the bank of Ganga are now Open
Defecation  Free (ODF) and now we are working on the strategy of ODF plus. She
said measures like Solid-Liquid waste management, tree plantation, making
villages and towns plastic free and awareness programmes are being adopted.
Sushri Bharti said, “Our Ministry is working on Ganga Gran Project which is
based on holistic development of villages situated on the bank of River Ganga
with active participation of villages. Organic Farming, Water Conservation
Project, proper disposal of solid and Liquid waste and renovation of Ponds will
be emphasized in Ganga Grams”. 

 

 

Namami Gange an
integrated Ganga Conservation Mission is an umbrella programme with the aim to
integrate previous, currently ongoing and new projects planned as part of the
programme at an indicative cost of Rs. 20,000 crore. The programme is to be
implemented over a period of five years ending on December 2020. ‘Namami Gange’
approaches Ganga Rejuvenation by consolidating the existing and ongoing efforts
and planning for a comprehensive action plan for future. 

 

Under Namami Gange
programme, a total of 195 projects have been sanctioned for various activities
such as sewage infrastructure, ghats and crematoria development, river front
development, river surface cleaning, institutional development, biodiversity
conservation, afforestation, rural sanitation, and public participation. 

 

102 projects out of
195 were sanctioned for creation of 2369 MLD new sewage treatment plants
(STPs), rehabilitation of 887 MLD of existing STPs and laying/rehabilitation of
4722 km sewer network for abatement of pollution in river Ganga and Yamuna.
Till date 24 projects have been completed which has created 217 MLD STP
capacity, rehabilitated 62 MLD STP capacity and 1879.5 km of sewer network has
been laid. Presently, 45 sewage infrastructure projects are under execution.
These projects envisage creating 841 MLD sewage treatment capacities. Another
33 projects are under various stages of tendering. In a paradigm shift in
sewage sector in the past one year, works on two STP projects (50 MLD in
Varanasi and 82 MLD in Haridwar) have been started under Hybrid Annuity PPP
mode (HAM). Other projects sanctioned under HAM are Naini, Jhusi, Phaphamau,
Unnao, Shuklaganj, Mathura, Kanpur, Mirzapur, Gazipur and Farrukhabad in Uttar
Pradesh; Digha, Kankarbagh and Bhagalpur in Bihar; Howrah, Bally and Tolly’s
Nalla (Kolkata), Kamarhati and Baranagar in West Bengal. These sewage
management projects will take care of the current gap in sewage treatment and
will also sustain the sewage treatment for future. 

Initiatives taken by NMCG

 

Among some of the new
initiatives that have been taken by National Mission for Clean Ganga are “One
City One Operator” as part of which STPs in 7 towns (Kanpur, Allahabad,
Mathura, Patna, Kolkata, Howrah-Bally, Bhagalpur) are being integrated and
tendered with Hybrid Annuity based projects. Four have already been tendered
(Kanpur, Allahabad, Mathura and Kolkata. The focus under Namami Gange programme
has been on 10 major towns contributing almost 64% of total sewage discharge.
Apart from that performance evaluation of existing STPs have been completed in
Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and project engineers for Haridwar and
Varanasi projects have been appointed. Besides, annual inspection of GPIs
through technical institutions in a time bound manner along with close
monitoring of milestones is being done. New projects are being taken up on
tributaries. 

 

For River Front
Development, works at 152 ghats and 54 crematoria are in progress and expected
to be completed by 2018 at an estimated cost of Rs. 683.32 crore. Patna River Front Development project worth Rs 254.52 crore is at
advanced stage of completion (more than 85% work done). Under this, 20 ghats
and 6.6 km of promenade are being developed among other services that include
toilets, bathrooms, changing rooms etc. Pathri ghat in Patna which was
developed under Namami Gange programme won 2A Asia Architecture Award 2016. One project of RFD at Chandi ghat in Haridwar involving a cost of
about Rs. 50 crore is 68% complete.   

 

44 Real Time Water
Quality Monitoring Station (RTWQMS) are operational under Namami Gange
programme to keep water quality check. As abatement of industrial pollution
which has been a prime focus of National Mission for Clean Ganga, survey of all
938 Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) was conducted. Out of 938 GPIs, 251
were closed and closure notices were given to non-complying GPIs. 

 

11 trash skimmers
have been deployed at Haridwar, Garh Mukhteshwar, Kanpur, Varanasi, Allahabad,
Patna, Sahibganj, Nabadwip, Howrah, Delhi and Mathura-Vrindavan. 

 

On rural sanitation
front, all 4465 villages on the bank of river Ganga have been made Open
Defecation Free (ODF) and 10,83,688 Individual Household Toilets have been
constructed. Five State Ganga Committees and 48 District Ganga Committees on
main stem of River Ganga, constituted for effective monitoring of projects and
activities. 

 

Five crore plants are
being planted along Ganga basin as part of the afforestation drive involving an
amount of Rs. 112 crores intended for preventing erosion of soil and
groundwater recharge in the Ganga basin. A comprehensive bio-diversity
conservation programme is being undertaken through Wildlife Institute of India
involving a cost of Rs. 25 crore. Afforestation campaign with public
participation has been taken up. 

 

A Composite
Ecological Task Force with headquarters at Allahabad and three companies of 100
men each is being raised with Territorial Army. They would be taking up
plantation, public awareness, patrolling of river fronts and monitoring of
river pollution.

                National Mission for Clean Ganga has brought on board Survey of India, the oldest scientific department in the country set up in 1767, to facilitate the Ganga rejuvenation task by using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. Through the project which has been approved in the EC meeting at an estimated cost of Rs. 86.84 crore, NMCG aims to strengthen planning and implementation at national/state/local levels. The project includes use of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) technology which ensures accurate data collection, an important aspect for river basin management planning. DEM technology enables identification of entire topography of an area making it easy for policy makers to analyse the available data thereby supporting the decision-making process. Critical hotspots are also easily identified through this technology. The use of GIS technology for Namami Gange programme will also ensure decentralisation. The data collected and subsequent actions taken by the government can easily be shared with the local public through geo portals and mobile apps. The technology will also enable people to send their feedback up to the national level thereby providing an interactive and transparent platform. For effective discharge management, outlet of sewerage and other discharges from all units - industrial, commercial and all types of other institutions will be mapped from the source outlet to the public drainage network. In addition, the high resolution GIS enabled data will help in regulating the proposed protected and regulatory zones along the banks of river. 

National Mission for Clean Ganga has approved a project to strengthen State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) of five main stem Ganga basin states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal so that they can frequently verify the quality of water in river Ganga and in case of any discrepancy appropriate action could be taken. The identified laboratories for this purpose are to be equipped in terms of advanced instruments and equipments with well-trained scientific personnel to carry out the pollution assessment and water quality monitoring activities in respect of existing and emerging pollutants. The strengthening of SPCBs will overcome the constraints of resources. This project has been approved at an estimated cost of Rs. 85.97 for five years. 

In West Bengal, two projects worth Rs. 358.43 crore have been approved to develop sewerage infrastructure in Hooghly-Chinsurah and Maheshtala municipalities of West Bengal. These two projects together will stop nearly 56 MLD sewage water from directly merging into river Ganga. 

Maheshtala is an important town and part of Greater Kolkata. In Maheshtala, the project includes construction of interception and diversion sewer network (27 km), one STP (26 MLD), rehabilitation of existing infrastructure along with operation and maintenance for 15 years at an estimated cost of Rs. 198.43 crore. In Hooghly-Chinsurah, the project includes construction of one STP (29.3 MLD), laying of 20 km of sewer line, construction of 2 pumping stations, rehabilitation of existing infrastructure along with operation and maintenance for 15 years at an estimated cost of Rs. 160 crore. Both these projects have been approved to be taken up under Hybrid Annuity based PPP model. 

These four new projects worth Rs. 531.24 crore were approved in the 11th Executive Committee meeting of National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) chaired by Shri Rajeev Ranjan Mishra, Director General, NMCG held recently.

                Consequent upon approval of the Cabinet, National Water Informatics Centre (NWIC) has recently been created by Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation at New Delhi vide notification dated 28th March 2018. NWIC would be a repository of nation-wide water resources data and would work as a Subordinate Office under the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation. The centre would be headed by a Joint Secretary level officer. 

The management of water resources is a highly complex and tedious task that involves expertise of multidisciplinary domains and depend on historical and real time reliable data and information. For this, the first requirement is to develop, maintain and update regularly a comprehensive “Water Resources Information System” (WRIS) in public domain for awareness and involvement of all concerned for effective integrated water resources management. This is also prerequisite for scientific assessment, monitoring, modelling and Decision Support System (DSS) and Integrated water resource Management. In this back drop NWIC is expected to provide a ‘Single Window’ source of updated data on water resources & allied themes; and provides value added products and services to all stake holders for its management and sustainable development. 

To empower, inform and enrich every citizen with upto date and reliable water data (other than classified data) and information through web based India Water Resources Information System (India-WRIS) on a GIS platform in Public Domain; and to develop value added products and services for all aspects of integrated water resources management serving the nation through research, capacity building, linkages, outreach and better governance in water resources sector.

Besides the centre will also collaborate with leading research institutes nationally as well as internationally to provide technical support to other central and state organizations dealing with water, emergency response for hydrological extremes.

                            The water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on May 03, 2018 was 35.219 BCM which is 22% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs. This percentage was at 23 for the week ending on April 26, 2018. The level of water storage in the week ending on May 03, 2018 was 85% of the storage of corresponding period of last year and 90% of storage of average of last ten years.

 

The total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 161.993 BCM which is about 63% of the total storage capacity of 257.812 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. 37 Reservoirs out of these 91 have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW.

                In a letter addressed to the Chief Ministers of all States/UTs, Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, has urged the States/UTs to issue necessary directions to the concerned departments to take necessary steps for including male child victims of sexual abuse in the Victim Compensation Scheme/Fund. The letter also requests that compensation including interim compensation may be given to the victim on time.  

The Minister also highlighted that POCSO Act is gender neutral and safeguards the interest of not only the girl child but also the male child. The letter also mentions that as per NCPCR data, though 31 State Governments have notified their Victim Compensation Scheme under Rule 7, POCSO Rules, 2012, the disbursements of compensation has not been uniform or satisfactory.

The Minister has also drawn attention that in some of the States the interim compensation to child victims of sexual abuse is not being awarded to meet the immediate medical and other needs of the child for relief or rehabilitation. The letter stresses that male child who is the most neglected victim of child sexual abuse is being ignored for award of compensation and needs to be included.  

 

Background on POSCO Rules,2012 : 

 

POCSO Rules, 2012 (Rule 7) envisages the following:


	The Special Court may, in appropriate cases, on its own or on an application filled by or on behalf of the child, pass an order for interim compensation to meet the immediate needs of the child for relief or rehabilitation at any stage after registration of the First Information Report.  Such interim compensation paid to the child shall be adjusted against the final compensation, if any.  
	The Special Court may, on its own or on an application filled by or on behalf of the victim, recommend the award of compensation where the accused is convicted, or where the case ends in acquittal or discharge, or the accused is not traced or identified, and in the opinion of the Special Court the child has suffered loss or injury as a result of that offence.  
	Where the Special Court, under sub-section (8) of section 33 of the Act read with sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 357A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, makes a direction for the award of compensation to the victim, it shall take into account all relevant factors relating to the loss or injury caused to the victim, including the following: -



	Type of abuse, gravity of the offence and the severity of the mental or physical harm or injury suffered by the child;
	The expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred on his medical treatment for physical and/or mental health;
	Loss of educational opportunity as a consequence of the offence, including absence from school due to mental trauma, bodily injury, medical treatment, investigation and trial of the offence, or any other reason;
	Loss of employment as a result of the offence, including absence from place of employment due to mental trauma, bodily injury, medical treatment, investigation and trial of the offence, or any other reason;
	The relationship of the child to the offender, if any;
	Whether the abuse was a single isolated incidence or whether the abuse took place over a period of time; 
	Whether the child became pregnant as a result of the offence;
	Whether the child contracted a sexually transmitted disease (STD) as a result of the offence; 
	Whether the child contracted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a result of the offence;
	Any disability suffered by the child as a result of the offence;
	Financial condition of the child against whom the offence has been committed so as to determine his need for rehabilitation; 
	Any other factor that the Special Court may consider to be relevant.  



	The compensation awarded by the Special Court is to be paid by the State Government from the Victims Compensation Fund or other scheme or fund established by it for the purposes of compensating and rehabilitating victims under section 357A of the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other laws for the time being in force, or, where such fund or scheme does not exist, by the State Government.  
	The State Government shall pay the compensation ordered by the Special Court within 30 days of receipt of such order.  
	Nothing in these rules shall prevent a child or his parent or guardian or any other person in whom the child has trust and confidence from submitting an application for seeking relief under any other rules or scheme of the Central Government or State Government.

Speaking on the occasion,the Minister congratulated the team and said that INSV Tarini team is an inspiration for the future generation to excel in a sector that has historically not seen the participation of many women. She also added that Nari Shakti Puraskar is one step towards acknowledging the team for their exemplary courage and team spirit.

The President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, had conferred the Nari Shakti Puraskars on International Women’s Day(08th March 2018) in RashtrapatiBhavan.As the INSV Tarini team was sailing then, the award could not be presented to the team.

The crew of the Indian Navy Sailing Vessel 'Tarini' is a part of the Indian Navy’s uniqueproject 'Navika SagarParikrama', an all-women team circumnavigating the globe,promoting ocean sailing activities in the Navy and depicting Government of India'scommitment towards women empowerment. Each crew member has minimum of20,000 nautical miles sailing experience. The Project aims to demonstrate the thrust ofNari Shakti on the world platform.The voyage also showcased the 'Make in India'initiative by sailing on-board the indigenously built INSV Tarini. 

The Six-member all-women team,led by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi circumnavigated and managed the whole operation in this first ever global journey. The voyage which lasted for 254 days,with 199 days at sea covered 21600 nautical miles, had 5 port calls in Fremantle,Australia;Lyttelton,New Zealand;Port Stanley,Falklands;Cape Town,South Africa and finally at Mauritius before returning home to Goa.All six members of the crew were trained for over three years under Captain DilipDonde, who is also the first Indian to successfully carry out solo-circumnavigation of the globe between 2009 and 2010.

The women who showed exemplary courage and team spirit had to face strong winds of more than 60 knots and very high waves of upto 7 metres. The crew used an indigenously built INSV Tarini, a 55-foot sailing vessel. The vessel also encountered rough seas, high stormy conditions and severely cold temperatures making the expedition an extremely challenging one. Apart from successfully circumnavigating the globe on a 55-foot yacht, the crew also collated and updated meteorological, ocean and wave data on a regular basis for accurate weather forecast by Indian Meteorological Department and reported marine pollution on the high seas. They interacted extensively with the local populace, especially children, during the port halts to promote ocean sailing and spirit of adventure.

                The Integrated Nodal Agency (INA), in its meeting held today under the chairpersonship of WCD Secretary, decided to issue one more Look-out-Circular(LoC). 

 

The INA also recommended that the passport of the concerned person may be impounded/revoked as per provisions of the Passport Act.

 

Last month, the Ministry had issued 5 LoCs after examining the complaints received regarding NRI matrimonial disputes.

 

In criminal matter involving NRI’s, LoC could be issued by the INA in cognizable offences, when the overseas husband is deliberately evading arrest or not appearing in the trial court despite Non Bailable Warrants and other coercive measures or there is a likelihood that he will leave the country to evade trial or arrest.The LoC will be issued after having the case scrutinised by NCW.

                The Government of India signed a loan deal worth $ 200 million with the World Bank today for the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyaan). The loan would help the Government of India in achieving its goal of reducing stunting in children 0-6 years of age from 38.4% to 25% by the year 2022. 

 

The POSHAN (PM’s Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nourishment) Abhiyaan was launched by the Prime Minister on 8th March 2018 at Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. 

 

A large component of POSHAN Abhiyaan involves gradual scaling-up of the interventions supported by the ongoing World Bank assisted Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Systems Strengthening and Nutrition Improvement Project (ISSNIP) to all districts in the country over a 3-year period. The loan approved today will support the first phase scale up to 315 districts across all states and union territories (UTs).  

 

With a focus on improving the coverage and quality of ICDS nutrition services to pregnant and lactating women and children under 3 years of age, the project will include investments in improving the skills and capacities of ICDS staff and community nutrition workers, instituting mechanisms of community mobilization and behavior change communication, strengthening systems of citizen engagement and grievance redress and establishing mobile technology based tools for improved monitoring and management of services for better outreach to beneficiaries during the critical 1,000 day window for nutrition impact. The project will additionally ensure convergence of all nutrition related schemes and provide performance based incentives to states and community nutrition and health workers, facilitating a focus on results.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development organized National Conference with the Nodal Officers of 244 Districts, State Nodal Officers and Senior Officers in New Delhi today. Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, the Union Minister for Women and Child Development inaugurated the event and interacted with 244 new districts with low Child Sex Ratio(CSR), from 25 States/ UTs.

Addressing the Conference, the WCD Minister highlighted the need to involve various stakeholders and join hands for achieving the goals of BBBP. The Minister suggested several initiatives such as celebrating the birth of Girl Child, engaging Sarpanches and make them aware about various aspects of the scheme and issues of girl child. The Minister said that positive environment must be created for Girls. The Minister highlighted need for training of women sarpanches in every district for achieving goals of BBBP.

Under the BBBP scheme, several local level innovative initiatives focusing on advocacy and community engagements have been undertaken by the Districts across the country.  The Minister interacted with DCs/DMs/Nodal officers who shared various initiatives taken by them in their districts. The Minister appreciated the initiatives such as involving Chemist Associations so that no drugs for abortion are sold without prescription and that chemists report in case such issue comes to their notice. The Minister suggested that counselling facilities may be set up at abortion centres where necessary information and counseling can be provided to women.

         The Minister said that WCD Ministry would start an e-magazine to capture the innovations and best practices so as to find out what works and what doesn't work. She said that failures are just as important as successes. The e-magazines would be distributed in districts so that all districts can learn from experiences of each other.

        The Minister stressed on the need for Self- defense training for girls, and also consent issues. She shared that Kenya has dealt with women security issues through “Just say no campaign”. She shared examples of districts such as Samba, J&K (special BBBP fund and self-defense training), Ahmednagar, Maharashtra (Kanya Ratna Utsav Programme) and other districts. 

          The Minister stated that as a result of initiatives by states/UTs/districts, latest reports of HMIS data of MoHFW for 161 BBBP districts indicate that for time period between April-March 2015-16 and 2016-17, an improving trend in sex ratio at birth (SRB) is visible in 104 districts, 119 districts have reported progress in first trimester registrations against reported Ante Natal Care registrations and 146 districts have reported improvement in institutional deliveries.

  The Minister further stressed that districts should take steps in the direction of creating assets for girl child with the involvement of parents wherein some financial incentive can be linked so as to give sense of ownership to the family and therefore they can have long term association with that asset which can help the girl child in the long run. She further suggested that promoting adoptions can also be helpful in reducing the female foeticide and infanticide.

The Minister highlighted that following are the main focus points for BBBP scheme:


	
	
		Compulsory institutional deliveries 
		Strict implementation of PC&PNDT Act
		Every village should have listing of children both girls and boys 
		Various organisations should be involved by giving them separate targets 
		Changing mindset through various incentives and unique initiatives
		Training Women Sarpanches as they can be change agents in their villages. 
	
	


 

Secretary, WCD, Shri Rakesh Srivastava, emphasized on bringing the Issue in public domain through Visibility of BBBP logo. He further said that Some districts have catalyzed the potential of local champions under BBBP who are chosen from diverse fields of sports, academics, writers, lawyers, students etc. The local champions are selected by District Administration as role models excelling in different fields. The local champions are mobilizing youth from gram panchayats and villages to work as community volunteers under BBBP. The District Collectors/Deputy Commissioners, lead the implementation of the BBBP Scheme in the newly selected 244 districts. 

Representatives from Ministry of Health and Family welfare shared the enforcement of PC&PNDT Act. Ministry of Human Resource Development shared various schemes which promote Education of Girl Child. The Director, WCD, Haryana shared their journey of successful implementation of the scheme on-ground and the various innovative interventions.

Background

    The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 22nd January 2015 and has been well received by different stakeholders across the country. The scheme is designed to address the issue of declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and related issues of disempowerment of women through a life cycle continuum. The key elements of the scheme include awareness and advocacy campaign, multi-sectoral action in select districts (low on CSR) and effective enforcement of Pre-Conception & Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PC&PNDT) Act. It is a tri-ministerial initiative of Ministry of Women and Child Development (WCD) with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of Human Resource Development. Ministry of Women and Child Development takes the lead at Central level and at State level Department of Women and Child Development under the leadership of Chief Secretary leads the programme. Stewardship of Collectors/District Magistrates/Deputy Commissioners has enabled meaningful innovations at the field level.

            On completion of its three years, the Prime Minister, Sh Narendra Modi announced the All India expansion of BBBP scheme in 640 districts across country (as per Census 2011) on 8th March, 2018 at Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. The new 244 Districts from across the country will be covered under Multi-Sectoral Intervention. This is over and above the ongoing 161 Districts and remaining 235 Districts will be covered through Media campaign and advocacy outreach.

                The Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister; Dr. Bibek Debroi has said that the provisional Estimates of Annual National Income, 2017-18 & Fourth Quarter (Q4) Estimates of National Income, (Jan-Mar 2018) are a reflection of the fact that the momentum in growth trajectory continues. 

 

The Fourth quarter (Q4) Jan 2018 – Mar 2018 estimate of Gross Domestic Product released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation estimates the GDP to grow at 7.7 percent. Q4 registered the strongest quarterly growth last financial year indicating a broader continuity in growth acceleration trends. As per CSO, “Real GDP or GDP at constant prices has reached Rs 34.77 lakh crore in Q4 as against Rs 32.27 Lakh crore in Q4 2016-17. 

The CSO has also released the provisional estimates of national income for the full financial year 2017-18. The GDP at the constant prices is estimated to grow at 6.7 percent for the financial year 2017-18. The Real GVA, i.e. GVA at basic constant prices (2011-12) has been estimated at 119.76 for the year 2017-18 showing a growth rate of 6.5 percent over revised estimate of GVA for the year 2016-17 of Rs 112.48 Lakh Crore.

 

Chairman of EAC to PM, Dr. Bibek Debroy said that the key sectors of the economy are experiencing steady growth. The improved growth numbers are due to the government’s consistent effort in implementing bold structural reforms. Goods and Services Tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, Bank recapitalization, 100% village electrification, repealing archaic laws, simplifying doing business etc. have all contributed positively towards growth.   

 

He further stated that sound macroeconomic management by the government is boosting growth and investment in India. This combined with IMDs prediction of normal monsoon is likely to further boost consumer demand particularly rural demand in the economy. The other key economic indicators like IIP, PMI, etc. are also showing steady growth. The IIP (Q-o-Q % change) grew at 5.23 percent in quarter ending in March 2018 as compared to 4.32 percent in quarter ending in December 2017.

 

Dr Debroy also said that the government has done well in keeping inflation and fiscal deficit under check. The retail price inflation has remained close to 3.6 percent during 2017-18. The RBI, in its Monetary Policy Report of April, projects the CPI to rise form 4.4 percent to 5.1 percent in the first quarter of 2018-19, on the back of crude oil prices shooting up. The inflation concern is genuine; however, a normal monsoon combined with a prudent fiscal policy being followed by the government would help keep the overall inflation under control.

                NITI Aayog and Sushant Singh Rajput have decided to collaborate towards promoting two major initiatives of NITI Aayog, promotion of BHIM and the Women Entrepreneurship Platform. 

As part of its larger mandate to promote digital payments across the country, the NITI Aayog has been successfully driving the digital payments campaign in India, wherein it collaborates with youth leaders and public figures to promote the cashless payment systems across the country. 

NITI Aayog continues to bring disruption within the industrial space with the establishment of the Women Entrepreneurship Platform (WEP), which was launched earlier this year with a mission to establish a vibrant, enabling ecosystem for women entrepreneurs across India. 

It is to promote these efforts that Shri Rajput would be entering into an agreement with NITI Aayog. 

The agreement would be signed by Shri Rajput with Ms Anna Roy, Adviser, NITI Aayog in the presence of Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog.

Through this collaboration, which will include cross-sectoral understanding of digitalization at ABB’s world class centers, will be key in driving progress of key sectors in India. This collaboration is meant to lead to actionable insights and focused plans that will help India become a centre for advanced manufacturing,” said Shri Amitabh Kant.

Through this SoI, NITI Aayog will facilitate participation of policymakers and government functionaries in workshops and training programs organized by ABB India. Such programs will feature subject matter experts and will aim to sensitize policymakers and officials about relevant AI capabilities, and explore ways they can be used for revolutionizing manufacturing productivity. 

The first workshop for senior government officials, under this collaboration, would be organised in June, 2018 at ABB Ability Innovation Centre in Bengaluru. Given the importance of the food processing sector, the workshop will focus on digital and automation technologies in this sector. 

Senior officials from the Central, State Governments and autonomous bodies will be nominated for this workshop. Similar workshops will be organised for other sectors such as power, urban development and transport in the future.

 

NITI Aayog and all stakeholders will be exposed to hands-on experience of ABB Ability, the company’s comprehensive digital portfolio of solutions that deliver value of industrial digitalization to utilities, industries and transportation and infrastructure. 

Based on the interactions with ABB India, NITI Aayog will also make recommendations to government ministries for guidelines and policies regarding development and adoption of AI technology in sectors such as power & water utilities, manufacturing, eMobility and infrastructure, with industrial automation and digitalization as the backbone.

NITI Aayog, in collaboration with ABB, will come out with a report on policy recommendations based on the feedback received in the workshops, by December this year.

The workshops and training programs will be held at ABB Ability Innovation Center (ABB AIC). As the company’s biggest research and development center in the world, located in Bengaluru, it develops technologies in areas such as AI, cyber security, automation engineering, data analytics, augmented and virtual reality and industrial software. 

 “We are excited to partner with NITI Aayog and develop ways to for key areas of India’s economy to benefit from and implement the latest technologies in digitalization, artificial intelligence, robotics, and industrial automation. We look forward to working with key stakeholders in the Indian government, and supporting key initiatives of Prime Minister Modi such as ‘Make in India’,” said Dr Ulrich Spiesshofer.

                On the eve of the National Technology Day, ATL Marathon’s Top 30 Innovations to be supported through industry partnerships

In an effort to identify India’s best student innovators, Atal Tinkering Labs of the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) of NITI Aayog, organized an Atal Tinkering Marathon, a six month long nationwide challenge across six different thematic areas, namely, clean energy, water resources, waste management, healthcare, smart mobility and agri-tech.

 

On the eve of the National Technology Day, ATL Marathon’s Top 30 Innovations were showcased through a booklet compiling the work done by the children, the mentors, teachers and schools. The booklet was released by the Dr Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman of NITI Aayog, with Shri Ramanan Ramanathan, Mission Director, Atal Innovation Mission.

 

""This booklet is dedicated to Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who took oath for the first time as Prime Minister of India on May 16. He believed that the future of this country lies in the hands of its children and the Atal Innovation Mission, named after his legacy, translates his dreams into reality"", said Dr Kumar. ""A very new era is coming where we will become an innovative society rather than an imitative society.""

 

The Top 30 teams are being awarded with several prizes including a three month-long ATL Student Innovator Program (ATL SIP) in partnership with industry and start-up incubator. The goal of the Student innovator program is to test the innovations in the community. Students will be trained on business and entrepreneurship skills, including intellectual property, effective communication, making an elevator pitch and so on. Additionally, ATL schools will be offered a participation voucher to World Robotics Olympiad (WRO), which is a global innovation challenge. 

 

From over 650 innovations received, Top 100 were shortlisted based on novelty and prototype functionality. There 100 teams were then given a month to further refine their prototypes and rework their presentations. Following this, their innovations were judged by an esteemed panel of judges including industry and academia experts to select the Top 30 innovations. These top 30 innovations have been identified from 20 different States and Union territories from across India, full details of which are available on the AIM website. 

 

Atal Tinkering Labs under the Atal Innovation Mission of NITI Aayog, is based on the philosophy that incentives and prize awards are a great beginning to create an exponential wave of innovation and entrepreneurship amongst school children. The ATL Student Innovator Program is an effort to institutionalize a mechanism, where high school students can work with university incubators to pursue their innovative and entrepreneurial ideas along with their education. Our goal is to drive extensive forward and backward linkages within the stakeholders in India, to create a paradigm shift in the student mindset and prepare them to become young innovators and entrepreneurs.

                The Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister; Dr. Bibek Debroi has said that the provisional Estimates of Annual National Income, 2017-18 & Fourth Quarter (Q4) Estimates of National Income, (Jan-Mar 2018) are a reflection of the fact that the momentum in growth trajectory continues. 

 

The Fourth quarter (Q4) Jan 2018 – Mar 2018 estimate of Gross Domestic Product released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation estimates the GDP to grow at 7.7 percent. Q4 registered the strongest quarterly growth last financial year indicating a broader continuity in growth acceleration trends. As per CSO, “Real GDP or GDP at constant prices has reached Rs 34.77 lakh crore in Q4 as against Rs 32.27 Lakh crore in Q4 2016-17. 

The CSO has also released the provisional estimates of national income for the full financial year 2017-18. The GDP at the constant prices is estimated to grow at 6.7 percent for the financial year 2017-18. The Real GVA, i.e. GVA at basic constant prices (2011-12) has been estimated at 119.76 for the year 2017-18 showing a growth rate of 6.5 percent over revised estimate of GVA for the year 2016-17 of Rs 112.48 Lakh Crore.

 

Chairman of EAC to PM, Dr. Bibek Debroy said that the key sectors of the economy are experiencing steady growth. The improved growth numbers are due to the government’s consistent effort in implementing bold structural reforms. Goods and Services Tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, Bank recapitalization, 100% village electrification, repealing archaic laws, simplifying doing business etc. have all contributed positively towards growth.   

 

He further stated that sound macroeconomic management by the government is boosting growth and investment in India. This combined with IMDs prediction of normal monsoon is likely to further boost consumer demand particularly rural demand in the economy. The other key economic indicators like IIP, PMI, etc. are also showing steady growth. The IIP (Q-o-Q % change) grew at 5.23 percent in quarter ending in March 2018 as compared to 4.32 percent in quarter ending in December 2017.

 

Dr Debroy also said that the government has done well in keeping inflation and fiscal deficit under check. The retail price inflation has remained close to 3.6 percent during 2017-18. The RBI, in its Monetary Policy Report of April, projects the CPI to rise form 4.4 percent to 5.1 percent in the first quarter of 2018-19, on the back of crude oil prices shooting up. The inflation concern is genuine; however, a normal monsoon combined with a prudent fiscal policy being followed by the government would help keep the overall inflation under control.

                Competition Commission of India celebrated its 9th Annual Day on 20th May 2018 with a lecture delivered by Shri Rajiv Mehrishi, the Comptroller & Auditor General of India, on Competition Law in India: Reflection and Rethinking. This lecture was attended by an audience representing, among others, business and industry, bureaucracy, regulatory authorities, chambers of commerce, legal fraternity and academics. 

In his lecture, Shri Mehrishi emphasised the need of a market regulator to address the issue of market failure. He highlighted issues such as structure of regulatory bodies, interface of competition law with sectoral regulators, market power of the State, and the challenges thrown by the new economy in competition regulation. Shri Mehrishi expressed his concerns relating to market regulation in the new economy in terms of first mover advantage emanating from economies of scale, common shareholding, vertical integration, financing cartels etc. 

With regard to interface with sectoral regulators, he flagged the issue of jurisdictional overlap with CCI, arising due to several sectoral regulators having competition provisions in their legislations. To resolve this overlap, he suggested statutory amendments and setting up of some engagement protocols between CCI and sectoral regulators. He also emphasized that given its specialized skills and experience across sectors, CCI is best placed to regulate markets on matters of competition. 

Shri Devender Kumar Sikri, Chairperson, Competition Commission of India, in his welcome address highlighted Commission's journey so far and stated that during the last nine years, Commission has reviewed 951 antitrust cases, 569 merger filings and has held more than 600 advocacy events. He emphasised that CCI has strived to nurture a culture of competition in markets through credible antitrust enforcement and regular engagement with stakeholders. He also cited the role of leniency provision of the Competition Act as an effective tool in detecting cartels. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Injeti Srinivas, Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, appreciated the crucial role played by the Competition Commission of India at each stage of corporate life cycle i.e. entry of firms, operation in markets and exit of firms. He stressed the need to expand regional outreach of CCI, simplify procedures of competition regulation, and strengthen internal capacity of the Commission.

The event ended with a vote of thanks by Secretary, CCI

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) passed final order imposing penalty on six firms - Fortified Security Solutions (Fortified), Ecoman Enviro Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (Ecoman), Lahs Green India Pvt. Ltd. (Lahs Green), Sanjay Agencies, Mahalaxmi Steels ( Mahalakshmi) and Raghunath Industry Pvt. Ltd. (Raghunath) for bid rigging/ collusion in five tenders floated by Pune Municipal Corporation during the period December 2014 to March 2015 for “Design, Supply, Installation, Commissioning, Operation and Maintenance of Municipal Organic and Inorganic Solid Waste Processing Plant(s)”. Under the provisions of Section 46 of the Competition Act, 2002 (‘the Act’) read with the Competition Commission of India (Lesser Penalty) Regulations, 2009 (‘Lesser Penalty Regulations’) CCI reduced penalty on four bidders i.e. Mahalakshmi, Lahs Green, Sanjay Agencies and Ecoman.

 

The case against these firms was initiated on the basis of an information filed under Section 19(1)(a) of the Act by Nagrik Chetna Manch. During investigation, all six firms approached CCI as lesser penalty applicants.  

 

From the evidence gathered during the investigation, CCI found that there was bid rigging/ collusive bidding in the Tender nos. 34, 35, 44, 62 and 63 of 2014 for ‘Design, Supply, Installation, Commissioning, Operation and Maintenance of Municipal Organic and Inorganic Solid Waste Processing Plant(s)’ in contravention of Section 3(3)(d) read with Section 3(1) of the Act. Further, CCI also found meeting of mind and co-ordination between various individuals which included the proprietor/ partner/ director of the firms to rig the tenders by way of submitting proxy/ cover bids.

 

Considering contravention of provisions of the Act, an amount of INR 13.07 Lakhs, INR 45.20 Lakhs, INR 42 Lakhs, INR 1.51 Crores, INR 3.36 Crores and INR 30.55 Lakhs was computed as leviable penalty on six firms namely Fortified, Ecoman, Lahs Green, Sanjay Agencies, Mahalakshmi and Raghunath, respectively, in terms of Section 27 (b) of the Act. CCI imposed penalty on firms at the rate of 10 percent of their profit for the years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 i.e. three years preceding the year in which collusion took place. Additionally, considering totality of facts and circumstances of the case, penalty leviable on individual officials of four firms namely Ecoman, Lahs Green, Sanjay Agencies and Raghunath was computed at the rate of 10 percent of their average income for the same three years. No penalty was imposed on individuals of Fortified and Mahalakshmi as these are proprietorship firms.

 

Keeping in view the modus operandi of the cartel, the stage at which the lesser penalty application was filed, the evidences gathered by the DG independent of Lesser Penalty Application and co-operation extended in conjunction with the value addition provided in establishing the existence of cartel, CCI granted Mahalaksmi and Lahs Green and their individuals 50 percent reduction in penalty than otherwise leviable on them. Sanjay Agencies and Ecoman, along with their individuals, were granted 40 and 25 percent reduction in penalty respectively. Pursuant to reduction, penalty imposed on Mahalkshmi was INR 1.68 crore, on Lahs Green was INR 21 Lakh, on Sanjay Agencies was INR 90.64 Lakh and on Ecoman was INR 33.90 Lakhs.
