                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the Vigilance Awareness Week 2018 function organised by the Central Vigilance Commission in New Delhi today (October 31, 2018). The theme of this year’s Vigilance Awareness Week is ‘Eradicate Corruption – Build a New India’. 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said eradicating corruption is the foremost condition for creating a new India. He emphasised that the confidence of our people that decisions and actions are being undertaken with transparency, accountability and fairness must continuously be enhanced. Technology and the Internet can be of great use in this regard. He noted that the GEM online platform has been introduced to improve transparency and prevent corruption in the public procurement process. From extending banking facilities to previously unbanked sections of our people to implementing the GST regime, various endeavours have been made to boost the formal economy. And adoption of digital systems has also helped contain corruption. In this manner, loopholes for misuse of public money are being addressed.

The President said that there is a serious effort to curb and punish economic offences, and to give habitual offenders a sense of fear of the law. Legislative measures have been taken – for instance the Amendment to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the enforcement of the Benami Property Act as well as the promulgation of the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) & Imposition of Tax Act 2015. The Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill has also been introduced in Parliament. Such initiatives give confidence to honest citizens and tax payers.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the International Arya Mahasammelan – 2018 today (October 25, 2018) in Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that in the 19th century when we were considering our culture and beliefs inferior than the western culture, Swami DayanandSaraswati showed us the path of renaissance and self-pride. He was an intrepid warrior of social and spiritual reform. He took effective measures for educational and social reform especially for women empowerment and eradication of untouchability. His work is relevant even in the present times both for Indian society and the entire world.

The President was happy to note that this Mahasammelan with discuss on the issues such as prevention of superstition, modernization, women empowerment, tribal welfare, and management of natural calamities. He expressed hope that the Arya Samaj will also work to promote the use of solar and other alternative sources of energy to contribute towards environmental protection.

The President noted that around 10,000 units of Arya Samaj are engaged in welfare activities across the world. He said that the Arya Samaj has made effective contributions to promote modern education based on ethics and worked for the upliftment of all sections of society, especially women and the deprived. It has established many schools and colleges in the country.

The President said that we will be celebrating 200th birth anniversary of Swami DayanandSaraswati in 2024. We will also celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Arya Samaj in 2025. Swami DayanandSaraswati had worked for eradication of discrimination in society on the basis of caste, creed and sect and motivated everyone to become Arya – that is - the best. It is our duty to take the work of Swami DayanandSaraswati further.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 15th convocation of the Symbiosis International University in Pune today (October 23, 2018).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said it is a matter of pride for us that India has been a centre of learning for centuries. From Taxila to Nalanda, the subcontinent’s age-old universities attracted students from different parts of Asia and beyond. In modern times as well our campuses have been open to and welcoming of talented young people from many countries, especially those in our neighbourhood and in Africa – a continent with which we have a special relationship, shaped in classrooms. 

The President said that it is worth noting that 46,144 international students from 166 countries study in various colleges, universities and institutions of higher learning in India. Symbiosis plays a significant role in this process. He was happy to note that over 1,000 international students study in Symbiosis. Of those who graduating today, 329 students are from 33 countries other than India. He said that this adds to the multicultural and cosmopolitan atmosphere of Symbiosis’s campus, and promotes goodwill among nations. 

The President said that India has a massive network of 903 universities and 39,050 colleges. But the fact is there are still gaps in quality and in attaining world-class excellence across the spectrum. In this context, the government has taken a decision to promote and support 20 institutions of higher education as “institutes of eminence” – to grant them recruitment and curricula flexibility in order to reach best-in-class global standards. He urged administrators, professors and students and alumni of Symbiosis to aim to build and locate at least one such “institute of eminence” at their University.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the Vishwashanti Ahimsa Sammelan at Mangi Tungi, Nasik, Maharashtra today (October 22, 2018). The event is being organised by the Bhagwan Shri Rishabhdev 108 Feet Vishalkai Digambar Jain Murti Nirman Committee.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that in the Jain tradition, the principle of ‘Ahimsa Paramodharma’ is distinguished for human welfare and compassion - not just for the absence of physical violence. The President said that Bhagwan Mahavir gave special importance to ‘Apirigraha’ - not taking what is more than essential to live. Humankind is exploiting nature indiscriminately. Ruthless consumption and accumulation of resources is increasing. Due to this, phenomena like climate change are emerging as challenges. Following the Jain tradition shows us a way out.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind greeted people on the occasion of Durga Puja, Dussehra and Vijayadashmi.

In his message, the President said “On the auspicious occasion of Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi, I convey Shubho Bijoya as well as Dussehra greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens in India and abroad. 

Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi symbolise the victory of truth and righteousness over evil. This is a day to share our happiness with the less-fortunate, the lonely and those in pain. It is also an opportunity to cherish the spirit of unity and bonds of fraternity among our people. 

Let us celebrate Goddess Durga as the epitome of Shakti. May she guide us to work to empower women in society, especially girl-children. And let us celebrate Lord Rama as a reflection of the moral and eternal values that have guided our way of life since time immemorial.""

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the issue of sustainability and energy efficiency is critical in view of climate change and related environmental concerns. CPWD officers must ensure that buildings, roads and other infrastructure they create are energy efficient and environment-friendly. He was happy to note that CPWD is promoting modern construction technologies that result in significant reduction in air and noise pollution and optimum use of water. He urged CPWD to strive to keep pace with emerging green and clean technologies. 

The President said that India is maturing as a country, and building larger institutions including larger infrastructure. While focusing on functionality we should also be mindful of aesthetics. For example, our Smart Cities should be efficient and people-friendly but also aesthetically pleasing. This is where architects and engineers can collaborate and play an important role.

	I welcome all of you to Rashtrapati Bhavan. I congratulate you on your success in an extremely tough and competitive examination and your entry into the Indian Police Service. 


 


	I am sure that all of you realise that being an IPS officer places an enormous responsibility on your shoulders. It is a service that is one of the pillars of our national administrative system. It is also a service that defines the trust of common citizens in our police forces. Citizens see you as officers who will uphold the rule of law and enable delivery of justice. This is a big responsibility and I am sure you will prove worthy of it.


 


	As members of an All-India Service, you will no doubt serve in individual states – but you will represent a national idea. Your mandate is to uphold a common concept of the rule of law and of our democratic polity. In that sense, you are guardians of not just public order and honest conduct – but of the majesty of the law. Governments come and go, but you represent continuity and you represent the Constitution.


 


	Being an IPS officer gives you privileges and powers that are actually tools to serve the people. Your primary duty is to serve common citizens, and ensure justice to the poorest of the poor. It is very rare that a profession allow one to make a difference to the lives of not just a few people but thousands. You are joining one such rare profession and you must take this opportunity as a blessing.


 


	Some people believe that we can judge a society and the level of national development from the quality of policing. In many ways police represents and symbolises the quality of the state itself. For a common citizen and visitor to a country, the impression of the state and governance is formed by their interactions with and impressions of the traffic constable at the signal, the beat officer on neighbourhood patrol and the reception desk officer in a police station. We must do everything required to make basic policing better and that is the hallmark of a sensitive and professional police force. This would help us build an environment where citizens fear and respect the law – rather than fear the law enforcer.


 


	As officers of our police forces you can make a real contribution in this area. You must lead by example and discharge your duties without fear or favour, and without time delays. As professional civil servants, be willing to give the political executive your honest and unbiased advice. Your holy book and your constant guide must be the Constitution.


 


	As senior police officers you will be confronted with several challenges. Some of these are peculiar to the times we live in. For instance, there is the challenge posed by terrorism and left-wing extremism, which have both domestic and international dimensions. I have no doubt that you will take on these challenges with full determination, but you must do so in a way that innocent bystanders do not suffer. 


 


	You will also be confronted with crimes that have emerged with economic growth and technological advance. Our police forces must invest in building specialisation to prevent, manage and mitigate white collar and corporate crimes. And while technology and the Internet are changing our society for the better, they are also creating avenues for sophisticated, digital crimes. Again, I am sure that all of you, the young leaders of our police forces, will rise to the occasion and ensure that we can overcome these challenges. 


 


	Technology is both a challenge and a tool. Technology allows you to do your duties with greater efficiency. It also allows the citizen to interact with the police force – and even to lodge a complaint – from the comfort of his or her home and computer. Or mobile phone. Please encourage this process. The ideal police system is one where the citizen gets due service from the police without needing to visit the police station.


 


	I would end by saying what I always tell the officer trainees from different services who visit Rashtrapati Bhavan. While you should seek both professional and personal success do not lose sight of the fact that all of you are privileged in some manner or the other – by virtue of education or position or in some other way. As IPS officers you are expected to be leaders of the police forces and do your duty with utmost integrity. But you must do more than that. You must also give back to society and to those less privileged. How you choose to do this is something I leave to you. But do remember that each of you and indeed all of us in this room are obliged to make a positive contribution to the lives of those who are less privileged than us. 


 


	I wish all you a long and satisfying career in the service of our country. 


 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the 13th Convention of the Central Information Commission in New Delhi today (October 12, 2018).

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that free flow of information is the essence of democracy. And for the people of a free and free-spirited country, information is power. They have a right to know how they are being governed, how public money is being spent, how public and national resources are being deployed, how public services are being delivered, and how public works and welfare programmes are being carried out. In a democracy, there is no such thing as too much information. Information overload is always preferable to information deficit.

 

The President said that RTI is not a standalone. It is part of the larger narrative of strengthening Indian democracy, of ensuring transparency across systems of governance, and of building capacities of the common citizen to enable him or her to take informed decisions and make informed choices. Above all, it is about nurturing the social contract of trust between the citizen and the state – where both must have faith in each other. A related and parallel implication is to ensure rational use of public resources to check instances of corruption or waste.

 

The President said that RTI is part of a theme that makes for greater efficiency in both delivering services to a citizen as well as using public resources and finances. This improves transparency and removes doubts that may arise about favouritism and misappropriation. The Internet and the digital economy have been used to advance e-auctions of mining blocks. They have helped create the Government e-Market or GeM portal for public procurement of goods and services. And the JAM trinity – Jandhan accounts, Aadhar-based unique identities and mobile phones – has helped with direct bank transfers to beneficiaries of schemes.

 

The President said that all these are promoting efficiency and checking wastage. They act as a bulwark against corruption. They are part of the same architecture of citizen empowerment, citizen enabling and public efficiency that has inspired the Right to Information.

 

The President also emphasized on the fine balance between the Right to Information and the Right to Privacy. He commended the CIC for upholding the RTI’s basic charter that public records, with some exceptions for subjects such as national security, are open to public scrutiny – but private records of individual citizens are protected from intrusive third-party curiosity. He said that we must be cautious against fringe cases that try to use the RTI mechanism to settle personal scores. Especially in an age when privacy has become a matter of such intense debate, it is crucial to maintain this balance.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the 29th Accountants General Conference in New Delhi today (October 10, 2018).

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the 29th Accountants General Conference is the right occasion and opportunity to introspect and deliberate on what needs to be done to further our mission of promoting accountability, transparency and good governance. The theme of this year’s Conference is “Auditing and Accounting in a Digital Era”. This is extremely relevant today when the government is making great strides in ushering in Digital India.

 

The President was happy to note that the institution of CAG has come out with a data management policy and is increasingly using data analytics in its audit work. He said that through the use of data analytic techniques the CAG can assist in not only giving insights for the present but also aid in providing credible forecasts. With the tools appropriate to managing and examining the expanding data in a digital economy, the CAG is positioned to anticipate long-term trends and emerging issues related to the economy, education, health, environment, national security among others. These warrant the attention of lawmakers and the executive.

 

The President said that audit is not an end in itself. It is a means to make governments work better. We have to emphasise outcomes as a more meaningful measure of programme value than output. The CAG may deliberate on how would it, as an organisation, identify, understand and measure outcomes to study the impact of programmes. Such a study of programme effectiveness would be a big boon to policy makers. Such a study should also include a dialogue with the implementing agencies to understand their motivations and perspective.

 

The President said that in recent times, we have seen a massive decentralisation of funds, functions and functionaries. There is greater flexibility available to state governments. A number of welfare schemes are also implemented through urban local bodies and panchayats. However, it is a fact that accountability mechanisms at the local level are not as robust. The social audit to account whether the money was spent properly, and made the intended difference, is mostly conducted by the scheme beneficiaries. Here the CAG as an institution could partner with local citizens and state audit societies to train them, build capacities and issue advisories on framing of guidelines, developing criteria, methodology and reporting for audit.

	I am delighted to be at the Tajik National University. This seat of learning has played a defining role in the making of Tajikistan, and continues to illuminate and guide its vision and progress. Your country and Central Asia, the great centers of learning and culture- Samarkand and Khujand, have nurtured the spirit of creativity and inquiry for centuries. You are proud flag-bearers of that enlightened scholastic tradition, of the voice of Rudaki and Bedil, from which not just this region but the entire world continues to draw sustenance and inspiration.
	I have chosen to speak on the topic “Countering Radicalization: Challenges before Modern Society” for two reasons. First, your country has done commendable work to tackle this global menace and foster peace for one and all. And the world must recognize it. Second, the battle against terrorism, extremism and radicalism must be fought, first and foremost, in the minds of people, between those who believe in peace, love and humanity and those who feed on hatred, death and destruction. It is a battle of opposing ideas, of humanity on one hand and a make-belief world on the other. Talking to the youth, our future; and scholars, our guide and pathfinders, therefore, becomes essential. As the President of India, I am Visitor of 160 Universities and Institutions of Higher Learning. This has given me an opportunity to frequently speak to the youth in my country as well.  


My dear students,


	Our two countries have much in common. Our histories are rooted in inclusive and tolerant values. All religions and thoughts have prospered and blossomed in the land of the Pamir and the Himalayas. Today, we are confronted with those who wish to burn and destroy the fabric of our faiths, the embrace of our togetherness. 



	The people of this country have made enormous sacrifice to stop the surge of bigotry and faith-based regressive ideas from capturing centre-stage. This not only saved your budding Republic in the 1990s, but also firewalled your neighbouring Central Asian Republics. They too, were then, struggling with challenges that young nations face. We sincerely hope there is deeper understanding of the geopolitical significance of the Tajik civil war.


Ladies and gentlemen,


	Today, as you can see around you, there are renewed attempts to impose obscurantist thoughts on peaceful societies. This is threatening the very foundation of   human civilization. Their targets are people and societies, who value progressive life and respect diversity of faiths and cultures. 



	Notwithstanding your historic struggle and subsequent victory in the civil war, the long-drawn war is far from over. It is evident in every day brutal killings and senseless violence. Perpetrators of this evil seek legitimacy in scriptures, where none exist. No religion, none whatsoever, be it Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, Sikhism or Judaism justifies violence and killing one human being by the other. They all talk in one language and that is the language of peace, harmony, compassion and kindness. The war on terror and radicalization is not against any religion, and should never be. Quite on the contrary, it is against those who believe in destroying the creation of the Almighty. 



	We laud the leadership of President Rahmon in fighting terrorism and countering radicalization. You are a frontline State against the war on terror and the world admires and respects your courage. We recognize the enormous challenges the Tajik security forces face every day. You have to fight terrorists and deal with those who are brain-washed with radical ideas. The hot-bed of death and destruction is not far from you. You also have to contend with provocations to young minds–many of which are through the Internet and social media.


Ladies and gentlemen,


	The world that we Indians live in is not very different from yours. Terrorism does not believe in borders! India, like Tajikistan, is taking on terrorism and extremism head-on. We, too, face the problem of radicalisation but we have been successful in dealing with it. It is not the question of how we have done but rather why we have been able to do it.  I wish to share some of our experiences. 



	Our inclusive society, where socio-economic partnership and   participatory politics provide everybody an inherent sense of belonging to the nation has been the most effective bulwark                      against radicalisation. Our belief in pluralism, democracy and secularism has been successful in trumping the ideology of hate and divisiveness. From the film industry, to India’s cricket team and from the professional arena to politics, India is a land of equal opportunity and equal respect for all. A growing economy lifts one and all leading to inclusive development. 



	Our society has always believed in the power of ideas derived from our history, civilization and culture. Our age-old values of Sufism, of humanism have shielded us against dark and ugly designs. The call of our revered Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya,– “Almighty holds dear those who love Him for the sake of human beings, and those who love human beings for the sake of Almighty”  binds our social fabric.



	From our childhood, we are taught of oneness, of insaniyat as our creed, of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” – meaning, the world is one family. It is natural, then, that the invitation to destruction, even with its false but tempting narratives, generally does not appeal to the Indian mind. For a vast country that we are, I must share that those working overtime to infect us with their deadly virus have not succeeded and never will.



	I must also emphasize the positive role of family and education in preventing and countering radicalization of the youth in my country. Our family-based social structure, much like yours, is a guarantee against extremist ideas. We have witnessed tremendous resilience in our family as an institution, which has prevented vulnerable youth from getting drawn into the vortex of radicalization and terror. There have been cases where parents and relatives alerted authorities to save young targets from radicalization. Added to our family and community linkages, our religious leaders have also played a pivotal role in rejecting, condemning and countering the narrative of hate and terror.  



	But we have to be ever vigilant against alienation. We have to ensure fairness and honesty in our approach. And we have to be cautious of the cyber world to prevent those who can go astray. This is challenging no doubt.  But with technology, with digital finger-printing and algorithms we can out do the other.


 


	The politics of terror and radicalization to destabilize society is not the monopoly of non-state actors.  India has been battling cross-border terrorism for long.  If you recall your early days of civil war, I am certain that similar bitter memories will resurface. You could put those days behind you, successfully repelling unwanted intervention. Our close friend Afghanistan is not so lucky.  Both India and Tajikistan must work together to bring peace and stability in Afghanistan and the region.     



	India has deep and special historical ties with all Central Asian Republics. Our relations with each of them are flourishing. Our shared past and our shared aspirations   have got us together in a collective embrace. We are strengthening our security cooperation programmes. We held the latest India-Central Asia dialogue in Samarkand.  We are also engaging each other through regional platforms such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to tackle terrorism and extremism. India remains committed to collaborate bilaterally, regionally and multilaterally to strengthen the global fight against terrorism. 


My dear students,


	Today morning, I met President Rahmon. We shared our common concerns on the security situation around us. I complimented him for the lead taken by Tajikistan in collaboration with the United Nations to counter radicalism. We also committed ourselves to defeating these forces. In this endeavor, we can do much to learn from each other, be it for youth mobilization, effective social communication, imparting education or interfaith dialogue and conversation. We must cooperate to choke the financing networks of terrorists and their likes. And we must strengthen our security cooperation and share best practices to counter radicalization. 
	Trade and economic growth are long term fundamentals on which peaceful societies prosper. Economic progress and equity act as a bulwark against the spread of radical ideas. We are determined to overcome the lack of our connectivity with Tajikistan and with Central Asia, so that our economic relations grow and gallop. We, indeed, have a stake in your progress and prosperity.  


Ladies and Gentlemen,  


	Before arriving here, I had the honour to pay floral tributes at the bust of two great sons of India – Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore. Mahatma Gandhi has shown us the path of ‘Ahimsa’ or nonviolence, and the words of Tagore teach us to shun parochialism. These are eternal values that we must share and we must live.     



	I would like to conclude by drawing your attention to our shared heritage of humanism. The great Indian poet Mirza Abdul Qadir Bedil, who is remembered fondly in the lands of Amu and Syr Dariya wrote :


चिस्त इंसान? कमाले कुदरते इश्क

मानिये काएनातो सूरते इश्क 

Meaning - What is human being? Perfect expression of love. He is the true meaning of universe and face of love.

If we instill this love for humanity in ourselves and spread the same to others, peace and love will prevail in our hearts, in our minds and in our world.

I wish all of you a bright future. 

Thank you and God bless you.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, delivered a lecture on the theme of ‘Countering Radicalisation: Challenges in Modern Societies’ at the University of Tajikistan in Dushanbe today (October 8, 2018). 

Addressing the gathering, the President said that he had chosen to speak on the subject for two reasons. First, Tajikistan has done commendable work to tackle this global menace, and the world must recognise its efforts and success. Second, the battle against terrorism, extremism and radicalism must be fought, primarily, in the minds of people – between those who believe in peace and humanity and those who feed on death and destruction. It is a battle of opposing ideas. Talking to the youth as well as to our scholars and pathfinders therefore becomes essential.

The President said that terrorism does not believe in borders. India, like Tajikistan, is taking on terrorism and extremism. We too face the problem of radicalisation but our inclusive society, where socio-economic partnerships and participatory politics provide everybody with an inherent sense of belonging, has been our most effective bulwark. Plural and democratic India is a land of equal opportunity and equal respect for all. And a growing economy lifts one and lifts all. 

Earlier this morning (October 8, 2018), the President commenced his engagements with a visit to the Palace of Nation in Dushanbe. He was received by his Tajik counterpart, President Emamoli Rahmon, and accorded a ceremonial welcome. He also paid his respects at the Ismail Somani Memorial.  

During the discussions the President thanked President Rahmon for the warm reception. He said India is proud of its Strategic Partnership and age-old friendship with Tajikistan. He appreciated the lead Tajikistan has taken in fighting terrorism and said that we need to strengthen our cooperation in combating terrorism, including cross-border terrorism.

Subsequently, the two Presidents led delegation-level talks. Speaking on the occasion, President Kovind stressed the importance of defence and connectivity projects to advance Indo-Tajik relations for the benefit of the people of both countries. The two Presidents also discussed the common challenge of terrorism, particularly in the context of Afghanistan. India announced a grant of US$ 20 million for developmental assistance projects identified by Tajikistan.

Immediately after the delegation-level talks, India and Tajikistan announced nine agreements. These are:


	An agreement on cooperation in the field of disaster management
	An agreement between the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and the Tajik Academy of Agriculture Sciences 
	An agreement on peaceful use of space technology for developmental purposes
	An agreement between the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, and the Committee of Youth, Sports and Tourism, Government of Tajikistan
	An agreement between the Centre Council for Research in Unani Medicine, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, and the Tajik State Medical University Abualibh Sino 
	A programme of cooperation between the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Tajikistan, for the period 2018-21
	An agreement between the India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Ministry of Energy and Water Resources of Tajikistan for cooperation in renewable energy
	A cultural exchange programme between the Ministries of Culture of India and Tajikistan for the period 2019-23
	An agreement for academic and research exchanges between the Vivekananda International Foundation, India, and the Centre for Strategic Researches, Tajikistan 


The President issued a media statement on his visit to Tajikistan (attached). Later in the day, he paid his respects to Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore at their memorials in Dushanbe.

Tomorrow (October 9, 2018), the President will hold separate bilateral meetings with Mr Shukurjon Zuhurov, Chairman, Majlisi Namoyandagon of the Majlisi Oli (Lower House of the Parliament of Tajikistan), and with Mr Kohir Rasulzoda, the Prime Minister of Tajikistan. He will also visit the Ayni Air Force Base, before returning to Delhi.

	Salom.  At the outset, let me express my profound gratitude to   President Rahmon for his gracious warmth and welcome. The generosity of your hospitality, Mr. President, reflects the vibrancy and depth of our strategic partnership and our friendship.


 


	This is my first visit to Central Asia. Tajikistan is our nearest neighbour in Central Asia. I have, therefore, decided to make my first call in Dushanbe.


 


	India has historical ties with Tajikistan. Our civilisational bonds go back to ancient times. Our cultural and linguistic connections have always been robust. Poets and philosophers like Rudaki, Amir Khusro and Bedil are household names both in India and Tajikistan. Their works bear testimony to our shared values of humanism and tolerance. 


 


	Mr. President, looking back at the 27 years of our diplomatic relations, we have a deep sense of satisfaction for what we have achieved together. In these years, India and Tajikistan together have built a strong foundation for bilateral and multilateral cooperation. In 2012, we elevated our relationship to the level of Strategic Partnership. President Rahmon, we in India deeply appreciate your personal attention in nurturing this relationship. We recognize your great contribution to combating radicalization and terrorism, promoting peace, stability and a progressive way of life in Tajikistan.
	India’s membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which was strongly supported by Tajikistan, has opened a new vista in our strategic partnership. 


 


	Ladies and gentlemen, in my meeting with President Rahmon today, we had a very useful exchange of ideas. I am certain that the roadmap that we have agreed to will further strengthen our Strategic Partnership. There is enormous potential for bilateral cooperation and collaboration in the fields of defence, trade and investment, tourism, health and development partnership.  To take our ties forward, today we have signed key MOUs in the fields of political relations, strategic research, agriculture, renewable energy, traditional medicine, space technology, youth affairs, culture and disaster management.    


 


	India remains committed to provide capacity building and   development assistance support to Tajikistan.  We are happy to offer a grant of US$ 20 million for financing development projects as identified by the Government of Tajikistan.  We will undertake feasibility study of solar projects in seven villages in the country as requested by our host. We are also happy to provide two English Language Laboratories for Tajik Military.


 


	Connectivity is vital for realizing the full potential of our Strategic Partnership and economic relations. Together, India and Tajikistan can promote the International North-South Transport Corridor and other connectivity initiatives such as the development of Chabahar Port and the Ashgabat Agreement for smooth transport of goods.


 


	We live in a region which has unfortunately been beset with challenges posed by fundamentalists and terrorists. Both India and Tajikistan remain determined to counter all forms of terrorism and violent extremism which are a grave threat to international peace and stability. I thank President Rahmon for his support for early adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism at the UN. 


 


	India is committed to peace and development in neighbouring Afghanistan through an Afghan-led Afghan-owned and Afghan controlled peace process. Like Tajikistan, we too look forward to a peaceful Afghanistan which is able to achieve national reconciliation. 


 


	I am happy that India and Tajikistan have convergence of views on key regional and global issues. I am confident that under the able leadership of President Rahmon, the future of Tajikistan will be as glorious as in the past and India-Tajikistan relations will scale greater heights.


 


	I have extended an invitation to President Rahmon to visit India at an early date. I look forward to receiving him.


 

Thank you.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, landed in Tajikistan this afternoon (October 7, 2018) on a three day visit to the country. Later in the evening, he addressed members of Indian community at a reception hosted by Mr Somnath Ghosh, Ambassador of India to Tajikistan, in Dushanbe. 

Addressing the gathering, the President said that a major change has been made in the Indian Government’s mechanism to connect with the overseas Indian community. Emotional, cultural, economic and institutional relations between India and its diaspora have become stronger in the past few years. Missions have been instructed to promptly respond to diaspora members in need of assistance. 

Addressing the “Friends of India in Tajikistan”, the President assured them that India will continue to give its cooperation to Tajikistan in capacity building and development. He appreciated the work of Tajikistan’s Indologists. He recalled that the Padma Shri had been conferred on the famous Indologist, Prof. Habibullo Rajabov this year for his contribution in education and literature.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the 4th India International Science Festival in Lucknow today (October 6, 2018).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that science has always been a part of Indian culture. Centuries ago, our ancestors were uncovering the secrets of mathematics and the concept of the zero. They were applying the lessons of science in fields as far apart as medicine and metallurgy. From the Green Revolution to our space programme to the creation of a thriving biotech and pharmaceutical industry, science has driven our post -1947 modernisation. Today, in the first quarter of the 21st century, in the age of robotics and precision manufacture, of bioinformatics and gene editing, of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Artificial Intelligence, it is time for a quantum jump.

The President said that we cannot make that jump without converting science into a mass movement – and without promoting tinkering and innovation as an everyday activity in our labs, our universities and even our schools. Jugaad, cut-paste experiments and frugal innovation have their role. Even so, if we are to transform India into a middle-income economy and an advanced industrial power, we need to upgrade the engines of knowledge creation. Science and technology are not a mere add-on – their cross-cutting nature and role in every field and in all our flagship programmes and developmental efforts have to be appreciated.

The President said that the role of science and scientific innovation in our national developmental agenda is expanding day by day. In 2017, patent applications by Indian start-ups rose to 909. This was a 15-fold increase from the number in 2016 – just 61. In 2018, India’s R&D investments will amount to an appreciable US$ 83.27 billion. The government has announced the Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship Scheme. It will promote development through innovation and has a budget of Rs 1,650 crore for seven years beginning 2018-19. These are exciting times for science in India. The resources are now available. It is for our talent pool to respond.

The President said that science is done best when it is a collaborative venture, with resources – including funding resources – and facilities being shared. This is the era of partnerships between research centres and universities. He urged the scientific community to mentor and to open its doors to budding researchers and students in universities. He said that budding researchers and students look to senior scientists for guidance, support and access to laboratories and equipment. With such generosity of spirit and of intellect, Indian science will carry much greater weight. And it will move closer to building a best-in-class ecosystem.

The President pointed to the low participation of women in higher science. He noted that of the 3,446 scientists working at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, only 632 – or 18.3 per cent – are women. He said that in a week when women scientists have won Nobel Prizes for physics and for chemistry, this is a telling statistic. It is a reminder of the scientific potential of our daughters that we are not adequately harnessing. This is both a social and systemic challenge – but it is our collective responsibility to overcome it.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed an International Conference on Women’s Health, Wellness and Empowerment organised by the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India and the Kanpur Obstetric and Gynaecological Society in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh today (October 6, 2018).  

 Speaking on the occasion, the President said that this Conference has a commendable theme: “Give her wings and let her soar.” When we give our daughters and young girls in our families the freedom to venture out, to explore and find their potential, they soar higher and higher. The President said that social and economic gaps affect women much more than others. They have a particular impact on families and communities from weaker sections of society. It is with this in mind that the entire ecosystem of healthcare is being revitalised. For example, more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened to sell and distribute quality medicines at reduced prices. These are benefiting fellow citizens from low-income families. And 85 lakh expectant mothers and 3.25 crore children have been provided immunisation cover under Mission Indradhanush. 

The President said that the Ayushmaan Bharat healthinsurance programme has been launched recently. It envisages providing health coverage to socially and economically disadvantaged sections of society. As part of Ayushmaan Bharat, 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres are being opened across India. These will provide services to, among others, mothers and newborn babies.

 Later in the day, the President addressed a seminar organised by the Talent Development Council, Kanpur, and unveiled the statue of the late freedom fighter Shri Shyamlal Parshad in Kanpur. 

 Speaking at the Talent Development Council’s seminar, the President appreciated the Council for its efforts to identify and encourage talented students and facilitate their free education. He noted that a number of students associated with the Council have been successful in engineering, medical and other entrance examinations. Unveiling the statue of the late freedom fighter Shri Shyamlal Parshad, the President paid tributes to him as the author of the song “Jhanda ooncha rahe hamara”. He spoke of Shri Parshad’s life as well as his ode to the national flag as everlasting inspirations.

 Later today in Lucknow, the President will inaugurate the 4th India International Science Festival organised by the Ministry of Science & Technology, the Ministry of Earth Sciences and Vijnana Bharati, before returning to Delhi.

                The Change of Guard Ceremony on Sundays, which was discontinued earlier due to extreme weather conditions, will recommence from October 7, 2018. The timing of the Ceremony will be from 1730 hrs to 1810 hrs (October 7, 2018 to November 14, 2018) and from 1630 hrs to 1710 hrs (November 15, 2018 to March 14, 2019).

 

The Ceremony will also continue to take place on every Saturday at its original timings, i.e., from 1000 hrs to 1040 hrs (November 15 to March 14) and from 0800 hrs to 0840 hrs (March 15 to November 14). 

 

The Change of Guard is a military tradition taken forward by the President’s Bodyguards (PBG) and the Army Guard. The 40 minute ceremony commences with the PBG troops advancing from behind the Jaipur column to the tune of ‘Maa Tujhe Salaam’, played by the Army Brass Band. The Army Guard contingent then marches in and the new guard replaces the old guard. The day's ceremony ends with an equestrian display by the PBG before they ride away towards Rashtrapati Bhavan, and with the National Anthem.

 

A request to witness the Change of Guard Ceremony can be made online through a link on the website https://rb.nic.in/rbvisit/rbvisit_cog.aspx. However, a person with valid government issued photo ID card would be allowed to witness the Ceremony subject to availability of seats. Entry is through Gate No. 2 or 37 of Rashtrapati Bhavan.

                Mr Antonio Guterres, the Secretary General of United Nations, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (October 3, 2018).

 

Welcoming Mr Guterres on his first visit to India as Secretary General of the United Nations, the President said that India deeply values his participation in the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention and the 4th anniversary of the Swachh Bharat campaign. The President thanked him for all the support has given to spread the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi.

 

The President said that in the past few years, India has witnessed transformative changes powered by digital technology and inclusive development policies, be it in gender empowerment; sanitation; financial inclusion; provision of clean cooking fuel to over 250 million people; making available health insurance to over 500 million people; or giving access to electricity to millions across the country. We remain fully committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). And our commitment is not limited to our country. Our development cooperation programmes are helping others to meet these Goals as well. 

 

The President said that India believes that in a globalising world, multilateralism is indispensible. India remains committed to it. However, to our understanding multilateralism and global governance in their present form are not working effectively. The UN must adapt itself to the changing times. It should be more responsive to the needs of all countries. 

 

The President said that no reform of the UN would be complete without the reform of the UN Security Council. The current permanent membership of the Security Council does not reflect contemporary global realities. He emphasised that the Security Council’s membership and work methods need to be updated to equip it to face the challenges of the 21st century.

                I extend a very warm and cordial welcome to President Mirziyoyev and First Lady on their first State Visit to India.  

Your visit Mr. President heralds a new era of friendship and cooperation in our Strategic Partnership. We deeply value the importance you attach to enhancing and deepening our age-old ties.

As old friends and strategic partners, we are privileged to possess a strong foundation of historical ties to build our contemporary relations.  

You started your journey to India with a visit to the Taj Mahal, a monument which most vividly symbolises our shared history. Traders and travellers, writers and poets, artists and artisans have since ancient times contributed to forging a close cultural bonding between our peoples. 

We both rejoice in the sufi musings of Alisher Navoi and the spiritual qawwali of Amir Khusrau.  Remains of Buddhist monasteries in Samarkand and Termez and the art of Kashidakari and ikat draw us together in thought and in creativity.  

Excellency, your visit is taking place on the eve of birth anniversaries of Mahatma Gandhi and our former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. With both, you have a very special connect. We are grateful to you and to your people for the love and affection you have showered upon them. 

Tomorrow, we are launching our worldwide celebrations of the 150th birthday of the Father of our Nation. As we mark the fourth anniversary of our Swachh Bharat programme started on 2nd October 2014, I thank you for the participation of Uzbekistan in the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention being held from 29th September to 2nd October 2018. We want to share with and learn from you and from all our international partners as we strive to realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi of a Swachh Bharat, of a clean India.  

Excellency, today we have committed ourselves to take our partnership to a higher trajectory.  We have signed several key bilateral agreements to strengthen our Strategic Partnership. We are aiming ambitiously to grow our trade and investment. We want to work together to secure our   people from the forces of terrorism and extremism; to intensify our defence cooperation; and to bring peace and stability in the region. 

We are also committed to bring the fruits of science and technology to better the lives of our peoples. And we are initiating plans to bring the benefits of digital-age and Start-ups to our youth.    

Excellency, our bilateral ties are doing well. But we want to, not just grow, but gallop in our partnership. And for this, we have to connect better - through airports, sea-ports, highways and i-ways. New opportunities await us to trade and taste our mangoes and our melons!   

Excellency, we thank you for supporting our membership to the Ashgabat Agreement to foster connectivity in the region. We also invite Uzbekistan to join the International North South Transport Corridor.   

Excellency, Uzbekistan-India friendship has the depth and warmth of the past and the present. It has now to connect with the limitless possibilities of the future.         

          On this optimistic note, I invite all our guests to raise a toast to:

There is a new dynamism in Central Asia today and the spirit of cooperation across the region is flourishing. As a friend, India takes great pride of Uzbekistan’s achievements.

The President said that cross-border terrorism poses a grave challenge to our region. Regional peace and stability are critical for fostering progress and prosperity of our peoples. He was happy to note that India and Uzbekistan have agreed to step-up security and counter-terrorism cooperation. 

The President appreciated Uzbekistan’s efforts to bring peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. He said that India stands ready to cooperate with all like-minded countries to work towards peace and stability in Afghanistan.

The President said that India takes pride in its development cooperation partnership with Uzbekistan. He was happy to note that India has offered a line of credit of US $ 200 million to support social sector projects in Uzbekistan. He said that connectivity is critical to building an economic partnership. He thanked Uzbekistan for supporting India’s membership of the Ashgabat Agreement. 

Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Kovind said that as old friends and strategic partners, India and Uzbekistan possess a strong foundation of historical ties to build contemporary relations. Our bilateral ties are doing well. But we want to, not just grow, but gallop. And for this, we have to connect better - through airports, sea-ports, highways and i-ways.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has issued the following message to the nation on the eve of Gandhi Jayanti.

In his message the President has said, “Gandhi Jayanti is an occasion for all of us to rededicate ourselves to the values espoused by the Father of the Nation - peace, fraternity, harmony and inclusive national development. Mahatma Gandhi’s values and his life itself had a universal appeal, making him an ideal not just for Indians but for the entire world. This year is even more special since it marks the beginning of the celebration of 150 years of the Gandhiji’s birth.

Gandhiji’s leadership inspired millions to participate in the struggle for the independence of our nation and in fact our subcontinent. The dawn of a free India meant that Indians could build the destiny of their nation and live a life of respect and honour. Gandhiji continues to be our guiding light as we seek to completely eradicate poverty and achieve rapid social and economic progress.

It is only befitting that the people and Government of India would celebrate Gandhi Jayanti this year with welfare programmes pertinent to the life and work of Mahatma Gandhi. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a true tribute to Gandhiji, who espoused cleanliness as an essential element of healthy living. 

This Gandhi Jayanti let us all resolve to make our homes, residential areas, cities, villages and our country clean-and to spread the message of total sanitation. Mahatma Gandhiji message remains relevant for all Indians – and indeed for all humanity”.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India’s stability, consistency, transparency and reform agenda coupled with a safe and structured financial system makes India one of the most attractive FDI destinations. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Global Expo Botswana 2018, in Gaborone, Botswana today.

 

This year’s Expo holds special significance to India this year as 25 Indian companies are taking part in the event making it the largest participation from a single country.

 

The Vice President said that the annual Business to Business Expo creates an opportunity for the world community to engage with the Africa and deepen the feeling of commonality and sense of purpose among participating nations.

 

Emphasizing that India's engagement with Africa has gathered an unprecedented pace over the last four years, the Vice President reiterated that India supports the industry to invest in Africa and keeps its markets open for investments. Informing the global business community about India’s economic progress, the Vice President highlighted the transformative changes taking place in India.

 

The Vice President said that India’s steady growth rate of over 7% presents multiple opportunities for Botswana entrepreneurs in various sectors and invited them to seize current and emerging business opportunities. He further said that transformative taxation reforms such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST) made India a transparent and an integrated market with greater ease of doing business.

 

The Vice President of Botswana, Mr. Slumber Tsogwane, the Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry of Botswana, Ms. Bogolo J. Kenewendo, the Minister of State for Social Justice & Empowerment, Government of India, Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar, accompanying Members of Parliament and participating members from several countries in the Global Expo 2018 were present on the occasion. 

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am happy and privileged to be amongst this august gathering for the inauguration of the Global Expo Botswana 2018. I am thankful for this wonderful opportunity. 

Botswana and India enjoy a longstanding and enduring partnership because we share the common values of democracy and strong people-to-people ties. 

I am delighted to be at this opportune moment and a unique platform that brings together business leaders from different countries. I consider this yet another milestone in India-Botswana business relations. 

I appreciate Botswana’s political and economic stability and its fastest growing economy status in the Southern African region. 

India commends Botswana’s significant role in integrating its regional partners and promoting inclusive growth for Africa.

I wish Botswana and its people all the very best in their endeavour to achieve the desired goals. 

I come from a country that has, from time immemorial, believed that the entire world is one large family. 

It is a country that has espoused peaceful co-existence among nations. It is a country that believes that all the countries should work together to improve human lives.

The Global Expo is a forum that, in my view, deepens this feeling of commonality and sense of purpose, of the feeling that partnership can lead to greater prosperity, and of the feeling that we can move faster to create a world we want if we learn from each other. 

I congratulate Government of Botswana for conceptualizing and organising this special business-to-business Expo every year in the month of October since 2006. 

I appreciate the enthusiastic participation of the local companies and various regional sectors showcasing their products and services and using this forum to explore business opportunities. 

I understand that 25 Indian companies are taking part this year. I am happy to note that this is the largest participation in the Expo from a single country. 

I am sure the Expo will further promote Botswana goods export; strengthen intra and regional trade, attract FDI, expansion of domestic investment and create joint-venture opportunities between Botswana and investors. I am hopeful that it will also stimulate a culture of entrepreneurship. 

In this regard, I am aware of the significant role played by Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry and Botswana Investment and Trade Centre (BITC) in organising this multi-sectoral Expo. I appreciate their tireless efforts in promoting business and organising such successful events. 

Friends,

India's engagement with Africa over the last four years has been unprecedented. Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set out 10 guiding principles to take our relationship with Africa to even greater heights. 

You may be aware that in the India-Africa Forum Summit III in 2015, India pledged an overall lines of credit of US $ 10 Billion for Africa, in addition to US $ 600 million as grant and 50,000 scholarships. We are well on our way to fulfilling these pledges. 

Let me assure that our development partnership assistance is on terms which are comfortable for you and as Prime Minister Modi said, ""It will liberate your potential and not constrain your future."" He had also reiterated that we will keep our markets open and support our industry to invest in Africa.  We will also bring our digital revolution to support Africa's development as well as work with you, as per ‘ your ’ priorities, on a range of areas. 

India's relation with Botswana has remained close and warm. Our engagement has enhanced over the years including in the areas of defence and security, trade and business, healthcare and capacity building. 

Dear Friends, It is indeed a matter of great satisfaction that India-Botswana business ties have been growing steadily over the years. Our bilateral trade is valued at USD 1.75 billion in 2017-18. It is impressive to note that our trade has increased by 26% during 2017-18. Both of our countries need to sustain this upward trend and boost the trade even further. 

I am glad to note that Botswana provides ample business opportunities to the Indian investors. Large number of Indian diaspora has already invested in Botswana. Indian companies are engaged in various sectors, including power transmission, infrastructural projects, IT, education, steel, diamond, trading etc. It shows Botswana Government’s commitment and progressive trade policies to attract investors. I also congratulate the Indian investors who are among the important investors in Botswana contributing significantly to employment creation. 

India is moving rapidly on the path of economic transformation with an annual growth rate of over 7%. It presents multiple opportunities for Botswana entrepreneurs in various sectors. 

There is an encouraging swing in stock market indices, foreign exchange reserves, and public investments in infrastructure and welfare measures. 

As per World Bank’s Ease of Business Index, India has climbed 42 places. 

Transformative taxation reforms like the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) has made India a transparent and an integrated market with greater ease of doing business. 

Aiming to make India the 3rd largest consumer market in the world, we are moving forward to build a five trillion dollar economy by 2025. 

Friends, 

As you have seen, our multi-party democracy has demonstrated stability coupled with a safe and structured financial system which makes India  one of the most attractive FDI destinations. 

Today, in India, there is a new enthusiasm, a new dynamism and a new quest for excellence in all spheres.

Government of India has launched several flagship programs including the Swachh Bharat i.e. Clean India, Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Industrial Corridors and Smart Cities development programs. 

The Jan Dhan Yojana programme, under which more than 320 million bank accounts have been opened, is a giant leap towards financial inclusion. 

I am delighted to invite Botswana companies to seize these current and emerging business opportunities.

I am confident that this Global Expo will generate mutually beneficial commercial opportunities between India and Botswana and among all the participant countries and business entities.

With these words, now I officially declare the 13th Global Expo open. 

I hope Global Expo Botswana 2018  will succeed in bringing the world a little closer, and making it a little more prosperous, a little more inclusive and sustainable than today 

Thank you.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that safety of passengers should be paramount for any transportation service and asked aviation industry to place passengers’ convenience at the centre of all activities. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the Economic Impact Report and Coffee Table Book encapsulating the growth story of Indian Aviation marking completion of 12 years of operations of GMR Group at Delhi Airport, here today.

The Vice President appreciated Airport authorities and GMR employees for maintaining global standards at Delhi Airport. “Delhi Airport is pride of our nation”, he added. 

The Vice President said that governments, policy makers and business enterprises must ensure hassle free environment at Airports for commuters. He further said that Government’s efforts to improve domestic air connectivity and make it affordable would get a boost if quality infrastructure is built and efficient customer services are provided by airliners. Public Private Partnership is the most suitable mode of developing such infrastructure and it is the best model to provide quality services at an affordable price as it allows competition among different entities, he added.

The Vice President said that connectivity is the key for economic growth and added that aviation industry has huge scope for development. He said that the growth of the aviation sector will have a multiplier effect on the Indian economy as it would positively impact hospitality and tourism sectors, among others.

The Vice President said that effective implementation of UDAN scheme would develop regional connectivity and promote economically viable flights on regional routes. He asked Airport authorities and PPP operators to focus on making it accessible and affordable to the common man.  

The Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Shri Jayant Sinha, the Lt. Governor of Delhi, Shri Anil Baijal, the Chairman of GMR Group, Shri Grandhi Mallikarjuna Rao and several members of aviation and airline industry were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“It is my privilege to be with you this afternoon and to have just released two important books, which encapsulate the growth story of Indian Aviation.

At the outset, my heartiest congratulations to Mr. G.M. Rao and his team for having successfully completed 12 years of operations at Delhi Airport which is India’s leading airport in the PPP sector.

I am given to understand that since the time GMR Group took over this airport, the number of Air Traffic Movements have gone up by 250 per cent, while the passenger numbers have gone up nearly 400 per cent. This is by no means a small achievement while maintaining a consistent top rank in the service quality rankings and making India proud by continuously being the world’s number one airport for the past few years.

If one looks at the world aviation scenario, it has doubled in the last 15 years and today, a country like India is the 4th largest aviation market in the world.

We are also among a few countries in the world which took bold steps of privatizing the industry. Today PPP airports handle 55 per cent of the total Indian Passenger Traffic and more than 72 per cent of the total air cargo traffic. I am also told that Delhi Airport is 16th busiest airport globally and they are targeting it to be among the top five in the near future.

The world today faces a variety of economic challenges as well as extreme volatility on various fronts. At times like this, it is important that appropriate investments be made to increase and improve the infrastructure within the country. I am informed that Delhi Airport will soon be spending nearly Rs. 9,000 crore to boost its capacity to nearly 100 million passengers per annum.

The Economic Impact Study has also been a huge eye-opener. I am happy to note that the Delhi airport contributes to almost 0.7 per cent of the national GDP and almost 18 per cent of Delhi’s GSDP. It is extremely heartening to note that this entity employs nearly 28 lakh employees both directly as well as indirectly.

I always knew that there was something significant happening whenever an announcement was made about the airport, but these figures and ranks which have now been highlighted bear testimony to the devotion, dedication and discipline of all agencies involved in the operations of Delhi Airport.

Congratulations to all on this achievement, particularly to Shri Mallikarjuna Rao and his family. I wish GMR group many more achievements in the years to come.

With the government deciding to improve domestic air connectivity and make it affordable, the need of the hour is to provide quality infrastructure and efficient customer services. The scope for growth and expansion of the Indian civil aviation industry is huge and the focus must be on making it accessible and affordable to the common man.

The global airlines body, International Air Transport Association (IATA), has projected India to be the third largest aviation market around 2024 surpassing the UK.

It has also projected the Asia-Pacific region to drive the biggest growth with more than half the total number of new passengers over the next 20 years coming from these markets. The growth is being driven by a combination of continued robust economic growth, improvements in household incomes and favourable population and demographic profiles, it noted.

The present trends in air transport suggest passenger numbers could double to 8.2 billion in 2037 and this doubling of air passengers could support 100 million jobs globally, according to IATA.

The National Civil Aviation Policy unveiled in 2016 has mentioned that if every Indian in the middle class income bracket takes just one fight a year, it would result in a sale of 35 crore tickets.

It should be noted that the growth of the aviation sector will have a multiplier effect on the Indian economy as it would positively impact hospitality and tourism sectors, among others. 

The Aviation Policy seeks to create an ecosystem to make flying affordable to masses to enable 30 crore domestic ticketing by 2022 and 50 crore by 2027.  The government also launched the UDAN scheme to develop regional connectivity and promote economically viable flights on regional routes.

In the end, I would like all the airlines and other stakeholders in the aviation industry to place the safety and passengers’ convenience at the centre of all your activities.

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has advised the youth to shun sedentary lifestyle, junk food and stay healthy and also called up on people to make Yoga an integral part of their daily routine to combat lifestyle diseases which have acquired menacing proportions. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the Book ‘Yoga and Mindfulness’ authored by well known Yoga exponent, Ms. Mansi Gulati, here today.

The Vice President stressed that Yoga would help in combating severe stress, life style diseases and helps the overall wellbeing of an individual. Practicing yoga will aid in strengthening muscles, improving respiration, lung functions, metabolism and circulation, he said. It would also help in improving immune system and mind relaxation, he added. 

The Vice President called on people to practice Yoga to be free of Roga (Illnesses) as he expressed concern over the worrisome statistics and this unhealthy trend of trend of increasing cancer cases and lifestyle diseases such as obesity. Every individual has to become health conscious and avoid leading sedentary lifestyle, eating junk food and harmful use of alcohol and tobacco, he said.

Saying that Yoga was a gift to the World from India, the Vice President said that everyone must be proud of the fact that UN had declared June 21 as International Yoga Day following the efforts of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.

Underlining that Yoga has nothing to do with religion, the Vice President expressed concern that some people with bigoted mindset and a tunnel vision were attempting to give it a religious colour. The fact that people in several countries across the continents have embraced Yoga shows the hollowness of the claims that link yoga to religion, he added.

Ambassadors and High Commissioners of several countries, Members of Parliament, Yoga experts and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am delighted to release the book, “Yoga and Mindfulness’, which provides a broad and comprehensive overview of Yoga and its benefits.

This book by Ms. Mansi Gulati, a well-known Yoga exponent, will further enrich the enormous literature and body of work on Yoga. Written in simple language and from a user’s perspective, the book will come in handy for beginners as well as regular yoga practitioners. I would like to compliment Mansi for her untiring efforts to popularize yoga.

Dear sisters and brothers, Yoga, an ancient physical, mental and spiritual discipline, is India’s gift to the world. We all need to be proud of the fact that UN has declared June 21 as International Yoga Day following the efforts of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

I would like to recall what the Prime Minister had told the UN General Assembly in 2014. He had said : “ Yoga is an invaluable gift of ancient Indian tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature and a holistic approach to health and wellbeing. Yoga is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with ourselves, the world and Nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help us to deal with climate change”.

Today, around 180 countries are celebrating International Yoga Day on June 21 as the world leaders have recognized its wide-ranging beneficial effects on mind and body and its holistic impact on the well-being of an individual. In fact, during my foreign travels, I have noticed the presence of Yoga training centres in many countries, including Latin America. 

I would also like to mention that Yoga has nothing to do with religion although some people with bigoted mindset and a tunnel vision are attempting to give it a religious colour. The fact that people in several countries across the continents have embraced Yoga shows the hollowness of the claims that link yoga to religion.

Various studies have chronicled the health-enhancing outcomes of Yoga for many medical problems from depression to asthma.  The need to make Yoga an integral part of the daily routine has become an absolute necessity in the present times to combat lifestyle diseases which have acquired menacing proportions.

According to ICMR India State-Level Disease Burden Study report, the estimated proportion of all deaths due to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) has increased from 37.09% in 1990 to 61.8% in 2016. 

As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2015-16, 11% of women (1 in 10) and 15% of men (1 in 7) in the 15-49 age group are hypertensive.  

It is estimated number of cancer patients in India is around 2.25 million and every year over 11.5 lakh new patients are diagnosed with the disease. the estimated number of cancer-related deaths are in 2018 is over 7. 8 lakhs. These are worrisome statistics and this unhealthy trend of trend of increasing cancer cases has to be curbed by concerted efforts of healthcare professionals, policymakers and other stakeholders in health sector. 

The Government has formulated the National Health Policy, 2017, which seeks to promote preventive healthcare and ensure universal access to good quality healthcare services. In short, the policy seeks to move away from sick-care to wellness, with thrust on prevention and health promotion. It basically seeks to reduce premature mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases.

Every individual has to become health conscious and avoid leading sedentary lifestyle, eating junk food and harmful use of alcohol and tobacco.

Obesity also is becoming a common health problem and I am sure that integrating Yoga into daily routine will help in combating various illnesses. Regular practice of Yoga will aid in strengthening muscles, improving respiration, lung functions, metabolism and circulation.It would also help in improving immune system and mind relaxation.   

 

Thank you. Jaihind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that he salute the valour, commitment and contribution of Sikhs to the humanity especially in the contemporary tempestuous times of mistrust, prejudice and intolerance. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the book ‘Prominent Sikhs of India’, authored by Dr. Prabhleen Singh and published by Paunjab University, here today.

The Vice President said that the Book highlights the achievements of 50 living Sikh legends from various walks of life and it is a fitting tribute to the founder of Sikhism Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji.

The Vice President said that Guru Nanak Ji had made immense contribution to this great nation with his commitment to serve the poorest of the poor, irrespective of cast creed and religion. He had laid foundation to build a society whose primary duty lies in serving the people and participating in nation-building, he said. Sikhs have always shielded the nation whenever the need arose, he added.

The Vice President said that India’s economy is growing at a much faster rate than many major economies of the world as he called for united efforts face challenges existing in the growth trajectory. We need to convert them into opportunities and take steps to sustain the momentum, he said. Here our youth, who constitute around 65 per cent of our population can act as the agents of change and lead the nation to new heights, he added. 

The Vice President said that the youth must draw inspiration from the life and stories of great leaders who have made their mark. It is our essential duty to motivate the youth to stay put in the nation and contribute to development, he added. 

The Vice President stressed the need to impart employable skills in youth realise their power and achieve the demographic dividend adding that such efforts instill confidence in youth and encourage them to make good use of the reform agenda of the nation and take part in developmental process. Our youth must move in a direction where they can become job creators instead of job seekers, he said.

More than 100 distinguished Sikhs and others were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to launch the book titled ‘Prominent Sikhs of India’, authored by Dr. Prabhleen Singh here at the Sardar Patel Conference Hall today.

I happy that a young doctor, Prabhleen Singh has put in good efforts to bring out the stories of valor, service and hard work of 50 great Sikhs and publishing the book on the occasion to commemorate the 550th birth celebrations of the first Guru of Sikhs, Guru Nanak Dev Ji.

Guru Nanak Ji, the founder of Sikhism had made immense contribution to this great nation with his commitment to serve the poorest of the poor, irrespective of cast creed and religion. He had laid foundation to build a society whose primary duty lies in serving the people and participating in nation-building. 

गुरु नानक जी के विचार, उपदेश, शिक्षाएं और शिष्यों तथा अनुयायियों के साथ उनके प्रवचन “केयर एंड शेयर” अर्थात “सबकी चिंता करना और प्रत्येक वस्तु/विचार साझा करना” की भारतीय दर्शन की मूल भावना को दर्शाते हैं। वे दयालुता की प्रतिमूर्ति थे और उन्होने लाखों लोगों को अपने निःस्वार्थ प्रेम, शांति और सार्वभौमिक भाईचारे के संदेश से प्रेरित किया।

ईश्वर के साथ उनके साक्षात्कार के बाद उनका प्रथम संदेश यही था कि ""कोई हिंदू नहीं है, न ही कोई मुसलमान है।"" उन्होंने यह भी स्पष्ट किया कि उनकी प्राथमिक रुचि किसी भी आध्यात्मिक सिद्धांत को स्थापित करने में नहीं बल्कि उनकी चिंता मानव और उसकी नियति में निहित थी। इसका अर्थ है जैसा प्यार तुम स्वयं से करते हो वैसा ही तुम अपने पड़ोसी से करो। 

- कीरत करो, अर्थात कोई भी कार्य ईमानदारी और लगन से करो।

- नाम जपो, अर्थात ईश्वर का नाम जपो, और उस ईश्वर का सतत स्मरण करो जिसने आपको श्रम और सेवा की शक्ति दी है।

- वाद छको अर्थात जो ज़रूरतमंद है, अक्षम है उसके साथ अपना भोजन साझा करो।

उनके इस महान सार्वभौमिक संदेश से प्रेरणा लेकर विश्व भर में लाखों सिख मतावलंबी जरूरतमंदों की सहायता कर रहे हैं। मैंने स्वयं देश के विभिन्न भागों में गुरुद्वारों में की जा रही सेवा को देखा है और यह सेवा निस्संदेह वास्तव मैं अनुकरणीय और प्रेरणास्पद हैं।

Indian history is witness to the fact that Sikhs have always shielded the nation whenever the need arose. Carrying the rich Sikh heritage and legacy in the modern times, the Sikhs continue to serve in different fields across the world with distinction and through their dedication, commitment and philanthropy. 

The book I have just released highlights the lives of 50 distinguished Sikhs of India who have contributed significantly to the development of the nation and asserted their Sikh identity to the world in a very positive light.

In my view, this literary piece is a celebration and a salute to the highest summits of professional excellence and social responsibility attainted by these exemplary Sikhs of India.

It carries the motivational success stories and messages for the youth from these icons. I am sure that it will serve as an inspiration to the youth of today and make them to emulate the qualities of the great men.

Highlighting the achievements of these living Sikh legends from various walks of life, the author presented the life of these esteemed personalities very crisply, conveying a hope to excel, and instilling confidence in the readers to aspire and bring about a change.

The book is step towards enlightening the world about Sikhs and their proactive contribution to the humanity especially in the contemporary tempestuous times of mistrust, prejudice and intolerance.

I would like to once again compliment the author for compiling inspiration stories of 50 esteemed living Sikh personalities who have made their mark nationally and internationally.

To name a few - Dr Manmohan Singh, the former Prime Minister of India, Dynamic Ministers in the present government Smt Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Shri Hardeep Puri & Shri SS Ahluwalia, Well-known Bureaucrat and former Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Shri Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Ace athlete and the flying Sikh Shri Milkha Singh, Cricketer Bishen Singh Bedi, Poet Surjit Patar and many more.

The writer has highlighted the pressing issue of brain drain or migration of young to abroad. By writing the inspiring, thought provoking stories of prominent Sikhs the author is aiming to motivate the youth to stay put in the nation and contribute to development.

Dear Friends, we are living at a time when India is undergoing a major transformation. Steps are being taken by the Government to empower youth and make them self reliant. We are moving in a direction where youth can become job creators instead of job seekers.

Schemes such as Make in India, Digital India, and Skill India are taking the shape of mass movement.  Our economy is growing at a much faster rate than many major economies of the world. World Bank in its 2018 Report has noted that India’s GDP growth is projected to reach 6.7 percent in 2017-18 and accelerate to 7.3 percent and 7.5 percent in 2018-19 and 2019- 20 respectively.

However, we have certain challenges and we need to convert them into opportunities and take steps to sustain the momentum. Here our youth, who constitute around 65 per cent of our population can act as the agents of change and lead the nation to new heights.

To realise this huge youth power and achieve the demographic dividend, we must train our youth with employable skills. We must empower them to understand and make good use of the reform agenda of the nation.

I am sure, this book will inspire and instil confidence in youth and encourage them to take the lead in scripting the country’s growth story

My compliments once again to Dr. Prabhleen Singh and publisher -Punjab University, Chandigarh for bringing out the stories of great men and women!

Jai Hind!

                “There is a great need to rethink and redefine development. We need a paradigm that combines development with sustainability”, the Vice President of India, Shri. M. Venkaiah Naidu said at the Presentation ceremony of ‘Earth Heroes Awards’ 2018, here today. 

The awards have been instituted by the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and the eight winners for the year were chosen for their significant contributions towards protecting and conserving the valuable resources of our planet and for going above and beyond their call of duty to save the planet’s ecological assets. 

The Vice President congratulated RBS for the various projects they had conceived and carried out for strengthening communities, improving livelihoods and promoting conservation of fragile ecosystems. Having congratulated the winners for the year, the Vice President told them that their commitment, creativity and energy were truly exemplary. 

Recalling India’s a great tradition of venerating nature, the Vice President observed that peace comes through equilibrium and balance and added that ecology gets disturbed if there is reckless over-exploitation. Sounding a warning that nature had inexorable laws, the Vice President said that our planet that has sustained life for billions of years, would be able to do the same for many more millennia to come, only and only if we take good care of it. 

The Vice President expressed deep concern about unchecked and unbalanced development, rapid and wasteful extraction and consumption of natural resources, thoughtless waste disposal, excessive use of fossil fuels and rapid deforestation that are ravaging the planet. Dismayed, he added that the world had already lost 80% of its forests and that the air in our cities had become un-breathable. 

Pointing out the drastic increase in the number of natural disasters the nation has been facing in recent times due to environmental degradation and climate change, the Vice President proclaimed that, there is a great need to make sustainability the core of our development philosophy. He argued that development and environmental conservation were not mutually exclusive goals. 

The Vice President applauded India’s firm devotion to the cause of conservation and sustainable development, especially the gains made by the country in the field of renewable energy. He added that what India does can change the global conservation landscape at this point.

The Vice President expressed hope that RBS, who were primarily wealth managers would continue to contribute to the management of the enormous wealth that nature continuously provides humanity. 

Dr. Brij Gopal, Mr. Peera Ram Bishnoi, Mr. Devender Singh Chauhan, Ms. Rita Banerji, Mr. Abhilash Khandekar, Mr. Lalit Kumar Bora, Late Mr. S. Manikandan and the Special Task Force (Wildlife), Madhya Pradesh Forest Department were honored with the ‘Earth Heroes’ awards.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""It is a pleasure to be here today on this momentous occasion. I congratulate Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) for having instituted these novel awards which identify and honor outstanding individuals and institutions that have made significant contribution to protect and conserve the valuable resources of our planet.

I am glad to note that the RBS has initiated several projects for  communities who live inside or in the proximity of important forest and wetland ecosystems. Among their initiatives, one on Chilka lake has been recognized by the UN for using enterprise as a model for making the communities as stakeholders in the conservation of a globally important wetland ecosystem. 

In the ecologically important region between Kanha and Pench National Parks, RBS have joined hands with UN Climate Adaptation Fund and Government of Madhya Pradesh to restore the biodiversity of the region and to build the adaptive capacities of 175 villages.

I am told that RBS actively encourages its 15000 employees in India to undertake community development work. 

I compliment RBS on this outstanding display of commitment towards protecting the environment. 

My hearty congratulation to the winners of this year’s RBS Earth Heroes Awards. 

Your deeds, creativity and the energy are truly exemplary. I hope the excellent work done by you are shared widely so that they motivate many others to take better care of the environment.  

India has a great tradition of venerating nature as summed up in this popular verse from the Yajur Veda.

“Om dyauh śāntih, antariksam śāntih, prithvi śāntih, āpah śāntih, osadhayah śāntih” 

(Let there be peace in the skies, in the space, on the Earth, in the waters, and the herbs and trees.)

Peace comes through equilibrium and balance.  Ecology gets disturbed if there is reckless over-exploitation. 

In this context, we all should remind ourselves of the relevant observation of Mahatma Gandhi that the ‘earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s need but not every man’s greed.” This beautiful planet of ours, the Mother Earth, has sustained life for more than 4.5 billion years and will be able to sustain us for many more millennia if we are careful, if we are not excessively greedy. 

Friends, Nature has inexorable laws. If we have to survive we need nature to protect and nourish us. That is why the ancient sages have called earth as ‘Dharithri’ or the one who sustains us. We have to take care of it so that it takes care of us. 

Today we face threats to our survival as a planet on a scale that was never before anticipated. 

This beautiful, fertile, abundant planet of ours is at a great risk. Unchecked and unbalanced development, rapid and wasteful extraction and consumption of natural resources, thoughtless waste disposal, excessive use of fossil fuels and rapid deforestation are ravaging this planet.

It has been estimated that every year, we extract 55 billion tons of fossil fuels, minerals, metals and bio mass from the Earth. 

The world has already lost 80% of its forests. If the current rate of deforestation is kept up, 5-10% of tropical forest species will become extinct every decade. 

27% of our coral reefs which are critical ecosystems for the survival of hundreds of species, have been destroyed. 

Billions of plastic bags are made each year. Of these bags, one hundred billion are thrown away, with less than 1 percent finding their way into a recycle bin. 

The end result of this is around 1 billion birds and mammals dying each year by the ingestion of plastic.

The air in our cities have become un-breathable. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) global air pollution database released in Geneva, India has 14 out of the 15 most polluted cities in the world in terms of PM 2.5 concentrations.

9 out of 10 people in the world are said to breathe polluted air, suffering from serious health consequences. 

It is baffling, but it has been estimated that we are using up 50% more natural resources than the Earth can provide at this point. 

Here in our country we have been feeling the impact of environmental degradation and climate change with a steadily increasing frequency. 

The number of extreme weather events have gone up at an alarming pace, the recent floods in Kerala being a warning sign to us. 

The dangers are not limited to floods. Intense heat waves and cold waves have become a regular occurrence in India, killing thousands of people. Drought has damaged crops, causing starvation. 

Another concern for India is its depleting water resources, especially in urban centres.

Friends, There is a great need to rethink and redefine development. We need a paradigm that combines development with sustainability. 

It is time to take a stand. It is high time we took firm action.

We cannot compromise on development. 

But we can surely change the way that development is carried out. 

It is my firm belief that development and environmental conservation are not mutually exclusive goals. It is possible to achieve development while protecting the environment. 

It is heartening to note that India has already taken firm steps towards ensuring sustainable development. 

Our Prime Minister was recently presented with ‘the champions of the earth award’ by United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) for his unprecedented pledge to eliminate all the single-use plastic in India by 2022 and for his pioneering work in championing the International Solar Alliance. 

India has firmly stuck to its nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement of 33-35% reduction in emission intensity from 2005 levels and is setting an example to the world. 

India is on a mission to enhance its renewable energy capacity by 2022 to 227.6 GW. 

We are cleaning up our rivers and are deeply committed to afforestation. 

Swachh Bharat has also become a rallying call for a societal mission on cleanliness and hygienic and healthy lifestyle. 

It is said that we have not inherited the earth from our ancestors but have borrowed it from the next generation. 

We are creating our future today. 

I am happy that, we have this evening amongst us, a few such individuals who have shown how the future can be created in small but significant steps.  

I compliment each one of them on their efforts and achievements.  

We need more such heroes, more of such spirited individuals who care for the environment. 

Ours is a vast country with complex challenges but infinite opportunities.  

What we do in India can change the global landscape. 

We should join hands to make our country and our planet a more livable place. 

I am very pleased that Royal Bank of Scotland has taken this excellent initiative.  

It is my fervent hope that his ‘Bank’ that manages money and wealth will continue to contribute to the management of the enormous wealth that nature continuously provides humanity. 

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Ambition, Ability, Agility, Accountability and Achievement, are five important directions in which the country must move forward to reform our governance system cautioning officers not be complacent with current achievements.

 

Addressing the 64th Annual meeting of the General Body of Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA), as its President, the Vice President stressed the need to acquire skills to increase efficiency and effectiveness while implementing schemes. He tasked officers with an aim to take the benefits of the programmes to the needy, most vulnerable populations.

 

The Vice President said that the bottom line of a development programme is the impact on human lives, the transformation it brings in the dignity, capability and prosperity of each citizen. He said resource institutions like the IIPA must take lead in order to make a leap forward in the way we govern ourselves.

 

The Vice President called for setting up of realistic but ambitious goals to stand up to the aspirations of the 600 million young Indians. He called on the civil servants and administrators to make efforts to meet the challenges such as the urban rural divide, the gender divide, discrimination against women and social groups like Scheduled castes, pockets of poverty, malnutrition, illiteracy and etc.

 

There is a need to develop the ability to adapt, improvise, innovate to create programmes and strategies to make them effectively address the challenges.  We must be agile and pro-active, he added.

 

The Secretary to the Vice President, Dr. I.V. Subba Rao, the Chairman of IIPA, Shri T.N. Chaturvedi, the Vice President of IIPA, Shri Shekhar Dutt and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am happy to be with all of you at the 64th Annual meeting of the General Body of this Institute that has been striving to extend the frontiers of knowledge to improve governance in the country.

As the President of this historic Institute, I am happy to note that IIPA has been extending support to Government especially to the Ministries of Urban Affairs and Housing, Science and Technology, Electronics and IT, Panchayat Raj and Rural Development, Environment and Forests, Consumer Affairs, Public Enterprises and Health.

It is also heartening that IIPA is collaborating with Governments and institutes abroad in Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Japan, Germany, Netherlands, France and China.

I congratulate IIPA for its efforts to build a culture of excellence and to blend academic rigour with practical policy orientation.

Dear friends,

Our country has many strengths and competencies that can easily propel us into higher development trajectory. Our rich human resource is one of them. We have a strong steel frame in the shape of a competent civil service created by our constitution makers led by Sri Sardar Patel.

The civil service has the mandate to translate the policy intent of the legislature into implementable programmes. It has the duty to monitor and evaluate, suggest mid course corrections and ensure that the programmes yield the desired results. It has done so in quite a remarkable way over the last seventy years. 

Yet, there is so much more to be done.

There are so many gaps to be bridged, so many dots to be connected.

The rural-urban divide, the gender divide, discrimination against women and social groups like Scheduled castes, pockets of poverty, malnutrition, illiteracy, ill health persist.

Basic issues like sanitation, clean drinking water, clean environment and dependable power remain key challenges in many parts of our country.

While we have moved up the league table in making our business environment more investor- friendly, there is considerable room for improvement.

Dear friends,

India is at cusp of a major transformation. The economy is growing at rate much faster than many major economies of the world. The World Bank in its 2018 Report has noted that India’s GDP growth is projected to reach 6.7 percent in 2017-18 and accelerate to 7.3 percent and 7.5 percent in 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively. At the same time, there are challenges of translating economic growth into inclusive development.

We need a fresh look at the way we govern.

The Swarajya for our country was a hard earned outcome of a persistent struggle waged by countless patriotic women and men. It was led by men and women of rare vision, dedication and national pride.

Su-Rajya for our people is an equally challenging task that requires enlightened leadership at various levels, aware citizenry, a vibrant civil society, a robust institutional framework and a learning, forward looking governance structures.

Unlike Swarajya, where the goal post was clear and unmoving, Surajya has constantly moving goal posts. Good governance is a process that has no finality.  We have to keep improving upon the past accomplishments.

Dear friends,

The world is changing at an unprecedented pace and there is no option for us except to move with the times and, if possible, stay ahead of times by proactive action.

Clearly, this poses innumerable, complex challenges to those who are responsible for the governance of the country.

We cannot continue with the ‘business as usual’ approach.

Our systems have to be reformed, our mindsets have to be altered and the focus of our actions has to be clearer.

The governance ethos has to be radically different from what exists today.

I would suggest five important directions in which we should move forward to reform our governance system.

They are:  Ambition, Ability, Agility, Accountability and Achievement.

At the outset, we must set realistic but ambitious goals. This is especially necessary when we have an aspirational India driven by the dreams of 600 million young people. We should aim high and not be complacent with our current achievements.

Second, we must imbibe the skills required to increase our efficiency and effectiveness.  We must be competent practitioners with the state of the art knowledge drawn from good practices around the world. 

Third, we must have the ability to adapt, improvise, innovate to create programmes and strategies to make them effectively address the challenges.  We must be agile and pro-active. 

Fourth, we must constantly evaluate the successes and failures.  We must enhance the accountability through a culture of measurement and evaluation and improvement – oriented monitoring.

Fifth, we must focus on the ‘outcomes’ or actual results on ground. Very often, we lose sight of this important aspect. We do not carry our initiatives forward till results are achieved.

The journey from Swarajya to Surajya is an arduous one.  But it  is the duty of each one of us who share the fruits of a free India to make this mission possible.

I am glad that IIPA has planned, on my suggestion, a number of national Consultations with Central Ministries, State Governments, Universities, Civil Society and professional institutes besides industry associations and local peoples’ representatives to discuss the current status of some key governance issues and come up with solutions for the consideration of Central and State governments. We started with a national consultation on problems of implementing the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments in Hyderabad in March this year. We had the second National Consultation in June at Pune on ‘Making agriculture more profitable and sustainable’. Both these consultations were very well attended and generated a number of interesting ideas.

I request the IIPA to complete the process of obtaining further inputs from the state governments and take forward this series of National Consultations in the coming months. 

As I have said, there has to be a review of our governance structures. The change that Sardar Patel desired and Pandit Nehru, the first President of the IIPA Society dreamt of, is today a multi-dimensional challenge.

There has to be a change in the way we set goals, benchmarks and objectives. 

There has to be a change in the way we enhance our competence.  

There has to be change in the way we learn from the best practices around the world and adapt them to our changing socio-economic contexts. 

But beyond these changes, the big change that we should attempt is to focus on ‘results’.  

We should not merely look at the activities or the money being allocated and feel contented.

The development agenda is incomplete if we don’t achieve our goals, our mission objectives. 

The bottom line of a development programme is the impact on human lives, the transformation it brings in the dignity, capability and prosperity of each citizen. 

In order to make this leap forward in the way we govern ourselves, we need resource institutions like IIPA.

IIPA has a six decade long history of being a think tank but I suggest we look at the way we reposition it in the light of current and emerging challenges.  

The Chairman and Director can constitute a small task force to prepare an approach paper and then have wide ranging discussions with different stakeholders.  We have to come up with a sound strategy for institutional reform and make IIPA a fit organization to catalyze the new wave of governance reform. 

I am glad IIPA has a strong network of institutes at state and local levels as well as a growing number of distinguished alumni. I suggest that we should strengthen these networks and collaborations. The state governments must be brought on board and be active partners.  So also the local bodies in cities and rural areas.  Good governance must percolate down to the lowest level. It must become a way of life for institutions we have established for our country’s governance. 

I wish to see IIPA set new ambitious goals in the next few months, benchmarking itself against the best institutions with similar mandate around the globe. 

I am glad to honour 9 eminent administrative and managerial leaders who have distinguished themselves in their careers with the Paul H. Appleby Award.  

I do hope each one of you will be able to contribute to the new wave of governance reforms underway in our country and to the re-structuring of IIPA into a centre of excellence.  

Infact, the Director IIPA could get useful suggestions from eminent practitioners and academicians who have been given this award and complete the process of preparing a set of recommendations in about three months time. 

I am happy to be amidst this galaxy of prominent figures in the field of public administration.  I congratulate the Chairman, Vice Chairman and Director, IIPA on steering this institution so well.  I wish you a very exciting productive year ahead as you navigate through a complex but fascinating sea of reform and innovation. 

Thank you.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called the eminent Agricultural Scientist, Prof. M.S. Swaminathan is a Vishwa Guru in Agriculture, a teacher and a scholar who continues to leave his inspirational, ideational thought prints on the world. He was addressing the gathering after presenting the first World Agriculture Prize to Prof. M.S. Swaminathan, instituted by the Indian Council of Food and Agriculture, here today.

The Vice President said that Prof. Swaminathan ushered in green revolution and laid a firm foundation for India’s food security. His vision and lucidity of expression have captivated more than a whole generation of agricultural scientists, he said.

The Vice President called up on the policy makers to accord highest priority to agriculture as it provides employment to more than 50% of the population. He urged them to have positive bias towards agriculture and rural areas while allocating resources. 

We need to accord the most favoured status for agriculture to give impetus to the farmers and provide infrastructure, irrigation, investment, insurance and credit, the Vice President said.

Stressing the need to re-think the development paradigm and see how we can make agriculture more economically viable and attractive, Shri Naidu called for regular and effective coordination between scientists, policy makers and farmers to make it sustainable.

Concerned over the decrease in number of people engaged in agriculture, the Vice President called for concerted, coordinated action to address a number of issues that impact the growth of agriculture sector and the quality of life of people who depend primarily on this sector. 

Talking on the ill effects of climate Change, Shri Naidu said that it is impacting every aspect of life including agriculture and said asked scientists and policy makers to evolve strategies to cope with the changing climate, depleting resource base and increasing food demand.

“This calls for policy changes in agriculture sector. We should focus on developing climate resilient crops. We need to develop crops that can withstand extreme weather conditions,” he said.

The Vice President said that hidden hunger and nutritional deficiencies are major challenges before the world. He said that nothing short of an agricultural renaissance and an evergreen revolution with nutrition as the main component can make us realize this ambitious goal.

The World Agriculture Prize has been instituted by Indian Council of Food and Agriculture to recognise the contribution of eminent people who served the mankind though agriculture and allied services.

The Minister for Commerce and Industry, Shri Suresh Prabhu, the Governor of Kerala, Justice P. Sathasivam, the Minister for Agriculture, Haryana, Shri Om Prakash Dhankar and representatives of Indian Council of Agriculture and Research & Indian Council of Food and Agriculture and more than 200 farmers were present on this occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am extremely happy to participate in this event organized by Indian Council of Food and Agriculture to award the first World Agriculture Prize to Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, one of world’s most distinguished agricultural scientists.

I am glad that the World Agriculture Prize has been instituted to recognize outstanding achievements in the field of agriculture and related sectors.

It is indeed a great honour for me to present this award to the most well known agricultural scientist of modern India who ushered in green revolution and laid a firm foundation for India’s food security.  It is indeed our good fortune that Dr. Swaminathan, cast in the mould of ancient seers of India, continues to guide the country and the world towards an evergreen revolution and a world without hunger. 

His vision and his voice have inspired many scientists, policy planners and students to quest for excellence. 

His clarity of thought and lucidity of expression have captivated more than a whole generation of agricultural scientists.

He is truly in many ways,  a Vishwaguru, a teacher and a scholar who continues to leave his inspirational, ideational thought prints on the world.

I compliment the jury for selecting him for the first World Agriculture Prize.

Awards and Prizes are not new to Dr. Swaminathan.  He has won countless prizes and a number of awards.  The institutions that confer awards consider it a privilege he bestows on them that he accepts these awards.  Since he is an embodiment of knowledge and humility, these honours sit lightly on him. 

As you all are aware, Shri Swaminathan has pioneered the introduction of high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice seedlings in the fields of poor farmers, which led to steep increase in the food production in the country and paved the way to feed millions of people. 

His continuous efforts to introduce innovative lab-to-land agricultural practices have given us rich dividends. He played a key role in drawing the attention of the policymakers and agriculture scientists to protection and conservation of plant genetic resources that are crucial to maintain biodiversity. 

I fondly remember his statement at a conference in Washington where he had stated that the future belongs to the countries with grains, not guns. Shri Swaminthan has worked tirelessly to ensure that quality and affordable food is available to the poor and marginalized sections of the society.

Dear delegates,

In honouring Dr. Swaminathan, you are focusing on an important theme that is of great relevance to the world today.

When Dr. Swaminathan was asked as to what the motivation was for the green revolution, he said, “the motivation was a hunger free India – an India which will not go with the begging bowl, an India which will not go on with a ship to mouth existence.”

This award, therefore, is a recognition of his dedicated work in making India self-reliant in food production.

Today’s program is an occasion to reflect on the current challenges in sustaining agriculture production and move towards an “evergreen revolution”, as Dr. Swaminathan says, in which productivity is improved without ecological harm.

The agriculture sector needs a big push in India and in other parts of the world. It is obvious that a concerted, coordinated action is needed on a number of issues that impact the growth of agriculture sector and the quality of life of people who depend primarily on this sector.

In India, agriculture has traditionally played a vital role in economic development and continues to do so even till this day. Agriculture, along with fisheries and forestry, is one of the largest contributors to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

The current challenge is to make it more profitable and ecologically sustainable. Being the second largest country in the world in terms of agricultural output, India is poised to take the lead in reforming the sector.

Farming or Agriculture contributes about 16% of total GDP and employs nearly 50% of the total workforce in India. 

Given the nutritional deficiency in the population there is an increasing recognition today that food production has to be modified to achieve nutrition security. We should reshape the agri-food system to focus on nutrition as well.

Of late, agriculture has not been a vocation of choice, especially for the youth. The number of people engaged in agriculture as a percentage of total employment has been steadily going down all over the world. From 43% in 1991, it is now a mere 26% in 2017.  In India also, while nearly 64% of the total workforce was engaged in agriculture in 1991, it was down to 44% in 2017.

We need to re-think the development paradigm and see how we can make agriculture more economically viable and attractive.  I would like to quote Dr. Swaminathan who had said, in 2001, “Agricultural progress will determine India’s economic and political future.  We can shape this future in a desirable direction through synergy among technology, public policy and farmers’ cooperative action.  Unless farming becomes both intellectually stimulating through the pathway of I.T. based precision farming, and economically rewarding through value-addition to primary produce, it will be difficult to attract or retain youth in farming”.

Irrigation, infrastructure, investment and Insurance sectors need to be strengthened to support farmers.  We must achieve agricultural intensification and diversification.  Given the small size of land holdings, it is imperative that we should enhance our productivity and focus on “intensification”. Increased productivity is possible if farmers have greater access to knowledge, technology and credit.

It is important to establish coordination among agricultural research institutions, scientists and Krishi Vigyan Kendras to train and educate farmers. Techniques of precision farming, Zero budget farming must be made available to farmers.

Steps must be taken to effectively implement the 'National Agriculture Export Policy' formulated in line with the vision to double the farmers' income and increase the share of agricultural exports from the present level of about USD 30 billion to over USD 60 billion by 2022.

Here I would like to highlight the need to diversify our food production by moving away from mono cropping of major cereals to a system that integrates a variety of crops including small millets, pulses, fruits and vegetables.

Pulses cultivation will not only help in improving nutrient rich food production but also in restoring nutrient value to the soil.  On the economic side, it will reduce our import burden as nearly six million tonnes of pulses are being imported.

Dear friends,

We need a multi-pronged approach to address the complex interrelated issues in current agriculture scenario.

As I consider this the most crucial sector of India economy, I have initiated a National consultation on crucial issues.

We have successfully completed National consultation on making agriculture sustainable and profitable. A number of good ideas have emerged.  It is clear that the government will have to take the lead, as it is doing now, to take concerted action along with other partners and stakeholders to build a facilitative eco-system to revitalize this sector. Creating adequate warehousing, cold storage and food processing facilities, enhancing access to timely affordable credit, dependable power and water resources, good quality seeds and farm equipment can make a world of a difference. 

However, a major leap forward is possible only with diffusion of knowledge and skills, through technology – mediated agricultural practices.  This is going to be the game changer in the next few years.  More so in the context of climate change and environmental degradation.

Dear friends, Climate change is real and is impacting every aspect of our life. Its impact on bio diversity is visible. Changes in rainfall patterns, melting glaciers, heating up of soil and rising sea levels are having a profound impact on farming as well. 

We need to evolve strategies to cope with the changing climate, depleting resource base and increasing food demand.

This calls for policy changes in agriculture sector. We should focus on developing climate resilient crops. We need to develop crops that can withstand extreme weather conditions.

Water scarcity and falling water tables have been a key concern in recent years. Niti Aayog's recent analysis of water use and ranking of the states on a composite water management index (CWMI) highlights the need to adopt agricultural practices that make optimum use of water.

Although, successive Governments have accorded priority to agriculture right from independence, there are quite a few challenges that need urgent attention and action. It is time for all us to get our act together. The Parliament, all political parties, media and scientists should focus on an integrated approach to agriculture sector and look at productivity as well as the returns on investment. .

I believe, you have a dedicated session today to discuss the aspects and impacts of climate change and food security. I hope this august gathering will come out with new ideas to create a new momentum towards sustainable and profitable agriculture.

Of course, concomitantly, one has to look at other factors that impact agriculture like unchecked population growth and unsustainable consumption of scarce natural resources.

The world community has committed to 17 sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030. Goal 2 is to “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.

Nothing short of an agricultural renaissance and an evergreen revolution with nutrition as the main component can make us realize this ambitious goal.

Nourishing the 815 million people who are hungry today and many millions of children who are stunted due to malnutrition are real challenges before all of us.

I am sure visionary activists like Dr. Swaminathan will provide the illumination of possible pathways we can achieve the zero-hunger goal.

I wish you all have a productive session in which you share ideas that could transform our world and the world of our farmers for the better.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M.

He was interacting with the Students of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, in Hyderabad today. The Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Mohammad Mahmood Ali and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has played a pivotal role in the education scenario of this country since its inception in 1938. He further said that the young Students would soon be called upon to be leaders of India’s journey towards development. You should prepare yourself; equip yourself starting today, so that you will be ready when called upon to be leaders of a resurgent India, he added.

Saying that it is important to learn from books, the Vice President said that it is good to know facts and understand theories, but it is more important to be able to understand concepts and to gauge their practical applications. It is important to learn to do things, to develop practical and pragmatic wisdom, he added.

The Vice President said that whole examinations should be based on measuring the child’s capacity simply to question the things around him or her. This will encourage young people to never be content with the status quo and help to make change a relatively easy process, he said.

The Vice President urged the young students to never let their marks define or restrict them in any way. You are much more than the numbers on your report card, he added.

The President opined that education imparted should be all encompassing, comprehensive and holistic. He further said that only half the school time should be spent in classrooms learning, the other half should be spent in playgrounds and in nature. Some of life’s crucial lessons are learnt by the children from playgrounds, such as sportsmanship, empathy and teamwork, he added.

Along with physical fitness schools should also encourage other extracurricular activities, the Vice President said. Love for the fine arts and interest in literary activities should also be inculcated in children, they teach children the art of living and working together, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

"" It is a great pleasure to be amongst you today in this great temple of learning and to interact with the young crowd. I have always believed that India’s leaders are born in classrooms and that the teachers of this country play a tremendous role in moulding these leaders. I understand that Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan has played a pivotal role in the education scenario of this country since its inception in 1938.

The founder of this institution, Kanhaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, was a multifaceted personality, a man of great ideas. He was a learned barrister, a great statesman, a committed social reformer, an intelligent educationist and a motivated leader. He took great pride the cultural, intellectual and spiritual heritage of India. He was an accomplished lawyer with a flourishing practice, which he readily gave up to join the cause of freedom for his motherland.  Munshi Ji’s life is a testament to the fact that a man with pride in the past could also have faith in the future. Today when the world is so conscious of conserving and protecting the environment we live in, it is heartening to note that as much as half a century ago, Munshi Ji pioneered the Vanamahotsava scheme to create enthusiasm among masses for forest conservation and planting trees. It is now a celebrated as a week-long festival in India.

Munshi ji’s vision for the future of this country was as deep as it was vast. Dear children, you are indeed lucky to be in this institution, you are the inheritors of this great man’s legacy. Always keep his life, his struggles and his vision in mind. Let his teachings help you set goals and priorities and guide you forward in life.

This is a very exciting time for India. We are a young nation. 65% of our population is below 35 years of age. Indian economy, growing at around 8%, currently is one of the fastest growing major economies of the world. We in India, are committed to build a five trillion-dollar economy by 2025, making India the 3rd largest consumer market in the world. India is surging forward to achieve sustainable and inclusive development. The achievement of this lucrative goal is not one person’s job. It is up to ‘team India’, it is up to each one of us to work to make this dream a reality. More importantly, you my dear young friends would soon be called upon to be leaders of India’s journey towards development. You should prepare yourself; equip yourself starting today, so that you will be ready when called upon to be leaders of a resurgent India.

Do not be under the impression that grand gestures are expected from you at this point. Even something that might look trivial to you, like turning a leaking tap off or planting a tree or helping your friend understand a Mathematics problem or sharing your food with a hungry person, are acts of leadership, courage and kindness. All these small acts have great positive repercussions, multiplier effects in the universe. Every such small act changes you for the better and cumulatively, over a period of time, brings out the best in you.

Dear students, it is important that you learn from books. It is good to know facts and understand theories. But it is more important to be able to understand concepts and to gauge their practical applications. It is important to learn to do things, to develop practical and pragmatic wisdom. It is more important to ask questions. I feel that whole examinations should be based on measuring the child’s capacity simply to question the things around him or her.  This will encourage young people to never be content with the status quo and help to make change a relatively easy process.

Albert Einstein once remarked that education is not the learning of facts, but the training of minds to think. Today’s education, unfortunately is all about cramming facts and reproducing them in answer papers with the result that very often the critical thinking faculties, the logical reasoning capacities of the children are not allowed to grow and flourish. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam once said that some of the best minds of this country can be found in the back benches of classrooms! I urge my dear young friends to never let your marks define or restrict you in any way. You are much more than the numbers on your report card.

Dear teachers, it is time for us to re-imagine and re-invent the entire education system, the curriculum, teacher training and management, conception of physical resources, system of assessment, administrative and governance culture, leadership, and more. We know that schools play a significant role in the life of children, beyond knowledge acquisition, even if they do so unwittingly. Every child is different and unique and have capabilities that are poles apart. Our education system is a failure if it is unable to understand this basic fact, if it fails to understand what is special about each child and fails to nurture those special capabilities. It is often said that if we keep judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life thinking that it is a failure even if it has within it the power to swim across great oceans.

Heavy school bags with thick books are not what should dictate a child’s education. It is the school’s responsibility to prepare the child in the best possible way to face the world. The education imparted should be all encompassing, comprehensive and holistic. I always believed that only half the school time should be spent in classrooms learning, the other half should be spent in playgrounds and in nature. Some of life’s crucial lessons are learnt by the children from playgrounds, such as sportsmanship, empathy and teamwork. Along with developing their physical abilities like coordination, balance and strength, children build relationships and practice communication and social interactions and engage in valuable impromptu learning on the play field. Unfortunately, very less emphasis is placed on Physical education, sports and games in the current education system and that should be changed. Teachers should understand that playing games is just not about fun but is an important facet of learning.

Along with physical fitness schools should also encourage other extracurricular activities. Love for the fine arts and interest in literary activities should also be inculcated in children, they teach children the art of living and working together. They inspire aesthetic development, character building, spiritual and moral growth, creativity, out of the box thinking and build pride in the traditional and cultural legacies of our diverse country. In a sense, exposing children to arts and culture from across the world truly helps to mould them into cosmopolitan citizens of the globe.

Ample research studies have established that children who take an interest in extracurricular activities tend to lead a more healthy and active life and have greater confidence and higher self esteem. Emphasis should also be placed on undertaking voluntary work. It could be organizing cleanliness drives or undertaking social work or community development activities. Children should not be shielded from the problems of the society, instead they should be encouraged to participate in problem solving. This would be an invaluable learning experience for them. I always maintain that it should be mandatory for students to serve in organizations like the scouts and guides or NSS along with their academic pursuits. An exposure to the working of armed forces would also inculcate great discipline and sense of patriotism and duty in them.

Dear teachers, today, the world is truly a global village. Information technology is being exceedingly used in the field of education. Smart Classrooms are becoming the norm rather than the exception. Very soon, learning would move online in India, with even on-campus programs having a significant online component. Students would have the opportunity of interacting with the best minds across the globe, not just India through live video conferencing facilities, applications and collaborative IT tools. I urge the teachers to make the best possible use of everything that technology has to offer.

There is no stopping the IT revolution, it is here and it is here to stay. There is an information overload, a sensory surplus on children. They are exposed to a variety of things through a multitude of channels, all of which are not good. Very little external filtering of such humungous amounts of data is possible. Instead, we should sensitize our children so that they are capable of self regulation and self filtering, so that they choose to expose themselves only to things that enhance their capacities and help them develop as individuals. We have seen the havoc played by unscrupulous internet predatory sites such as the ‘Blue Whale’. It is upto us to empower our children so that they develop the maturity to say no to such exploitative and inhuman tendencies online.

This generation has grown up with smart gadgets, to them they are natural extensions of life. I request the children to not get addicted to smart phones and computers. They force you to be sedentary and cause several problems from sleeplessness to Stress, anxiety, depression, delinquency and aggressiveness. You should use technology, it should not be the other way round, technology should not be using you. I cannot stress enough on the need to spend more time with your parents, your grand parents and family members. They will teach you much more about life than internet ever will. Make real friends in the real world and not virtual friends on social networking sites. Always be careful to retain human connections. 
I wish Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan all the very best for a bright future. I hope that you pioneer the much needed change in today’s educational system and bring forth responsible citizens of unquestionable integrity and impeccable moral standing. Let us together build a more compassionate world.

Thank You

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that value addition for agricultural production is one of the solutions for improving farmers' income. He was addressing the inaugural session of the International Conference 'AFITA/WCCA2018' on Research Frontiers in Precision Agriculture, jointly organized by Asia-Pacific Federation for Information Technology in Agriculture, International Network for Information Technology in Agriculture and Indian Society for Agricultural Information Technology, in Mumbai today.

The Vice President said that farming community needs to diversify and take up allied activities like fisheries, dairy and poultry as well to supplement on-farm incomes.

Expressing concern over the increasing urban rural divide, the Vice President said that such divide would consolidate majority population in urban areas only. He suggested developing Smart Villages along with Smart Cities with a greater focus on technological innovations in agriculture.

The Vice President said that we need smart farmers who absorb new knowledge and skills.  Technology cannot be confined to urban areas and it must spread quickly to the rural population and enable farmers to harness its potential. It must be remembered that, agricultural renaissance can take shape only on a strong digital foundation, he added.

The Vice President said that India’s digital revolution must be expanded to rural areas enabling the population to adopt use of digital tools. He suggested taking the leap forward in agricultural productivity using digital applications and technological innovations, he said.

The Vice President opined that adopting state of the art technology can help in sustaining food security and enhanced livelihood opportunities. He said that transformation in agriculture can come not merely from the government cooperation but from a wide range of individuals and institutions such as Krishi Vigyan Kendras, Agriculture research centers and scientists. He stressed the need to transfer knowledge and technology to farmers so that they put it into practice.

The Governor of Maharashtra, Shri C. Vidyasagar Rao, the Minister for School Education, Sports and Youth Welfare, Higher and Technical Education, Maharashtra, Shri Vinod Tawde and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It gives me immense pleasure to share my views on agriculture in general and precision agriculture in particular at this international conference on research frontiers in precision agriculture. 

I am delighted to learn that this conference is organized as a part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of IIT Bombay.  

It is a unique event which brings on to a single forum two different international entities -- AFITA (Asia-Pacific Federation for Information Technology in Agriculture) and INFITA (International Network for Information Technology in Agriculture) and our own INSAIT (Indian Society for Agricultural Information Technology).

I am happy to note that CSRE (Centre of Studies in Resources Engineering) of IIT Bombay, which deals with geo-spatial information and communication technologies (Geo-ICTs) in natural resources management, is hosting the conference. 

As you all are aware, agriculture plays an important role in the Indian economy, both in terms of its contribution to GDP as well as employment. Although, India is among the biggest producers of pulses, rice, wheat, spices and spice products, Indian agriculture’s operational efficiency has to be further enhanced. 

Although, nearly half of India’s population depends on agriculture for livelihood, the agriculture sector contributes less than a fifth of India’s GDP (approximately 18%). And this fact matters a lot in a country with a population of about 1.3 billion. This means that there is considerable scope for further improvement in productivity and efficiency. 

These improvements can be triggered and sustained only by harnessing the potential of the latest technological advances. 

I am glad that these national and international forums are focusing on the much-needed technological advances and creating awareness about them. 

Conventional, traditional Indian agriculture has been greatly influenced by the monsoon conditions and, as a result, until the late 1970s, India had relatively low economic growth rates - around 3.5 percent per annum with large fluctuations due to frequent floods and famines. 

However, we have made significant progress as well. The Green Revolution ushered in a new era with the adoption of modern methods and technology, including high yielding variety (HYV) seeds (particularly wheat), tractors and pump sets. Initiated by Dr Norman Borlaug and Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, these changes resulted in the rate of growth of agricultural productivity increasing rapidly. 

A major problem in India is the fragmentation of land holdings and the large number of small farmers. 

As farmers’ landholding sizes declined significantly, it has become necessary to intensify the cultivation practices and cultivate more crop per drop. 

We are now witnessing the 2nd Green Revolution, in which Precision Agriculture has emerged as an extremely vital strategy. Precision irrigation, precision protection and greenhouse technology are now gaining ground. 

Precision agriculture seeks to make agriculture remunerative even to small and marginal farmers by reducing the cost of cultivation and enhancing yields. 

Agriculture production has gone up. So has horticulture production which touched 305 million tonnes this year. Two very prominent programmes which brought about substantial changes in Indian agriculture are the introduction of Special Foodgrains Production Programme (SFPP) and the Special Rice Production Programme (SRPP). I am happy to know that ICAR is playing a vital role in revitalizing the agriculture sector.

The primary limiting factor in agricultural production, however, has been the scarce resources. A farmer’s landholding size is reducing with increased population and water resources are becoming scarce. The yields have been getting affected in a cyclical fashion due to the impact of climate change and the resultant droughts and floods. 

Sisters and Brothers, 

The entire farming sector needs a new orientation. We need precision in targeting our efforts. 

Precision Agriculture or site specific crop management is therefore the key to optimally manage the resources for a better yield, reducing pollution and saving environment. 

With a majority of farmers-around 80 per cent belonging to the small and marginal category - it is extremely vital that they derive adequate income from agriculture.  Farmer’s welfare is essential for the overall growth of the Indian economy. For this to happen, we have to use the power of technology. The Indian farmer should be able to use new tools, new gadgets and make farming more cost effective. 

As you all are aware, satellite technology and GIS can play a crucial role in improving agricultural production. Ultimately, technological tools can help in providing farmers with vital information relating to weather and marketing, which are the two most important factors in ensuring enhanced incomes to farmers. 

I am happy to know that mobile apps are being used to provide farmers with weather information and provide early warning. Research by an organization involved in precision agriculture has showed that mobile-based agricultural extension system among farmers in Gujarat had resulted in increase in each farmer getting Rs.7,000 more per year, while the yields went up by 8.6 per cent for cotton and 28 per cent for cumin.

Precision Agriculture is a concept which needs implementation through ICTs, Wireless Sensor Networks, Geospatial methods and automated positioning systems. I am told that in recent times even drones have provided very good solutions to precision farming with very fine resolution images. 

All these technologies facilitate to give each plant exactly what it needs to grow optimally, with the aim to improve the agronomic output while reducing the input. This means producing ‘more with less’, which coincides with our 2nd Green Revolution concept of ‘more crop per drop’.

As you all are aware, there is a need to increase output per hectare in India as it is low compared to other countries. One of the reasons for the low output is lack of access to modern technology. There is a need for judicious use of water, energy and efficient use of various inputs like seeds to enhance productivity.

As India takes rapid strides to enhance access to digital tools, it is an opportune moment to think of ways in which the rural areas and farmers can benefit from the digital revolution.  The next big step we have to take is to link the leap forward in agricultural productivity with digital applications and technological innovations. 

I am happy to note that the aim of this Conference is to provide digital solutions for agriculture through ICTs, sensor networks, image processing techniques, geospatial technologies, robotics and farm machinery. 

Almost every country has realized the significance of technology in agriculture and they have dedicated societies which systematically work for its implementation. AFITA is a federation of such societies from the Asia-Pacific region viz. India, Japan, China, Indonesia, Thailand, Australia, etc. 

I am glad that AFITA, since its inception in January 1998 in Wakayama City, Japan, as an autonomous non-governmental forum is promoting the use of information technology in the improvement of all aspects of the agriculture sector. 

In order to make agriculture sustainable and profitable, the Government has initiated several programmes. Some of the schemes like PMKSY’s (Per Drop More Crop) in fact involve Precision Agriculture practices. 

The need of the hour is to adopt state of the art technology to make agriculture sustainable and profitable. 

I am sure the adoption of technology will help in sustaining food security and enhanced livelihood opportunities. In addition, the farming community needs to diversify and take up allied activities like fisheries, dairy and poultry as well to supplement on-farm incomes. 

What we need is a transformative approach to agriculture. 

This transformation can come not merely from the government but from a wide range of individuals and institutions. 

In addition to the missions launched by the government, I am pleased that a number of entrepreneurs have launched start-ups for agricultural development. A number of academic institutions like IIT-Mumbai are engaged in trying out new solutions powered by technology.

I am happy that the Digital India and Make in India programmes cover around 25 sectors of Indian economy including agriculture. With a number of platforms for conducting large experiments and using robots and wireless sensor networks, the benefits of digital smart farming are already being realized.

For example, drone technology is being used in quantifying the field status and crop damages. The objective of these initiatives has been to ensure holistic development of rural India. 

We cannot afford to have a huge rural-urban divide any longer. Technology cannot be confined to urban areas. It must spread quickly to the rural population and enable farmers to harness its potential. 

Agricultural renaissance can take shape only on a strong digital foundation. 

Smart Villages must be built along with Smart Cities. We need smart farmers who absorb new knowledge and skills.  We need a greater focus on technological innovations in agriculture.

I congratulate the organizers of this conference for making a good beginning in that direction.

My best wishes for your continued efforts to transform the lives of farmers in India and the world.

He was addressing the Maritime Conference SAGAR Discourse 2.0, organized by Forum for Integrated National Security, in Panaji, Goa today.

The Vice President stressed on the need to update technical capabilities, to ensure national security and said that security threats like cross border terrorism, ecological vulnerability and environmental deterioration are not limited to one country and they require a united response from the global community. Such problems have no boundaries and stress the need to use scientific prowess to find solutions, he added.

The Vice President said that India as a responsible power has always collaborated with other nations on space issues. He cautioned the scientific community to beware of the threats to space systems from debris and other irresponsible activities are adding to the complexity. We all need to be concerned with the pursuit of weapons systems capable of destroying satellites in orbit, he added.

Calling for International efforts to focus on the likely global consequences of conflict in space domain, the Vice President said that such conflicts might not be limited to just a few countries but could extend to all spacefarers and the entire globe.

The Vice President said that India must intensify relations with traditional partners and establish new ties with other nations to promote peaceful use of outer space. The activities include carrying out joint activities of mutual interest, sharing expertise in applications of space technology and participating in international events dealing with space, he added.

The Governor of Goa, Smt. Mridula Sinha, the Minister for Panchayat, Goa, Shri Mauvin Godinho, the former Chairman of ISRO, Dr. Kiran Kumar, the Convener of SAGAR Discourse, Dr. Prabhakaran Paleri and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am extremely happy to inaugurate - SAGAR Discourse 2.0 which focuses on space domain.

I am delighted to know that last year’s Maritime Conference saw the participation of delegates from 22 countries, including senior ministers, diplomats and practitioners. I am told that the extracts of that conference in the form of actionable inputs were sent to respective ministries for implementation.

It is very apt that Forum for Integrated National Security has chosen Goa for this meet. It is the place where core Indian values have merged with international culture. Goa is the place where tourists and the visitors from all over the world come and experience the colours and the vibrant culture of India.

This is the State where one finds some of the oldest places of worship of different religions as also the state of the art institutions of science and technology. Goa truly is a melting pot! This State also has a well-groomed hospitality culture. I am sure the delegates would enjoy their stay here.

The term SAGAR - coined by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji, means Security And Growth for All in the Region. This thought I am sure will find its true expression here. This is the region which has some of the fastest growing economies, abundant natural resources, young and vibrant population and some of the brightest scientists and technologists.

At the same time, this region also faces security threats like cross border terrorism, apart from population explosion, ecological vulnerability and environmental deterioration. These problems have no boundaries and the solutions need also be borderless.

I am sure, the agenda for this discourse will address various problems confronting the region. We need to collaborate and make optimal use of the scientific prowess available in the region to find solutions. Unless we address these problems urgently the future of humanity would be uncertain.

Under the leadership of Shri Narendra Modiji, India is committed to address these global issues and take a leading role as a responsible power.

The borderless problems as stated earlier require seamless solutions and I am sure that space-related technologies will play an important role in providing us with the wherewithal to improve the lot of humanity.

As you all are aware, the concept of space is not new to India. In fifth-sixth century, Aryabhata represented the pinnacle of space knowledge at that time. In 1975, India launched the first satellite by the same name. Later, we had a successful Mars mission and our space scientists are now poised to launch a mission to send man to space.

Dear brothers and sisters,

India as a responsible power has always collaborated with other nations on space issues. As such, the outer space environment is very complex with over 80 nations and numerous government consortia, scientific and commercial firms accessing and operating satellites for countless economic, scientific, educational and social missions.

 At the same time, threats to space systems from debris and other irresponsible activities are adding to the complexity. We all need to be concerned with the pursuit of weapons systems capable of destroying satellites in orbit.

Competitive approach and the important role played by space technologies in improving economies and in providing national security have heightened international community’s interest in space security. Diplomatic engagement coupled with scientific cooperation will help in finding common solutions to the challenges we face in relation to the outer space environment.

International efforts need to focus on the likely global consequences of conflict in space domain. Such conflicts might not be limited to just a few countries but could extend to all spacefarers and the entire globe.

For India, international co-operation in space sector is aimed at intensifying relations with traditional partners and establishing new ties with other nations for promoting peaceful use of outer space.  The activities include carrying out joint activities of mutual interest, sharing expertise in applications of space technology and participating in international events dealing with space.

Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is involved in space co-operation with the space agencies of over 40 nations and four multi-national bodies.

The international cooperation for exploitation of space covers various aspects, including launch, satellite and ground segments. Although, cooperation with most nations is on commercial basis, it also provides an opportunity to engage with global south.

As part of the neighbourhood first policy, the Prime-Minister had mooted the idea of SAARC Satellite. This is to provide Communication and Meteorology support from geosynchronous orbit to serve the needs of SAARC member nations.

India belives in the philosophy of share and care. We espouse the idea  of “ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”. Co-operation among the space-faring nations in international disaster management has been a long-standing tradition and India has been an active participant of various such forums such as the Sentinel Asia program-- an international collaboration among space agencies, disaster management agencies to apply remote sensing and Web-GIS technologies to support disaster management in Asia-Pacific region and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.

Last year ISRO had facilitated data request for 16 disasters in nine nations in the Indo-Pacific region. India has also been at the forefront of search and rescue operations and is active in ASEAN Space Co-operation projects.

In the wake of the successful launch of Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan, India is pursuing Human Space Flight programme.

Dear brothers and sisters, the world is facing many challenges from security to climate change. Burgeoning population also continues to put burden on the resources available. Along with the population controlling measures, all the space-faring nations need to step up collaboration on a range of issues like tackling poverty and hunger, improving crop yields, developing drought-resilient crops, predicting floods, drought and other extreme weather patterns more accurately, among others.

Crowding of low earth orbit, mitigation of space debris, development of capacity in space situational awareness and advancement of International space laws for activities such as space mining and tourism need multipronged efforts at various levels.

India would be looking at the space co-operation at three levels—governmental, scientific-technological and private sector commercial level.

I am sure this august gathering would address all the relevant issues and come up with concrete recommendations for the urgent consideration of International community 

On behalf of the government of India, I assure all the co-operation and declare open the conference.

Thank you.

Jaihind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Girls’ education should be the centre of women empowerment. Addressing the 13th convocation of Jamia Hamdard University, here today, he stressed the need to empower students, especially girls by providing skills, apart from academic excellence to compete in global job market.

The Vice President said that universities, institutions and public places to use solar energy and promote rain water harvesting methods. He said that educational institutions such as colleges and schools must encourage students to develop affinity towards environment protection and teach them to live with nature.

The Vice President spoke about the importance of education at length and said that it should not be confined to getting just degrees. Education is not just for employment, it must empower the individual and help in economic uplift, he added.

The Vice President appreciated the efforts of Jamia Hamdard Management and faculty for having almost 50% ennoblement of female students in its Hamdard programs and said that educating girls of all sections of society is key factor in overall development of the nation.

There is nothing more important than educating women - it is the one sure shot, consistent gauge of progress for practically every development indicator, from mortality declines to economic growth, democracy and justice, he said.

The Vice President said that a tremendous opportunity for progress lies in women’s education and empowerment adding that programs like ‘Beti Bachao – Beti Padhao’, ‘Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana’ etc have been proven to be ‘game changers’ and have inspired people to campaign for the cause of the girl child.

Talking about the ill effects of changing life styles, the Vice President cautioned the students to not let technology and gadgets overtake people and relationships.

He has also advised students in the medical profession to respond sensibly, sensitively, reservedly and mildly to people who consult to them suffering from ailments of the mind, body and spirit. Always be kind, for there is no virtue like kindness, he said.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""It is my great honour to be a part of this prestigious institution’s 13th Convocation. Today, the graduating students who have been conferred degrees, shall join a large and prominent group of global alumni of Jamia Hamdard based all across the globe. They should all be proud to be in the league of some eminent alumni who have made their mark in whichever field they chose to excel in.

Jamia Hamdard is a unique institution conceived and built single- handedly by its decorated Founder. It has achieved tremendous respect among the public and among all stakeholders. I am pleased to learn that in a short span of 30 years, it has created a niche for itself. The Founder of the University Hakeem Abdul Hameed, who decided to stay in India during the turbulent days of the partition, nurtured the noble dream of building a University where higher education could be imparted to students from all sections of the society. His dream was a testament to his great patriotism and commitment to the nation and its people. He started his educational mission by establishing colleges imparting higher education in the fields of Pharmacy, Unani Medicine and Nursing. These colleges and other institutions were then amalgamated into a single unit within a University. The University was granted status of Deemed to be University as ‘Jamia Hamdard’ in the year 1989.

Jamia Hamdard currently houses one of the pioneering Colleges in the field of Nursing education. I understand that there is a tough competition happening to obtain a seat in the prestigious Rufaida College of Nursing at Jamia Hamdard. I understand that Graduates and teachers of the Nursing College of Jamia Hamdard have won global recognitions for their committed service.

Apart from nursing, Hakeem Sahib wanted to create educational avenues for girls in all disciplines. This has resulted in an exponential increase in girl student enrolment in Jamia Hamdard. It is extremely heartening to note that Hamdard currently has enrolment of almost 50% female students in its Hamdard programs. Educating girls of all sections of society, has been an area of great priority for the current government. There is nothing more important than educating women- it is the one sure shot, consistent gauge of progress for practically every development indicator, from mortality declines to economic growth, democracy and justice. It is a matter of great concern that in India the average female literacy rate is 65.46%, while the world average female literacy rate is 79.7%.

The World Bank estimates female labour force participation in the market at 31.2 percent in India and says that more than 50 million young women in India neither study nor work. The numbers are appalling. It is also calculated that one percentage point increase in female education raises the average gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.3 percentage points and raises annual GDP growth rates by 0.2 percentage points. A study in 2015 found that India could increase its GDP by 16-60% by 2025 by simply enabling women to participate in the economy at par with men. A tremendous opportunity for progress lies in women’s education and empowerment. Programs like ‘Beti Bachao – Beti Padhao’, ‘Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana’ etc have been proven to be ‘game changers’ and have inspired people to campaign for the cause of the girl child.

Like ‘Swachh Bharat’ became a mass movement, empowering the girl child should also become a mass movement, a cause close to the hearts of every Indian. It is upto institutions like this university to educate more women and inspire them to become a productive part of the work force which would soon become India’s claim to fame, given its huge youth population.

I am being told that the rain water harvesting system at Jamia Hamdard is considered as a model for emulation by many. It reflects the commitment of this University towards protect the environment. Water is the most important natural resource without which life is simply not possible, it is the very basis of life. Rain water harvesting helps in mitigating the inadequacy of surface water and in recharging ground water levels. It is encouraging to note that Jamia Hardard is not only teaching its students the importance of conserving every drop of water, but also practicing it effectively, thereby acting as a role model in this respect to all other educational institutions.

I am happy to know that Jamia Hamdard has reached high levels of excellence, particularly in the field of Pharmacy. But there is a need to further expand our research and development to produce new and better quality medicines and to tighten our drug testing and experiment protocols.

It is heartening to note that Jamia Hamdard is perhaps one of the few Universities where education and research are conducted both in modern medicine as well as traditional medicine, all within one campus. Convergence of modern and traditional knowledge and thoughts are important for the growth of our country where these practices have co-existed for centuries. India has a great potential to assimilate different thoughts and knowledge and this ‘Sangam’ is very prominently showcased in case of ‘Ayurveda’ and ‘Unani’ which are two systems of medicine having a lot of similarities but with certain differences. Unani medicine is one of components of AYUSH. AYUSH medicines have great potential as they are considered safe and nature inspired. The Government is promoting AYUSH in a big way, an independent Ministry has been created to deal specifically with issues related to AYUSH medications. Keeping both physical and mental wellness of people in mind, the Government has been promoting holistic health practices like Yoga.  Yoga Day, which falls on 21st June is now a much celebrated event in India and all over the world.

While promoting traditional, natural systems of medicine, an attempt should also be made to prove the efficacy of these systems using globally established experimentation protocols. There can be no place better than Jamia Hamdard for such a convergence where traditional medicine can be validated and standardized using modern tools and techniques of pharmacy, biochemistry, toxicology and clinical practices. It is heartening to note that all the necessary infrastructure for such studies is currently available on the Jamia Hamdard campus. I urge the students and researchers to exploit this unique opportunity of learning and expand their horizon of knowledge and experience. It would be a great service to mankind if the boundless knowledge and wisdom that our traditional medical systems possess can be meticulously validated and documented for the posterity.   

Friends, India is now on the verge of a demographic dividend. 65% of India’s population is under 35 years of age. There is a huge potential for growth and development within India’s young human resource. But for the youth of India to be a productive workforce, quality education and excellent skill development practices are a necessary precondition. The Government has initiated many steps to bring quality to educational institutions. NIRF which was launched in 2016 is now a globally recognized ranking system. Each year, several higher education institutions are coming forward to receive evaluations and feedback and work towards achieving best possible rankings for their facilities and resources. Both parents and prospective students are also more conscious about ranking and rating of the institutions. Greater awareness among the general population will help eliminate existence of institutions which use false information to attract students.

Some other initiatives of Government such as the National Academic Depository (NAD) have had a tremendous impact in the life of students. Now students do not need to visit their Universities to get their degrees and awards verified. Students can now go online, and with a click of button through the NAD portal, their degree and award can be verified. In addition, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and E-pathshala are other programmes which have further created different benefit of students. 

Dear Graduates, today is a very important day for you, for this academic institution and for your parents and loved ones. May this day serve as a turning point in your lives. You are moving away from the protected environment of your university and from the circle of love cast around you by the constant presence of your parents. You are moving into a world where you have to find your own footing, write your own story and fight your own battles. The institution can only do so much, it can only prepare you to fight. But it is your hands that have to wield the sword and carry the shield, it is your mind that has to strategise and it is your moral compass that has to lead you forward. Dedicate your lives to improving the plight of the less fortunate around you. Do not let technology and gadgets overtake people and relationships, especially those in the medical profession. Always respond sensibly, sensitively, reservedly and mildly to people who come to you suffering from ailments of the mind, body and spirit. Always be kind, for there is no virtue like kindness. 

Tomorrow you would step out of the hallowed portals of this institution and join the mission of nation building. A great responsibility rests upon your shoulders. Our nation faces a number of challenges from crippling poverty to violence to discrimination and illiteracy to environmental degradation. It is upto you to combat these great challenges of our times. The faith of the nation rests upon you. Every one of you is worthy of that faith. This nation needs able, visionary leaders. When you choose your leaders make sure that they possess 4 Cs, Character, Calibre, Capacity and Conduct. Unfortunately, 3 other Cs are assuming great importance today, Caste, Community and Cash. I hope that each one of you will be leaders of impeccable character, boundless calibre, great capacity and spotless conduct. I hope that you live upto the great expectations that the nation has about you. 

The world is now truly a global village and you are all ready to take a global journey. Each step you take in the right direction will make you, your family, and your nation proud. The University expects you to remain worthy of the degree that is being conferred upon you today, forever and become ambassadors of your alma mater.

Congratulations! And my best wishes for your continued success and a bright career ahead!

 

Jai Hind!""

                “Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri was an exemplary leader, his humility, courage, determination, integrity and moral uprightness were legendary”, the Vice President of India Shri. M. Venkaiah Naidu said today. He was addressing the gathering at the presentation ceremony of the 19th Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award for Excellence in Public Administration to Shri. Fali S Nariman, here today.

Citing the major mile stones of Shastri Ji’s life, from his active participation in the freedom struggle to his adorning the post of the Prime Minister of the country, the Vice President lauded his leadership style and the great acceptance he had among the people of India. Shri Naidu spoke of the various portfolios held by Shastri Ji in the Union Ministry from Railways to Communication to Industry. He recalled the time when Shastri Ji had resigned from his post as the railway Minister taking moral responsibility for a train accident. He added that this gesture spoke volumes about his integrity and moral standing and set new standards in constitutional propriety.

The Vice President remarked that Shastri Ji had great clarity of his vision and even greater conviction in the capacity of his beloved nation to beat all odds and survive. He observed that Shastri Ji’s 19 Month long Prime Minister-ship was quit eventful and described his various achievements from promoting Green and White Revolution to steering India successfully during the turbulent times of the India-Pak war of 1965.

The Vice President said that beneath a gentle and soft exterior, Shastri Ji carried an iron clad will power and added that Courage and humility are more complementary than contradictory. Shastri Ji made several tough decisions with great conviction when it came to India’s security and national interest.

The Vice President lauded the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Institute of Management for taking forward Shastri Ji’s vision of uplifting the masses and for nurturing moral values and societal responsiveness among its students. He congratulated the recepient of the 19th Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award for Excellence in Public Administration, Shri. Fali Sam Nariman and applauded his significant contributions to the field of jurisprudence.

The Vice President argued that the practice of law was a public service and that an officer of the court of law had certain responsibilities to the public. Agreeing that Shri. Nariman was truly an example to be emulated by practitioners of law around the world, Shri. Naidu said that he had always displayed an impeccable sense of justice, a deep sense of duty and profound concern for his fellow human beings.

Addressing the young people in the gathering, the Vice President reminded them that India required a clear vision, leadership and direction and expressed hope that the youth would serve as navigators who would take India forward in its quest for inclusive and sustainable development. He requested them to learn from the lives of men like Shri. Lal Bahadur Shastri ji and hoped that their sacrifices would grant inspiration and their teachings would give conviction to the youth of India. 

The Vice President said that love for material things should not be the force that drives one forward and added that material things, wealth, possessions, would give only a fleeting illusion of joy.  He revealed that true happiness and lasting peace would come from service, from making a positive change in someone’s life and from providing leadership to initiatives of nation building.

Shri Anil Shastri, Chairman of Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management and the institute’s Director, Prof. D.K. Srivastava, eminent diplomats, faculty and staff & students of Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management bore witness to the ceremony.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today exhorted universities and higher educational institutions in the private sector to earmark certain percentage of seats for the poorer sections and subsidize their education.

 

Delivering the 9th Convocational Address of the Lovely Professional University at Phagwara, Punjab, he said unfortunately quality private sector education has become out of bounds for the poor and marginalized sections. “Why should not private universities earmark certain percentage of seats for students belonging to poorer sections and subsidize their education”, he asked.

 

The Vice President pointed out that public sector alone cannot provide quality higher education for all and the private sector must pitch in. He said that industries and the private sector in general should supplement the efforts of the government in making quality education available to all. “Our challenge is to ensure the spread of knowledge to every section and every corner of our country”, he added.

 

Calling for a complete overhaul of our education system, the Vice President said that majority of our colleges have become mere breading centres for producing students with degree certificates rather than individuals with critical analytical skills. He expressed concern that students passing out of colleges were lacking the employable skills.

 

Quoting poor performance of Indian higher educational institutes, the Vice President stressed the need to improve the standards by leaps and bounds to make them globally competitive. He called for increasing the number of institutions and universities to meet the growing demand of students seeking higher education and to realize India’s target of a gross enrolment ratio of 30% by 2020.

 

The Vice President said that educational institutions must kindle the entrepreneurial spirit among the students. Our educational institutions must not only prepare students for life long careers but also as good and responsible citizens of the society, he said adding that students must become job creators rather than job seekers.

 

Lauding the farmers of Punjab for turning the state into rice bowl of India, the Vice President called for making agriculture sustainable through innovative methods. He suggested students studying agriculture must spend time with farmers to have a firsthand understanding of the problems faced by farmers. India must become self sufficient food security to battle the challenges such as hidden hunger, malnutrition, he added. 

 

The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Punjab, Shri Sunder Sham Arora, the Chancellor of Lovely Professional University, Shri Ashok Mittal, the Pro-Chancellor, LPU, Smt. Rashmi Mittal and students of the university were in attendance at the venue.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am very happy to be in Punjab – the Golden State of India-- endowed with nature and with people of indomitable spirit, exemplary valor and zest for life. 

 

I would also like to applaud the entrepreneurial and hard working nature of the people of Punjab. This region is renowned for the export of sports goods, hand tools and leather goods. It is the largest NRI belt of North India and a fast emerging hub of education in the state. 

 

Of course, I am also quite happy to be in this beautiful and imposing campus of Lovely Professional University to participate in its 8th Convocation. It is my pleasure to be amongst some of the brightest young minds, who, with dreams in their eyes, are raring to carve out a bright future for themselves and play an important role in building a New India. 

 

I heartily congratulate those who have excelled in the pursuit of academic, cultural and sports activities and all the graduating students for their accomplishments. 

 

Also, I would like to congratulate LPU, a young university with enthusiasm and innovative spirit for its commitment to provide quality education and prepare students to face the challenges of the global society in the 21st century.

 

Education is the main instrument for socio-economic transformation of the nation and lays the foundation for building a knowledge society. “Education is an investment, an educated individual will indeed serve the society”, said Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya.

 

However, it is important for education to produce holistic individuals, who are committed to strong ethical and moral values. “Education which does not mould character is absolutely worthless”, remarked the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi.

 

Education means the process by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, and intellect is sharpened, as a result of which one can stand on one’s own feet. True education equips the youth to contribute to the material progress of the country as well as to maintain India’s cultural and spiritual heritage.

 

Dear sisters and brothers,

 

majority of our colleges have become mere breeding centres for producing students with degree certificates rather than individuals with critical analytical skills and innovative thinking. And most of the time, the students passing out of colleges do not possess employable skills.

 

It is a matter of concern that we are turning out lakhs of students each year from the portals of our colleges with emphasis only on theoretical knowledge. We are merely adding numbers and not individuals with critical minds.

 

Of course, there are islands of excellence like the IITs, IIMs and the IISc. But that’s not enough if India has to emerge as a knowledge hub and a major economic power in the coming years. 

 

There is a need to completely overhaul our education system. We cannot allow the status quo to continue. We need to change the system and the change has to be for good.

 

In the 2019 Times Higher Education’s global rankings, no Indian University has figured in the top 200 institutions, while IISc is ranked 251 and IIT Indore figures at 351. Other Indian Institutions are ranked between 401 and 1001. These rankings underscore the need for higher education institutions to improve the standards by leaps and bounds to make them globally competitive.

 

Dear students!

 

India is a young nation with 65 per cent of the population under the age of 35 years. We are placed in a uniquely advantageous position as compared to many other nations which have ageing populations.

 

The time has come for universities to forge organic links with industries and impart skills to the students in accordance with the requirements of the industry. Although, some universities are acting in this direction, it is not enough and there is a need for paradigm shift in teaching and learning methodologies of our universities to enable the students face global competition effectively and with confidence.

 

The Indian education system faces many challenges. There is a need to increase the number of institutions and universities to meet the growing demand of students seeking higher education and to realize India’s target of a gross enrolment ratio of 30% by 2020.

 

This would translate into an additional 10 million students, of which private universities and institutions are expected to provide education to about six million students.

 

But simply an increase in numbers without ensuring quality would be detrimental to national interests.  We need to restore India’s ancient glory as a prime destination of quality higher education. India was once known as ‘Vishwaguru’ and ours universities were international centers of excellence.

 

For the country to recapture the past glory, the private sector too will have to play a vital role in meeting the demands of higher education. This can be done by building trust amongst all stakeholders and by commitment to quality education and research. At the same time, the private sector must find ways to cross subsidise the education for the poor and the needy.

 

Unfortunately, quality private sector education has become out of bounds for the poor and marginalized sections. Why should not private universities earmark certain percentage of seats for the students belonging to poorer sections and subsidise their education?

 

Our challenge is to ensure the spread of knowledge to every section and every corner of our country.

 

In the words of Sri Aurobindo, India is blessed with a rich inheritance of the past but the potentialities of the future can be realised only if we bring about a reform in the prevalent system of education by revolutionising the whole aim and method of our education.

 

Curricular reforms through regular revision, development of new teaching methodologies, extensive use of information and communication technology and improvements in the examination and evaluation system are taking place in the country. These reforms are basically aimed at introducing openness and excellence in our higher education system.

 

Of course, a great deal of responsibility, in this context, rests upon those who manage education. The regulatory mechanism should facilitate educational institutions to improve quality and ensure minimum standards for excellence in higher education. To take Indian education to the next level, the regulatory bodies need to be open to new ideas and systems.

 

As mentioned earlier, we are a nation that is becoming younger both in age and spirit; this is an opportunity as well as a challenge. There is a need to channelize the energies and the unlimited potential of our youth and to make India one of the most prosperous countries in the world.

 

Our youth need to imbibe all the qualities required to excel in their chosen fields. They need opportunities and those avenues have to be created by imparting the right kind of education, training and skills so that they do not only become job seekers but also job creators.

 

The educational institutions must kindle the entrepreneurial spirit among the students. Our educational institutions must not only prepare students for life long careers but also as good and responsible citizens of the society.

 

I am pleased to learn that LPU focuses on the overall development of character of its students by laying equal emphasis on sports, cultural activities, self- discipline, values, ethics, developing teamwork and leadership qualities.

 

Some other challenges that need to be addressed include shortage of quality teachers and lack of research competencies among the faculty.

 

I am told that a host of short duration skill development programmes have been specifically designed to empower the rural youth to improve their employability. LPU’s collaborations with the schools on the one end and the industry and global institutions on the other, clearly demonstrate its holistic and futuristic approach to educating the future generations of this country.

 

I am happy to know that your students have worked on various live projects such as designing a remotely controlled driverless car and organic farming and are also actively involved in numerous community development projects.

 

I congratulate the Chancellor, faculty members and the staff of LPU for taking forward the cause of providing quality education to the masses and thereby contributing to nation-building.

 

I am happy to learn that the university has now decided to focus on research and has launched many initiatives to promote it. Research in key areas such as agriculture, nanotechnology, energy and water is the need of the hour. The focus should be to encourage applied research which would solve society’s problems. I wish you success in all your present and future endeavors.

 

Dear graduating students, today is an occasion to remember fondly for the rest of your lives. Strive to become independent thinkers and use your knowledge and competencies for the betterment of society for building a strong, modern and prosperous India.

 

Let us dream big and work hard

Let us respect freedom, equality and peace

Let us keep learning and sharing

Let us seize the future!

Let us be proud of our nation and bring pride to our nation.

 

Thank you!

 

Jai Hind!”

Venkaiah Naidu has said that building the future together is the need of the hour and promoting Inclusive growth and Sustainable Connectivity should be the priority. He was intervening in the first Plenary Session of 12th ASEM Summit, in Brussels, Belgium today.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""Your Excellency Donald Tusk, President of the European Council

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, brothers and sisters

 

The theme of ASEM 12 Summit ""Global Partners for Global Challenges” is particularly relevant in the current global context. I express my gratitude to Belgium, our gracious hosts, for the excellent arrangements made for the Summit.

 

Excellencies, we are today confronted by global challenges that need a global response. The significant threats to world peace and security, to financial integrity and environmental protection need concerted action.

 

Excellencies, a major threat to global peace and security is Terrorism, along with radicalization and extremism. India, as an affected party, urges the international community to work towards early adoption of the United Nations Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism which will, inter alia, deny terrorists and their supporters’ access to arms, funds and safe havens.

 

Excellencies, my country considers economic offences, tax crimes and criminal misappropriation of public assets as a significant threat to the integrity of financial systems. We need to considerably strengthen international cooperation within G20 and other fora, to deny shelter to economic offenders. There is also an urgent need for enhancing mechanisms for Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) with committed timelines. ASEM can and should play an important role in this regard.

 

Excellencies, Climate change is an existential reality for all countries and for our future generations. Elimination of poverty through sustainable use of resources and improvement in livelihoods will be the biggest driver to prevent climate change. Developing countries would need enhanced financial and technological support. In this context, fulfillment of obligations by developed countries would be important.

 

Excellencies, I am glad that the world community is coming together to address these formidable challenges. For example, the ‘International Solar Alliance’, launched by India and France in 2015, is an excellent example of Asia and Europe cooperation. For his leadership effort, Prime Minister Modi, along with President Emmanuel Macron, has been recently awarded the United Nations Champion of the Earth award. We invite ASEM partners to join this initiative on renewable energy.

 

Excellencies, India is of the firm belief that connectivity is the pathway to shared prosperity. India is currently involved in a number of international connectivity projects, such as the International North-South Corridor and the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway. Connectivity initiatives must meet universally recognized international norms such as respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and should be transparent, fiscally and environmentally sustainable.

 

Excellencies,

 

Connecting nations, connecting the hearts and connecting minds and connecting economic development with environmental protection is at the heart of our shared commitment.

 

I am proud to share that every 2030 Sustainable Development Goals has been mapped to India's developmental programmes and schemes. As Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi has repeatedly emphasized, India’s development architecture is under pinned by ‘Collective Efforts for Inclusive Development’. Women’s empowerment is now a key development imperative.

 

India values its participation in ASEM which acts as a bridge between the two continents and brings together countries with deep commitment to the rules based international system in particular strengthening WTO.

 

Culture is the bridge that connects people. India would be showcasing its rich cultural heritage through the unique fusion of Indian classical dance Kathakali narrating the story of Spanish ""Don Quixote"" as a part of the ASEM culture festival.

 

Excellencies, the formidable global challenges of our times need clear vision, innovative direction and sincere commitment to action.

 

Let me conclude with a line from Rigveda an Indian scripture that could provide inspiration for all of us–

 

""May our purpose be the same May we all come to a common understanding May our aspirations and intentions be similar May a common set of objectives unite us all”

 

Peace is a prerequisite for progress. If there is tension at the border, there will be no attention in the nation. Let’s work together to eliminate terror from the globe. Namaskar

 

Thank You, Excellencies.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venakaiaha Nadiu has called on Chambers of Commerce of Industries to promote ethical practices in corporate governance, tax compliance and corporate social responsibility among its members. He also asked them to create an environment for whistleblowers to report any wrong doing without any fear.

 

Addressing the 98TH Annual Session of ASSOCHAM, here today, he emphasized the need to adopt zero tolerance towards corruption, bribery and frauds. He also sought such organizations to create an environment for whistleblowers to report any wrong doing without any fear.

 

Calling them key drivers of India’s growth, the Vice President tasked the business associations to plan for the long term vision to serve the larger interests of the nation. He stressed the need reinvent and reposition to promote trade and commerce effectively in line with the changing global scenario. A country like India cannot implement its welfare agenda without the progress and participation of industry, he said.  

 

The Vice President said that vital structural reforms like the implementation of demonetization and GST by the Indian government have led to an expansion of the formal economy and brought about increased tax compliance and increased the tax payer base.

 

The Vice President stressed the need to impart education, skills and foster entrepreneurship among young Indians and said that country must harness the potential of youth and utilize the demographic dividend to better country’s prospects. We must empower the youth to become Job Creators rather than Job Seekers, he added.

 

The Union Minister for Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am very happy to be present at the 98th Annual Session of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, popularly known as “ASSOCHAM”.  I understand that ASSOCHAM, established in 1920, will be celebrating its Centenary in the near future.  Hundred years is indeed a long time in the history of any organization and I wish ASSOCHAM many more years of service to the industry and business community as also to the nation.

To begin with, I would like to emphasize the important role bodies like Chambers of Commerce & Industry play in the economic development of the country. They act as a bridge between the governments and the industry in creating conducive atmosphere for the businesses to thrive and produce wealth. They also play an important role in advising the governments to enact legislations and regulations that promote ease of doing business. At the same time, these bodies also have a responsibility in promoting ethical corporate governance, tax compliance and corporate social responsibility among its members.

Looking ahead, I believe that the success of a Chamber of Commerce like the ASSOCHAM will depend not just on focusing  on traditional business issues but on how  it guides its  members to face the challenges arising from globalization. In short, tomorrow’s Chamber of Commerce will have to reinvent and reposition itself to not only promote trade and commerce effectively, but also serve the larger interests of the nation.

I am delighted to be here amongst the large gathering of eminent business leaders this morning. Your presence here is affirmation of your deep commitment and interest in India’s growth story.    

I am happy to share with you the ambitious, transformative vision of “New India working for 1.25 billion aspirations”

India is in the midst of an unprecedented economic and social transformation. The economy is growing at a steady pace and the systemic governance reforms are creating a more inclusive society. Most of the multilateral institutions have forecast that India will grow at more than 7 percent in 2018 and 2019, ahead of other major economies. The first quarter estimates of GDP growth for Q1 (April-June) 2018-19 show that Indian economy is now cruising at 8.2 %.

 We have managed to retain buoyancy in foreign investment, public investment in infrastructure and greatly expanded the scope of welfare measures despite uncertain global environment. Investment in infrastructure development has increased substantially and it is already visible in the improved railways, roads, airports and shipping infrastructure in our country. 

India is rapidly expanding its infrastructure. For instance, over 9,829 Km national highways were constructed during the year 2017-18 as compared to 8,231 km during 2016-17. 

We have seen a strong global confidence in the India story with a surge in Foreign Direct Investments which reached over US $ 52 billion in 2017-18(RBI, Annual Report for 2017-18).

India has emerged as one of the leaders in renewable energies and the government has launched a massive push for clean energy. India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under Paris Climate Agreement, inter-alia, include achieving about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030. India has taken various initiatives, including setting up of National Solar Mission and has set a target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 for increasing share of carbon free energy in the energy mix.  Solar energy prices have fallen to record low of Rs2.44/unit, thus bringing us close to achieving our goals under the Paris Climate Accord. 

India is playing a leadership role in International Solar Alliance which is committed to financing solar energy projects around the world. 

Only recently, the United Nations has bestowed the Champion of the Earth Award, its highest environmental honour, jointly on Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi and the French President, Emmanuel Macron in the ‘Policy Leadership’ category for their pioneering work in championing the International Solar Alliance and promoting new areas of levels of cooperation on environmental action, including Shri Modi’s unprecedented pledge to eliminate all single-use plastic in India by 2022.  

Dear sisters and brothers, we are committed to build a five trillion dollar economy by 2025, making us the 3rd largest consumer market in the world. We are strengthening the manufacturing sector through the Make in India and other programs, even as our services sector remains robust and high-tech.

Last four years have witnessed major reforms which include harmonization of indirect taxes through GST, easing the regulatory environment, facilitating foreign direct investment across all sectors, massive recapitalization of the public sector banks at Rs.2.11 lakh crore and the implementation of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. Vital structural reforms like the implementation of demonetization and GST by the Indian government have led to an expansion of the formal economy and brought about increased tax compliance. The number of people, who had filed Income Tax returns have surged. All these measures have given a fillip to the Indian economy, which is expected to pick-up further momentum in the coming years. 

The IMF had recently forecast a growth of 7.3 per cent in the current year and 7.4 per cent in 2019.

The IMF in its World Economic Outlook said that in India important reforms have been implemented in the recent years, including the Goods and Services Tax, the inflation-targeting framework, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and steps to liberalize foreign investment and make it easier to do business. “Looking ahead, renewed impetus to reform labor and land markets, along with further improvements to the business climate, are also crucial,” it said.

I would like bodies like the Assocham to be in the forefront in promoting corporate ethics by its members and in following various reforms initiated by the Government.  Ethical behavior has to be promoted by individuals as well as organizations by adopting zero tolerance towards corruption, bribery and frauds. Organizations should also create an environment for whistleblowers to report any wrong doing without any fear.

Total tax compliance should be the motto of every corporate and bodies like Assocham should sensitize its members on this aspect.  It should also sensitize its members towards taking up various CSR activities by organizing seminars and workshops on the issue regularly. 

As part of the efforts to curb the menace of black money, the government has signed treaties with 48 countries for extradition of fugitives and brought in the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill. India also played a major role in building a consensus among countries for free flow of financial account information to tackle black money stashed abroad. 

Any tough reform will face teething problems in the initial stages and the same was the case with both demonetization and GST. However, the long-term advantages will definitely outweigh the short-term hiccups which caused a bit of economic slowdown. Well, that period is over now and the economy is on the track to achieve a higher growth.

India has to gear up the delivery system so that the intended benefits of the policies and programmes of government reach the people on time in the spirit of the principle “Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikaas”. Inclusive and rapid broad-based economic development will address a number of problems like income and regional inequalities. The real challenge for us is to ensure that the legislative intent is translated into effective implementation and nobody is left out of the inclusive growth story.

India is witnessing the onset of an information technology revolution which is changing the way a government engages with its citizens. This transformation rests on digital infrastructure that allows free flow of information, innovation and ideas on the information high-ways. We must fully utilize the power of information technology to reach out to the targeted beneficiaries. Government has launched some very significant  initiatives like GST – making India into a single unified market, GeM – to reform government procurement process, Public Finance Management System (PFMS) – to make Just-in-time payments between various entities; eNAM - creating a national agriculture market by connecting the existing Mandis through an electronic platform, and JAM – Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile using Aadhaar to target government schemes to the poor and the needy sections of the society, besides removing intermediaries. 

More than 326 million persons have opened bank accounts in the last four years making financial inclusion a reality. Tax base has been widened and tax compliance has increased. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is a path-breaking innovation that cuts down multiple intermediaries.

As you all are aware, the Government’s efforts in the area of Ease of Doing Business include cutting down on layers of regulations, simplifying procedures, promoting on-line applications and fixing time-lines for approvals.  As result, India has climbed 30 places in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business ranking. There also has to be a change of mindset for these reforms to be effective. 

Given the size and diversity of the country, there are challenges in delivering basic services to the common man. Therefore, it is imperative to streamline service delivery and provide effective, transparent and people-centred good governance. 

India has become the third largest start up eco-system in the world. According to a NASSCOM report, about 1,000 start-ups were added in 2017 taking their number to nearly 5,200. Interestingly a chunk of these start-ups are from Tier-II and Tier-III cities.

The new India that has emerged is ‘Aspirational India’ with about 65 per cent of the population under 35 years of age. While most of developed countries face the risk of an ageing workforce, India is expected to have a very favourable demographic profile. It is estimated that by the year 2020, the population of India would have a median age of 28 years only as against 38 years for US, 42 years for China and 48 years for Japan. This ‘demographic dividend’ offers a great opportunity and it is extremely crucial to effectively harness it.

In order to capture this demographic dividend, we need to impart appropriate education, skills and foster entrepreneurship so that the youth could also become job creators and not remain as mere job seekers. 

As we all know the talent of Indian youth is recognized across the world as is evident from the leadership positions many Indians are occupying in well-known global companies. We need to create adequate opportunities, fully harness their potential and ensure that they productively contribute towards nation-building. India’s demographic advantage also provides us with a unique opportunity to not only provide gainful employment through appropriate skilling to meet the domestic demand but also meet the requirements of the aging economies of the world.

While India’s academic system has undergone a massive expansionary phase, there is a need to strengthen and popularize vocational education system. The students graduating from our college and Universities do not have adequate employable skills. The quality of education both in terms of the curriculum as well as teaching methodology needs to be improved.

Education is not only for getting employment, but also for the overall development of an individual—for enlightenment and enhancement of knowledge.

We also need to pay attention to equity in access to education. Women and girls, weaker sections, differently-abled and minority groups tend to be generally educationally disadvantaged. In a country that is committed to the principle of ‘social justice’, equitable opportunities to education become a crucial first step towards achieving ‘Aspirational India’.

With growing middle class, rising disposable incomes, expanding consumer market and the presence of a young, talented work force, the global companies are choosing India for their manufacturing operations and R& D centres. There is also a healthy competition among various State Governments, which are implementing reforms to attract investors.

We have also set the goal of providing affordable and inclusive healthcare to the citizens and to realise this goal we have launched the world’s largest and India’s most ambitious healthcare program, Ayushman Bharat — National Health Protection Mission. The scheme will provide a health insurance cover to 100 million families.

The policy initiatives taken by the Indian government such as Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Smart Cities and Start-up India are opening up new opportunities for youth.

The current Indian context is full of infinite opportunities. It is an aspirational India with a transformational vision. The next few decades can potentially be India’s decades.  I am hopeful that the Prime Minister’s three-word mantra to ‘Reform, perform and transform’ would inspire every Indian to scale new heights and help transform the country. 

I hope ASSOCHAM will play a very constructive and useful role in coming years to realize the aspirations of 1.2 billion Indians in a very befitting and proactive manner.

My good wishes to all of you for future endeavors!

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Peace is the prerequisite for Progress and India is on rise and entire world is looking at us. He was delivering a Lecture at the National Defence College on the theme “India’s Strategic Culture, National Core Values, Interests and Objectives”, here today.

The Vice President said that the history of mankind seems to be a ceaseless struggle between the forces of war and peace, between evil and goodness, between violence and non-violence, between tolerance and hatred, between understanding and misunderstanding, between isolationism and inclusion and between conflict and coexistence. It is a continuous struggle and the State has a major role in it along with other bodies like the United Nations, he added.

Saying there is also an overtone that highlights the connection between peace and progress, the Vice President said that the welfare and development of the people and the reduction in inequalities and discontent can potentially lead to a more harmonious, peaceful and less insecure society. So, what we should be addressing are the potential triggers that make our society an insecure place, he added.

The Vice President said that the National Security Strategy aims at creating conditions to effectively pursue its development agenda while keeping the costs of security optimal and affordable. Our strategic security direction should encompass the following components, he said:

(a)        Maintaining a deterrent capability to safeguard National Interests. 

(b)       Ensuring security of national territory, maritime region, including our trade routes, air space and cyber space. 

(c)        Maintaining a secure internal environment to guard against threats to our unity and development. 

(d)       Strengthening and Expanding ‘‘Constructive Engagement’’ with Nations to promote regional and global peace as also international stability.

The Vice President said that we believe that the whole world is one large family as exemplified by the oft-quoted statement: “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”. We are a nation that has desired peace not only on earth and for human beings but for the entire universe, he said. Peaceful co-existence has been an article of faith with us and we should be proud of our country’s timeless vision that encapsulated a world view that is quite relevant even to this day, he added.

The Vice President said that we are living in a world that is torn by violent thoughts, violent emotions and violent actions. He further said that to ensure security, we need to have a multi-pronged approach. Extremism, terrorism, communalism, violence against women and numerous other forms of violent behaviour need a concerted approach, he added.

The Vice President said that education for peace and learning to live together is the need of the hour. He further said that education with values of empathy, compassion, tolerance and goodness embedded in the curriculum can prevent conflict and irrational violence. Community education, inter-faith understanding and evolution of societal norms that encourage harmony and zero tolerance towards violence of all kinds can provide the foundation for a secure society, he added.

The Vice President said that we have been facing the problems of insurgency, left wing extremism and attempts by certain fissiparous forces to weaken the unity and integrity of the country. There is no place for violence in a democracy and India is a mature parliamentary democracy and the ballot has proved to be far more powerful than the bullet, he added.

The Vice President said that terrorism is the biggest threat to humanity today and all nations need to come together to eliminate this global menace. It is time for the United Nations and the global community to act with greater force and determination in tackling the problem, he said.

The Vice President said that the way forward could be to focus on inclusive development and reduce inequalities. Creating just and inclusive societies could lead to more peaceful world and this is what India is attempting through its “Sab ka Sath, Sab ka Vikas” approach, he added.

Hundred senior officers from Army, Navy, Air Force, IAS, IPS and other service including senior officers from friendly neighbouring countries are attending this 47 week course. AVSM, Shri Srikanth welcomed the Vice President.  

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am happy to be with all of you today to share with you some of my thoughts on India’s perspectives on building a secure and peaceful world.

The history of mankind seems to be a ceaseless struggle between the forces of war and peace, between evil and goodness, between violence and non-violence, between tolerance and hatred, between understanding and misunderstanding, between isolationism and inclusion and between conflict and coexistence.

It is a continuous struggle and the State has a major role in it along with other bodies like the United Nations.

The State has a pivotal role in ensuring the security of all people in the country and the territorial integrity of a country. Article 21, the heart of Indian Constitution and the democratic principles that underpin it, guarantees every one the right to life and liberty.

In fact, the security of its citizens and national security is the primary responsibility of the State.

It is worth recalling that Kautilya’s Arthashastra written around the 1st Century AD outlines the three important duties of the ruler.

First is “raksha” or protection of the state from external aggression.

The second is “paalana” or administration and maintenance of law and order.

The third is “Yoga- Kshema” or ensuring the safety and welfare of the people.

Underlying the statement of these three mandates of the state is the recognition of the imperfect world we live in and the constant threat of violence and aggression.

There is an unambiguous mandate to the state to maintain peace, establish rule of law, defend the borders and ensure that all citizens enjoy secure and fulfilling lives.

There is also an overtone that highlights the connection between peace and progress. The welfare and development of the people and the reduction in inequalities and discontent can potentially lead to a more harmonious, peaceful and less insecure society.

So, what we should be addressing are the potential triggers that make our society an insecure place.

The security strategy in simplistic terms focuses on identifying internal, external and hybrid threats and suggests preventive, prescriptive and operative ways to exercise comprehensive national power (CNP) to mitigate these effects. 

The National Security Strategy aims at creating conditions to effectively pursue its development agenda while keeping the costs of security optimal and affordable.

The concept of national security has multiple dimensions. It has to take into consideration various events and situations as they constantly emerge within and outside the nation.          

Our strategic security direction should encompass the following components:

(a)        Maintaining a deterrent capability to safeguard National Interests. 

(b)       Ensuring security of national territory, maritime region, including our trade routes, air space and cyber space. 

(c)        Maintaining a secure internal environment to guard against threats to our unity and development. 

(d)       Strengthening and Expanding ‘‘Constructive Engagement’’ with Nations to promote regional and global peace as also international stability. 

Dear friends,

As you all are aware, India’s security strategy broadly reflects the core values which we have been representing from time immemorial.

We have believed that the whole world is one large family as exemplified by the oft-quoted statement: “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”.

We are a nation that has desired peace not only on earth and for human beings but for the entire universe. Let me recall what the Vedic sages have said in Yajurveda:

“May peace radiate in the whole sky as well as in the vast ethereal space everywhere;
May peace reign all over this earth, in water and in all herbs, trees and creepers;
May peace flow over the whole universe;
May peace be in the Supreme Being;
Let there be peace, peace and peace to all of us and to all beings in this universe.”

This has been the prayer that India has given to itself and the world.

Peaceful co-existence has been an article of faith with us.

Hatred and conflict have been consistently abhorred.

We should be proud of our country’s timeless vision that encapsulated a world view that is quite relevant even to this day. Let me share with you a Upanishadic verse:

“May God protect us both together; 

May God nourish us both together;
May we work together collaboratively with great energy;
May our study be ennobling;
May we not hate each other for any reason;
Let there be peace within my body;

Let there be peace within my mind;
Let there be peace in the  environment around me.”

Dear friends,

We are living in a world that is torn by violent thoughts, violent emotions and violent actions.

To ensure security, we need to have a multi-pronged approach. The battle has to be fought on multiple fronts.

Extremism, terrorism, communalism, violence against women and numerous other forms of violent behaviour need a concerted approach.

The Preamble to the Constitution of UNESCO declares that

""Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed"".

The defences of peace must be constructed in a number of places starting with the schools and colleges, workplaces and places of worship, in the homes and the fields.

Education for peace and learning to live together is the need of the hour.

Education with values of empathy, compassion, tolerance and goodness embedded in the curriculum can prevent conflict and irrational violence.

Community education, inter-faith understanding and evolution of societal norms that encourage harmony and zero tolerance towards violence of all kinds can provide the foundation for a secure society.

The 6th Chapter of the Bhagavad Gita has the following lines:

“Mana eva Manushyaanaam 

Kaaranam Bandha Mokshayoh”

(It is our mind that either binds us or liberates us)

We need more broad minds that are open and receptive, willing to accept and act on good advice, share positive thoughts and ideas that can transform the world for the better.

Negative, narrow, tunnel vision can only lead us all to a strife-torn world we would not like to enter.

This is the medium and long term view and actions needed to prevent extreme violence.

In the short term, however, we need to be firm in our resolve to not allow any violence to spiral beyond control and take decisive, swift and stern action.

We, in India, have been facing the problems of insurgency, left wing extremism and attempts by certain fissiparous forces to weaken the unity and integrity of the country. There is no place for violence in a democracy. India is a mature parliamentary democracy and the ballot has proved to be far more powerful than the bullet.

I have mentioned the threat to internal security and senseless violence which wears different garbs in different contexts, be it language or religion or community or ideology.

There are also the external threats we have to recognize and counter in time and effectively. We live in a globalized world and what happens in one part of the world has an impact on many countries and regions.

Today, terrorism is the biggest threat to humanity and all nations need to come together to eliminate this global menace. It is time for the United Nations and the global community to act with greater force and determination in tackling the problem.

All countries have adopted an ambitious and transformative agenda for achieving 17 Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

This agenda has the following important resolve right at the beginning:

“We are determined to foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies which are free from fear and violence. There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development.”  

One of the important findings of ‘World Peace Index 2018’ published by Institute for Economics and Peace is that global peacefulness has deteriorated by 2.38 per cent since 2008.

Another important finding in this report is about   the impact of conflict on macroeconomic performance. In the last 70 years, per capita growth has been three times higher in highly peaceful countries when compared to countries with low levels of peace.

The way forward could be to focus on inclusive development and reduce inequalities. Creating just and inclusive societies could lead to more peaceful world and this is what India is attempting through its “Sab ka Sath, Sab ka Vikas” approach.

Dear friends,

Clearly, there is a complex matrix of causes and effects, internal and external factors, short term and medium term strategic options that one has to carefully understand and develop a strategy that allows us to respond to existing and emerging threats to our security.

We need to develop the competence to understand the magnitude and the nature of each of these threats and prepare adequately to deal with each one of them.

I am happy to know that the National Defence College brings together selected senior officers from various organs of the Government and friendly foreign countries for giving them a structured exposure to various issues relating to national security of a modern state in general and India in particular. I am told the College seeks to prepare these officers for higher responsibilities in the management of national security and other related areas of public policy.

The 47-week course, focuses on socio-political study of India, study on economic security, international security environment; global Issues, science and technology, including environmental ones; India’s strategic neighborhood and finally strategies and structures for National Security.

My best wishes to all of you in your future endeavours as you embark on the challenging task of creating a secure, sustainable planet.

 

JAI HIND!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has told authorities to make it mandatory to young Doctors to work in rural areas at least for two to three years before they get their first promotion. He was addressing the 11th International Dental Students & 5th Dental Surgeons Conference, jointly organized by Dental Students Welfare Association and Dental Surgeons Conference, here today. Dental students and dental surgeons from different parts of India and abroad have participated in this conference.

The Vice President said that the most common oral diseases are dental cavities, periodontal (gum) disease, oral cancer, oral infectious diseases, trauma from injuries, and hereditary lesions. Proper awareness and setting up of health camps will be a solution address this problem, he added.

The Vice President wanted the healthcare professionals to conduct dental camps in the rural areas which were neglected over the years. He appreciated the participants who have taken oath to work for 15 days in a year in rural areas for free. That is a good idea and I am sure that the initiative will help the needy, he said. Medical professionals should work for life-style changes of people, he added.

The Vice President said that while the government is keen to set up more colleges in the public sector, strict action should be taken by the Dental Council against the private dental colleges which are not maintaining proper standards and falling short of stipulations. We cannot afford any kind of laxity when it comes to health education and healthcare of the people, he said. I am told that only 40 of the 300 odd dental colleges in the country are in the government sector, he added.

The Vice President said that today the digital technology is revolutionizing every aspect of our life. He further said that while using the latest technology, you should ensure that the treatment and implants are within the affordable range of the common man. We need to encourage people to maintain proper oral hygiene and visit dentists periodically to ensure a healthy society, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I welcome all the dental students and dental surgeons from different parts of India and abroad to this 11th International Dental Students & 5th Dental Surgeons Conference.

I am told that the Dental Students Welfare Association and Dental Surgeons Conference have been organizing this conference in different parts of the country every year not only for an exchange of knowledge. 

I am happy to learn that they are also running an international exchange programme and an international research programme with the help of dental teachers of different countries to give chance to Indian students to learn beyond the boundaries. I would like to congratulate them for their efforts in this regard.  

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), oral health is essential to general health and quality of life. It is a state of being free from mouth and facial pain, oral and throat cancer, oral infection and sores, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth decay, tooth loss, and other diseases and disorders that limit an individual’s capacity in biting, chewing, smiling, speaking, and psychosocial wellbeing.

The most common oral diseases are dental cavities, periodontal (gum) disease, oral cancer, oral infectious diseases, trauma from injuries, and hereditary lesions.

Risk factors for oral diseases include an unhealthy diet, tobacco use and harmful alcohol use. These are also risk factors for the four leading chronic diseases – cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes – and oral diseases are often linked to chronic disease. Poor oral hygiene is also a risk factor for oral disease.

With dental diseases increasing day-by-day, I appeal to all the dental students and surgeons to launch regular campaigns to create awareness amongst the people, particularly in the rural areas, which are in general facing shortage of medical professionals, including dentists.

I would like you to conduct dental camps in the rural areas. I am happy to know that the participants have taken oath to work for 15 days in a year in rural areas for free. That is a good idea and I am sure that the initiative will help the needy. 

The dentists’ fraternity also has a great responsibility to step up the fight against oral cancer which is among the leading cancers in the country. 

Apart from launching a massive campaign against the risk factors like tobacco and alcohol use and highlighting the need for the people to lead healthy lifestyles, your members can play a vital role in early detection of oral cancers. Unfortunately, in vast majority of cases, the disease is diagnosed in an advanced stage and this needs to be prevented. The Government has taken many initiatives to fight oral cancer and you need to supplement them.

I am told that 30,000 graduates pass every year from different dental colleges in the country and more than 6000 post graduates get their MDS degree from dental colleges - the number is increasing every year because of the mushrooming of dental colleges.

While the government is keen to set up more colleges in the public sector, strict action should be taken by the Dental Council against the private dental colleges which are not maintaining proper standards and falling short of stipulations. We cannot afford any kind of laxity when it comes to health education and healthcare of the people. I am told that only 40 of the 300 odd dental colleges in the country are in the government sector.

I think the government should also consider using the services of dentists and dental surgeons in PHCs and CHCs in order to promote oral hygiene and in the fight against oral cancer. The national oral health policy must aim not only at promoting oral hygiene but also generate employment for dentists as the dentist-patient ratio at present is around 1:8,000.

Dear students, today the digital technology is revolutionizing every aspect of our life. While using the latest technology, you should ensure that the treatment and implants are within the affordable range of the common man. 

We need to encourage people to maintain proper oral hygiene and visit dentists periodically to ensure a healthy society.

My best wishes to all the participants at this conference.

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asked engineers and technologists to ensure that the new technologies are used to improve the living conditions of the common man, farmers, women and each citizen in our country. He was addressing the gathering after launching two-year celebrations under the aegis of “Beyond Twenty by 2020” campaign, marking the 20th anniversary of the Indian Institute of Information Technology, in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh today. The Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Ram Naik, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Yogi Adityanath and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that Science and Technology must make people’s lives better. He stressed the need to enhance access to services like education, quality health care, timely, authentic and relevant information, access to government services and e-governance initiatives. He further said that significant portion of our citizens still do not have easy access to essential resources. Relentless pursuit is needed to improve the quality of life of people living in the marginalized sections of society, he added.

To achieve this, the Vice President suggested taking a fresh approach and finding solutions that are solutions that are affordable, accessible, intelligible, sustainable and scalable. Our traditional approach to alleviating these problems simply does not work and we need to think afresh, he added.  

The Vice President said that it is vital that young innovators of this institution and surrounding regions gets all the resources required for successful translation of their ideas into products and solutions. This will certainly contribute to the growing economy of this nation and accelerate the growth process considerably, he added. 

Highlighting the need to keep environmental and social considerations while designing or planning, he reminded the future engineers that the present world cannot afford the luxury of unlimited resources. He stressed on the need to adopt a growth model that cares for the environment as well as the economic prosperity of the people.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to be here at the commencement of two-years of celebratory events under the aegis of “Beyond Twenty by 2020” campaign, marking the 20th anniversary of the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad.

Driven by the Computer Policy of 1984, Electronic Policy of 1985 and catalyzed by the Software Policy of 1986, our nation moved steadily towards computerization and use of Information Technology.

In order to be prepared for the IT driven economy, the country established specialized institutions that focused on I.T.

I am very pleased to see that one of the first such institutions, the Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad, has performed very well. As we have heard from Shri Ravi Kant and Prof. Nagabhushan, this institution has made rapid strides in the recent past.

It may come as a surprise to some of you, but the first prototype of the modern Software park in this country was established in Mumbai way back in 1973! At that time, Information Technology was relatively unheard of. Today our country is among the largest exporters of IT services in the world. IT Sector’s contribution to India’s GDP has grown from 1.2% in 1998 to 7.7% in 2017. Clearly, this would not have been made possible without the structured partnership of the industry and the education sector. However, the real drivers of this revolution are the bright minds of the remarkable engineers that this nation has produced.

The global landscape is changing fast. So also is the educational system. A number of curricular and pedagogical innovations are taking shape across the nation. Students are learning by doing, by experimenting and finding solutions to contemporary problems. Students are focusing on multidisciplinary application of knowledge. New domains are emerging such as Big-Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence.

It is indeed a pleasure to see the changes here in your Institute, I am please to inaugurate the Central Computing Facility here at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad and dedicate it to the nation. I am informed that this state-of-the-art facility houses a high-performance computing cluster coupled with a Big Data facility along with Cloud Computing resources as well. It is also quite impressive that apart from being one of the very few of its kind in the country, this is the very first large-scale high-performance computing setup among all the IIITs in the country.

In the same vein, IIIT-Allahabad’s adoption of a new academic evaluation system that offers enhanced choices and a flexible academic tenure to its students, is certainly a step in the right direction.

Quite akin to a meandering river, an ideal academic environment should afford its students a menu of choices so that they identify the areas of their interest and realize their creative potential to the fullest extent.

The bedrock of any society is its relentless pursuit of an improved quality of life. A significant portion of our citizens still do not have easy access to essential resources.  We need to enhance access to services like education, quality health care, timely, authentic and relevant information, access to government services and e-governance initiatives.

It is also now clear, that our traditional approach to alleviating these problems simply does not work.

We need to think afresh. 

We must search for solutions that are affordable, accessible, intelligible, sustainable and scalable.

Technology provides tools for achieving many goals as per these parameters. We must fully harness this potential.

We need products and technologies that are indigenous, low cost, rapidly deployable, robust and resilient to disruptions.

I am confident that my audience here will agree that we require a new approach characterized by an agile and constantly innovating mindset.

The global experience points to a need to establish a dynamic ecosystem that supports and nurtures creativity and collaborative enquiry.

I am particularly delighted today that IIIT-Allahabad is taking a major step towards this end and is committed to setting up a dedicated Innovation and Incubation complex.

It is vital that young innovators of this institution and surrounding regions gets all the resources required for successful translation of their ideas into products and solutions. This will certainly contribute to the growing economy of this nation and accelerate the growth process considerably.

I am confident that startups incubated in the premises will make us all proud through their innovations.

Dear Students,

We must never be complacent and be satisfied with what we have achieved. Innovation requires constant churning of ideas and creative, out-of-box thinking to develop unique products. I am sure you will continue your quest for excellence in the years to come.

It gives me great comfort that this institution is very clear in its long-term objectives – as enumerated in the Vision document being released today. The document is a testimony to the ambitious agenda you all have set for yourself.

I compliment you on your dreams and hope you will put in adequate efforts to achieve them.

Your plans to develop and strengthen symbiotic partnerships with captains of the Industry and education leaders across the globe, faculty development program and other similar initiatives are quite promising.

However, I would like to suggest that your growth must be tempered with environmental and social considerations. We exist in a world that no longer affords us the luxury of unlimited resources. We should adopt a growth model that cares for the environment as well as the economic prosperity of the people. 

I am happy that this institution has already adopted certain measures to lower its carbon footprint. I hope that each resident of this campus takes this further by adopting individual measures towards the “Swachch Bharat Abhiyaan” and contributes to our planet’s sustainable future. 

I would like to mention to my young friends here today that we are now living in exciting times when India is emerging as one of the fastest growing economies in the world. We are also as a nation among the frontrunners in information technology.

Dear students,

In the coming years, digital technology will be playing an important role in accelerating economic growth.

My advice to all of you is to ensure that the new technologies are used to improve the living conditions of the common man, farmers, women and each citizen in our country.

I am optimistic that the students, scholars and faculty members of this relatively young institution will shape this institution as a trend setter and a pace setter in the next wave of technological change. 

I do hope you will keep the societal needs and the cultural context in view so that what you do will be of great value to society. We need to bring in a transformation in the country in many domains.  You, as technological experts, can usher in this change.

I wish the Indian Institute of Information Technology – Allahabad, the very best in its future endeavors. 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the language used in the courts should be understood by the petitioners who are seeking justice. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the new building for Allahabad High Court, in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh today.

The Vice President told the judges and members of the Bar Association that while our Constitution envisages independence of judiciary from the executive, the Legislature and Judiciary should share healthy mutual respect and should complement each other. He reminded the Judges and members of the Bar Association of the crucial historical milestones witnessed by the Allahabad High Court, like the trial of the Chauri Chaura case, the Meerut Conspiracy case and the INA Trials.  

The Vice President proclaimed that Judiciary is a key pillar of our democratic polity and suggested that judiciary should strengthen democracy by ensuring speedy justice, even handed justice and justice that is perceived to be entirely fair. He lamented that there was a huge volume of cases pending in Indian courts. He recommended that Courts must make use of innovative tools such as Lok Adalats, Gram Nyayalays and Fast Track Courts for speedy justice disbursal. 

The Vice President advised that the endless possibilities of Information Technology should also be fully exploited to make procedures more transparent and less cumbersome. He underscored the importance of the use of local languages in the procedures of Courts in India for their easy comprehension by the common people. 

The Vice President expressed his deep concern at the existence of a large number of unfilled vacancies in the judicial system and expressed hope that the efforts being made by the government to bridge the gap in human resources would bear fruits soon. He acknowledged the dedication of the Judges of the Allahabad High Court who agreed to dispose urgent criminal cases during the vacations. 

Applauding the functioning of the National Judicial Data Grid which found place in Ease of Doing Business Report for 2018 for facilitating the enforcement of commercial contracts, the Vice President said that we should avoid delays in judicial litigations and create a robust regulatory architecture to inspire more confidence among investors. 

The Vice President spoke about the rise in the number of cyber-crimes which have opened up an all together new dimension in jurisprudence. He added that Cyber-crimes and their ramifications transcend defined jurisdictions and expressed hope that the courts would equip themselves to deal with them. He emphatically spoke about the need to implement Anti Defection law, with sincerity and also fast track disposal of election petitions. 

The Vice President also touched upon the need to be cautious about invoking provisions in law that have a bearing on the stature of constitutional and judicial authorities like impeachment proceedings. 

The Vice President urged the courts to stand by the truth at all times so that each citizen will feel confident that truth alone would triumph in this country. The Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Ram Naik, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Yogi Adithyanath, retired and sitting judges of Allahabad High Court, Judges from Supreme Court and eminent legal luminaries were present on the occasion. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

“I am pleased to be here in the holy land of ‘Prayagraj’, the sacred land where three rivers converge and inspire humanity to move towards Dharma. I am thankful for the kind invitation to join you at this historic institution as it completes 150 years of dispensing justice. The occasion reminds me of my distinguished predecessor Shri Gopal Swaroop Pathak ji, who was a Member of both the Bar and the Bench of this Court. I take this opportunity to pay my sincere tributes to his memory. 

During the last 150 years, this institution has grown in strength and stature. 

The institution which began its journey with just six judges and as many lawyers, has now grown into the largest such institution in Asia with a sanctioned strength of 160 Judges and over 15000 lawyers. 

It has also been an institution where eminent judges have delivered several landmark judgements. 

Some of the legal stalwarts of its Bar contributed to the constitutional and political evolution of this country. It was here that Mahamana Malviya ji contested the case to save 155 convicts of Chauri Chaura case from the gallows. It was here that Shri K.N. Katju pleaded the case in favour of convicts of Meerut Conspiracy Case. He and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru argued for INA soldiers in the celebrated INA Trial. 

This High Court is indeed a rich repository of historical moments of our national life. We must preserve these archives as a part of our country’s historical and judicial heritage. 

Like many legal stalwarts of that time, the legal luminaries of this High Court like Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Kailash Nath Katju, Jawaharlal Nehru, made immense contribution in the framing of our Constitution. 

Even after independence, this High Court has produced eminent lawyers like Shri Kanhaiyya Lal Mishra, Shri Shanti Bhushan ji,  Shri V.B. Upadhyayay  and many others. Former Chief Justices of India Shri R.S. Pathak and Justice V.N. Khare were members of Bar and the Bench of this High Court. Former Advocates General of the State Shri Virendra Bhatiya ji and Shri Satish Chandra Misra ji who became members of Rajya Sabha made immense contribution to parliamentary debates.

Friends, 

Judiciary is a key pillar of our democratic polity. It is meant to be the dispassionate monitor of Constitutional values. It is expected to safeguard the letter and spirit of the Constitution.  

I said earlier that this High Court had grown in stature. It is, in fact, an institution that has safeguarded the democratic polity of the country during the most testing times. 

In 1975, this Court made the first resolute attempt to purge the polity of electoral malpractices and political corruption. Justice Jagmohan Lal Sinha’s judgment was perhaps the first celebrated attempt by judiciary to stem the tide. It was a judgement that had tectonic effect on the political landscape and led to a number of cataclysmic events like the imposition of emergency and curtailment of human rights. 

It was a judgement that upheld the rule of law, the spirit of the Constitution and the values which our Constitution makers and freedom fighters had so unwaveringly followed. 

It was a moment that restored the faith of all Indians in the independence of the judiciary and rekindled the faith that we can together make the constitution work in real life. 

As a part of my education, I too have studied law. However, influenced by Loknayak Jayprakash Narayan’s clarion call for Total Revolution, I chose a legislative career instead of a legal career. In a way, although quite indirectly, I seem to owe my legislative career to this Court because the 1975 judgement of Justice Sinha of this Court had triggered subsequent events in recent Indian history which impacted me. 

Friends,

For long, I have been a part of Legislature. It has been my endeavor to restore people’s faith in our democratic governance. In my view, judiciary also has a crucial role to play in deepening our democratic roots.  It can do so by ensuring speedy justice, even handed justice and justice that is perceived to be entirely fair. Justice delayed is, as they say, justice denied. 

I am told that about 3.25 lakh cases are pending in this Court for last more than 10 years. 

I am happy to learn that in order to reduce pressure on Courts and to reduce pendency, the Court has encouraged Mediation process and pre-litigation Lok Adalats. Results have been encouraging. Lok Adalats in 2016-17 alone could settle around 11 lakh cases involving around Rs 400 crores. Similarly 7500 cases were settled through Mediation. Similarly, I will suggest that your High Court should make use of Gram Nyayalay scheme for rural areas. This will relieve farmers and villages of hardship and exorbitant cost of litigation. 

I am also happy to learn about some of the very progressive initiatives taken by this Court in introducing technology in the Court process by setting up E-Courts. You have also set up a separate Center for Information Technology to digitize records. I suggest that the Members of the Bar and Bench should regularly conduct training and refresher courses for the Members and Staff of the Court. A new Protocol of Digitised Court procedures and record keeping should be developed. 

Related to this is also the issue of language. I firmly believe that the language used in the courts should be understood by the petitioners who are seeking justice.  The entire process should be in the State language so that the petitioners have the confidence that they will get a fair hearing and treatment. The Article 348 (2) of the Constitution provides for usage of official language of the State in the Court. If you so decide, you must consider digitization in the Official language of the State for the benefit of litigants. 

Hon’ble Judges and Distinguished Members of Bar,

As the people expect Courts to deliver expeditious justice, I am quite aware of issue of the large number of vacancies. With a sanctioned strength of 160, this Court has 86 Judges - almost 50% of the strength. There is significant shortage even in the supporting Staff. At the level of Subordinate Courts too there is a vacancy of around 1200 Judicial Officers. However, I am told that the Government of India has been actively engaged in the process of filling up vacancies and during the last 4 years, 351 fresh appointments have been made in the High Courts. 

Friends,

Hopefully, we shall soon have all the vacancies filled up. In the meanwhile, however, I would urge you to take measures to expedite disposal of the cases. 

I know some efforts are already underway. I acknowledge with appreciation the cooperation of Hon’ble Judges of this Court who responded to the appeal of the Chief Justice and agreed to dispose off urgent criminal cases during the vacations. I also appreciate the cooperation of Members of the Bar in this regard. 

Delay in judicial proceedings affects the image of the country. We can further improve on our position in the Ease of Doing Business ranking if we can avoid delays in judicial litigations. Apparently, large amount of money is locked up in long pending tax-related litigations. 95000 tax related cases involving more than Rs 3 lakh crores are pending before High Courts for last 3 years. 

However, the Government of India has taken a number of steps for improved justice delivery. The National Judicial Data Grid is a case in point. World Bank praised the National Judicial Data Grid in the Ease of Doing Business Report for 2018, that it made possible to generate case management reports, thereby making it easier to “Enforce Commercial Contracts”.

Friends, 

India’s economy is on a growth path.  We are currently among the fastest growing economies in the world. The whole world is now looking towards India as an investment destination. However, we need to ensure that there is a transparent, predictable policy regime and a sound judicial, regulatory system in place. 

A robust regulatory architecture gives confidence to investors. Time bound approval of applications and disposal of appeals is absolutely essential. 

I am happy to know that Allahabad High Court has established Commercial Courts to settle commercial disputes. This will help in resolving commercial disputes expeditiously. 

The Indian society is changing at a fast pace. As the previously marginalized groups like women, dalits exercise their constitutional rights, they are actively seeking social justice. The Legislature has been sensitive to the need to protect the rights of these groups and has provided for resolute action and time-bound disposal of such cases. This legislative intent has to be carried out in practice. 

I am happy to learn that in the State you are setting up Fast track Courts in every District to decide the cases against these marginalized sections of our population. 

Similarly, the Government of India has also established 727 fast track courts. 

Since the integrity of election process is essential for a healthy democracy, it would be ideal if the judiciary can expedite the decisions on Election petitions. If needed, Special Courts could be set up for dealing with the Election petitions. 

Cyber-crimes have opened up an all together new dimension in jurisprudence. Cyber-crimes and their ramifications transcend defined jurisdictions. I hope that the Bench and the Bar have already realized the impending danger and equipped themselves accordingly.

Friends,

While our Constitution envisages independence of judiciary from the executive, the Legislature and Judiciary should share healthy mutual respect and should complement each other. 

We have inherited a very comprehensive, well drafted Constitution and we are heirs to a rich judicial heritage we can legitimately be proud of.  

We must add to the grand tradition, not dilute it or trivialize it. 

Persons in high offices live in glass houses. 

The society looks upto them as role models and any slip up or slide down is not taken kindly.  

The behavior, the speech and the ideas of the leaders are constantly under scrutiny.  

We all need to understand that we are not only important functionaries in leadership positions but are also representing important institutions in which people repose their trust.  

Judiciary is one of these institutions and all of you have chosen this noble profession of upholding the Constitution, illuminating the path of Dharma and walking the path of righteousness, truth and justice. Each one of you is viewed with awe and expectation by every citizen.

Let us remind ourselves that ours is a country that had a sound judicial system for over two millennia and had set great ideals for judges. As Kautilya says in his Arthashastra; 

“Judges shall discharge their duties objectively and impartially so that they may earn the trust and affection of the people”.

That ‘trust’ is crucial.  

It is a great honour as well as a tremendous responsibility that is given to higher judicial officers.  

It is a unique opportunity that each of you have to touch the lives of millions of people through your judicial pronouncements.  

You have the knowledge of the intricate world of laws. 

You have the analytical ability to separate the truth from the untruth.  

Combined with the courage to stand by the truth, you can influence the way India and the world moves.  

Each citizen should feel that truth alone will triumph. 

That’s the ideal our ancient sages like Veda Vyasa have set before us when they said “Yato dharmah Thato Jayah” (Victory comes only to those who follow the righteous path). 

I thank you for inviting me to share my thoughts with all of you and giving me the privilege of inaugurating this new High Court building. 

I wish each one of you a fulfilling career as you shape a new India built on the strong foundation already laid by the legal luminaries who have served humanity in this part of our country over the last 150 years. 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that quality and credible companies needed to facelift infra sector in our country. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the Biography of late Industrialist, Dr. Anumolu Ramakrishna, authored by Shri. V. Pattabhi Ram and Shri. R. Mohan, in Chennai today. The Minister for Fisheries and Personnel & Administrative Reforms, Tamil Nadu, Shri D. Jayakumar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President complimented the biography and said that it introduced us to a man with great sagacity, sharp intellect and refined engineering orientation. He added that Dr. Ramakrishna had the ability to grasp issues quickly, understand their nuances and impact and arrive at innovative solutions rapidly.

The Vice President said that Dr. Ramakrishna had the wonderful ability to take people along with him. He was a leader by example, a motivator, an inspiration for his colleagues to reach for the sky with him, he added.

The Vice President said that Dr. Ramakrishna was a  great communicator and that his warmth and empathy were overwhelming, truly, the traits of a born leader. He possessed an extremely rare trait of being able to expertly synthesize innovation and execution in an industry where execution is key, he added.

Saying India is on a growth trajectory today, the Vice President said that we have highly ambitious plans for the country and a large part of these plans would work only if we build infrastructure. He said that this is a truly exciting and challenging time for Indian technocrats and builders.

The Vice President exclaimed that that Dr. Ramakrishna was an institution by himself, but what is more remarkable was that he was instrumental in building an institution that would stand testimony to him for a long time to come. Technocrats like Shri. A. Ramakrishna have helped India face the world with its head held high.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It is indeed a matter of great pride and privilege for me to be here today to participate in this function and to release the biography of one of the true doyens of Indian industry. 

Today is an opportunity to celebrate the life and contribution of Dr. A Ramakrishna, posthumous winner of the Padma Bhushan, the nation’s third highest civilian award. This biography is in many ways an acknowledgement and recognition of his tremendous contribution towards finding the rightful place for the Indian construction industry in the world. 

This creative expression traces Dr. Ramakrishna’s life right from its humble beginnings, through his formative years, his emergence as a man of substance, his several triumphs to his ascension to lead one of the country’s largest organizations and a celebrated industry leader.His is also a story of evolution, of promises kept, of dreams realized, of hopes fulfilled. 

The biography introduces us to a man with great sagacity, sharp intellect and refined engineering orientation. Dr. Ramakrishna had the ability to quickly grasp issues, understand their nuances and impact and arrive at innovative solutions rapidly. His thinking and his approach were far ahead of his times with the result that he was able to endow the erstwhile old world construction industry with a verve, instil in it a freshness that made the world look at it through a new lens. 

His is also the story of a pioneering spirit. As is the case with great thinkers, the mundane bored Dr. Ramakrishna; the usual and the ordinary did not hold his attention for long. He constantly questioned the obvious; never readily accepted the status quo and urged everyone around him to become equally unforgiving towards the standard and the sedate. A restless mind, he was forever seeking new ways, finding new paths, engineering new solutions. His natural inclination to question gave him the opportunity, the latitude and the freedom to think new, think big and think beyond the ordinary. His mind soared to new heights and strove to find new paradigms. For him, problems were always opportunities to rewrite the rules of the game, to overturn convention and create new vistas of achievement. Such iconoclastic thinkers are often isolated and left to plough a lone furrow by the loftiness of their thoughts.That, fortunately, was not so with Dr. Ramakrishna. 

Though he discovered new paths, he found enough traction with those around him to accompany him on those new paths; he had that wonderful ability to take people along with him selling them his own brand of dreams that they were readily willing to buy into. He was a leader by example, a motivator, an inspiration for his colleagues to reach for the sky with him. He found willing partners to own his novel way of thinking; the pride and commitment to take and live his dreams. Not many could resist his enthusiasm, his free spirit and his obvious bonhomie. Not many could resist him; instead they became unswervingly loyal to him. 

As the conductor of an orchestra of designers, architects, engineers and workers, Dr. Ramakrishna had the capability to explain interfaces openly and thoughtfully. Seeing the overall picture and putting a myriad of mosaic stones to a unique piece of work was one of his outstanding characteristics. A great communicator, his warmth and empathy were overwhelming, ever willing to explore a fresh perspective, engage a contrarian view, discuss and debate it threadbare and willing to alter his stand point if convinced. Truly, the traits of a born leader.

His vision was as large as it was far-sighted and, more importantly, he was able to articulate it perfectly to all around infusing them with his passion, drive and enthusiasm. Like a born leader, he was ever mindful of the big picture though he hardly ever lost sight of ground realities. The macro perspective was as important for him as micro detailing. 

A man of considerable learning, he loved to dispense his wisdom to those who rubbed shoulders with him or had the privilege of working under him. He was a fountain of new thinking, always contemplating fresh perspectives, exploring hitherto untried approaches. The construction business was maturing during his days at the helm and it needed a man with an equally evolved and mature mindset to ride the turbulence and steer the ship to safer, calmer waters. He proved to be an ideal skipper. 

His freshness of thought and approach cast him as a leader of rare quality and calibre.It is therefore hardly surprising that he was able to guide the fortunes of ECC, the organization he headed, setting a growth trajectory that took it to new heights. His far-sighted and visionary leadership transformed the organization. Driving it with passion and foresight, ECC emerged as one of the biggest and most respected construction organizations in the country. When faced with seemingly impossible projects, the phrase “If not L&T, then who else?” became commonplace in India. 

Spearheading a burgeoning business is fraught with challenges but he was able to address them with strength and conviction. He believed in the intrinsic strength of his people and thus was bold in his forays, confident of his own and his team’s capabilities. Under his tutelage, the business grew and grew and as the size, scale and complexity of L&T’s projects increased, so did Dr. Ramakrishna’s uncanny depth of understanding and width of attention. He was always on top of it all, no matter how intimidating the project or its timelines were. For him, the world was the stage. Not satisfied with his successes within the country, Dr. Ramakrishna set his mind to make overseas conquests and made several successful forays into hitherto untapped markets. He smelt opportunities and triggered the globalization of the business by opening newer vistas for growth, forging fresh relationships and preparing the Company for sterner challenges ahead.

Technology did not awe him but in technology, he found a worthy ally to awe the world. “The Indian construction industry will have to adopt international practices to be globally competitive,” he once declared. “It will have to address issues such as achieving faster construction methods, improving quality, mechanization, trained personnel and problems relating to contract management.” 

He possessed an extremely rare trait of being able to expertly synthesize innovation and execution. In an industry where execution is key, Dr. Ramakrishna was able to introduce innovation to metamorphose construction. He assiduously and constantly modernized construction practices at site with an almost missionary zeal enhancing competencies multi-fold. The intricacy of the famous Baha’i Temple, often referred to as the modern day Taj Mahal, and the majesty of the Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences, Whitefield, Bengaluru are but a couple of examples of his thinking. The introduction of segmental launching to build the incredibly complicated Panval Nadi Viaduct, one of the tallest in Asia or the challenging projects he has executed for Sri Sathya Sai Baba at Pattuparthi are all testimony of his finely honed engineering skills. 

Dr. Ramakrishna fathered the application of pre-cast, pre-stressed and tunnel form techniques across the entire gamut of construction right from housing to vaults in nuclear power plants, airports to sports stadia. The introduction of System Formwork technology to vastly improve concrete forms and raise productivity levels was his brainchild as were the modern launching techniques for bridges or flyover construction like those used in the case of the Panval Nadi viaduct, the tallest in Asia or Bangalore’s Sirsi Circle flyover, India’s longest. A brilliant structural designer, he did not stop at designing but ensured to match design with execution. Leaders have three fundamental responsibilities: They craft a vision, they build alignment, and they champion execution. Very often we see ambitious projects being designed which fail miserably when it comes to execution, but not with Dr. Ramakrishna. He created practical, pragmatic solutions to engineering problems. He designed the pre-tensioned, pre-cast long span slab or truss – the ‘A’ frame that became known as ‘AR Frame’! A fitting tribute to his memory is that several of his new ideas have now become industry norms. Surely, imitation is the best form of flattery. 

Although a charismatic and inspiring leader who devoted his entire life to making Larsen & Toubro live up to the sobriquet of ‘Builders to the nation’, Dr. Ramakrishna was also an intense family man, a side of him that we have the privilege to see in this book. His warmth, his sense of commitment, his spirit of inclusion are evident in the web of relationships he wove.

I take this opportunity to appreciate the sacrifices of his wife and his entire family for having given Dr. Ramakrishna the freedom and opportunity to become such an asset for the country!

Friends, India is on a growth trajectory today. We have highly ambitious plans for the country and a large part of these plans would work only if we build infrastructure, roads, dams, power plants, living spaces, amenities, metro systems, ports, utilities. The progress of any nation depends upon the talent and the commitment of its ‘Vishwakarmas’, its builders.

The economic survey 2018 estimates that India would raise $ 4.5 trillion by 2040 to develop Infrastructure. We have a number of ambitious projects such as the Bharatmala for road transport and Sagarmala for shipping. We are trying to rationalize and balance the construction boom in urban areas and at the same time striving to take infrastructure to rural areas as well. 

Recognizing the importance of railways in aiding and abetting the progress of the nation, we are focusing on expanding and upgrading our rail network. For the first time Northeast India is fully integrated with the rest of India with the entire network converted to broad gauge. It brought Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram on the rail map of India after 70 years of independence! We recently saw how the tiny Himalayan state of Sikkim got its long-awaited airport. Situated at a height of 4,500 feet. It was an engineering marvel.

We are also building crores of affordable houses for those who are deprived of a roof over their heads. This is a truly exciting and challenging time for Indian technocrats and builders. In such times, the builders of modern India should draw lessons of inspiration from the life of this great Karmayogi.

In the 1990’s Dr. Ramakrishna took the lead in implementing projects under the public-private partnership (PPP). Notable among the PPP projects executed by L&T under his leadership include the HITEC City in Hyderabad, Kakinada Deepwater Port, Jaipur-Kishangarh Expressway and Bangalore International Airport. 

Right in the early days of Information Technology, Dr. Ramakrishna introduced the application of IT in L&T’s construction operations.  Under his leadership and guidance L&T opted for implementation of an Enterprise Information portal. Friends today, industrial revolution 4.0 is underway. Automation and data exchange. Taking a page out of Dr. Ramakrishna’s playbook, technocrats of today must unhesitatingly, unflinchingly go ahead with making full use of information technology, be it in hydrocarbon exploration or affordable housing.  

Dr. Ramakrishna was inspired by the vision of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to make India a developed nation by 2020 and firmly believed that Government Departments, Indian Industry and Public Institutions can work on a matrix mode for technology development and towards enhancement of public awareness of engineering.  

Many both in India and abroad see Dr A Ramakrishna as an exemplary Engineer and Leader who combined technical excellence with honesty, integrity and human values in business.  He showed the way to transform construction scenario in India and contributed to India becoming a Developed Nation. He was a true patriot, a true son of Mother India. His empathy and compassion are virtues worth emulating. He was the very epitome of the core philosophy preached in the Bhagawad Gita, that of equanimity. 

The trappings of fame used to sit very light on him, he stayed away from limelight and never sought credit for his exceptional work. Untiring, self-less service to his chosen profession is something that everyone can learn from Dr. Ramakrishna's life. I implore the younger generation of technocrats to make his biography their talisman. It will go a long way in setting the right priorities and envisioning the right goals, helping us to realize the dream of a new, resurgent, strong India.

In conclusion, Dr. Ramakrishna was an institution but what is more remarkable is that he was instrumental in building an institution that will stand testimony to him and his memory long after he is gone!  

Long live his memory! 

I take this opportunity to appreciate and congratulate the author of this great work. Shri..... What you have done by capturing the life of Dr. A. Ramakrishna on paper is that you have immortalized the story of his life for the benefit of the future generations of this country. You have chronicled the life and times of one of India’s great creators. Posterity will thank you for this beautiful work. I wish you all the very best.

Thank You!

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the stories of great leaders like Shri Mylapore Ponnusamy Sivagnanam (Ma.Po.Si) should be taught in all schools. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the autobiography 'Enadhu Porattam' on Ma.Po.Si at the commemoration of in 23rd Anniversary, in Chennai today. The Minister for Fisheries and Personnel & Administrative Reforms, Tamil Nadu, Shri D. Jayakumar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President recalled the remarkable contribution made by Ma.Po.Si as a freedom fighter, a learned scholar of Tamil literature and great leader who forged a new identity for Tamil Nadu, Tamil language and Tamil Culture. He further said that Ma.Po.Si's literary expositions were immaculate and he delved into 'Silappathikaram' and helped spread the epic throughout Tamil Nadu. His work on V.O Chidambaram Pillai, 'Kappalottiya Thamizhan' was so popular, it ended up becoming the great  leader's sobriquet, he added.

 

The Vice President said that Ma.Po.Si was a great chronicler of events, not only the biographies of legendary figures he admired but also of events that shaped India as we know today. ""Viduthalai Poril Thamizhagam"" is a great compilation by him on the role of Tamilnadu in the Nationalistic movement, he added.

 

Saying Ma.Po.Si was a staunch believer in strengthening traditional roots through extensive use of mother tongues, the Vice President said that he loved Tamil language and culture and gave the clarion call that resonated in every Tamil home. ""Engum Tamil - Edhilum Tamil"" meaning ""Tamil Everywhere - Tamil Everything"", he added.

 

The Vice President said that the need to preserve and propagate the best in our ancient literary and cultural heritage, the inclusive humanitarian approach to development, the care and concern for the common citizens and above all, recognizing the diversity and richness of each state within the national context are most relevant issues for each one of us even today.

 

The Vice President said that the strong humanistic thread that has been spun by the great visionary leaders like Ma.Po.Si can bring diverse people together to strive for a better future. Our children should learn and understand the sacrifices made by the architects of this great nation and they should understand their teachings and draw inspiration from their lives, he added.

 

Saying Ma.Po.Si a universal leader, the Vice President said that he did not discriminate between people based on anything, be it religion or caste or creed. He was a true leader to every Indian, h added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am happy to be with all of you today for paying homage to an illustrious son of our country, Mylapore Ponnusamy Sivagnanam fondly called Ma. Po. Si.

 

As we commemorate his 23rd Anniversary, we recall the remarkable contribution he made to our nation as a freedom fighter, a learned scholar of Tamil literature and great leader who forged a new identity for Tamil Nadu, Tamil language and Tamil Culture. 

 

It is indeed with great pleasure that I accepted the invitation from his daughter to release  a book on this  great son of Tamil Nadu.

 

Thiru Ma. Po. Si avargal was a self taught genius.

 

Unable to complete his education because of poverty, he was so determined to acquire knowledge that he studied on his own and rose to great eminence as one of the foremost Tamil scholars of his time. He won several honorary doctoral degrees besides the Sahitya Academy Award.

 

He was a freedom fighter and an ardent follower of Mahatma Gandhi. Rajaji paid a glowing tribute to him for his leadership role in the freedom struggle. He said that described in the independence struggle in Tamil Nadu, Rajaji himself was the Arjuna, while Ma Po Sivagnanam was his philosopher-charioteer like Krishna. 

 

Ma Po Si was a true nationalist and a man who exemplified the best of Indian values.

 

His principled stand in favour of prohibition antagonized several people of his own caste in the 1940s.  He dared to stand alone and took a firm stand even if it meant crossing swords with the tall leaders like Periyar. He was a a quintessential humanist who was opposed to caste discrimination.  

 

We also remember Ma Po Si as an incisive researcher, a prolific writer and a captivating orator.

 

It was in Amaravathi prison that Ma Po Si started his literary journey. His interest in  Sangam literature was kindled by the words of Subramanya Bharathi. He claimed that the simple words of Bharathi acted as a tutor to take him to the next literary level. He attributed all his literary growth to Subramanya Bharathi on whom he wrote  about 10 research books. 

 

Ma Po Si had a great connect with the common man and woman. He wanted the classical literature to be accessible to every body. 

 

Ma Po Si’s title “Silambu Selvar” was conferred on him by R.P.Sethu Pillai not only because of his  insightful research on the Tamil classic, Silappathikaram , written by Ilango Adigal but his untiring efforts to popularize it. 

 

A treasure trove of history to understand life 20 centuries ago in South India, Silappathikaram has an extraordinary literary flavor on par with other classics of the world. Ma Po Si delved into the subtle nuances of this classic that dealt with the life of Kannagi and Kovalan, two ordinary persons who had extraordinary qualities. He is the one responsible to spread Silappathikaram to the length and breadth of Tamilnadu, even among the common man. He conducted the 'Silappathikara Vizha' in 1950 for the first time in Tamil history. From 1950 onwards, Ma Po Si’s Tamil Arasu Kazhagam has been celebrating this festival every year. 

 

I am very happy that his daughter Madhavi Baskeran has revived this tradition in 2013, through a Trust run by her in the name of her father.

 

Similarly, Ma Po Si wrote “Kappalottiya Thamizhan” a biography of V.O. Chidambaram Pillai that became very popular with the  masses. This book was so popular that V.O.Chidambaram Pillai was subsequently remembered by all as 'Kappalottiya Thamizhan'. 

 

Ma Po Si was also instrumental in reviving the public interest in Kattabomman. Ma Po Si wrote his  biography based on which a Tamil movie was made  for which Ma Po Si wrote the screenplay. 

 

He drew philosophical strength from the great saint of the 19th century – Ramalinga Adigal popularly known as Vallalar.  His writings on Vallalar and interpretation of the great saint’s world-view remain unparalleled and won him the Sahitya Akademi Award. 

 

Vallalar himself got his inspiration from one of the greatest sages of India - ‘Thirumoolar’, who lived about two thousand years ago, inspiring Tamil poets and philosophers over the centuries. He propagated the idea of “Ondre Kulam, Oruvanae Dhevan’ (Humanity is one community – There is only one God).

 

Ma Po Si was a great chronicler of events, not only the biographies of legendary figures he admired but also of events that shaped India as we know today.


""Viduthalai Poril Thamizhagam"" is a great compilation by him on the role of Tamilnadu in the Nationalistic movement. It details the participation of Tamilnadu people in freedom struggle that took place in the first half of twentieth century. It is  an encyclopedia of Nationalists hailing from the modern Tamilnadu.

 

He was a staunch believer in the need to strengthen the traditional roots through extensive use of mother tongues and Indian languages. He loved Tamil language and culture and gave the clarion call that resonated in every Tamil home. ""Engum Tamil - Edhilum Tamil"" meaning ""Tamil Everywhere - Tamil Everything"". This was not a mere slogan but a reflection of his inner self. It gained tremendous popularity and is being echoed by every political party.

 

Even before the independence, in 1946 itself, Shri Ma.Po.Si started a movement called 'Tamil Arasu Kazhagam' and demanded proper status for Tamil in administration and education.

 

His political party had a unique way of functioning. Theirs was the only party to conduct a literary discourse on the previous day and conduct the political conference the next day morning.

 

Ma Po Si is indeed a versatile personality who has left an indelible impression on the history of Tamil Nadu and India.  His ideas and vision are as relevant today as they were when he espoused them.

 

The need to preserve and propagate the best in our ancient literary and cultural heritage, the inclusive humanitarian approach to development, the care and concern for the common citizens and above all, recognizing the diversity and richness of each state within the national context are most relevant issues for each one of us even today.

 

While there are many books about Ma Po Si, the one by his dedicated daughter Madhavi Bhaskaran titled, “Arignargalin Parvayil Ma Po Si” is really a commendable effort to portray the person and the noble ideas and ideals he lived by in a lucid and engaging style. I congratulate her on this great contribution.

 

I am privileged to launch this book today and dedicate it to the people of our country. There are so many things we can learn from the lives of great people like Ma Po Si.

 

Silambu Selvar Dr. Ma. Po. Si has left behind a rich legacy for us.

 

As Tiruvalluvar says,


“పెరుమై ఉడయవర్ ఆట్రు వార్ ఆట్రిన్ అరుమై ఉడయ్య సెయ్యల్ “

 

(Great men do rare deeds in a proper and perfect way)

 

 

The great and rare deeds of this will remain etched in our collective consciousness.

 

They provide the inspiration for all of us to shape our lives better.

 

They illumine our paths by a value system that can bring greater fulfillment and harmony in our lives.

 

The strong humanistic thread that has been spun by the great visionary leaders like Ma Po Si can bring diverse people together to strive for a better future.

 

I am sure Ma Po Si’s family will continue their efforts to spread the invaluable message he has left behind for the entire humanity.

 

I hope the Government of Tamil Nadu and the Government of India will create greater awareness about legends like Ma Po Si across the country.

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu told graduating doctors that quality and compassion as well as ethics and equity should be the guiding principles that light their path in life. He was addressing the 9th Annual Convocation of the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER), in Puducherry today. JIPMER is a 200 year centre of excellence in medical education and patient care and is among the top five medical schools in India.

 

The Vice President appreciated the institution for managing a hospital that caters to the poorest of poor where 90% of the treatment is totally free. He added that this 6th best hospital in the country would be a great boon to the poor people of the region including those from neighboring states. He also congratulated the institution for the large number of innovations they have initiated in Tele-Medicine and teleconferencing services, connecting themselves to almost all medical colleges in India and the BIMSTEC Countries.

 

The Vice President said that JIPMER should aspire to become a model for health systems in India through innovations in education, patient-oriented research and service excellence, in tune with their mission statement which speaks about compassion, ethics and selfless service. He observed that the frontiers of medicine were expanding continuously and rapidly. Hence the graduates should be always open to new learning and be active researchers, innovators and thinkers in addition to being lifelong students of their chosen disciplines.

 

The Vice President lauded the yeoman service for the treatment of cancer done by the Regional Cancer Centre which provided expensive treatments like bone marrow transplantation and Rapid Arc High Technology totally free of cost. Appreciating the good work done by the alumni of JIPMER, he urged them to serve their alma mater and the patients it cared for.

 

Describing the transformative phase India is going through, the Vice President suggested that we should focus more and more on expanding basic services, including health care, to all our citizens. He added that forging public private partnerships actively could help accelerate the progress. Reminding the graduates that the healthcare needs of our vast and diverse population were huge, he requested them to never compromise when it comes to making affordable and quality healthcare accessible to all. 

 

Wishing the graduating students, the faculty and the institution the very best, the Vice President said that the young doctors had the knowledge and skills needed to transform human lives, having been mentored in a great institution like JIPMER. He reminded them to always have a ready smile for the sick and infirm who would be looking for a smile and a kind word. He added that doctors could bring hope to the most desperate. 

 

The Lt. Governor of Puducherry, Dr. Kiran Bedi, the Chief Minister of Puducherry, Shri. V. Narayanasamy, the Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare, Shri J.P. Nadda, the Minister for Health, Puducherry, Shri. Malladi Krishna Rao, the Leader of Opposition, Puducherry Legislative Assembly, Shri N. Rangasamy, doctors and medical students and their parents were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

I am happy to be here on the momentous occasion of the 9th Annual Convocation of this illustrious Institution that has grown over the last 200 years into a centre of excellence in medical education and patient care. 

 

I am very happy that Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER) is among the top five medical schools in India.

 

It is not only imparting undergraduate and postgraduate medical training but is also managing a hospital that provides inexpensive medical care to a large number of patients. 

 

Established in 1823 by the French government, it was one of the earliest institutions of tropical medicine. Later, for a short period it was called the Dhanvantari Medical College, and finally on July 13, 1964, it was rechristened as the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research. 

 

It is gratifying to note that JIPMER has completed a decade as an Institution of National Importance and is now ranked as the Third Best Medical College in the country.

 

Dear faculty members and students,

 

You have set for yourself a broad vision to become a “model for health systems in India through innovations in education, patient-oriented research, population health and service excellence”.

 

Guided by this vision, you have been making consistent efforts, as you have mentioned in your mission statement, “to develop compassionate, ethically sound health professionals and provide service of the highest order across the health care continuum”. I congratulate the Director and his team for all the efforts they have been making in shaping this institution as an institution of excellence. 

 

Building an institution is a long, arduous process in which the entire team must work towards a common goal. Cooperation and collaboration, initiative and innovation, reflection and reform are key elements that can make an organization grow in stature.

 

Today, I am glad to note that about 200 students are graduating from the two campuses of JIPMER.  I congratulate each one of them on their successful completion of a rigorous course of study. 

 

I congratulate the dedicated faculty who have mentored them over the course of the last few years and the proud parents of all the students who have selflessly contributed to their success.

 

Dear students,

 

You are fortunate to be among the select few in this country to have had the benefit of such a high quality education. 

 

I am sure you have received excellent grounding in the fundamentals of medicine and are ready to specialize in the fields of your choice. With the frontiers of knowledge expanding continuously and rapidly, you need to develop the capacity to access and absorb the latest from around the world. 

 

You must not only be aware of the innovations in medicine but also be active researchers and thinkers who will be able to add to the pool of knowledge and expertise so that you emerge as frontline leaders in your chosen domains.

 

I do hope you will keep the spirit of curiosity and yearning for excellence alive throughout your professional careers.

 

Dear faculty members and students,

 

It gave me great pleasure to learn that this Institute has achieved great progress in research and there are various national and international collaborations on projects as well as filing of patents. Under the able guidance of your President Dr. Bhan who is a great academician and researcher, I am sure this Institute will scale new heights.

 

I am pleased that the hospital services of this Institute are rated very high and you have been ranked the 6th Best Hospital in the country. The OPD attendance of nearly 10,000 patients per day, the Emergencies of nearly 1000 per day and even the deliveries of nearly 100 per day stand testimony to the confidence reposed by the patients coming from Puducherry and the adjoining districts of Tamil Nadu and even from the neighbouring states of Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. I am told that this Institute caters to the poorest of poor and over 90% of the treatment is totally free. This is really a great boon to the poor people of this region.

 

It is gratifying to note the number of innovations you have initiated in tele-Medicine and teleconferencing services connecting your institution with almost all medical colleges in India and to the BIMSTEC Countries.

 

I foresee a bright future for this Institute which is clearly poised for great growth in the areas of organ transplantation and trauma care services.

 

I am happy that the Government of Puducherry has allotted a 50 Acre Land for the Second Campus which will specifically cater to the establishment of these centres. The Karaikal and Yanam Centres of this Institute would be additional feathers in the cap of this institution serving the poor people in these area of the UT of Puducherry. 

 

The Regional Cancer Centre has done yeoman service for the treatment of cancer especially to the poor patients by providing expensive treatments like bone marrow transplantation, Rapid Arc High Technology, radiotherapy and chemotherapy totally free.

 

Dear faculty members and students,

 

I am told that you have an active JIPMER alumni some of whom are present for this event today. Today, all of you, new graduates, will be joining this proud and accomplished group. You will have ample opportunities to serve your alma mater and the patients it serves. I hope you will take keen interest in the growth of this Institute even after you leave its portals.

 

Dear students, 

 

Our country is in a transformational phase. We are focusing more and more on expanding basic services, including health care, to all our citizens and we are seeking to actively forge public private partnerships to accelerate progress.

 

The healthcare needs of our vast and diverse population are huge. Any visit to our primary healthcare centres or super specialty hospitals like yours and AIIMS, makes it clear that there is so much more to be done. The access to quality healthcare is not yet universal. Nor is high quality treatment affordable to many segments of the population. In order to deliver good quality health care to every one and make it affordable, the Government of India has initiated the ambitious Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana recently. It is an unprecedented initiative in scope and scale. Effective implementation of this programme can change the heath care landscape in India. In this great thrust towards affordable quality health care, institutions like yours have a key role play. 

 

In fact, I am glad that JIPMER has been at the forefront of providing excellent health care at affordable cost to a vast multitude of our population for a long time.

 

In addition to continuing your good work, I urge you to move into a higher leadership orbit.

 

I believe that even for the best, there is always a possibility to be better.

 

I would like to see more focus on original research and patient centered clinical transformation. 

 

Let quality and compassion as well as ethics and equity be your guiding principles and touchstones of progress.

 

Dear faculty members and students,

 

I wish you all the very best in your future endeavour. You have the knowledge and skills needed to transform human lives. 

 

You have been mentored in this great institute by some of the best academic leaders. 

 

You are now stepping out into the real world where the sick and infirm will be looking for a smile, a kind word and medical intervention that will restore them to good health. 

 

Believe me, there can be no greater challenge than this in the world. Nor can there be a greater opportunity.

 

You can make a difference between hope and despair. 

You can make a person’s life more livable and enjoyable. 

You can make the pain and suffering more bearable. 

You can add new meaning to life.

 

I am sure you have opted for this profession because you have the ‘aptitude’ for this exacting but exciting work. 

 

I hope your professors have inculcated the ‘attitude’ necessary to carry out the responsibilities you are about to shoulder.

 

I am confident that you will reach the ‘altitude’ you aim for in your professional career if you can keep your sight clearly on your goals and take firm confident steps with passion, compassion and ceaseless quest for greater competence.

 

My best wishes to each one you.

 

Jai Hind!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the private sector must come forward in health-care sector in India to fulfill the health-care requirements of the whole nation. He was addressing the 43rd National Conference of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons of India with the theme “Innovate, inspire, integrate”, in Chennai today.

The Vice President said that Science & Technology has been part of India’s culture right from the ancient times and we invented zero, place values, algebra, concept of atom, calculation of eclipses, among others. ‘Sushruta Samhita’ talks of surgery while Charak describes hundreds of diseases, their causes and treatment methods, he added.

Saying the budding maxillofacial surgeons of today have a wider surgical horizon to explore, the Vice President said that the role of an oral and maxillofacial surgeon in the society is of paramount importance and indispensable, especially during the time of tragic accidents or oral cancers.

Showing concern over the present youth not wearing the helmets while riding motorbikes, the Vice President said that helmets protect from severe injuries to head and face in the unfortunate case of an accident. Wearing a helmet should be a matter of habit, he said. A road accident occurs every 3.5 minutes in India and over-speeding, mobile phone usage while driving and drivers’ fatigue caused the maximum number of road accidents in India and the youth are the most vulnerable to such incidents, he added. He cautioned the youth who enjoy high speed chases on motorbikes to be aware of the dangers of high speed. He added that they have a valuable life and bright future and do not let go of it for momentary happiness – Drive safe!    

The Vice President said that India is the “oral cancer” capital of the world and it is among the top three cancers in India in terms of its incidence. This creates a responsibility for the oral and maxillofacial surgeons not only to treat this disease but also help in preventing the occurrence of oral cancer by increasing anti-tobacco awareness, he added.

The Vice President urged the healthcare professionals to encourage people to go for early and regular medical checkups. Lack of early identification and diagnosis often leads to patients seeking care only in the terminal stages, he said. Steps must be taken to reduce the cost of oral & maxillofacial surgery and make it affordable to common man, including those in rural areas, he added.   

The Vice President said that early detection is crucial for any disease, more so for cancer. Although preventive, curative and palliative care programmes have been initiated at national and regional levels, these measures seem to be too negligible for combating the spread of cancer, he said. Unaffordable healthcare is a serious social handicap and Ayushman Bharat scheme would be a real boon to the poor and the needy, he added.

The Vice President urged all healthcare professionals to create awareness regarding the maxillofacial treatment procedures and highlight them at all medical facilities including PHCs. There is a need to lay down a strong referral network to address them at the nearest district hospital where a specialized OMF service can be set up, he added.

The Minister for Fisheries and Personnel & Administrative Reforms, Tamil Nadu, Shri D. Jayakumar, the President, Dental Council of India, Dr. Dibyendu Mazumdar, the President, Japanese Society of OMS, Dr. Mihikiki Kogo, the President of AOMSI, Dr. Philip Mathrew and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It gives me immense pleasure to be here in this knowledge city of Chennai to interact with doctors at the annual conference of the Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons of India (AOMSI).  I congratulate the organizers for choosing “Innovate, inspire, integrate” as theme of the conference.   

I am told that the conference offers a wide spectrum of topics for scientific interactions – ranging from minor surgical procedures to recent innovations like computer assisted surgery, intra operative navigation and robotic surgery.

I was informed that the AOMSI and its Japanese counterpart the Japanese Society of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons (JSOMS) are signing a MoU for collaborations in research, knowledge transfer and student exchange programs. My best wishes to them. It is essential that countries like Japan and India both with a great history of medical genius must exchange knowledge. 

Friends, Science & Technology has been part of India’s culture and tradition. The scientific bent of mind in ancient India was reflected right from the use of zero, place values, algebra, concept of atom, calculation of eclipses, among others. ‘Sushruta Samhita’ talks of surgery while Charak describes hundreds of diseases, their causes and treatment methods. Our medicinal forms such as Ayurveda gave solutions to the most complex health problems. 

I am happy that doctors gathered here are discussing about an important specialty of dentistry - Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS).  It involves the diagnosis and surgical management of various diseases and conditions affecting the mouth, jaws, face, head and neck. The surgery is done to establish harmony between a person’s upper and lower jaws. 

Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) as a specialty originally began in the UK and USA in the late 1800s as a branch of dentistry called oral surgery which primarily handled trauma and diseases of the teeth and the mouth.

The specialty in India took its roots in Mumbai when Prof Ginwalla completed his training from Canada under Dr Risdon and established the first formal training program in India for Oral Surgery.

Currently the specialty has been re designated as Oral & Maxillofacial surgery. The budding maxillofacial surgeons of today have a wider surgical horizon to explore; extending from the practice of surgery of  mouth and jaws  to surgery of the head and neck, bony orbit(bone around the eyes) and the cranium(bones of the skull).

Dear friends, role of an oral and maxillofacial surgeon in the society is of paramount importance and indispensable, especially during the time of tragic accidents or oral cancers.

The definition of an ideal surgeon according to the great surgeon Sushrutaa is: “A person who possesses courage and presence of mind, a hand free from perspiration, tremor less grip of sharp and good instruments and who carries his operations to the success and advantage of his patient who has entrusted his life to the surgeon. The surgeon should respect this absolute surrender and treat his patient as his own son.”

The core spectrum of work which falls within the purview of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery includes the treatment for problems associated with the oral cavity, restoration of missing teeth, birth defects of the head and face and injuries cased due to accidents, among others.

A recent study has revealed that not using helmet caused severe injuries to head, face. It should be understood by one and all that wearing helmet is not for the police, it is for our own protection.

According to government estimates, a road accident occurs every 3.5 minutes in India. Over-speeding, mobile phone usage while driving and drivers’ fatigue caused the maximum number of road accidents in India in 2017, data released by the government showed.

More than three out of four (76 percent) of the accidents happened because of over speeding, nearly one in five (18 percent) road mishaps took place because of using mobile phones during driving.

Overall, road accidents in the country fell by two percent, year-on-year, from 4,80,652 (2016) to 4,70,975 (2017) but Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of accidents totalling close to 75,000, followed by Madhya Pradesh (57,532) and Karnataka (52,961).

In all the cases, it was found that the youth were the most vulnerable to such incidents. In 2017, 73,793 people, aged between 18 and 35 met with accident. The number was 69,851 the previous year. This is serious and we cannot lose youth who are our future and the pillars of our national development.

Here I would like to caution our young generation who enjoy high speed on a motorbike to be aware of the dangers of high speed. You have a valuable life and bright future. Do not let go of it for momentary happiness. – Drive safe!    

Injuries or defects on face not only cause pain but take people into trauma and high degree of emotional stress. It will also have a severe psychological impact on those suffering and their parents.

In such cases maxillofacial surgery comes as a relief. Since the surgery is on the visible parts of the body, it requires utmost care. The science and art of treating these injuries requires special training involving a “hands on” experience and an understanding of how the treatment provided will influence the patient’s long-term function and appearance.

Now, I would like to talk about the most pressing problem of this time and age, oral cancer. India is the “oral cancer” capital of the world. It is among the top three cancers in India in terms of its incidence. Approximately 20 persons in 100,000 suffer from oral cancer and 90% of this is attributable to the use of tobacco in different forms.

This creates a responsibility for the oral and maxillofacial surgeons not only to treat this disease but also help in preventing the occurrence of oral cancer by increasing anti-tobacco awareness. Reports suggest that 30% of cancers in India are oral cancers and require the professional services of a maxillofacial surgeon. But lack of facilities, care and lack of early identification and diagnosis leads to patients seeking care only in the terminal stages. This leads to poor prognosis and high rates of cancer related deaths.

Dear friends, early detection is crucial for any disease, more so for cancer. Although preventive, curative and palliative care programmes have been initiated at national and regional levels, these measures seem to be too negligible for combating the spread of cancer.

Documented findings reveal mammoth proportions of cancer growth which warrants not only scientific, but also sustained and consistent efforts with appropriate planning, monitoring and evaluation of cancer control programmes.

While the incidence of cancer has been increasing worldwide, developing nations like India are showing steep increase over the years. In India, it is estimated that there are about 30 lakh cases of cancer at any particular point of time with 10 lakh new cases occurring every year. About 5 lakh deaths occur annually in the country due to cancer in India.

According to projections of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in 2016, the total number of new cases is expected to touch 17.3 lakh by 2020. It has been estimated that the number of deaths due to cancer is likely to reach 8.8 lakh cases by 2020. Breast cancer was the most common among women, while the incidence of mouth cancer was highest among men. Clearly, this is a major healthcare challenge that needs to be adequately and effectively addressed.

I advice all the people present in this august gathering to encourage people to go for early and regular medical checkups. Lack of early identification and diagnosis often leads to patients seeking care only in the terminal stages.  Steps must be taken to reduce the cost of oral & maxillofacial surgery and make it affordable to common man, including those in rural areas. 

As you all are aware, technology-driven modern healthcare is becoming increasingly expensive. 

As per the World Development Indicators, out of total expenditure on health in India, only 30 per cent is contributed by the public sector. Remaining 70 per cent of the expenditure is borne through private expenditure. Of the Household expenditure on health, it is estimated that 95 per cent is out-of-pocket expenditure borne directly by the individuals at points of health services, while the remaining 5 per cent goes towards insurance.

As regards out-of-pocket expenditure, 52 per cent expenditure is towards medicines, 22 per cent towards hospitalization at a private hospital and 10 per cent goes for diagnostic labs. It is a matter of concern that in many instances families were pushed into debt trap by high costs of medical treatment. 

Unaffordable healthcare is a serious social handicap and Ayushman Bharat scheme would be a real boon for the poor and needy sections of the society. It is a transformative healthcare scheme seeks to provide insurance coverage of Rs 5 lakh per family will cover 10 crore marginalized and vulnerable families for secondary and tertiary healthcare. 

The Private sector must also come forward in health-care sector in India to fulfil the health-care requirements of the whole nation. Corporate sector must also take keen interest in improving the healthcare situation in the country by turning their CSR funds.  Sharing and Caring are essential to Indian culture and such culture must be taken forward by helping the needy. We must ensure that the poorest of the poor get benefits of government and societal initiatives.   

In conclusion, I urge all of you to create awareness regarding the maxillofacial treatment procedures and highlight them at all medical facilities including PHCs.

There is a need to lay down a strong referral network to address them at the nearest district hospital where a specialized OMF service can be set up.

I hope the conference of the Association of Oral Surgeons of India (AOMSI) would throw light on all the pressing problems and would help you come out with solutions.                             

In the end, I would like to congratulate the organizers for their efforts to bring in all medical professionals together.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the private sector can play a huge role in accelerating the pace of inclusive development of India. He was addressing the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of the prestigious Tamil Chamber of Commerce and presented the Tamil Chamber & Chozha Naachiar Foundation Exim Awards, in Chennai today. The Minister for Fisheries and Personnel & Administrative Reforms, Tamil Nadu, Shri D. Jayakumar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that the stalwarts of the Tamil Chamber of Commerce have played a great part in the growth and welfare of commerce and industry while simultaneously extending its arms to help the needy and to ensure the general welfare of the community. He further said that the people of Tamil Nadu are well known for their business acumen and entrepreneurship from as early as the Sangam period of Tamil History. The Tamil epithet, 'Yadoom Voorey Yavarum Keleer' meaning, 'All places are ours, all people are ours' has been inscribed on the walls of the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, bearing testimony to the cosmopolitan nature of Tamil people, he added.

The Vice President said that the chambers of commerce act as bridges that connect the governments and the industry in creating conducive atmosphere for the businesses to thrive and produce wealth.

Saying the chambers should be conscience keepers of the private sector, the Vice President said that there are a number of areas where the private sector should be mature enough to undertake self regulation. The Chambers must hand hold them into a path of self- responsibility, he said. The Chamber should encourage businesses to be truthful and disciplined and practice restraint and self regulation when it comes to matters such as responsible waste disposal, use of chemicals and pesticides, maintenance of standards in food processing etc, he added.

The Vice President said that the profit should not be the only motive of business and the chamber should also work to make sure that vulnerable sections of the population are given equal opportunities when it comes to business. He further said that the the industry should strive its best to end discrimination especially against women. A woman's pregnancy simply cannot be grounds for stalling her professional development and it is unethical and inhuman, he added.

The Vice President stressed on the need for the special focus placed upon Micro, small and medium enterprises and cottage industries. Small industries are as crucial as transnational corporations which earn precious foreign exchange are, because they empower the poorest, the weakest, the most vulnerable, he added.

Saying the Chambers of Commerce should encourage the private sector to take up social responsibility, the Vice President said that when corporates become generous, they achieve wonders and Indian corporates do have a history of great generosity of spirit. He also said that Chambers of Commerce  also have to encourage and nurture entrepreneurship and the government of India wants the youth of today to 'stand up' on their own two feet. Entrepreneurship makes people job creators and brings about general prosperity, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to be a part of the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of the prestigious Tamil Chamber of Commerce and to present the Tamil Chamber & Chozha Naachiar Foundation Exim Awards.

I understand that the Chamber was started in the year 1944 by the great son of Tamil Nadu Dr. R.K.Shanmugam Chetty, the First Finance Minister of Independent India who represented India in the Brettonwood Conference, USA on money matters. This crucial conference eventually paved the way for the formation of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. It is a matter of pride that the Tamil Chamber has a small but significant role to play in the formation of the two International organisations. Stalwarts of the Chamber have played a great part in the growth and welfare of the commerce and industry. From the galaxy of its activities and events mentioned by the President of the Chamber Mr. Chozha Naachiar Rajasekar in his Welcome Address, I gather that the chamber is in the forefront of commerce, encouraging the growth of commerce and industry and extending its arms in to help the needy and to ensure the general welfare of the community.

It is important to mention that the Former President of the Tamil Chamber Late Thiru Nagappa Chettiar played an instrumental role in the formation of Central Leather Research Institute, Chennai. After Independence, he fought with the British Leather Auctioneers for opening letter of credit in the name of Indian Exporters instead of treating them like  commission agents. Through this landmark initiative, he earned a soaring reputation and a recognition for the leather exporters from India.

The History of the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce cannot be chronicled without including the economic and commercial history of Tamil People and the story of their determination, perseverance and industriousness. The people of Tamil Nadu are well known for their business acumen and entrepreneurship from as early as the Sangam period of Tamil History. It has been recorded that since ancient times the Tamil community went abroad crossing barriers of land and ocean and traded with people in far off countries, true to the Tamil saying “Thirai Kadal Odiyum Diraviyam Thedu” meaning “Cross even the vast ocean in search of wealth”. During the Chozha Dynasty, Raja Raja Chozhan created a Naval Force to protect the Maritime Trade from the sea pirates, which played a major role in conquering Java, Sumatra and Ceylon. As another Tamil saying goes, “Yadoom Voorey Yavarum Keleer” meaning “All places are ours, All people are ours”. The people of Tamil Nadu and our whole country should feel proud that this epithet has been inscribed and displayed on the walls of the headquarters of the United Nations in New York. Just like the Tamil people, word of Tamil glory also crosses seven oceans.

While browsing the history, Chozha Dynasty is the only dynasty in India which nurtured Maritime trade and commerce across the world from the Southern tip of our country. They built a powerful navy, ships and improved the maritime trade relations with many parts of the world by sending business delegation to several countries. The Chozha Dynasty had trade relation not only with Asian countries but also with China and other European countries. In those days, swearing-in-ceremony of the Chozha Kings was done by the Chief of the Traditional trader family by placing a crown on the King’s head. Such was the power and clout of Tamil traders. In the Chozha Dynasty, King Kulothunga Chozhan I had the title “Sungam Thavirtha Chozhan” , the chola who ended tax, for his landmark decision to exempt traders from paying customs duty. There was a visionary ‘Free Port Policy’ during his regime about a 1000 years ago.

I am extremely happy, that The Tamil Chamber of Commerce is organizing field and factory visits to industries in and around South India and abroad. It is a unique initiative as it gives members knowledge about industries and an exposure to the best practices adopted in world class factories. I congratulate the Chamber for visiting 56 industries so far.

I am also pleased to know that the Tamil Chamber of Commerce led a business delegation to a number of foreign countries to promote bilateral trade relationships.

The Chamber is organizing EXIM Achievement Awards function in association with Chozha Naachiar Foundation since 2010 and I have to mention here the fact all the awards were given based on merit only with the statistical performance data derived from Customs and Ports. This is a laudable initiative. When I went through the list of awardees, I could not help but notice that most of the awardees are from automotive sectors from Chennai. Chennai is also called the “Detroit of Asia”. There are awardees from Government departments, Customs, Navy, Coast Guard, Public Sectors like Ports and private players like Shipping, Logistics, EXIM trade, container freight station, warehouses, and banks too.

I appreciate the chamber for instituting Dr. Nalli Awards in the category of Best Weaver and Best Designer in Silk Sarees and a number of other awards for excellence.

I am happy to know that the Chamber is represented in Customs, Central Excise, GST, Railways, Port and other departments of Central and State Governments and taking the issues of trade and industry forward.

The world is changing at a rapid pace aided by technological and digital revolutions. Any nation unable to keep pace with the changes will become obsolete. India is at the threshold of becoming one of the major economic powers and the private sector can play a huge role in accelerating the growth and development of the country.

Tamil Nadu is among the States which are in the forefront of industrialization. It is rich in agriculture, rich in resources and endowed with abundant human capital. This State is known, among others, for the automotive, leather and textiles industries and the hard working nature of the population. To spur growth, we have to improve infrastructure, resource efficiency and promote innovative technologies.

Reformative measures like the introduction of GST will improve the economy in the long run, although there might be some teething problems in the initial stages of implementation. We are now truly one nation, one tax. Tax overlaps and cascades will not hamper tax calculation and collection anymore. With increasing emphasis on online and app based filings and submissions, the scope for evasion and corruption would be diminished significantly. In the end, such reforms will also benefit all the consumers and will hasten commercial activity, ultimately leading to growth and  development.

I am happy to share with you the ambitious, transformative vision that is making India one of the most favorite investment destinations in the world. Indian economy, growing at around 8%, currently is one of the fastest growing major economies of the world. Over the past half a decade, India has witnessed a positive swing in stock market indices, foreign exchange reserves and public investment in infrastructure.

Sisters and brothers,

We in India, are committed to build a five trillion-dollar economy by 2025, making India the 3rd largest consumer market in the world. This grand dream cannot be achieved until India’s vibrant, dynamic private sector joins hands with the government.

The latest report of the World Bank has forecast that the economy is projected to grow at 7.3 per cent in 2018-19 and 7.5 per cent in the next two years. 

As the World Bank has noted in its latest report, “India’s growth in recent years has been supported by prudent macroeconomic policy: a new inflation targeting framework, energy subsidy reforms, fiscal consolidation, higher quality of public expenditure and a stable balance of payment situation. In addition, recent policy reforms have helped India improve the business environment, ease inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and improve credit behavior.”

India has climbed 30 places in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index this year and IMF has forecast that India will grow at more than 7 percent in 2018 and 2019, ahead of other major economies.

A number of economic reforms have been undertaken by Indian Government including digitisation of the economy. More than 326 million persons have opened bank accounts in the last four years making financial inclusion a reality. Tax base has been widened and tax compliance has increased. The policy initiatives taken by the Indian government such as Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Smart Cities and Start-up India are opening up new opportunities.

We have seen a strong global confidence in the India story with a surge in Foreign Direct Investments which reached over US $ 62 billion in 2017-18. We are moving away from red tape to red carpet and making procedures simple and transparent.

Chambers act as bridges that connect the governments and the industry in creating conducive atmosphere for the businesses to thrive and produce wealth. The chambers should be conscience keepers of the private sector. There are a number of areas where the private sector should be mature enough to undertake self regulation. Environmental compliance audits being one example. We are at a juncture where uncontrolled development has caused almost irreversible ecological and environmental damage.

The Chamber should encourage businesses to be truthful and disciplined and practice restraint and self regulation when it comes to matters such as responsible waste disposal, use of chemicals and pesticides, maintenance of standards in food processing etc. It is for the collective good of the planet. Profit should not be the only motive of business. Business ethics should take prominence. The foundations of business ethics should be laid right from our business schools.

The chamber should also work to make sure that Indian businesses are inclusive and that vulnerable sections of the population are given equal opportunities. One often hears stories about how our women struggle to shatter the ‘glass ceiling’. The industry should strive its best to end discrimination especially against women. A woman’s pregnancy cannot be grounds for stalling her professional development. It is unethical and inhuman. It is up to the chamber to act as guardians to those who are wronged in such a manner.

There should also be special focus placed upon Micro, small and medium enterprises and cottage industries. The chamber should work to promote self help groups, especially that of women. The success story of Kudumbashree in Kerala and the way it transformed the lives of ordinary women who gained not only the much needed financial independence but also gained the respect that they rightfully deserved. It is an example worth emulating. Small industries are as crucial to our economy as transnational corporations which earn precious foreign exchange are. The reason being that they empower the poorest, the weakest, the most vulnerable. By encouraging cottage industries, we have to make our rural areas hubs of thriving economic activity, thereby ending distress migration.

Chambers of commerce should also focus on innovations, especially when it comes to agriculture. Our agriculture is not sustainable and lacks the much needed forward and backward linkages. You should take students and labs to the field and give the farmers the advantage of modern technology. You should create efficient supply chains and cold storage systems. The crisis in agriculture can be and must be ended and you have a crucial role to play here. Make the dream of doubling farmers’ incomes by 2022 possible.

Another one of your crucial mandates is to encourage the private sector to be more generous when it comes to their social responsibility and not limit themselves to their mandated CSR spending. The core of Indian philosophy is sharing and caring. We have to nurture and mould our private sector to share their wealth and care for the less fortunate. When corporate become generous, they achieve wonders and Indian corporates do have a history of great generosity of spirit.

You also have to encourage and nurture entrepreneurship. The government of India wants the youth of today to ‘stand up’ on their own two feet. Entrepreneurship makes people ‘job creators’. It has a multiplying effect on employment generation and contributes to general prosperity. Chambers of commerce also play a formulating role in advising the governments in enacting legislations and regulations that promote ease of doing business rather than act as strangulations.

I am confident this organization with its present band of enthusiastic soldiers of service will stand up to the occasion and work for the commerce and industries community and also the entire community as a whole.

My congratulations to Tamil Chamber of Commerce for celebrating the Platinum Jubilee and I wish them the best in all their future missions.

Thank you.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has stressed on the need to provide education that inculcates values, morals and ethics. He said that Education is not just accumulation of knowledge from textbooks and quoted Albert Einstein saying that education is not just the learning of facts but the training of the mind to think.

Delivering the Annual Convocation address at the prestigious Presidency College in Chennai today, the Vice President lauded the contributions made by the noted alumni of the institution.  He appreciated the college for their policy of inclusive education and for their zeal in promoting research and scientific spirit.

The Vice President said that that sometimes, asking the right questions is more important than having the right answers. He urged the students to grow up with courage and conviction to question the irrational and critique the illogical. He added that students should develop the moral fibre and strength of character to have and hold their own opinions and viewpoints.

The Vice President assured them that marks obtained in texts and examinations were not true measures of their calibre. He insisted that the students never restrict themselves from pursuing their goals because of their marks.

The Vice President said that young graduates should know how to work in a team and learn to trust and be trustworthy. He commented that nothing was more important than developing the ability to put the needs of the group ahead of one's personal requirements. Students should be well-rounded people, they should develop a taste in arts, in music, in painting and in dancing. He added that art would refresh, relax and comfort a person and grant solace.

Asking the youngsters to be responsive to the needs of the less fortunate, the Vice President asked them to develop the habit of caring and sharing from a young age. He also asked them to adopt noble missions such as Swachh Bharat and take lead in making India clean. Such initiatives should take the shape of a people's movement to realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi, he added.

The Minister for Fisheries and Personnel and Administrative Reforms, Tamil Nadu, Shri D. Jayakumar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. More than 1000 students, faculty members and researchers were present at the convocation that witnessed the presence of the Vice President.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It gives me great pleasure to be here amidst all of you on the momentous occasion of the convocation, the day that marks the successful culmination of the students’ journey in the prestigious Presidency College and their graduation. Convocation is a crucial rite of passage, a critical juncture in the life of any student. At the outset, let me congratulate each and every one of the young graduates on their achievement.

The convocation day is important not only to students, but also to the teachers who toiled to bring forth the best in every pupil, to the college who would be adding  several more illustrious names to the glorious list of alumni and to the parents of the graduating students whose countless sacrifices bear fruit today. 

Dear students,

It is truly the day when dreams come true. When you, the students stepping out of the portals of this great institution, walk up to this dais today to receive your degrees, kindly know that the gown you don today, the cap you wear and the scroll that would be handed over to you, places upon you a great responsibility. 

Apart from building a great career for yourself, you may have to take on the daunting but extremely rewarding task of nation building which would soon be placed in your able hands. It is your hard work, determination, dedication and creativity that will bring the collective aspirations, the billion dreams of this country to fruition.

You are privileged to be graduating from Presidency College which has a history of more than 178 years. It was the first government college in South India established along with the other two Bombay and Calcutta Presidency Colleges by the then British government in 1840. Started merely as a Preparatory School, the institution has blossomed into a centre of excellence for higher education. 

You must be proud of the fact that you belong to an institution that has produced thousands of eminent personalities including Nobel and Abel Laureates, Bharat Ratnas, Padma Shree awardees, SS Bhatnagar awardees, Prominent writers, Celebrities, Bureaucrats, Corporate Administrators, Politicians and Scientists. It is my privilege to mention a few of them - Sir C.V. Raman, the first Nobel prize recipient from India, Abel Laureate Shri Srinivasa Varadhan, Statesmen like Shri C. Rajagopalachari, Smt. R.S. Subbulakshmi, the first woman graduate from the University of Madras, Shri. R. Chidambaram, former Principal Scientific Advisor, General Cariappa and many more. 

Your college has also had a great lineage of illustrious faculty members many of whom were eminent writers, translators and thinkers. The most prominent among them is “Tamil Thaatha” U.V. Swaminatha Iyer. 

The Presidency College, Chennai, also enjoys the reputation of having been the mother of the University of Madras established in the year 1857. 

While initiating the move to start the Presidency College, Lord Elphinstone, the then Governor of Madras Presidency, is reported to have expressed his beautiful vision for the college. He said: “Education is to train and to qualify the native for the higher duties of life in an enlightened nation. If the society is to consist of responsible human beings capable of using their ability and creativity constructively, there must be a solid base for general education.” It is with this mission in mind that the 49 Principals of this college right from Eyre Burton Powell to Dr. R. Ravanan have been striving hard. All their efforts have no doubt enabled this institution to produce thousands of patriotic and socially responsible graduates for the past 178 years.

I am delighted to know that this great institution is home to more than 4000 students. Presidency College today hosts 700 research scholars who are engaged in the pursuit of new knowledge aimed at the betterment of the human condition. 

What is even more heartening about this institution is that more than 90% of the students here hail from socially and economically weaker sections of the society, who are mostly first generation learners. I am told that it is with the help of scholarships given by the both the state and the central governments that the students from rural and poor backgrounds are able to pursue their higher studies. 

Another feather in the cap of this institution is the focus it places of inclusivity. 

It enjoys the privilege of giving quality education to nearly 300 differently abled students in an inclusive set-up. I especially congratulate the differently abled members of the faculty who truly are sources of inspiration to all the youngsters present here. Your service to this great nation makes you really special. As a recognition of its continued efforts to provide quality education without any discrimination, the college has won several accolades.

I am happy to learn that NAAC has honored the college with a 4 Star status and an ‘A’ grade. It is encouraging to note that in the NIRF Ranking recently declared by the Ministry of HRD, Government of India, the Presidency College is placed in the fifth position. 

Friends, 

India today stands at the cusp of a tremendous demographic opportunity. 65% of India’s population is under 35 years of age. For this demographic dividend to be effectively realized, quality education is a necessary precondition.  

Education is not just the accumulation of knowledge from textbooks. Albert Einstein once said that education is not the learning of facts but the training of the mind to think. Sometimes, asking the right questions is more important than having the right answers. 

You should grow up with the courage and conviction to question the irrational and critique the illogical. You should develop the moral fiber and strength of character to shape and develop your own opinions and view points. To develop these qualities and sustain them, you must always remain students at heart, always ready to learn and forever open to new experiences. 

I have always maintained that you as youngsters should never be content with the status quo. 

You should always challenge that which needs to be changed. We today have a government that is very receptive to the voices of the youth, a government that is acutely sensitive to the aspirations of young India and has come forward with a number of diverse schemes ranging from ‘Skill India’ to Make in India to ‘Khelo India’ to leverage the creative energy and zeal of the youth. So, you have a very positive environment around you and an array of great opportunities. It is up to you to make yourself capable of utilizing these opportunities to the fullest possible extent. 

I wish to draw your attention to something I consider important. The marks that you obtain in tests and examinations do matter. They are the manifestations of the excellence you have achieved in your academic pursuits. But they are not the only things that matter. You are much more than those numbers.   So if you are a Chemistry graduate, never stop yourself from playing the violin or studying law.  Please develop your personality in as many ways as you are capable of.

India has since time immemorial been open to absorb the best thoughts from all over the world. You, as youngsters, should imbibe these values in your thoughts, your speech and your actions. In many ways, you are the flag bearers of India before the world. Never compromise on your identity of ‘Indianness’, for it is an identity that is unique and worth possessing. Let humility, tolerance, love and respect for all life be the guiding principles of your life. Rabindranath Tagore once said that “the highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence”. Learn to live in harmony with your fellow human beings and more importantly with nature. Let this harmony that you nurture within you be the harbinger of peace to the world. 

Our country faces a number of challenges today, from rampant poverty to debilitating environmental pollution. These challenges are by no means small or easy to tackle. It is not possible for one single person to tackle these challenges. It will take our combined will power, collective intelligence and shared resources to solve the great problems of our time. 

Always build a team, learn to trust and be trustworthy. There is nothing more important than being a team player, having the ability to work effectively as a part of a group, to be able to put the interests of the group ahead of your personal requirements. 

We are today building ‘Team India’, a new India where development is inclusive and sustainable. This task demands your utter devotion and small but not insignificant sacrifices for the greater good.  

Friends,

I leave you with a parting thought.  Confucius once remarked that real knowledge is to know the extent of one’s ignorance. Along with what you know, be intensely aware of what you don’t know and in this knowledge, may your humility be firmly rooted. 

Quest for excellence, quest for truth, quest for harmony. 

As the Vedic sages have said,

“Arise, awake and stop not till you reach your goal.”

I wish you all the very best in your endeavours.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that family system is the best medicine to protect youngsters from slipping into depression. He was addressing the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of Ethiraj College for Women, in Chennai today. The Minister for Fisheries and Personnel and Administrative Reforms, Tamil Nadu, Shri D. Jayakumar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

 

The Vice President said that there is no better antidote to patriarchy, fundamentalism, extremism and dogmatism than women's education. He stressed on the need to educate the girl child to empower the society. If India has to become a country that lives by the Constitutional values that it espouses, and then it must put girl’s education at the centre of its development efforts, he added.

 

Expressing concern over the disturbing incidents of discrimination gender inequality against women, the Vice President called for strict action against such societal evils.

 

The Vice President said that women empowerment is key to national development and added that India is taking major steps to involve women in India's development journey. He appreciated the contribution of women in national development and said that Indian women have demonstrated excellence in various fields. Be it politics, industry, sports, technology, service or scholarship they established that women, given a chance, are capable of scaling great heights, he added.

 

The Vice President said that education is not only an entry point to economic opportunities but also has positive ripple effects on all other aspects of social development.

 

Talking about the increasing number of depression cases among the youth, the Vice President opined that young people were becoming increasingly aloof from the people around them and absence of experienced advice was pushing youngsters into severe depression. He asked the youngsters to have a regular interaction with elders in the family. Lack interaction at home is depriving them of guidance and support, he said.

 

The Vice President said that excessive use of Internet and Gadgets is disturbing the body clock of young children and depriving them of the required sleep. He asked students and youngsters to follow a strict routine and dedicate time for physical exercise.

 

The Vice President said that Ethiraj College for Women made a modest beginning with 96 girls in 1948 has today grown to become Chennai's largest womens' college with around 8000 students. The college has produced luminaries in the field of entertainment, science and technology and others, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

I am happy to be with all of you today as you celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of one of the nation’s premier women’s institutions. I am indeed pleased that Ethiraj College for Women  which made a modest beginning with 96 girls in 1948 has today grown to become Chennai’s largest women’s college with around 8000 students.

 

The glory of Ethiraj College cannot be chronicled without mentioning its visionary Founder Thiru. V. L. Ethiraj, an eminent lawyer who donated his life’s earnings - Rs.10 lakhs, a mammoth sum in the 1940s - and the title deeds to two of his bungalows, for the cause of  quality education for women.

 

Thiru Ethiraj was tutored by Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the first Vice President of the Republic of India. A magnanimous and a successful barrister, he graduated in Legal Studies from the University of Dublin and upon his return to India, joined the Madras Bar. Within a short period, he built up a lucrative practice, thanks to his knowledge and expertise. He was the first Indian to be appointed as the Crown Prosecutor by the British Government.

 

Even at the zenith of success, the young barrister’s conscience troubled him. He was extremely concerned about the plight of Indian women, who he felt were “depressed, oppressed, and suppressed”. Armed with the generosity of his spirit and a resolute will power, he set out on a crusade to improve their lot. In 1944,as a result of his tireless efforts, the Ethiraj College for Women was born.

 

I am sure Thiru. Ethiraj would be delighted to see that the institution he founded has grown by leaps and bounds over the last 7 decades and, in the course of its growth, has successfully empowered thousands of proud young women.

 

When women thrive, the whole country benefits. If India has to be transformed, and become a country that lives by the Constitutional values of equality and fraternity that it espouses, then if must prioritise education and within education, if must put girls education at the centre of its development efforts. There is no better antidote to patriarchy, fundamentalism, extremism and dogmatism.

 

Thiru. V.L. Ethiraj often said, “Education is a great leveller in the society”. We believe in an inclusive society where we respect and celebrate diversity, where we incorporate various voices and viewpoints. Education is the key instrument for achieving this inclusive society. As a popular proverb goes ‘If you educate a man, you educate an individual, but if you educate a woman, you educate a nation’.

 

Dear students,

 

You belong to a College that has always been known to focus not only on learning from textbooks but also on the all-round development of the students. It is no wonder then, that the alumni of Ethiraj College for Women have excelled in various fields and have done our country proud. To recall a few, Padma Bhushan Padma Subrahmanyan & Padma Bhushan Sudha Raghunathan in Arts, Dipika Pallikal & Joshna Chinappa in Sports, and most recently Dhivya Suryadevara who was appointed the first woman CFO of the iconic General Motors.

 

Indian women have demonstrated excellence in various fields. Be it politics, industry, sports, technology, service or scholarship. Gita Gopinath, Chief Economist in IMF, Arundhati Bhattacharya who headed State Bank of India, Mary Kom, Saina Nehwal, sport stars, Sunitha Williams, Tessy Thomas in the field of space exploration, Major Mithali Madhumitha in defence, have all established that women, given a chance, are capable of scaling great heights. Recently, Indian army has opened up combat roles for women.  It is abundantly clear that our country is taking major steps to involve women in India's development journey.

 

We must get over the societal mind set that views  women as inferior to men. It is against our own ancient philosophical moorings.

 

Ours is a nation that  declared millions of years ago, “Yatra Naaryastu poojyante, Ramante tatra Devataa” (Where women are respected, gods live there and feel happy to be at that place).

 

Ours is a country that has from the Vedic times celebrated learning irrespective of the gender of the person. Names women of scholars  Gargi and Maitreyi stand out as shining examples of women achievers in the glorious heritage we have inherited. Our mythology has a large number of powerful goddesses who killed dreadful demons. For example, we worship  Durga and Saraswati during the Dasara festival and Laxmi during Deepawali.  Most of the rivers in our country have feminine names. Our traditional world view has always held that women are equal to men in all respects. We must revive that spirit once again.

 

As Subramanya Bharathi, one of the greatest sons of our our country and a son of this sacred Tamil land, had said, “World will prosper in knowledge and intellect if both men and women are deemed equal”.

 

The women of India are central to our nation’s development. Institutions like Ethiraj College are playing a significant role in ensuring that young women have access to quality education. Education is not only an entry point to economic opportunities but also has positive ripple effects on all other aspects of social development. This is why the Government of India has focused on girls’ education through its ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ programme.

 

Today, the educated Indian woman is extremely skilful and self-sufficient. She juggles a number of responsibilities with remarkable ease and lives her life on her own terms. There is not one sphere of activity that women have not made a place for themselves in. India has the world’s largest number of professionally qualified women. Women in India have started recognising their true potential. They have excelled in diverse fields ranging from medicine to engineering, from civil services to mountaineering, from research and development to flying fighter aircrafts.  There is no arena which remains unconquered by Indian women.  Professions which were earlier considered to be the forte of men are now no longer their sole preserve and women frequently outperform their male counterparts with ease and élan.

 

There are, however, some disturbing trends and women are subjected in some parts of our country to discrimination and harassment. It is a societal evil that needs to be eradicated with concerted action. We have to usher in a new India where gender equality becomes the norm, where we successfully unleash the full potential of the half a billion strong women force.

 

For India to become a global superpower, the Indian woman needs to be empowered. Institutions like Ethiraj College for Women have a pivotal role to play in equipping women to be the change leaders of tomorrow.

 

I am glad you are moving steadily in that direction.

 

Friends,

 

India is at the cusp of a demographic dividend. 65% of its population is below 35 years. This is an unprecedented opportunity to fast track development.

 

Education does not, by itself make a person employable. Educational institutions must take it upon themselves to impart essential skills to students, including crucial life skills required for the knowledge driven, interconnected world of the 21st century. India has embarked on a mission to skill its vast youth population so that the huge opportunity that the demographic dividend offers is realised most effectively.

 

Schools and colleges must ensure that the children and youth of our country acquire the knowledge and skills that will enable them to become active contributors to building a new India and a new world.

 

They must ensure that the foundations are strong. What we need is the ability to observe and absorb, to assimilate and articulate, to ask questions and seek answers, to decipher and discover. The students must have the zeal to discover new fields of knowledge.  However, they should always have the ‘ethical compass’ handy all the time to make wise decisions.

 

Friends,

 

I am glad to learn that as a recognition of the quality of education it imparts, Ethiraj College for Women was conferred the prestigious “College with Potential for Excellence” status by UGC. In pursuit of excellence in research and in learning exchange activities, the college has signed MoUs with national and international research Institutions and multi-skill universities.

 

I am happy to learn that Ethiraj college has been growing from strength to strength and has been consistently ranked among the top women’s colleges in India in various surveys including the NIRF ranking list by the MHRD and has won numerous awards and accolades.

 

The future belongs to those who dare to dream and have the competence to create a new tomorrow. I hope that Ethiraj College provides the springboard for all to chase their dreams and realise them.

 

I congratulate each and everyone of you who have played a part in the 70 year journey of this great institution and I am sure that the College will nurture and mould many more successful students. I hope many of them will take up powerful and socially relevant roles and be in the vanguard of India’s journey towards a new era of peace, prosperity and inclusive and sustainable development.

 

I wish each are of you all the very best!

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Mahatma Gandhi’s thoughts are of eternal value and would be relevant irrespective of the times. He was addressing the 34th Convocation of the Gandhigram Rural Institute in Dindigul, Tamil Nadu today. 

The Vice President asked teachers, doctors, engineers and other professionals to take pride and prestige in serving in rural areas. Adding that serving in rural areas would help them understand the hardships of people, he urged people to develop an undying fascination for rural service. 

The Vice President argued in favour of providing basic amenities in rural areas on par with urban areas. He insisted that one cannot be denied basic amenities just because he or she is living in a remote area. Our governance and administration should be developed in such a way that the last person living in remotest part of the country should have access to services.   

The Vice President asked the younger generation to be as progressive as the older generation was dogmatic. He expressed hope that the youth of the country would make Gandhiji's dream of a 'castless, classless' society a reality. He warned that it would be an uphill struggle but reassured the students and faculty that the end result would justify the hardships.

The Vice President said that we as a nation could pay tribute to the father of our nation only by eliminating the evils in society such as poverty, untouchability, hidden hunger and by achieving cleanliness. “It is our duty to see that the gap between the rural and urban areas is bridged at the earliest”, he added.

The Vice President said that one cannot think of rural development and community development without talking of the Mahatma and revisiting his vision for India. He lived with people, understood their suffering and came out with mottos to lead a clean and peaceful life, he added.

If the dream of inclusive development has to be realized, we cannot ignore the development gap between urban and rural areas, the Vice President said. He lamented that unequal access to basic facilities, like education, health, drinking water, sanitation, transportation, markets and economic opportunities has created a great divide between the rural and urban areas.

The Vice President presented degrees to students on this occasion. He also conferred Doctor of Literature (Honoris Causa) upon Smt. Krishnammal Jagannathan for her lifelong contribution to social justice and sustainable human development and Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa) upon Dr. R. Kausalya Devi for her work in the field of medicine and social service in rural India.

The Minister for Forests, Tamil Nadu, Shri Dindigul C. Sreenivasan, the Chancellor, Gandhigram Rural Institute, Dr. K.M. Annamalai and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. More than 500 students, faculty members, parents of graduating students and other well wishers also bore witness to the convocation ceremony.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

"" I am glad to have this opportunity to address you at the 34th Convocation of the Gandhigram Rural Institute, an institute that has carved a niche for itself in the higher education system of our country.

Thanks to the visionary leadership of the the founders, Dr. G. Ramachandran and Dr. T.S. Soundaram Ramachandran, Gandhigram Rural Institute (GRI) has emerged as a leading centre of education for rural development encompassing within its ambit aspects like rural development, agriculture, cooperation, health, sanitation and village industries.

I am well aware of the good work being done by this Institute. Though 11 Rural Institutes were set up by Government of India way back in 1956 for giving impetus to the implementation of Community Development Programme in India, the Gandhigram Rural Institute alone evolved into a deemed to be University in 1976 and continues to reflect the spirit of national development ethos.

Sisters and brothers,

I am blessed to be in this place sanctified by the Father of our Nation, Mahatma Gandhi on 7th October 1947 with a powerful message “Success Attends where Truth Reigns”.

I am happy to be here with all of you in this auspicious year when we are starting the commemoration of Gandhiji’s 150th birth anniversary.

We cannot think of rural development and community development without talking of Mahatma and recollecting his vision of India. For him, “To serve our villages is to establish Swaraj. Everything else is but an idle dream. …Exploitation of villages is itself an organized violence.  If we want Swaraj to be built on non-violence, we will have to give the villages their proper place”.

If the dream of inclusive development has to be realized, we can hardly ignore the development gap between urban and rural areas. Unequal access to basic facilities, like education, health, drinking water, sanitation, transportation, markets and economic opportunities has created a divide between the rural and urban areas.

Successive governments since independence have made consistent efforts to bridge this gap but there is still a huge unfinished agenda.

Education is a significant catalyst for growth and progress on other dimensions of development. No country has made sustainable progress without improving the quality of education.

This aspect of our national development strategy assumes a greater significance today more than ever before,  because nearly 65% of our population is below the age of 35 years.

This demographic ‘statistic’ has to be converted into a ‘dividend’. This can be done only by revamping our education systems to ensure our young children and adults acquire the competencies and skills required for the knowledge economy and the interconnected world of the 21st century.

We have to bridge the rural-urban divide and also the other divides that still challenge us.

Institutions like Gandhigram, which have been established with the objective of providing good quality education to rural children and youth have a crucial role in this regard.

True patriotism lies in ensuring that all children get good education among other essential public goods. As Gandhiji had said, “Love requires that true education should be easily accessible to all and should be of use to every villager in this daily life. “

I have been witnessing the growth of this unique institution from the time I served as the Union Minister for Rural Development. I am glad that during the past six decades of existence of this Institute, our villages in and around Tamil Nadu, especially in this southern region of the country, have made notable progress in many areas of rural economic activity and social equity. 

I am happy to learn that the efforts of Gandhigram Rural Institute, especially its educational initiatives for pre-school children, out of school children, remedial training and adult literacy have made a big difference in the educational landscape of this region.

Your integrated approach and outreach efforts have been quite laudable.

You have successfully integrated health in the training, awareness activities and health camps. Your focus on women empowerment through education and training, capacity building, awareness activities and facilitation of self-help groups is a step in the right direction. So also are your skill development programmes.

With agriculture continuing to be the mainstay of rural populations, you have quite justifiably given maximum attention to agriculture programmes.

I am sure you will continue these activities with greater vigour and sense of urgency because the country has set for itself a very ambitious goal of doubling farmers’ incomes by 2022.

Education leads to empowerment both social and economic. We should aim at a holistic view of education that Indian thinkers have been advocating for a long time. 

It is good to remind ourselves what Gandhiji had to say on how we should move away from a narrow definition of education and how we should broad base it. 

It is also note worthy that Gandhiji wanted the gender discrimination also to end and that equal attention should be given to girls’ education as much as we give to education of boys. 

He said, “The real difficulty is that people have no idea of what education truly is. We assess the value of education in the same manner as we assess the value of land or of shares in the stock-exchange market. We want to provide only such education as would enable the student to earn more. We hardly give any thought to the improvement of the character of the educated. The girls, we say, do not have to earn; so why should they be educated? As long as such ideas persist there is no hope of our ever knowing the true value of education.”

Dear sisters and brothers,

I am delighted that Gandhigram is awarding degrees to successful candidates today and so many bright young students are moving on to higher education or entering the world of work.

Both the world of education and the world of work are changing very rapidly across the world. 

Knowledge and skills are becoming the key markers of development. 

India cannot afford to lose the opportunity to capitalize on the demographic advantage. Universities must reinvent themselves significantly to lead the change process. 

Mediocrity should be shunned. We cannot afford to have a poor quality human resource if we want to build a robust new India that will be at the forefront of global development.

The curriculum, the teaching methodology and the attitude towards teachers and learning must be reviewed and transformed. The entire system has to be brought on par with the best in the world and, if possible, even become better than the best. 

Dear faculty members, 

Let me congratulate you on this occasion for the yeoman service you are doing. You are truly shaping the new India in your classrooms. You are fine tuning the value system of the next generation through your conduct. You are setting benchmarks for knowledge acquisition through your research and teaching. I would like to see many of you emerging as academic leaders in your individual disciplines.

In this context, I would like to quote Gandhiji’s advice on how teachers should be good learners as well. He had said, “A teacher who establishes rapport with the taught, becomes one with them, learns more from them than he teaches them. He who learns nothing from his disciples is, in my opinion, worthless. Whenever I talk with someone I learn from him. I take from him more than I give him. In this way, a true teacher regards himself as a student of his students. If you will teach your pupils with this attitude, you will benefit much from them.”

Sisters and brothers,

The Indian higher education system has been expanding in terms of the number of institutions. 

Its quality, however, has been rather uneven.

We must now focus on this important aspect. We must define quality, measure quality and constantly strive to attain higher benchmarks. There is no reason why we should not be among the best institutions in the world. 

Let us not forget that ours is a country that has welcomed noble thoughts from across the globe. We should be open to new ideas and opportunities that are opening up. With our feet firmly on our traditional grounds, we must absorb the best practices from any part of the globe. That’s the only way we can grow. 

Sisters and brothers,

On this happy occasion of the 34th Convocation, I congratulate the students, the faculty members and the parents of the students as well as the distinguished awardees of degrees Honoris Causa.

I wish the Vice Chancellor, Dr. Natarajan, and his team all the very best in the years to come as they build this institution into a centre of excellence in education and foster a new generation of learners who are global citizens with Indian roots.

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that skill development should be a continuous process and the innovations must help making the lives of people better. He was addressing the gathering at the Valedictory of the Diamond Jubilee Celebrations of Educational Institutions run by Nachimuthu Industrial Association (NIA), in Pollachi, Tamil Nadu today.

Calling Arutchelvar Dr. N. Mahalingam, the founder of the institution, an ideal person who had contributed immensely for the uplift of the people living in rural Tamil Nadu, the Vice President said that such qualities should be emulated by young and the politicians of the present generation. Dr. Mahalingam was an MLA, educationist, philanthropist and was a contemporary of Late Kamaraj, C. Subramanya Bharathi, C. Rajagopala Chari. He gave up politics and worked for education & rural development. He was awarded Padma Bhushan to his invaluable social work, he said. Character, Calibre, Capacity and Conduct should be the guiding principles for people in public life, he added.

The Vice President expressed concern over the rising urban rural divide and stressed the need to create urban amenities such as educational institutions, uninterrupted electricity, access to drinking water and medical facilities at affordable cost for the benefit of people. He argued in favour of a bias towards rural areas in allocating funds, creating infrastructure at par with urban areas. 

Addressing a young gathering of school children, the Vice President highlighted the need to acquire skills to grab the opportunities in the technology driven job market. Develop the habit of upgrading your skill set in line with the changing technology, he said. Skill development forms a fitting bulwark against the increasing vagaries of the global business environment and honing and polishing skills should be a continuous practice, he added.

Quoting report by a leading employment solutions company that claimed that more than 90% of the engineering graduates of India were unemployable, the Vice President cautioned the young students understand the seriousness of the situation. He has asked teachers & educational institutions to take a good hard look at the curricula and the teaching method so that the gap between a classroom and the workplace can be bridged.

The Vice President said that government of India is extremely sensitive to the dreams and aspirations of young India and is doing everything possible in its power to support, nurture and empower the youth of the country. It is up to young people to make use of this opportunity, he added.

Tasking the universities, colleges and premier institutions to focus on innovation, the Vice President said that innovations must help making the lives of people better. Innovations should keep in mind the status of our environment as well. He highlighted the need to use Science & Technology to protect the nature and take steps to restore the lost balance in nature.

Earlier the Vice President has inaugurated the Diamond Jubilee Block and the Mirakle Wellness Clinic in the premises and went around the Wellness Centre and interacted with Doctors about the facilities and treatment given to patients. 

The Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Tamil Nadu, Shri S.P. Velumani, the Chairman, NIA, Dr. M. Manickam, the Secretary, NIA, Dr. C. Ramaswamy, more than 4000 Students, Faculty Members and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to be here with you today at the valedictory function of the Diamond Jubilee celebration of the Nachimuthu Industrial Association. It is always a pleasure to be amidst young students who would be the builders of a new India, a resurgent India, a resplendent India, an India that is the sum total of a billion dreams, an India that has the ability to nurture and fulfil a billion dreams.

Friends, it is a pleasure to recollect that I was here in this campus in the month of August 2003 to inaugurate the Alumni Centre on the occasion of the Centenary celebrations of the founder, Shri P. Nachimuthu Gounder.

Shri P. Nachimuthu Gounder, the founder of Anamalais Bus Transport Company, father of Arutchelvar Dr. N. Mahalingam, and a great embodiment of hard work and perseverance had a vision to start a technical educational institution in Pollachi. He strongly believed that it would benefit the youth of this countryside which has a predominantly agrarian population. The visionary leader’s dream had to pause due to his untimely demise at the age of 52 in 1954. His illustrious son, Dr. N. Mahalingam made his father’s dream come true on the 5th of September 1957 by establishing the Nachimuthu Polytechnic College (NPTC), under the aegis of the Nachimuthu Industrial Association (NIA).

I am happy to learn that this great institution is completing 60 years of its existence. Its endeavor to impart high quality, competency based technical education along with the necessary skills and abilities to face the challenging needs of the industry around the globe is truly laudable.

I am told this institution is also striving hard to attain   international standards in terms of f infrastructure, state-of-the-art computer facilities and techniques. It is also encouraging to note that it has at its heart a bunch of core values which it holds dear, the values of Equity, Transparency, Creativity, Team Work, Environmental Sustainability, Staff Development and Women participation in all its spheres of activity. To mark the celebration of four decades of service and the 75th birth year of Arutchelvar in 1998, a self financing engineering college in the name of Dr. Mahalingam was also established. Dr. Mahalingam College of Engineering and Technology (MCET), is also celebrating its two-decades of service  this year.

These are truly exciting times for India. There are quite a few reasons to justify this statement. One is that India today stands at the cusp of a tremendous demographic opportunity. India is a relatively young nation. More than 50% of its population is below the age of 25 and more than 65%  is  below 35 years. In 2020, the average age of an Indian will be expectedly 29 years, while it will be 37 for China and 48 for Japan. We are a young nation, full of youthful energy and enthusiasm, brimming with creative zeal. The Government has initiatied schemes like Skill India, Digital India, Start Up India and Stand Up India to tap this huge demographic potential by channelizing the energies of the youth in the right direction and empowering them.

 It is up to young people like you to make use of this opportunity. Focus on building knowledge that is both deep and wide in your subject area. My dear young friends, I cannot stress enough on the need to continuously learn and continuously upgrade your skills so that they stay relevant to the times. Skill training can thus be equated to empowerment of individuals through enrichment of capabilities leading to achievement of the highest order in economic, personal and social spheres. The country, however, has a big challenge ahead as it is estimated that only 4.69% of the total workforce in India has undergone formal skill training as compared to 68% in UK, 75% in Germany, 52% in USA, 80% in Japan and 96% in South Korea. it is indeed a challenge of  formidable proportion and we need to step up skilling of the youth on a massive scale.

There are a few other reasons why I say that it is the best of times for India. We in India, are committed to building a five trillion-dollar economy by 2025, making India the 3rd largest consumer market in the world. India has climbed 30 places in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index this year and IMF has forecast that India will grow at more than 7 percent in 2018 and 2019, ahead of other major economies. India is also rapidly expanding its infrastructure.

As mentioned earlier, the policy initiatives taken by the  government such as Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Smart Cities and Start-up India are opening up new opportunities. We have seen a strong global confidence in the Indian growth story with a surge in Foreign Direct Investments which reached over US $ 62 billion in 2017-18. My dear friends, the stage is set for you to take the centre stage. The future of this great nation now depends upon your dedication and creative brilliance.

The development of any country depends greatly upon the quality of its engineers, its builders, its architects. I came across a very disturbing report by a leading employment solutions company that claimed that more than 90% of the engineering graduates of India were unemployable. The same issue was flagged by  almost a decade ago. Nasscom estimates that 6 million people are required in cyber security sector alone by 2022. But we have a tremendous skill gap in engineering. We have to bridge this gap to make the best possible use of all the opportunities that we have access to, today. I request the teachers to take a good hard look at the curricula and the teaching methods, not only in engineering colleges but also in other educational institutions. The focus should be on continuously honing and polishing skills and on learning by constant practice.

It is sad to note that India, in spite of having one of the best talent pools and one of the strongest human resource bases of the world,  is unable to keep up with the kind of scientific breakthroughs that are happening in the western world today. I was perusing an article on the recently decorated Nobel Prize winners of 2018. The winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 2018 has made a discovery that will have to be termed as miraculous. Arthur Ashkin has invented optical tweezers that grab particles, atoms, viruses and other living cells with their laser beam fingers. In layman’s terms, this new tool would allow us to move objects using nothing but laser light! Imagine moving objects using just light! The invention would bring about paradigm shift in a number of scientific and technological arenas. Practical applications include but are not limited to removing bacteria without harming the surrounding healthy cells.

The world is now struggling to distinguish the boundaries between science and science fiction, anything seems possible now through science and technology. India should be at the forefront of pushing boundaries of knowledge and challenging dogmas. We have always been the ‘Vishwaguru’, the wise teacher to the world, a ‘Margadarshi’ par excellence. It is time we reclaim that status which is rightfully ours and you my dear young students will drive the innovation machine that will take us there.

Friends along with opportunities, India faces a number of challenges too.  We still have about 20 per cent of people living below the poverty line. We are waging wars on multiple fronts now. On the one side, we are battling poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, infant mortality, maternal mortality, communicable and lifestyle diseases and on the other front we are fighting terrorism, extremism, degradation of moral values in the society and social evils like caste system and untouchability.

According to the National Family Health Survey 4 (NFHS 4), 38.4 percent of children in India are stunted and 21 percent wasted. We might not be able to find solutions to all these pressing problems at once. But a start can be made. The solution lies in science and technology, to be more specific, the answer lies in innovation. It is a great leveler. It brings about prosperity which would eventually usher in an era of peace.

These innovations need not be ground breaking, they need not cost billions of dollars and they need not be paradigm altering. There should be a simple covenant when it comes to innovation. It should contribute to making the lives of people better. It should contribute towards alleviating suffering and it should be equally accessible, available and useful to every section of the population, the last man in the row, the weakest, most deprived human being in the country should benefit from it.

India has always been known as the capital of ‘Frugal innovations’. It is said that necessity is the mother of all inventions and we in India know very well what necessity is. Our once thriving economy which owned a lion’s share in world trade was looted and plundered for centuries.. But we are slowly ‘standing up’, confidently on our own two feet. In every village in India, we have our own home-made innovators, with little or no formal education to boast about, still providing incredible one stop solutions with cheap resources that can even put the best of technocrats to shame. Engineering and management institutes are starting courses and financing research studies to better understand our commonplace yet extraordinary thinking.

From the Jaipur foot invented by Dr. Sethi who made it possible for the poorest of the poor to afford prosthesis to Padmashree Arunachalam Murugandam who hails from this very city and invested his life’s savings to manufacture affordable sanitary napkins for women solely because of his concern for menstrual hygiene, India is teeming with innovative brilliance. From water wheels to bicycles fitted with dynamos to tree climbing machines, India, especially rural India, has showcased its resilience and spirit of survival to the world. You as future technocrats of the world, must learn from these innovators and explore the possibilities of adopting, adapting and scaling these innovations so that they can help a much larger number of people. No technology, however state of the art and futuristic,, will  stand the test of time if it does not contribute tangibly to improving lives.

Innovations should also keep in mind the status of our environment. We have to understand that climate change is real. There is imbalance in nature and the scales have tipped to a point that nature is forced to react and react fiercely. A recent study done by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, highlighted that the number of extreme rainfall events have gone up by threefold in India. According to the study, there have been 285 reported flooding events in India over 1950-2017 affecting about 850 million people, leaving 19 million homeless and killing about 71,000 people. The recent flood in Kerala is a warning to us. If we keep up this model of development, the catastrophes which would befall us would keep growing in scale and scope. Our cities have exceeded their carrying capacity long ago. We have encroached upon river beds and have concreted agricultural fields. Therefore, I request our young technocrats to always make sure that development is sustainable and nature friendly and to innovate to restore the lost balance in nature.

Scientific and technological advancements should also benefit the vulnerable sections of our population, the differently-abled, the women, the children, the socially and economically backward classes and tribals. We are all equal inheritors, having equal rights to the wealth of this nation. We dream of making every city in India smart. But do we invest time and money to ensure that the swanky, smart infrastructure we intend to construct is accessible to a differently- abled person? Do we make sure that public instructions are always displayed in Braille formats, do we secure ramps in all public transport facilities? We must not fail our Divyang brothers and sisters. Every innovation we envision should be fuelled by their dreams as well. Not all kinds of innovations and models of development are suitable to all kinds of people. When we innovate for our tribal brothers and sisters, we should take into account their unique lifestyles, their fragile habitat and their centuries long seclusion. We should adapt technologies in a way that the benefits reach them but allow them to retain their unique way of life.

Friends, there is also a need to bring in more women into the field of science and technology. Some of the most celebrated scientists in world history have been women. India has a rich tradition of women’s participation in all walks of life from science to philosophy to politics to the art of warfare. Yet, somewhere along the road, we failed to promote women in science and technology. No nation can make progress if women lag behind. With women constituting about 50 per cent of the country’s population, every effort has to be made to empower them economically, politically and in every other field. With programs like Beti Bachao-Beti Padao’, the government has taken the first step to ensure gender equality and the provide more opportunities to girl children. Studies have shown that increasing women and girls’ education contributes to higher economic growth. To quote Swami Vivekananda, “There is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved. It is impossible for a bird to fly on only one wing”. When our innovations take flight, it should be using both wings. The flight should be powerful, steady, focused and relentless. 

In the pursuit of excellence in innovations, we should also take care to retain and refresh what makes us Indian, our core values of sharing and caring. Science should never be without soul. The first and the foremost quality a successful innovator must have is empathy. Only when you imagine yourself in another person’s place and walk a mile in their shoes would you know what their problems are. We should never give up our righteousness, our moral strength and our sense of justice and fairness. Science and technology should only compliment and elevate our humanity, our humility. We have no room for superciliousness and arrogance. We must forever remain in the service of humanity. 

Friends, with industry 4.0 gathering momentum business expectations and skill demands are evolving faster than ever before. The future of manufacturing lies in automation and data exchange. At a time when we as a nation are taking flight and making efforts to narrow the gap between the available and required skills, it is heartening to note  NIA Skill Foundation is offering training programs to build capacities and capabilities among the youth to make them industry-ready. The qualitative educational service offered in this campus is noteworthy. 

It gives me immense pleasure in joining the campus in its joyous moment and to be part of the valedictory function of the Diamond Jubilee celebration. I congratulate NIA Educational Institutions with 12000 students and 1500 employees, offering education from  kindergarten to research, in 4 campuses inside Pollachi. I wish the institution good luck and I am sure the glory of this institution will soar higher and higher. May you lead the way to the creation of the resurgent, resplendent India.

Thank You!

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that government of India’s reform agenda would realize the full potential only when it receives support from all sections of the society. To achieve the herculean task, he called on business associations and Chambers of Commerce to promote tax compliance and run campaign against the black money.

Addressing the 90th Year Celebrations of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu today, the Vice President said that demonetization and the introduction of GST were landmark initiatives aimed at ensuring transparency, eliminating parallel economy and fetching increased revenue to the exchequer. These initiatives have led to change in the attitude of the people as evidenced by increased tax compliance, he said.

The Vice President said that Government has taken several measures to cut down red tape, improve the ease of doing business, attract more investments and create a business-friendly environment. With various measures taken by the government to step up economic growth, including FDI in various sectors and given the strong macro-economic fundamentals, India will continue to grow steadily to become the third largest economy in the world, he added.

The Vice President asked the business community not to confine themselves to the minimum requirements of Corporate Social Responsibility but to take up activities for the betterment of the society. Promote ethical corporate governance, tax compliance and corporate social responsibility among its members, he added.

The Vice President told the gathering reminding them India’s great philosophy that has 'Sharing and Caring' at its core. In this regard, he advised organizations such as The Coimbatore Chambers to adopt some government schools and contribute towards improving the infrastructure as part of their CSR activities. He said that sectors like agriculture, education and health must receive the highest priority. Government, Parliament and Press must focus on these three core areas, he added.

Saying that Agriculture and Industry were like two eyes of our nation, the Vice President sought the support of the business community to realize the vision of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi to double the income of farmers by 2022. Agriculture must be made remunerative by encouraging farmers to adopt allied services like poultry, fisheries, horticulture and others, he said adding that it can be achieved through the concerted effort by scientists, farmers, government and business entities, he added.

The Vice President said that encroaching up on rivers, canals and water bodies is a bad habit and termed such actions as contrary to civilizational values. Expressing concern over the depleting water levels in states such as Kerala and Karnataka that recently experienced massive floods, he warned people to be aware of the challenges of climate change. Man made mistakes such as encroachments would lead to frequent floods. We have played with the nature for too long and now it is playing with us, he added. Rising sea levels and depleting ground water levels are staring back at us. Urgent action is required to tackle the menace, he said asking people to preserve and protect nature.

The Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Tamil Nadu, Shri S.P. Velumani, the President, ICCIC, Shri V. Lakshminarayanasamy, the former President, ICCIC, Shri K.G. Balakrishnan and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to participate in the 90th year celebrations of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore.

Ninety years is indeed a major milestone in the journey of this organization which was witness to the birth of Indian Republic and many other momentous events since it was formed in 1929 by Sir R.K. Shanmukham Chetty, the First Finance Minister of Independent India.

Since then Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Coimbatore has been serving the cause of trade, industry and services since then and fostering the economic development of the this region.

I am happy to note that the members of this organization are investing their time and money in community development and working for civic and cultural well-being of the area. 

With over 1671 members with 96 affiliated associations and with their members of nearly 10,000, the Chamber represents a wide spectrum of merchant establishments of Coimbatore – from the manufacturing of pump sets, engineering, auto components, software development centres, IT solutions, BPO companies, clean-tech industries like wind, solar power and electric vehicles industry, State-of-art educational institutions, world class hospitals and medical facilities, textiles and garments, among others.

I am also glad to know that the Chamber launched a crusade against destruction of tanks in and around Coimbatore which culminated in the announcement by the State Government in 1992 that construction on tank lands would not be permitted.

I am told that with active support of the members, the chamber took initiative for reviving Noyyal canal system, De-silting of Valankulam these efforts towards environmental protection are truly laudable.

Friends,

The world is changing at a rapid pace aided by technological and digital revolutions. Any nation unable to keep pace with the changes will become a laggard. India is at the threshold of becoming one of the major economic powers and the private sector can play a huge role in accelerating the growth and development of the country.

Tamil Nadu is among the States which are in the forefront of industrialization. This State is known, among others, for the automotive, leather and textiles industries and the hard working nature of the population. To spur growth, we have to improve infrastructure, resource efficiency and promote innovative technologies.

Reformative measures like the introduction of GST will improve the economy in the long run, although there might be some teething problems in the initial stages of implementation. In the end, such reforms will also benefit the consumers.

With various measures taken by the government to step up economic growth, including FDI in various sectors and given the strong macro-economic fundamentals, India will continue to grow steadily.

India has now emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world today. If this trend and momentum continues, India is poised to become the largest economy in the next 10-15 years.

We in India are all committed to build a five trillion-dollar economy by 2025, making India the 3rd largest consumer market in the world. 

The latest report of the World Bank has forecast that the economy is projected to grow at 7.3 per cent in 2018-19 and 7.5 per cent in the next two years. 

As the World Bank has noted in its latest report, “India’s growth in recent years has been supported by prudent macroeconomic policy: a new inflation targeting framework, energy subsidy reforms, fiscal consolidation, higher quality of public expenditure and a stable balance of payment situation. In addition, recent policy reforms have helped India improve the business environment, ease inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and improve credit behavior.”

IMF has forecast that India will grow at more than 7 percent in 2018 and 2019, ahead of other major economies. 

India has climbed 30 places in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index this year. 

India is rapidly expanding its infrastructure. For instance, over 9829 Km national highways were constructed during the year 2017-18 as compared to 8231 km during the previous year.

The policy initiatives taken by the Indian government such as Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Smart Cities and Start-up India are opening up new opportunities. 

We have seen a strong global confidence in the India story with a surge in Foreign Direct Investments which reached over US $ 62 billion in 2017-18.

The Government has taken several measures to cut down red tape, improve the ease of doing business, attract more investments and create a business-friendly environment. Demonetization and the introduction of GST were landmark initiatives aimed at ensuring transparency, eliminating parallel economy and fetching increased revenue to the exchequer.

These initiatives have led to change in the attitude of the people as evidenced by increased tax compliance. Similarly, bankruptcy and insolvency code and the measures taken to unearth black money and curb corruption will further improve our economy. As a matter-of-fact, Chambers like yours should promote tax compliance and launch campaigns against corruption and black money. It should be remembered that improved collection of taxes will only enable the government to spend more on developmental activities and welfare of the people.

However, every reform must have a human face and the fruits of the reforms must reach the poorest sections of the society. Economic prosperity is meaningless if there is no equity in wealth distribution.

The initiatives taken up by the Union Government such as Jan-Dhan Yojana are aimed at empowering the poor and putting an end to their financial inclusion.

Commerce and Industry bodies like yours must chip in to see that nobody is left behind in the financial inclusion initiative.

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

Chambers act as bridge between the governments and the industry in creating conducive atmosphere for the businesses to thrive and produce wealth.

They also play a formulating role in advising the governments in enacting legislations and regulations that promote ease of doing business rather than act as strangulations.

Chambers should promote ethical corporate governance, tax compliance and corporate social responsibility among its members.

Corporate sector should not get confined to the statutory requirements of CSR, but take up much more activities for betterment of society as ‘Share and Care is the core of Indian philosophy ’.

I advise Chambers like yours to adopt some government schools and contribute towards improving the infrastructure as part of your CSR activities.

I have been always stressing that the government, Parliament and press must accord highest priority to agriculture, education and health.

Agriculture and Industry are like two eyes of our nation and Agriculture is also our basic culture. So focus your CSR efforts on help the farming community to realize the vision of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi to double the income of farmers by 2022. No doubt, it is a tall order. But nothing is impossible to achieve if there are concerted efforts by all stakeholders.

Perhaps, the Chamber of Commerce can even identify the felt needs of a given area and take it up on your own.

The Chamber can be the centre sphere of influence in community and governance issues and provide innovative thoughts to those in power.

Your body can also play a vital role in promoting ‘Skill India’. The need of the hour is impart employable skills to our youth. India is blessed with a huge demographic advantage as 65 per cent of our population is below the age of 65. We need to unleash the energies of our youth to develop India into a manufacturing hub and one of the top economies.

In fact, the Chamber should help in promoting cottage industries in the rural areas based on the local resources in each area. It will not only help in providing employment to the youth, but also prevent migration of people from rural areas. As you all are aware, urbanization is an irreversible modern-day phenomenon and cannot be fully curbed. However, we need to make our rural areas vibrant hubs of economic activities through multiple efforts on various fronts, including education, health, industries and agriculture.

As regards healthcare sector, the members of your chamber should supplement the government’s efforts under CSR activities.

I am happy to know that the chamber has played an important role in getting new railway lines, developing Coimbatore airport into an international airport and establishment of Coimbatore Stock Exchange, among others.  

I am also glad to learn that you have been organizing interactive meetings with diplomats of foreign countries to promote bilateral trade.

My best wishes to Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore for all its future endeavors.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called the educational institutions to make it mandatory for students to undertake social service or service in armed forces or voluntary organizations like NSS, Scouts & Guides for being conferred with their degrees. Participating in social service or enrolling in such services would help them inculcate the feeling of oneness, nationalism, Social consciousness, he said.

Addressing the valedictory celebrations of the Birth Centenary Celebrations of Shri Deenadayalu Naidu, the Vice President asked students to draw inspiration from the visionary leader and the committed nationalist. He has also suggested the educational institutions to incorporate moral science classes in schools.

Expressing displeasure over the depleting values in public life, the Vice President stressed the need to elect responsible public representatives with calibre, capacity and conduct. India needs committed leaders with a clean record to fight social evils like poverty, illiteracy, violence and others. They must be responsive to the needs and sufferings of the people and ensure that the benefits of government schemes reach the poorest of the poor, he added.

Highlighting the ill effects of climate change, the Vice President called for a constructive action plan to preserve and protect the nature. Governments, public representatives and the young people of the scout and guide movement should work towards empowering rural communities to conserve water, he aqdded.

The Governor of Karnataka, Shri Vajubhai Rudhabhai Vala, the Minister for Cooperation, Government of Karnataka, Shri Bandeppa Kasampur and officials, members and over a hundred students associated with the Bharat Scouts and Guides movement, members of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike District Association were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“It is a pleasure to be here on the occasion of the valedictory of the birth centenary celebrations of Shri Deendayal Naidu, a visionary leader and a committed nationalist. 

Born in a reputed family, Shri Naidu completed his schooling from St. Joseph’s European High School and graduated from. St Joseph’s College, Bangalore in 1942. The leader in him began to take shape during his college days when he was elected as the Vice-President of the St. Joseph’s College Union.

He joined the Indian National Congress in 1942 and was closely associated Gandhiji, Nehru, Chakravarthi, Rajgopalachari, K. Kamaraj, Nijalingappa, Jagajivan Ram and many other leaders during the freedom movement. He actively participated in the Quit India Struggle and was imprisoned on two occasions. He carried the spirit of freedom with him wherever he went and was chosen as the President of the Freedom Fighters Association, Bangalore, a position he retained until his death.

While studying law at Law College, Pune, he was chosen as a candidate to contest municipal elections by the Bangalore District Congress Committee and was unanimously elected to the post. He completed Law in 1945 and became a Member of the Karnataka Bar Council and took up active practice from 1947.  He was a nominated Member to the Legislative Assembly in 1948 and was later elected to the Legislative Assembly (1957-1962) from the Cubbonpet Constituency. He also held the posts of Deputy Mayor and Mayor of Corporation of the City of Bangalore.

Shri Naidu was also appointed as Chairman of City Improvement Trust Board, (C.I.T.B)-- Present Bengaluru Development Authority-- in 1959. He was mainly responsible for the Development of Greater Bangalore. 

Sri V.P. Deenadayalu Naidu has an impressive record of Public Service in Scouting and Guiding. Starting as Rover Scout during his college days in 1942, he served the Scouting Movement for over six decades. He held many important positions before reaching the highest position of Chief Executive- State Chief Commissioner of The Bharat Scouts and Guides, Karnataka and held the post continuously for 10 Years (1983-1993). 

He was responsible for the merger of the different Scout and Guide Associations in the country to form the present United Bharat Scouts and Guides. He shared his passion for the Scouting Movement with Sri Kondajii Basappa, who was his guide and mentor and together their contribution was invaluable to the movement. His association with other pioneers in the movement helped Karnataka reach the pinnacle of Scouting and Guiding.

He also appointed as Deputy Chief Commissioner (Scout), India and was elected as National Commissioner, the Bharat Scouts and Guides, India, the highest position in the movement and served from 1992 to 1995. During his tenure as National Commissioner, he travelled all over India and motivated all the State Associations to promote Development of Scouting and Guiding. The National Adventure Institute of the Bharat Scouts and Guides, at Pachmarhi, Madhya Pradesh, was established during his tenure which continues to be the leading Training Institute for the Movement even today.

He received the Highest National Award-- Silver Elephant Award of the Bharat Scouts and Guides in recognition of his outstanding service to the Movement.

In recognition of his selfless service as a freedom fighter and to the Scouting Movement, the Karnataka Government conferred the prestigious “Kannada Rajyothsava Award” in 1995. He served in Rotary for over 30 years and was recognized by Rotary International with highest award of “Service Above Self”.

Other important positions held by him were President, Karnataka State Council for Child Welfare, Senior Member, Bar Association of Karnataka, Founder and Correspondent of Yogeshwara Nanda High School a Branch of Ramakrishna Ashram.

Because of his association with the Scouting Movement, he had traveled far and wide, including to U.K., U.S.A., Canada, Germany, France, Thailand, Australia, China and Japan. I am happy to know that with such a committed career, he also had a happy family life.

He left his earthly abode in 1998.  Shri Naidu might not be with us today. But the legacy he left behind continues to live and inspire us. It is often said that the key to immortality is to lead a life worth remembering. In that sense, Shri Naidu has truly been immortalized.

He was a nationalist, a freedom fighter, a leader, an able administrator, a talented sportsman and above all, a genuine humanist who believed in the potential of the youth. The Bharat Scouts and Guide movement plays a crucial role in inculcating discipline among the young people and contributes to their education through a value system. The movement in India owes its current stature and achievements to Shri Naidu in no small measure.

I hope that the young boys and girls of the movement would always remember, cherish and seek inspiration from Shri Naidu’s outstanding work.  Such qualities of self-service are needed in the present times than ever before and I appeal to young boys and girls to devote some of their time in helping the needy and vulnerable sections of the society. They could make a difference to lives of the poor through community development, environment, health and education, among others.

I am happy to know that the Vision Statement of Bharat Scouts & Guides seeks to make it by 2024 a globally visible, self-reliant premium youth movement that will be gender-balanced, vibrant and responsive to trends.

It also seeks to provide young people with value-based, attractive and challenging youth programme, through competent leaders, effective communication, optimum use of technology and efficient management.

I wish the movement all the very best.

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Science and technology should ultimately result in the betterment of human condition. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Diamond Jubilee Celebrations of National Institute of Technology (NIT), Warangal, Telangana today. 

 

Expressing his deep affection for the city of Warangal, the Vice President said that Warangal had a very unique character, that it is a smart city as well as a heritage city. He expressed hope that story of Warangal would serve as an example to all of us. It urges us to embrace modernity but hold on to all the good things that our ancient culture and traditions have given us.  He congratulated NIT Warangal for being one of the top technology institutions in India and lauded the many new initiatives being taken up by NIT to further technological and scientific research. He insisted that technological institutions such as the NIT should focus extensively on innovation. He proposed that innovation be the one Mantra that leads the institution forward. He remarked that innovation was no longer a luxury for a country like India but an urgent necessity. 

 

The Vice President said that India is committed to build a five trillion-dollar economy by 2025, making India the 3rd largest consumer market in the world. He added that the world was watching India. The Indian growth story has taken the world by surprise and a number of foreign businesses wish to invest in India. He cautioned that for India’s growth to be sustainable we have to go on an innovation ‘overdrive’. He argued that India just cannot afford to be obsolete anymore.

 

The Vice President opined that innovation today should keep the coming 20 years in mind. This innovation should be clean and green. He added that we should ‘plan’ and ‘plant’ for our children.

 

Appreciating Warangal’s Smart City status, he said that a smart city should be a livable, comfortable and happy place and that everything from offices to people to the utilities should be ‘smart’. He urged town planners and civic authorities to take measures to conserve the native architectural structures such as monuments, water flow systems and heritage sites in smart cities. He also asked them to keep spaces for construction of affordable housing for those who needed them badly. He stressed upon the need to create livable, eco-friendly urban spaces keeping in mind the growing demand of infrastructure requirements in mind.

 

The Vice President expressed pride that India has always been known for its frugal innovations. Innovations help in combating corruption and pilferage of subsidies. Innovation makes it possible to overcome the most pressing problems of our time efficiently and effectively. He added that as India prepared to cut the red tape and lay the red carpet to invite the world, we have to focus on simplifying and making our procedures transparent. He observed that we would have to innovate to drive governance online so that we see no more long lines to avail services.

 

The Vice President also spoke about the need for colleges such as NIT to have linkages with the industry as well as with the alumni. He complimented the proactive alumni base of NIT, Warangal for coming together to build a modern convention centre on the campus.

 

The Vice President reaffirmed that in the present era of growing materialism, education must lay the foundations for building a society rooted in strong values and morals. Students must imbibe the values of tolerance, empathy, simplicity, honesty and generosity, he added. He expressed hope that engineers passing out of premier institutions like the NITs would use their knowledge and capabilities to solve problems related to drinking water, health, transportation and education and improve the lives of people, especially in rural areas.

 

The Director of NIT, Warangal, Prof. Ramana Rao, the Dean, International Relations & Alumni Affairs, Prof. K.V. Jayakumar, the Registrar, Shri Goverdhan Rao, Deans, Faculty Members and Students of different branches of NIT were present on the occasion.

                The Vice President, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has called upon doctors to create awareness among the people on the dangers posed by lifestyle diseases and the need to promote healthy living.

Inaugurating a free Medical Camp jointly organized by the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology and the Swarna Bharat Trust (SBT) in the latter’s premises in Hyderabad today, he emphasized that people must made to pay greater attention towards their health and wellness as prevention is better than cure. He said that a healthy nation can become a wealthy nation but not vice- versa. The spending on healthcare will naturally come down if people are healthy, he added.

Expressing his anguish over the lack of adequate medical facilities in rural areas, he lauded the Union Government for launching Ayushman Bharat to provide health insurance cover to five crore families in rural areas and 2.5 crore families in urban areas. The scheme would provide coverage of up to Rs. 5 lakh per family per year. He also complimented the government for planning to establish one primary health centre for every 5,000 population and increase their number to 1.5 lakhs. 

The Vice President expressed his deep appreciation to eminent gastroenterologist and Chairman, Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Dr. D. Nageshwar Reddy for organizing the free medical camp at SBT. Lauding Dr. Reddy for being service-minded, he said such qualities must be imbibed by every healthcare professional. 

Later speaking after giving away ‘Rythu Nestham’ awards, the Vice President warned that there was a danger of farmers leaving agriculture unless farming was made profitable and viable. He said the emphasis should be on bringing down the input costs and not only on increasing productivity. The indiscriminate use of fertilizers, pesticides, electricity and water also need to be curbed.

Referring to the initiative taken by him to conduct national consultations on making agriculture profitable, the Vice President said that scientists must ensure research outcomes must directly reach the farmers (Lab to Land).

Observing that zero budget natural farming promoted by eminent agriculturist, Shri Subhash Palekar was beneficial, the Vice President pointed out that it would help in reducing costs and providing a stable income to farmers. It would also protect the consumers from the ill-effects of pesticides. As a matter of fact, only 10 per cent of water and electricity would be required for natural farming when compared normal farming, he added.

The Vice President also stressed the need to create awareness among farmers to diversify to allied activities to increase their incomes. A study has shown that there were no suicides by farmers who had diversified to allied activities like poultry, dairy and fisheries, he added.

Lauding the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi for increasing the MSP for various crops and for launching farmer friendly schemes like soil health cards and PM Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, the Vice President also appealed to the private sector to step up investments in agriculture.  Similarly Parliament, press, and Planning Commission (NITI Aayog) should give top priority to agriculture.

Observing that the Government, Parliament and the Media must accord the highest priority to health, education and agriculture, the Vice President said that scientists, agricultural research centres and Krishi Vigyan Kendras must make concerted efforts to make agriculture sustainable and profitable.

The former Minister for Health and Medical Education, Andhra Pradesh, Dr. Kamineni Srinivas, eminent Gastroenterologist and the Chairman, Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Dr. D. Nageshwar Reddy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu called for stepping up the campaign for organ donation in a big way to meet the huge demand due to rising number of end organ failures of kidney, liver, heart, lung and pancreas.

Addressing the 29th annual conference of the Indian Society of Organ Transplantation in Hyderabad today, Shri Naidu pointed out that although there was a huge requirement for donated organs in the country, only a miniscule number were getting them. “Of the 85,000 liver failure patients on waitlist annually, less than 3% get the organ. Similarly, while two lakhs kidney failure patients registered for organ transplantation, only 8000 get the kidney. And barely 1% get heart /lung amongst the thousands on waitlist,” he added.

The Vice President said though there was a huge leap in cadaveric organ donations in the last 4-5 years, the demand-supply remained hugely unmet because of low rates of organ donation at 0.8 per million population when smaller countries like Spain and Croatia were having rates of 36 per million and 32 per million respectively.

Observing that the significant gap in the country was due to cultural beliefs, traditions and ritual practices, he called upon the doctors, NGOs and others to make people aware of the importance of organ donation. He said “India is known for unity in diversity and altruism in all cultures and we need to increase the donation rates to meet the demand of organs for organ transplantation”.

Keeping the rising demand in view, the Vice President urged doctors and other health care delivery providers to focus on the preventive care and making transplantation an affordable therapy for all the needy people.

Emphasizing that prevention was better than cure, the Vice President said many end stage diseases can be prevented by lifestyle modifications. Expressing his concern over the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases, he told the medical fraternity to educate the people on the dangers of leading sedentary lifestyle, eating junk food and on excessive consumption of alcohol and tobacco.

Stating that Yoga has nothing to do with religion, he said people should be advised to practice yoga. He also asked the medical fraternity to educate people on reducing salt intake in view of its association with hypertension.

Referring to the lack of adequate healthcare facilities and manpower in rural areas, the Vice President suggested that it should be made mandatory for doctors to serve a minimum of 2-3 years in rural areas before giving the first promotion.

Lauding the Union Government for launching ‘Ayushman Bharat’ scheme to provide insurance cover to 10.74 crore deprived rural families, the Vice President described it as a “positive and progressive scheme. He said the Make in India programme should promote manufacturing medicines and devices in India at affordable prices

Observing that doctors are treated with reverence in India, he told them to treat patients with empathy and provide the much-needed human touch. Unfortunately, due to the present-day fast-paced lifestyles, doctors were not spending as much time as needed with each patient. This should change and doctors must spend more time with each patient like the family physician used to in the past, he added.

The Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Mohammed Mahmood Ali, the President of Indian Society of Organ Transplantation, Dr. K.L. Gupta and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am pleased to participate in the inaugural ceremony of the 29th conference of the Indian Society of Organ Transplantation Society. 

As you all are aware, strong foundations in health and education sectors are vital for the progress of the nation. 

Medicine is a noble profession and service is at the core of this vocation,

In India, a doctor is revered and treated like a demi-god. As professionals, you must always treat patients with empathy and provide them the much-needed human touch. Unfortunately, due to the present-day fast-paced lifestyles, doctors are not spending as much time as needed with each patient. This should change and doctors must spend more time with each patient like the family physician used to in the past.

While healthcare has been accorded utmost priority by successive governments since Independence, the challenges on this front continue to be daunting and formidable. The major challenges include low public spend, low doctor-patient ratio, low patient-bed ratio, dearth of medical colleges and trained doctors, inadequate infrastructure in rural areas, lack of penetration of health insurance and inadequate disease surveillance and preventive mechanisms.

We need a multi-pronged action to overcome the challenges in the health sector. The efforts of the government need to be supported by the private sector, voluntary organizations and even individual medical specialists. India is spending far less than the developed nations on healthcare goods and services. While the developed nations spend about 18 per cent of the GDP, India spends a mere 4.2 per cent.

In regard to the number of physicians available per 10,000 people, their number is grossly inadequate in India when compared to developed countries. While the number of physicians available is 20 per 10,000 population in developed countries, it is only six in India. The country needs 10.5 lakh doctors while we have only 6,5 lakh.

As against the WHO norm of one doctor per 1,000, there is one doctor per 1700 population in India. In order to reach this target, a high-level committee of erstwhile Planning Commission (Now NITI Aayog) has recommended the setting up of 187 more medical colleges by 2022.

I am sure, the Union Government and the State Governments will address this issue on a war footing and increase budgetary allocations for the health sector.

While we have done fairly well in controlling communicable diseases, the burden of non-communicable diseases is increasing and posing a major challenge to healthcare planners and professionals. Sedentary lifestyles, consumption of junk food, use of alcohol and tobacco are among the causes for an increase in NCDs in the country. This trend has to be reversed and people must made aware of leading healthy lifestyles by taking balanced diet and taking part in physical activities, including yoga.

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 data shows that NCDs and injuries are the main cause of death among people of all age group in India.

In view of the low penetration of medical health insurance and an estimated 62.58 per cent of the people meeting medical and hospitalization expenses on their own, the Union Government has launched “Ayushman Bharat” to provide financial protection to 10.74 crore deprived rural families by offering a benefit cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family per year. It covers almost all secondary and most of the tertiary care expenses. Thus, it is expected to provide a fillip to India’s goal of achieving Universal Health Coverage.

It is unfortunate that even 71 years after attaining Independence, our villages lack adequate healthcare facilities in spite of the best efforts by Central and various State Governments. We cannot allow this kind of lop-sided development if the country has to make rapid progress. The absence of healthcare facilities in rural areas is one of the contributing factors for migration of people to cities. I have been suggesting that rural service should be made mandatory for MBBS doctors and also before giving the first promotion to those in government service.

Sisters and brothers, organ donation is one of the noblest causes. Today, with the development of science and advanced technology, the field of organ transplantation increased exponentially world over and in India.

With the increasing number of end organ failures of kidney, liver, heart, lung and pancreas, the demand for organs too been rising tremendously.

Although there is a huge requirement for donated organs in the country, only a miniscule number are getting them. Of the 85,000 liver failure patients on waitlist annually, less than 3% get the organ. Similarly, while two lakhs kidney failure patients registered for organ transplantation, only 8000 get the kidney. And barely 1% get heart /lung amongst the thousands on waitlist.

Though there is a leap in cadaveric organ donations over the last 4-5 years, yet the demand-supply remains hugely unmet with. This is because of low rates of organ donation in India at 0.8 /million population, when smaller countries like Spain and Croatia are performing at 36/million population and 32/million population respectively.

The significant gap in increasing end organ failures and the organ donations is because of cultural beliefs, traditions and ritual practices.

Sisters and brothers, please remember that India’s core philosophy is share and care and we need to step up the campaign for organs donation in a big way. India is known for unity in diversity and altruism in all the cultures and we need to increase the donation rates to meet the demand of organs for organ transplantation.

I am told that the actor such as lack of awareness, infrastructure, technical expertise, legal and police formalities and the need to use immune-suppression drugs for lifelong are among the reasons for low rates of organ donations in India.

There should be greater focus on increasing brain death declarations in a legal and ethical way, strengthening the infrastructure in all the hospitals for organ retrieval and transplantation, protective laws and free follow-up medicines.

To increase the donor pool, transplantation society and governments should work towards increasing donations after cardiac death (which is not frequent in India),  promoting altruism-related donations, legalizing the donor-card and overcoming traditional beliefs by creating more public awareness.

Prevention is better than cure. Many end stage diseases can be prevented by the lifestyle modifications.

I am aware that Tamil Nadu runs one of the most successful cadaver transplant programs in India. Other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have also shown significant improvement.

I am also happy to know that few State Governments have brought all the organ transplantations and post surgery follow-up medicines under the health assurance and are providing  completely cashless medical services  to the poor and needy.

Various Initiatives of the Government of India such as Swatch Bharath and YOGA  will help to prevent the diseases. Exclusive Department of AYUSH was created in the Ministry of health to increase the focus on traditional health systems which will be complementary to the allopathic systems in preventive and curative health care.

The wellness centers launched across India by the government of India will help to detect the diseases early, offer early treatment so that the diseases will not result in the end-stage failure.

The Make in India programme should promote manufacturing medicines and devices in India at an affordable price. 

I would like all the doctors and other health care delivery providers to focus on the preventive care and make transplantation an affordable therapy for all the needy people.

 

I conclude by saying

Om Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah
Sarve Santu Nir-Aamayaah |
Sarve Bhadraanni Pashyantu
Maa Kashcid-Duhkha-Bhaag-Bhavet |
Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||

 

Meaning:
Om, May All become Happy,
May All be Free from Illness.
May All See what is Auspicious,
May no one Suffer.
Om Peace, Peace, Peace.

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that education is an instrument of social transformation adding that it forms the foundation for empowering women, especially in a country like India.

Delivering the Convocation address at the University College for Women in Hyderabad today, he said that no country can make progress if women lag behind. Educating a woman would not only empower an individual but an entire family. Expressing his concern over gender inequality, he warned that subordination of women in various spheres would have serious negative consequences.

Calling for breaking down walls and defying stereotypes, he emphasized that women, who constitute more than half the population, need to be given voice and space. “Empowering women is empowering entire humanity”, he asserted.

Education is not only for employment, it leads to enhancement of knowledge, enlightenment and empowerment of individuals, he said.

Observing that we need women at all levels, the Vice President called for strengthening social, economic, political and legal avenues to ensure equal rights for women. Political participation of women was extremely crucial in strengthening the democratic process in the country, he added.

Shri Naidu quoted Swami Vivekananda, who had said: “There is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved. It is impossible for a bird to fly on only one wing”.    

Quoting a World Bank report on the positive effects of educating women, Shri Naidu said that rise in female education levels will help in reducing infant and child mortality rates. He further said that increased earning capacity of women will also have a positive effect on children's nutrition, health and educational prospects.

He advised the graduating students to leave their mark of excellence wherever they go. He told them not to remain mediocre and always try to push their boundaries of performance.

Saying that Indian universities and Indian colleges have not made much progress in terms of becoming centres of innovation in the areas of Science and Technology, the Vice President said “we have become good knowledge consumers but we are not able to become knowledge producers”

“We can become innovators and knowledge producers only when we bring about a paradigm shift in our education system and evolve an education system that provokes young minds into thinking; that combines pursuit of knowledge with creativity, critical thinking and skills”, he added.

To achieve this, Shri Naidu called upon the teachers to rededicate themselves to the cause of education and transform this college into a centre of excellence for innovations.

During his interactions with students, the Vice President stressed on five aspects that students must never forget in their life. “Never neglect or forget your mother tongue, parents, native place, motherland and the Guru (teacher). Learn other languages, but be proficient in your mother tongue,” he told them.

The Deputy Chief Minister of Telangana, Shri Mohammad Mehmood Ali, the Vice Chancellor of Osmania University, Prof S. Rama Chandram, and Principal, University College for Women, Prof. Roja Rani, members of the faculty, students and parents were present on the occasion.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am indeed happy to be here to be part of your celebration of an academic achievement.  At the outset, let me congratulate all the girls who are graduating today. My compliments to their parents and teachers too on this momentous occasion! 

I hope the girls will excel in their chosen fields and bring laurels to the country, their alma mater and their families.

Convocation is a momentous occasion marking a new beginning in your career. It is not only an occasion to celebrate, but also to introspect and plan your future. All of you must reflect upon what you have achieved so far and what you aspire to do in future. You need to have clear-cut goals and strive hard to reach those goals.

 

Dear students,

 

I have a couple reasons for accepting this invitation from your college to be the Chief Guest at this Convocation. I have inherent penchant to interact with youth of the country to motivate them and share my insights on various issues.

The other reason for my coming to this college is that my daughter Smt. Deepa Venkat was an alumnus of this college.

I fondly recall the days when I used to come to this college to drop my daughter. My daughter is now an independent and successful entrepreneur. She runs an NGO which is dedicated to imparting skills to thousands of youth, especially women to enable them to be self-reliant. I strongly believe that education must transform us and empower us to transform the society. Swarna Bharath trust led by my daughter precisely does this.

I am aware that this college was started in the year 1924 and is going to celebrate its centenary soon. There is an interesting anecdote in regard to the starting of this college. I am told that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore came all the way to Hyderabad to meet the then Nizam and requested him to start a college for girls. The Nizam immediately accepted the request. Understand this. Why should Tagore travel all the way to promote women’s education? Did he have any selfish agenda? No. It was his nation-first conviction –- it reflects his innate concern for women’s education in India. Tagore was not alone. Others with similar zeal for women’s empowerment were Dr. B R Ambedkar, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Iswar Chandra Vidya Sagar, Jyothiba Phule, Savitri Phule, the list is endless.  I salute their vision and commend their efforts.

I am glad to know that the erstwhile British Residency has been converted into women’s college. Today it has about 4000 students 14 PG and 28 UG departments. I am also happy to know that this is the only college in the entire Telangana State in public sector with on campus hostel facility. I am glad that the college has students from all 31 districts of Telangana, from across the nation and foreign countries.

Dear students, please remember that there is no short-cut to success. With hard work, dedication, sincerity and by following ethical and moral values, you can realize your goals.  

Education is an instrument of social transformation. Education is not only for employment. It leads to enlightenment and empowerment of an individual. No country can make progress if the women lag behind.  

India has a rich tradition of women’s education right from the early Vedic period. Rig Veda and Upanishads make unequivocal assertions about the efficacy of women’s education; many women sages themselves were engaged in pursuit of knowledge. We have examples of sage-scholars like Maitreyi and Gargi.

Further, in ancient India, we used to have Guru Sishya Parampara, where the Guru trains the Sishya to gain insights into life that would make him a complete person.

However, during the colonial period somehow we lost this tradition and we have inherited the present education system. Although, India has made tremendous progress in various fields, I feel that we have not achieved to our full potential.

Notwithstanding the fact that women’s literacy rate in India is still less than the world average (65.46 as against the world average of 79.6), there is huge awareness among the people on the importance of women’s education in India.

It is needless to say that education forms the foundation for empowering women, especially in a country like India. As had been most aptly said educating a woman means educating an entire family.

According to the report by UN World Survey on Role of Women in Development, women's active participation in decision-making has a positive impact on education, health, nutrition, employment and social protection.

For example, as female education levels rise, infant and child mortality rates fall and family health improves. Women's increased earning capacity has a positive effect on children's nutrition, health and educational prospects.

As Vivekananda said: ‘Our right of interference is limited to giving education to women. Women may just be put in a position to solve their own problems in their own way. No one can or ought to do this for them. And our Indian women are capable of doing it as any in the world.’

This vision of Vivekananda has come true today as we see Indian women making strides in all fields. Today the women of India are more confident than their counterparts in the world. They are leaders of many fortune 500 companies. They are also excelling as entrepreneurs, scientists, sportspersons, politicians and even as combat pilots. They are making the entire nation proud with their achievements.

Students who are graduating today must bear in mind that their future will be shaped by their education and the values inherited from their family and society. They should strive to leave their mark of excellence wherever they go. Never remain mediocre and always try to push your boundaries of performance.

In 1947 when India became free, there were only 20 Universities and 500 colleges. Of these, exclusive Women’s colleges were not more than 10. Today we have 864 universities, 42,000 colleges and 3.7 crore students. Today we have exclusive women universities and thousands of colleges for women.

Indian universities and Indian colleges have not made much progress in terms of becoming centres of innovation in the areas of Science and Technology. Although boys and girls are able to acquire latest skills and are able to adapt themselves to meet the technical requirements of the industry, we are somehow lagging behind in unleashing innovations.

In other words, we have become good knowledge consumers but we are not able to become knowledge producers. We can become innovators and knowledge producers only when we bring about a paradigm shift in our education system and evolve an education system that provokes young minds into thinking; that combines pursuit of knowledge with creativity, critical thinking and skills. 

If there is a new software programme, we quickly learn it but we are not able to create a new one. We should not be imitators but creators. 

During my interactions with students, I have been stressing on five aspects—never neglect or forget your mother tongue, parents, native place, motherland and the Guru (teacher). Learn other languages, but be proficient in your mother tongue.

I call upon the teachers on the occasion of this convocation to rededicate themselves to the cause of education and transform this college into a centre of excellence for innovations.

As I look at you dear students, I feel happy. You are bright, you are energetic, you are enthusiastic and you all look purposeful and look motivated. You will certainly make tremendous impact in your chosen careers and contribute to the progress of the nation.

 

I wish you great success, tremendous happiness and a life filled with learning and bliss.

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India is quickly becoming a global leader and lifting millions out of poverty and added that country requires skilled youth to accelerate the growth process.

Addressing the founder’s day celebrations of CHIREC International School in Hyderabad today, he stressed on the need to teach students the great culture, heritage of India. He asked Educational institutions in the country to take an active lead and revamp the system to make it more relevant and contemporary and ensure that our institutions churn out ideal citizens.

The Vice President said that the mechanical fashion of memorising the subjects must go and said that such rote method of learning is detrimental to overall personality development of the child. Education must foster creativity, critical thinking, open learning and impart analytical skills. It must help students to become good human beings, he said.

The Vice President suggested educational institutions and policy makers to take steps to reduce the burden on students. First and foremost, the syllabus at the school level has to be drastically cut to reduce the load on students. The time spent by students in school should be divided equally between the classroom and play field, he added.  

The Vice President said that the participation in sports and other extra-curricular activities will help in improving physical and mental health, and fostering active citizenship and social inclusion.

Stressing the need to inculcate strong ethical and moral values in students, the Vice President called on educational institutions encourage students to embrace the spirit of nationalism and patriotism. Develop the feeling of oneness among students, he added.

Saying that holistic development of student is important for a student to make informed choices, Shri Naidu said that education must help students to become good, compassionate and caring human beings with a sense of empathy.

Highlighting importance of India’s own Gurukla System of education, the Vice President said that Educational institutions which are considered temples of learning must teach students to respect the Guru, the teacher. Students entering schools, must not only show respect to the Gurus, but also display complete dedication and discipline towards the entire process of learning, he said. 

The Vice President said that the teaching methods should become interactive and facilitate the students to express their doubts and raise questions freely without any inhibition and fear. Such an atmosphere will instill confidence in children, an important prerequisite for their overall development, he added.

The Home Minister of Telangana, Shri Nayani Narasimha Reddy, the Principal, the Director and Faculty of CHIREC International School and parents of children were among the attendees.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am delighted to be here to celebrate CHIREC’s incredible milestone of 30 years of excellence in education at this Founders’ Day event. I am always happy to interact with children and share my thoughts as I consider them as future of our country.

I am aware that CHIREC International has consistently provided its students with quality education. I am told that it is upgrading its curriculum on par with international standards, which would help in nurturing the academic and creative talents of the students.

India is quickly becoming a global leader and lifting millions out of poverty. This is achieved by one tool – Education. Educational institutions in the country should take an active lead in resetting education landscape to make it more relevant and contemporary.

“Education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man” said Swami Vivekananda. It should lay the foundation for a strong character. The education system must help students to become good, compassionate and caring human beings with a sense of empathy. It must inculcate strong ethical and moral values and infuse the spirit of nationalism and patriotism among students.

Indians across the world have done us proud because of the education they have received and committed themselves to. They have established themselves as the world’s top industrialists, doctors, and scientists.

Even within India, the quality of our hospitals and MNCs are spoken high of, because of the standards set by our schools and education system. It is a true testament to how important a global education currently changes everything we see.

Education in India has always been an evolving landscape. Schools used to be places wherein students lived with their gurus and participated in lessons in the same space. Educational institutions are the temples of learning and every student, who steps into them, must not only show respect to the Gurus, but also display complete dedication and discipline towards the entire process of learning.

However, I feel that the overall education system from school level to higher education should be completely overhauled to ensure that our institutions churn out ideal citizens. First and foremost, the syllabus at the school level has to be drastically cut to reduce the load on students. The time spent by students in school should be divided equally between the classroom and play field.

Participation in sports and other extra-curricular activities will help in improving physical and mental health, and fostering active citizenship and social inclusion.

Education should foster creativity, critical thinking, open learning and impart analytical skills rather than making the students to memorize and reproduce in a mechanical fashion. The rote method of learning is detrimental to overall personality development of the child as it virtually stunts intellectual growth.

Like in the past, regular physical exercises, drills and lessons on moral science should become part of the syllabus in all schools to ensure that children develop into complete human beings.

What is happening of late is a matter of grave concern for all of us. We are regularly coming across instances of juveniles committing crimes, even heinous ones at times. The time has come for us to go back to our roots. The study of Indian culture, civilization and history is essential for the students to develop a proper understanding and perspective on our glorious past. Our culture always taught us to respect women, elders, teachers, nature and animals.

చదువు అనేది ప్రతి కుటుంబం యొక్క ఆర్థిక, సామాజిక స్థితిని మెరుగుపరుస్తుంది. అయితే ప్రస్తుతం అది ఒక లక్ష్యం కోసం కాకుండా, కేవలం డిగ్రీని సంపాదించే మార్గంగా మారిపోయింది.

విద్యలోని పరమార్థాన్ని అర్థం చేసుకోకుండా, కేవలం మార్కుల కోసం, సర్టిఫికేట్ ల కోసం చదవడం వల్ల, చదువు దాని విలువను కోల్పోతోంది. దేశానికి నాయకత్వం వహించే భవిష్యత్ భారత భాగ్యవిధాతల్ని తయారు చేయడమే లక్ష్యంగా విద్యారంగంలో మార్పులు రావాలి.

దేశానికి నాయకత్వం వహించే సమాజాన్ని తయారు చేయడమే లక్ష్యంగా, యువతకు జాతీయ భావాలు నూరిపోసి, నైపుణ్యం, లక్ష్యం, చిత్తశుద్ధి ఉన్న దేశభక్తులుగా వారిని తీర్చిదిద్దాల్సిన బాధ్యత ఉపాధ్యాయులు తీసుకోవాలి.

In the wake of technological advances and digital revolution, rapid and fast-paced changes are taking place in the world. The students coming out of educational institutes must be equipped to deal with new and emerging situations in an innovative and practical manner.

For this to happen, the curricula and teaching methods should be re-oriented and made relevant to the requirements of the digital age. Our classrooms should not become cages for children but should be joyful learning centres and enable them to acquire learning with passion and enthusiasm.

The teaching methods should become interactive and facilitate the students to express their doubts and raise questions freely without any inhibition and fear. Such an atmosphere will instil confidence in children, an important prerequisite for their overall development.

Apart from improving the curriculum, schools must also focus on ensuring periodic training for teachers in pedagogy. Teachers must also keep abreast with the latest trends.

It is quite essential to make children aware of India’s heritage, culture, customs, traditions and the basic Indian philosophy of sharing and caring. We believe in ‘Vasudaiva Kutumbakkam’-- the whole world is one family.

Dear Children,

Try to be erudite, but polite; creative but responsive; innovative but evocative. Be humane, inclusive and environmentally-conscious. You should also be socially conscious with a national outlook.

I am happy to know CHIREC is grooming its students to be leaders who will affect positive change across the global landscape.

I am happy to know that CHIREC’s calibre and service have not gone unnoticed within the education community. Mrs. Ratna Reddy has received numerous awards for her innovation, leadership and significant contributions to the field of education.

సమాజంలో మార్పును తీసుకురావడానికి చదువు మాత్రమే చాలదు. సమాజానికి జ్ఞానాన్ని అన్వయించి, అమలు చేసే మేధావులు కావాలి. ఇలాంటి వారు రావాలంటే, ఉపాధ్యాయులు వారికి పాఠాలు మాత్రమే నేర్పిస్తే సరిపోదు.

విద్య మాత్రమే కాదు, పిల్లలకు ఉన్నత విలువలు నేర్పాలి. చదువు మాత్రమే కాదు, వారు నేర్చుకున్న క్రమశిక్షణ, విలువలు వారిని ఉన్నత స్థానంలో నిలబెట్టితీరతాయి. అలాంటి ఎన్నో విలువలు భారతీయ సంస్కృతిలో భాగంగా ఉన్నాయి.

I am happy to learn that CHIREC fosters creativity in the student body by providing exposure to various arts and sports. CHIREC’s team of teachers and staff have been dedicated to allowing students to leverage the resources, labs, facilities and equipment at their campuses to explore new skills and attitudes, and to learn how to take initiative, show good judgement, and make smart decisions.

చిన్నతనం నుంచే మంచి మంచి పుస్తకాలు చదవడం అలవాటు చేసుకోండి. వ్యక్తిత్వాన్ని నిర్మించే అనేక పుస్తకాలు  మనకు అందుబాటులో ఉన్నాయి. దీని ద్వారా ఎందరో మహనీయుల జీవితాల గురించి తెలుసుకోవడంతో పాటు, జీవితం పట్ల అవగాహన ఏర్పరచుకోవడం సాధ్యమౌతుంది.

పిల్లలకు చదువుతో పాటు సమాజం పట్ల బాధ్యతను కూడా నేర్పించే ప్రయత్నం చేయాలి. స్వచ్ఛభారత్, చెట్ల పెంపకం, ప్లాస్టిక్ వ్యతిరేక కార్యక్రమాలు, పర్యావరణ పరిరక్షణ లాంటి వాటి పట్ల జాగృతం చేయాలి. సమాజంలో పేరుకుపోయిన వివిధ రుగ్మతలకు వ్యతిరేకంగా పిల్లల్ని చైతన్యవంతుల్ని చేయాలి.

I applaud CHIREC’s efforts to instil healthy and eco-friendly initiatives into the routines of the students by integrating the environment and sustainable initiatives throughout the school through academics, management, policies, and community activities. Love nature and live with nature should be our mantra.

Furthermore, I commend CHIREC’s initiative of having dedicated career counselling cell to guide students to explore every career and higher education opportunity available to them, so that they can make the most informed decisions about their own futures.

మనం ఎంత ఎత్తుకు ఎదిగినా, ఎంత ఉన్నతమైన స్థాయికి చేరినా ఐదు విషయాలు మాత్రం ఎప్పుడూ మర్చిపోకూడదు. కన్నతల్లి, జన్మభూమి, మాతృభాష, మాతృదేశం, చదువు చెప్పిన గురువు.

మనకు తొలిగురువు అమ్మే. అలాంటి తల్లి రుణం తీర్చుకోలేనిది. అదే విధంగా మనం పుట్టిన ఊరు మన భవిష్యత్తుకు పునాది అనే విషయాన్ని గుర్తుంచుకోవాలి.

ప్రపంచంలో ఉన్న అన్ని భాషలు నేర్చుకోండి. మీకు ఆకాశమే హద్దు. కానీ మాతృభాషను మాత్రం మర్చిపోకండి. రేపటి ప్రపంచం మీరు ఎవరు అని ప్రశ్నిస్తే, మీ మాతృభాషే మీకు సమాధానాన్ని చూపుతుంది.

మనల్ని గొప్ప వారిగా చూడాలనుకునే తపన గురువులది. వారి నుంచి విద్య మాత్రమే కాదు మంచి క్రమశిక్షణ అలవడుతుంది. వారు కేవలం చదువు చెప్పే వారు మాత్రమే కాదు, మన భవిష్యత్ కు చుక్కాని లాంటి వారు.

జీవితంలో ఎదగాలంటే కష్టపడి పని చేయడానికి మించిన మార్గం ఏదీ లేదు. క్రమశిక్షణ, చిత్తశుద్ధి, దేశభక్తి కలిగి ఉంటే చాలు... విజయాలు మీ వశమౌతాయి.

ఈ రోజుల్లో చదువుతో పాటు సాంకేతికత కూడా ముఖ్యమే. దాన్ని సరైన మార్గంలో వాడడం ఎలానో నేర్చుకోండి. టైమ్ పాస్ కోసం కాకుండా జీవితాన్ని మలచుకోండి.

మనుషుల్ని ఒక సమాజంగా నిలబెట్టేదే భాష. మనం ఎక్కడకు వెళ్ళినా మన భాష, మన యాస, మన కట్టు, మన బొట్టు... ఇలా అన్నింటినీ కాపాడుకున్నప్పుడే మనం ఎవరమనే ప్రశ్నకు సమాధానం దొరుకుతుంది. 

ఇంగ్లీషు భాషను నేర్చుకోవడంలో ఎలాంటి తప్పూ లేదు. దాన్ని కచ్చితంగా నేర్చుకుని తీరాలి. అదే సమయంలో ఇంగ్లీషు మనస్తత్వాలను మాత్రం ఒదిలించుకోవాలి. 

పిల్లల్ని మార్కుల కోసం పరిగెత్తించే సమాజాన్ని నేను కోరుకోవడం లేదు. జీవితంలో వారికి ఎదురు కాబోయే ప్రశ్నలకు సమాధానాన్ని చూపించే  చదువు వారికి అందాలని భావిస్తున్నాను.

Congratulations to Mrs. Ratna for your contributions to education sector. You have been able to create a community of individuals who are committed to excellence in education and are dedicated to creating positive and sustainable changes in society.

 

My best wishes to the CHIREC family.

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has cautioned against the clamour to provide free power saying that people want assured, uninterrupted and quality power. Inaugurating a three-day International Conference on ‘Recent Developments in Clean and Safe Nuclear Power Generation,’ organised by the Institution of Engineers (India), in Hyderabad today, he said free power meant low power and finally no power. “There is a misconception among politicians that of you don’t give free power you will lose power,” he added.

 

Shri Naidu said one should understand that low power would lead to frequent power cuts. Therefore, the focus should be on assured power for which people are willing to pay

 

The Vice President said that the country is witnessing an increasing demand for energy and the consumption was only bound to go up further by 4.2 per cent per annum.  Rapid urbanization and industrialisation are among the factors that would push energy demand and consumption further, he said.

 

Keeping the consumption in mind, he said that increasing the share of nuclear energy in the overall energy mix of the country was essential to ensure sustainable development of the nation and also to achieve India’s international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He said that clean and cost-effective energy was the need of the hour.

 

The Vice President said that nuclear power is a cost effective and commercially viable energy resource. A developing country like India should make good use of such an important energy source that is clean and cost-effective.

 

The Vice President said that one of the cheapest sources of energy being produced in India today is by a nuclear power plant (TAPS-1 & 2: 92 paisa per unit). Electricity generated by the latest Kudankulam nuclear power unit-1, sells for a little over Rs. 3 per unit, which is very competitive.

 

Referring to the contributions of Dr. Homi J. Bhabha in the development of nuclear energy in India, he said that India has been pursuing a robust three-stage nuclear power programme as formulated by the eminent scientist and said that India has made a remarkable progress in producing a clean, low-cost nuclear energy.

 

As part of promoting Swachh Bharat campaign, he called upon scientists, engineers, doctors and others to create awareness among people on the need for having clean energy. He said that clean fuel, clean mind, clean body and clean money were essential for making India into a healthy and wealthy nation.

 

The Vice President also called for massive afforestation to increase the green cover in the country. “For long, we have played with the nature. Now nature is playing with us”, he cautioned and wanted people to protect nature and preserve culture for a better future.

 

The Vice President exhorted Love the Nature and Live with the Nature. He further said that Nature, Culture together for better future. Let us have clean Tan (body) Man (mind) Dhan (money), he said. Shri Naidu concluded by saying ‘if you follow this you can have healthy and wealthy nation’.

 

The Home Minister of Telangana, Shri N. Narasimha Reddy, former Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, Dr. R. Chidambaram and the President of Institute of Engineers India, Shri Sisir Kumar Banerjee, Engineers, Scientists and Professors were among those present at the event.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am delighted to participate in this international conference on ‘Recent Developments in Clean and Safe Nuclear Power Generation’, which is being organised as part of the centenary celebrations of the Institution of Engineers (India).

 

With the Institution of Engineers (India) set to complete 100 years of its existence in 2020, i am told that five years of centenary celebrations have begun in 2015.

 

The theme and the location are very apt as the Institution of Engineers, Hyderabad is surrounded by many Department of Atomic Energy establishments like Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration & Research, Nuclear Fuel Complex and the Uranium Corporation of India Limited, which are contributing to front end technologies of Nuclear Fuel Cycle. 

 

Talking about the importance of power generation for sustained development to the experts gathered here is like carrying coals to Newcastle. As you all aware, India is witnessing an increasing demand for energy and the consumption is only bound to go up further in the coming decades. It is estimated that India’s energy consumption will grow by 4.2 per annum, the fastest among all major economies by 2040 with fossil fuels meeting 82 per cent of the demand, followed by renewable energy as the second largest source of energy.  The enhanced energy consumption is likely to push the country’s share of global energy demand to 11 per cent by 2040 as against 5 per cent in 2016.

 

Rapid urbanization and industrialisation are among the factors that would push energy demand and consumption.

 

The generation of different types energy, including nuclear, has to be increased manifold times to ensure sustainable development of the nation and to achieve the international benchmark of per capita energy consumption.

 

In the wake of global warming and climate change and India’s international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there is a stress on increasing the share of nuclear energy in the overall energy mix of the country.

 

Coming to the development of nuclear energy, India has been pursuing a robust three stage nuclear power programme based on a closed nuclear fuel cycle formulated by the great visionary Dr.Homi J. Bhabha.

 

At the first International Conference on Nuclear Energy in Geneva in 1955, Dr. Bhabha in his presidential address had said :‘For the full industrialization of the under-developed countries, for the continuation of our civilization and its further development, atomic energy is not merely an aid, it is an absolute necessity. The acquisition by man of the knowledge of how to release and use atomic energy must be recognized as the third epoch of human history.’ 

 

Today India is a technology-empowered country in nuclear area as a result of its hard work over the past decades. We are the only country to have a reactor operating on U-233 fuel. India has mastered the PHWR (Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor) technology and has successfully scaled up from 220 MWe to 700 MWe capacity reactors. The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is currently operating 22 commercial nuclear reactors with an installed capacity of 6780 MW. The reactor fleet comprises 18 PHWRs, two BWRs and two 1,000 MW VVER reactors at Kudankulam.

 

India is poised to enter into the second stage of nuclear programme with 500 MWe PFBR (Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor), which is expected to be operational shortly.

 

Dr. Bhabha had remarked that ""no power is as expensive as no power”.  This perfectly matches to the present day economic development with nuclear power. Presently, all the developing countries including India seek new energy sources like nuclear, solar, wind to sustain high rates of economic growth. There is now a growing consensus that nuclear power is an important energy source that is clean and cost-effective. 

 

As part of the Civil Nuclear Initiative to allow the resumption of full civil nuclear cooperation between India and the international community several agreements and reciprocal commitments were concluded and we look forward to their full and effective implementation in the coming months and years.

 

Nuclear power is a cost effective and commercially viable energy resource. One of the cheapest sources of energy being produced in India today is by a nuclear power plant (TAPS-1&2: 92 paisa/unit). Electricity generated by the latest Kudankulam nuclear power unit -1, sells for a little over Rs. 3 per unit, which is very competitive.

 

The government has established the legal framework for a nuclear industry and an independent regulatory organization AERB is responsible for licensing and regulatory control of nuclear power plants and for enforcing the relevant regulations.

 

The separation between the responsibilities of the regulatory organization and those of other parties is clear and regulators retain their independence as a safety authority and are protected from undue pressure.  This is the reason Indian nuclear power program has a wonderful safety record.

 

India has an installed nuclear power capacity of 6,780 MW (2016-17), which contributes to over 3% of total electricity generated. Even though the nuclear contribution is not high at this stage, however this lays a solid foundation for the rapid expansion of nuclear power addition through fast breeder reactors and the collaborative projects to install Light Water Reactors (LWRs).

 

I expect this International conference will provide a platform for deliberations and exchange of views on the growing global energy demand and the need to reduce the dependence on fossil fuel based power generation. Experts gathered here should come out with a roadmap on these aspects as also on developing newer technologies for increasing safety and further reducing the cost of nuclear power generation.

 

With eminent personalities, scientists, engineers and technocrats having expertise in the field brainstorming on diverse topics, I am confident that the discussions at this international conference will throw new light on a whole gamut of issues relating to the field of nuclear energy. I hope the conference will boost the spirit to work for sustainable growth of nuclear energy in the world.

 

I wish all the best to the organizers for having a successful Conference.

 

Thank you.”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the union of science and spirituality was the need of the hour for promoting a society that is free of terror, violence, poverty and discrimination. He said that the unique combination of science and spirituality would provide solutions to the contemporary challenges faced by the world.

Inaugurating the dome-prayer hall & library and world parliament of science, religion and philosophy at MIT campus, Pune today, the Vice President said that peace is the foremost prerequisite for progress and development.  One cannot pay attention to development if there is tension, he added.  He reiterated that all the countries in the world should come together to stamp out the menace of terrorism. Condemning all forms violence, he said that only ballot can provide solution not bullet.

Appreciating the architectural marvel of the dome having a diameter of 160 feet, he said that it was not just a structure made of bricks and cement but it was a beacon of India’s rich cultural heritage.  He said that the message behind the dome was to prevent doom.

Referring to the 54 bronze statues of revered scholars, saints, scientists, philosophers and gurus erected inside the world prayer hall, he expressed confidence that it will provide peace, inspiration and solace to millions of visitors from India and abroad.  

Appreciating MIT World Peace University for exposing students to modern science along with ancient values and spiritual wisdom, he recalled that India had a long tradition of Gurukul education where Vedas and sciences, ancient values of brotherhood, humanity love, discipline and mutual respect were seamlessly woven into the curriculum.

Observing that India had enough of copying the western education model, he called for a revamp of the present education system.  He also stressed the need to make the education system relevant to the job market. However, he pointed that education was not meant only for employment but also for enhancement of knowledge, empowerment and enlightenment.

Paying tributes to Mahatma Gandhi on his birth anniversary today, he said that the dome was a true endorsement of the Gandhian thought and a manifestation of all the good that comes out of it.

He said ""Mahatma Gandhi’s life and teachings are a treasure trove of wisdom to the youth of today. He was a seeker of truth and pursued discipline and spirituality all his life. Gandhiji emphasized on simplicity, kindness, truth, and non-violence as his life’s mantras. He always taught that ethics and morals should be the foundations of one’s life. His teachings transcend the boundaries of time and space and have acted as the moral compass that has been guiding India’s journey towards progress, for decades.”

Referring to Swacchta initiative of the government of India, he said he was confident that the country will achieve cleanliness by 2022 with the participation of every citizen. 

The Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Phadnavis, Eminent Scientist, Dr. Raghunath A. Mashelkar, the Chancellor of Nalanda University, Dr. Vijay Bhatkar, the Founder President of MIT World Peace University, Prof. Dr. V.D.Karad, the Members of Parliaments, Educationists, Scientists and Spiritual Gurus from various countries were present on the occasion.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

"" It is a Historic Occasion today that we are inaugurating one of the largest domes in the world on Mahatma Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary. The city of Pune has a rich history and is considered as the cultural capital of Maharashtra. This dome is a monumental addition to the thoughts propagated by the great Saints of Maharashtra.

I have been told that this enormous structure has a diameter of 160 feet with only 24 pillars as the foundation. The dome also houses a library and a prayer hall, with 54 bronze statues of revered scholars, saints, scientists, philosophers and gurus. The library covers an unbelievable expanse of 62,500 sq. ft. and is a testament to the knowledge and wisdom that India as a country holds and disseminates. 

Monuments do not earn their greatness by their design and structure alone, it is the vision behind its creation that matters. This dome is not just a structure made of bricks and cement, it is a beacon of India’s rich cultural heritage and the harbinger of light to the lives of many who look to it for solace and peace. I am confident that it will inspire and attract millions of people from all over the world, taking India to new heights of spirituality and humanism.

I am aware of the various social initiatives undertaken by Dr. Vishwanath Karad in Pune, Alandi and Latur, and I must say this dome in all its grandeur is a true reflection of the vision he held for posterity and his mission in life. MIT has played a pivotal role in the private education sector of Maharashtra and it is the uniqueness of Dr. Karad’s vision which separates it from other similar institutions. 

I am pleased to know that Dr. Vishwanath Karad’s legacy rests safely in the able hands of Shri. Rahul Karad, whose dynamism has led to the conception of various social initiatives which aim to integrate youth in the process of nation building.

For centuries, India has been a centre of learning and an apostle of peace and MIT WPU has been established on this philosophy. It is focused on being the change that is needed in the world today by sensitizing and understanding the human dimensions of conflict, and developing a toolbox of transferable skills such as negotiation, peace building, technology and management which enable graduates from various diverse programs to succeed in peace building.

MIT World Peace University has always functioned keeping the ideals of Swami Vivekananda in mind, focusing on the union of science and spirituality. They have presented in front of the world the inimitable Indian model of education, which is an amalgamation of modern science and ancient spiritual wisdom. It is something innate and inherent to India which has had a long tradition of Gurukul education. In the Gurukul, along with teaching Vedas and sciences, ancient values of brotherhood, humanity, love, discipline and mutual respect were seamlessly woven into the curriculum. They were truly comprehensive learning environments where intellectual development, personality development and spiritual development occurred. 

I am told that MIT not only seeks to expose students to infinite possibilities of modern science, but ensures that their feet are planted firmly in ancient values and wisdom which are of timeless utility.

The whole nation would be celebrating the 150th Birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi Ji. He is the father of our nation, and like an ideal father, like the perfect head of the family, he has guided all of us to lead truthful, ethical and honorable lives. His contribution to the nation and his greatness will light the path of our lives for thousands of years to come. This dome is a true endorsement of the Gandhian thought and a manifestation of all the good that comes out of it. 

Gandhi ji led from the front and led by example. His moral courage and honesty was so blemish-free, it gave him the strength and the confidence to proclaim with utmost conviction that his life was his message. Mahatma Gandhi’s life and teachings are a treasure trove of wisdom to the youth of today. He was a seeker of truth and pursued discipline and spirituality all his life. Gandhiji emphasized on simplicity, kindness, truth, and non-violence as his life’s mantras. He always taught that ethics and morals should be the foundations of one’s life. His teachings transcend the boundaries of time and space and have acted as the moral compass that has been guiding India’s journey towards progress, for decades. 

His clarion call for Swacchta moves the nation to this day. The initiative of Swachha Bharat was launched on this very day by the Government of India. Each year we are moving one step closer to Gandhiji’s dream of a Swachha Bharat and I am confident that if every citizen believes in Gandhiji’s dream, we will achieve it by 2022.MIT should be able to produce not one but thousands of leaders who are honest, courageous, creative and devoted, with unquestionable integrity and unwavering commitment to the cause of nation building. 

I am happy to note that the World Parliament of Science, Religion and Philosophy would have unique sessions on various thought provoking topics where many eminent people from all walks of life would participate and share their knowledge and experiences. I wish success to this parliament and I have full faith that it will achieve its objectives.

On one hand, the world is moving forward at a very fast pace, but on other hand it is also experiencing chaos, confusion, bloodshed and discrimination. The solution to this chaos lies within the thought of this dome where ideals of all the religions reside together. All religions preach love. This one understanding is sufficient to bring about world peace and brotherhood. 

India has always been welcoming all religions, cultures and traditions. In its diversity, lies India’s strength. This mutual respect and peaceful coexistence is the hallmark of Indian ethos. I pray that this dome, which symbolizes harmony and peace is able to inspire a sense of unity and humanity in every single person who enters its premises.

I would like to congratulate Dr. Vishwanath Karad and Shri Rahul Karad for creating this epitome of architectural magnificence. The monument is sure to become a global marvel. 

My best wishes are with the whole MIT Family for all their future endeavors.

Thank you.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has expressed his concern over mixing of views with news and said that the cardinal principles of journalism seem to have taken a back seat. Delivering the 3rd Justice J.S. Verma Memorial Lecture on ‘Freedom & Responsibility of Media in the evolving media space’, here today, he expressed his anguish over the diminishing values in journalism. 

The Vice President asked journalists to be extra careful in checking the veracity of information in the present digital era and advised them to guard against ‘fake news’, disinformation and misinformation. The digital media provides news by the minute in a “fastest finger first” mode, with alerts and flashes on smart phones. In this milieu, with media houses scrambling to flash news alerts to an ever-widening base of users, the freedom and responsibility of the media acquire far greater significance than ever before, he said.

The Vice President condemned the obsession of news organizations in lending primacy to their points of view. Truth, objectivity, accuracy, credibility, fairness, impartiality, humanity and accountability seem to have taken a back seat with news purveyors themselves assuming the role of gate-keepers. The disturbing trend of mixing news with views has become the new normal, he said. 

The Vice President said that some sections of the media have become propagandists of a particular ideology and reduced broadsheet journalism to pamphleteering. In such a scenario, freedom and responsibility cannot be considered as inseparable. They are as inter-dependent on each other as a TV channel is on an OB Van or a newspaper on newsprint, he added. 

The Vice President said that freedom of media is not absolute and is circumscribed by certain reasonable restrictions relating to security of State, public order, decency or morality, defamation and contempt of court and sovereignty and integrity of India.

Saying that every Indian citizen has a responsibility in protecting the sovereignty and integrity of the country, the Vice President sought much more responsibility from the media, particularly the Television medium.

The Vice President said that TV Channels must exercise editorial discretion while broadcasting a prgramme and see that it does not harm viewers. TV stations should not promote programmes or serials which seek to justify superstitions or promote irrational beliefs. I feel that there should be also be some check on sponsored health programmes, which make exaggerated claims on benefits of health products, he added.

The Vice President said that media must enlighten people on their rights as only an informed citizenry can provide the best checks and balances in a democracy. He said that media must act as an instrument of reformation in the transformation of India into a leading economic power in the coming decades.

Following is the text of Vice President’s Lecture:

“It is a singular honour for me to deliver the 3rd Justice J.S. Verma Memorial Lecture on ‘Freedom & Responsibility of Media in the evolving media space’. I am thankful to the organizers for having invited me to share my views with all of you.

As all of you here are aware, Justice Verma was a highly respected legal luminary, who had served as Chief Justice of India and the Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission with utmost distinction.

He was a firm believer in protecting fundamental rights, ensuring social justice and empowerment of women. Justice Verma was a a man of great erudition and his knowledge and wisdom were tempered with high ethical and moral values.  Above all, he was an outstanding humanist.

The digital media provides news by the minute in a “fastest finger first” mode, with alerts and flashes on smart phones. In this milieu, with media houses scrambling to flash news alerts to an ever-widening base of users, the freedom and responsibility of the media acquire far greater significance than ever before.

In the present digital era when millions are using social media platforms, journalists will have to be extra careful in checking the veracity of information and guard against ‘fake news’, disinformation and misinformation.

Vested interests and mischievous elements will always try to spread false stories. In the recent past, we have been witness to the unfortunate incidents of lynchings due to false information on social media.

In today’s times, the cardinal principles of journalism such as truth, objectivity, accuracy, credibility, fairness, impartiality, humanity and accountability seem to have taken a back seat with news purveyors themselves assuming the role of gate-keepers. Most news channels are obsessed with lending primacy to their points of view.

The disturbing trend of mixing news with views has become the new normal. 

Of course, some sections of the media have become propagandists of a particular ideology and reduced broadsheet journalism to pamphleteering. In such a scenario, freedom and responsibility cannot be considered as inseparable. They are as inter-dependent on each other as a TV channel is on an OB Van or a newspaper on newsprint.

Tolerance, acceptance and assimilation of diverse viewpoints have been the hallmark of Indian civilization. 

The freedom of media is not absolute and is circumscribed by certain reasonable restrictions relating to security of State, public order, decency or morality, defamation and contempt of court and sovereignty and integrity of India.

Every Indian citizen has a responsibility in protecting the sovereignty and integrity of the country.

The media, particularly the Television medium, should not promote programmes or serials which seek to justify superstitions or promote irrational beliefs. I feel that there should be also be some check on sponsored health programmes, which make exaggerated claims on benefits of health products.

The media should act as a bridge between the Government and people. It ought to ensure that justice is not denied to the people, particularly the vulnerable and marginalized sections of society.

It should give equal importance to all regions of the country and all segments of society. Often, we see excessive focus on political developments and on events closer to the Capital and major metropolitan cities. This must change. The media must focus on development and welfare.

At the risk of sounding didactic, let me add that the Media must enlighten people on their rights as only an informed citizenry can provide the best checks and balances in a democracy. The media should also act as an instrument of reformation in the transformation of India into a leading economic power in the coming decades. Finally, I would like to reiterate that MEDIA should function as ‘Means of Empowerment for Development through Informed Actions’.

Thank you. Jaihind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that although we inhabit different geographical locations, we are all bound by a common mission, to build a better world for our posterity. He was addressing the Concluding Technical Plenary Session of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, here today. The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Yogi Adityanath, the Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation, Smt. Uma Bharti, the Deputy Minister of Water and Sanitation, South Africa, Ms. Pamela Tshwere and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that the Father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi accorded highest priority to sanitation and cleanliness. He said, “Sanitation is more important than political freedom.” I feel very proud that in the past few years, India has made unprecedented progress towards achieving universal safe sanitation goals, he added.

The Vice President said that everybody from celebrities to the common man has selflessly participated and taken ownership of the programme, rather than treating it as a government-driven campaign. It is because of the missionary zeal with which everybody participated that the goal of a “Clean India” seems closer and real now, he added.

The Vice President said that we are a country of 1.2 billion people, large and complex. But the Swachh Bharat Mission has been the great unifier, has made remarkable progress and has transformed the sanitation situation in all parts of the country, he added.

The Vice President said that it is the result of a very intelligent and carefully planned campaign the clarion call for which was made by none other than the Prime Minister of the nation. He led from the front and his countrymen followed dutifully and wholeheartedly, he added.

Saying that there is still some distance to travel, the Vice President said that we are committed and India is on track to achieve open defecation free status by 2019 – the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. This is going to significantly contribute to the global achievement of SDG 6, he added.

The Vice President said that building toilets is only one and a physical aspect of this noble mission. But what is more important is a ‘cultural revolution’ and this culture of clean living has been heralded through intensive behaviour change campaigns, he added.

Saying that this is of foremost importance in the strategy for achieving cleanliness, the Vice President said that everyone from the Prime Minister to Bollywood stars to sports icons to the common man has participated in spreading the message. Change in mindset is the need of the hour, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am pleased to participate in the Concluding Technical Plenary Session of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.

I understand that over the past three days, Ministers from across the World along with Sanitation experts have deliberated on various aspects of sanitation and are keen to work together to eliminate the degrading practice of open defecation from the world.

Most of you are aware that the Father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi accorded highest priority to sanitation and cleanliness. He said, “Sanitation is more important than political freedom.” I feel very proud that in the past few years, India has made unprecedented progress towards achieving universal safe sanitation goals.

This dream of the ‘Father of the Nation’ could be realized through ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’ - a government programme that eventually became a ‘Jan-andolan’, a people’s movement. Ever since the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi launched ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’ and called upon the countrymen to come together and work to achieve ‘Clean India’ by 2019, the response from all countrymen has been tremendous.

Everybody from celebrities to the common man has selflessly participated and taken ownership of the programme, rather than treating it as a government-driven campaign. It is because of the missionary zeal with which everybody participated that the goal of a “Clean India” seems closer and real now. As Hon’ble President had said in his inaugural address – “An Open Defecation Free India is the best 150th Birthday Gift, we could give Mahatma Gandhi”.

Mahatma Gandhi had once said, “One must care about the world one will not see”. This reflected India’s deep commitment to sustainable development. Realising the importance of water and sanitation towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals, a dedicated SDG on water and sanitation – the SDG 6 was set, which aimed “to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.” India has taken massive strides towards achieving universal safe sanitation. I am sure this convention has identified common grounds and mechanism to collaborate on eliminating open defecation from different countries.

Friends, we are a country of 1.2 billion people, large and complex. But the Swachh Bharat Mission has been the great unifier, has made remarkable progress and has transformed the sanitation situation in all parts of the country. The number of people practicing open defecation in rural India has gone down from 550 million in 2014, to less than 100 million today. 22 states, more than 500 districts and half million of the villages have been declared ODF. All villages along the banks of the Ganga have been declared ODF. Urban India is very close to being declared ODF as well. This tremendous achievement was no coincidence. It is the result of a very intelligent and carefully planned campaign the clarion call for which was made by none other than the Prime Minister of the nation. He led from the front and his countrymen followed dutifully and wholeheartedly. There is still some distance to travel, but we are committed and India is on track to achieve open defecation free status by 2019 – the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. This is going to significantly contribute to the global achievement of SDG 6.

While the success of the programme can be largely attributed to the extensive participation of people at large, the driving force has been the constant focus on ‘behaviour change.’ Swachh Bharat initiative is different from other programmes as it targeted the minds of the people, aiming to get people to start thinking about sanitation and make it a priority. It doesn’t seek to meet the needs already felt in the minds of the people. This leads to the pragmatic shift from a ‘service delivery approach’ to a ‘demand driven approach.’ Building toilets is only one and a physical aspect of this noble mission. But what is more important is a ‘cultural revolution’. This culture of clean living has been heralded through intensive behaviour change campaigns. This is of foremost importance in the strategy for achieving cleanliness, and everyone from the Prime Minister to Panchayat Leaders, Bollywood stars to sports icons, boys and girls in schools to spiritual leaders and above all the common man have participated in spreading this message. Their role in supporting Swachh Bharath Abhiyan is commendable. Change in mindset is the need of the hour.

We couldn’t have achieved sustained progress had we adopted a business as usual approach. We collectively searched for innovative solutions at all levels and implemented them with utmost zeal and enthusiasm, to bring about tangible differences to the lives of our people. Our Swachhagrahis are at the grassroots, continuing to work towards keeping sanitation at the top of people’s minds and sustaining the gains we have already made. A mention must be made of the active participation of children in the campaign. The schools of India, especially those in rural areas, acted as resource centres for the Swachh Bharat Mission. The children were taught how crucial good sanitation was to their life and future and were trained to be change agents. Their tremendous contribution to the success of this mission will forever be remembered by this great nation.

The recent recognition accorded to us by the World Health Organization (WHO), that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan will be successful in averting more than three lakh deaths between October 2014 and 2019 is very encouraging and a matter of pride for the whole country.

I hope that the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC) provided an opportunity to share experiences of Sanitation Ministers, sector specialists and public health specialists from around the world. It would be very helpful for India to learn from the success stories and best practices from the participating countries.

The world is now a closely knit and well connected cosmos. Although we inhabit different geographical locations, we are all bound by a common mission, to build a better world for our posterity. It is not an easy task and cannot be carried out by nations working alone. It will take our collective determination, our shared wisdom and pooled resources to realize this vital mission. Conventions like the MGISC which act as platforms for cooperation and mutual exchange, play a vital role in creating the much needed synergy between countries working to combat the great challenges of our times.

The convention has been addressed by many eminent speakers like Mr Arun Jaitley, Finance Minister and Mr Kevin Rudd, the Former Prime Minister of Australia. Hon’ble Ministers from Madagascar, Bangladesh, Senegal, Ghana and Indonesia have addressed the various parallel technical sessions on very relevant themes of Strategic Partnerships, Urban Sanitation and Fecal Sludge Management, Gender and Inclusive Sanitation, Sustaining ODF Status and Sanitation as everyone’s Business and Technology and Innovation. All of you have also deliberated in the ministerial sessions.

I hope your visit to Gujarat on ‘Gandhi Trail’ particularly, to Mahatma Mandir, Sabarmati Ashram to learn about the life and lesions of Mahatma Gandhi, has been inspirational and you have come back with some insights from the life of the great soul. You could also see for yourself, the impact of the programme on the ground in your visit to Punsari village. I hope, these will help in your country’s journey towards achieving and sustaining universal sanitation.

Friends, we are grateful for your participation and for your experiences shared in this convention. We will be committed to support the global community with all the knowledge, we have gained.

Let me end by reiterating our firm commitment to eradicate open defecation from our country and the world. Let us further accelerate the campaign against open defecation and make it an eminently forgettable history. Let us aim to make our country ‘Swachh’ by all means - Tan( Body), Man(Mind), Dhan(Money)

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has stressed on the need to respect and seek guidance of the elderly people. Calling them the conscious keepers of our society, he said that adequate steps must be taken to provide facilities to them. He was addressing the gathering after presenting Vayoshreshtha Samman Awards 2018 on the International Day of Elderly Persons, here today. The Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Thaawar Chand Gehlot, the Ministers of State for Social Justice & Empowerment, Shri Ramdas Athawale, Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar, Shri Vijay Sampla and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

The Vice President said that he would salute the wisdom and experience of the elders whose hard work and selfless sacrifices helped build this nation. I salute their struggle, their unique journeys and their success, he added.

The Vice President called on authorities and all the people working for the welfare of senior citizens to avoid the use of the word 'Old' and replace it with 'Senior'. He further said that there should be no 'Old age Homes' in India, there should only be 'Homes for the Elderly and Senior Citizens'. The word 'Old' invokes a prejudice and does not do justice to the energy and youth of our veterans, he added.

Expressing concern over the rising incidents of neglect of elders, the Vice President said that rapid proliferation of nuclear families coupled with urbanization of the society, inter-generational bonding has weakened. He stressed the need to safeguard and revive the joint family system and said that elders enjoyed a place of reverence under the system. Elders are the custodians of righteousness, traditions, family honour, samskar and wisdom and it is the responsibility of the present generation or the children of the family to play a greater role in ensuring the welfare of elderly persons, he added.

The exorbitant cost of medical expenses is a burden, especially for elderly persons, said the Vice President as he suggested extending government healthcare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat to senior citizens. Quoting the 2011 Census data, he said that hat 8.6% of total population is above 60 years old and it is important to reach them and give them the facilities they need and the dignity they deserve. For this, the Vice President called for a special drive to include all the elderly people in affordable healthcare programmes. The processes of availing the benefits of such Government schemes should be easy and we cannot expect our elderly citizens to run around the office at that age, to avail the benefits, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am honored to present the Vayoshreshtha Samman Awards 2018 on the International Day of Older Persons.

The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to observe 1st October, 1999 as the International Year of Older Persons and to promote the theme ""A society for All Ages"". Ever since 1st October every year is celebrated as International Day of Older Persons. It is indeed appropriate to envision a society which has compassion and respect for persons of all ages particularly the Elders. Though we take pride of being a Young country with youth constituting 65% of the population, the wisdom and experience of elders is always needed to mentor the young talent of the country.

According to the Census of 2011, about 8.6 per cent of the total population is of the age of 60+ years. Based on the rate of growth, the population of the elderly in India is projected to reach about 19 percent of the total population, by the year 2050. The number of elderly women is more as compared to the number of elderly men. 70% of the elderly population lives in villages where medical facilities and healthcare infrastructure and livelihood opportunities are minimal. Their health and financial security is a major concern as most of the youth migrate to cities in search of employment.

Sisters and Brothers,

We often hear of Generation Gap. The society changes intrinsically, continuously but gradually. This process continues for ages. It does not allow sudden disruptions between generations. The nature has destined that successive generations coexist so that social skills and wisdom are naturally transferred from one generation to the next one. Generation Gap is against the norm and scheme of society. Every society teaches its new generations to respect and revere elders. This finer link must be sustained from generation to generation.

Sisters and Brothers,

Every society has age old tradition of respecting and caring for the Elderly. Under our traditional Joint family system, they enjoyed a place of reverence. They were custodians of righteousness, traditions, family honour and samskar and wisdom.   However, with rapid proliferation of nuclear families coupled with urbanization of the society, inter-generational bonding has weakened. The younger generation does not have the pleasure of enjoying the tender care, love, affection, patronage and guidance of the older generations. That is why we must promote and preserve the age old joint family system. India should revive its traditional family system and stand as a model for other countries. Share and care is core of the Indian Philosophy.

Though with advancements in Medical Sciences and improved technology, the longevity of people has increased from the average level of 60s, to 70s, however, we have not been able to provide commensurate social, economic, physical and health security to our elderly people.

With advancing age the need for comprehensive health care increases as the incidence of acute and chronic disease conditions worsen. Chronic but non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, arthritis, etc. are more prevalent in the elderly and often require long term costly treatment. This causes a drain on the economic capacity of the elderly persons themselves in their twilight years and also on their families. By one estimate, every year some 5 crore people fall under the poverty line due to costly treatment. I will suggest that a survey must be done to discover how many of them are elderly people?  And, if elderly citizens residing in rural areas are facing destitutions due to high cost of prolonged treatment. Such exorbitant cost of health care is essentially a social crisis that needs to be resolved. 

It is in this context that the relevance of schemes like “Ayushman Bharat” must be appreciated. The scheme has come as a boon to elderly people. I will suggest that special drive should be launched to enroll elderly people specially from villages and rural areas. The Ministry of Social Justice along with Ministry of Health should launch special awareness drive about Ayushman Bharat among elderly people. I also think that Yoga and affordable AYUSH system of medicine can help in preventing and containing the old age related ailments and must be popularized particularly in rural and semi urban areas.

I am told that a healthcare scheme - National Programme for the Health Care of the Elderly, has been launched to address the various health related problems. Two National Centers of Ageing are also being set up at Chennai and New Delhi. In addition, Regional Geriatric Centers are also being established.

We must appreciate that age-related issues are chronic and require prolonged treatment and post – treatment rehabilitation. Geriatric care should be a separate medical, nursing and physiotherapy discipline.  I will suggest that our Hospitals should have separate Geriatric Departments and Wards with specialists and paramedical staff trained in geriatric care.

I am told that the Government is assisting in setting up Old age homes, Day care Homes for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, physiotherapy clinics and Mobile Health Clinics for remote areas and villages. ""Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana"" has been launched since 2017, for free distribution of physical aids and devices to senior citizens belonging to the BPL category.

I will suggest that quality of services provided under these Government schemes must be ensured and coverage should be expanded. The processes of availing the benefits of such Government schemes should be easy. We cannot expect our elderly citizens to run around the office at that age, to avail the benefits.   Concerned agencies and Hospitals must use digital technology to facilitate people to avail these schemes. Government may hire volunteers, school students to help elderly people avail the benefit of schemes.    

It is indeed a tragic irony that your income sources are restricted when you need them the most to meet your age related expenses like health care.  I am happy to learn that to reduce the financial hardship of our elderly citizens in their old age,  ""Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana"" a pension scheme for the elderly, is being implemented by L.I.C. of India since 2017. Under this Scheme, an assured income of 8 per cent per annum is given to the senior citizens for ten years, along with Life Insurance Cover. In addition another pension scheme for monthly pension to senior citizens belonging to BPL category is under implementation. Most States provide additional contribution to the pension for the elderly. I will suggest that the possibility could be explored to increase the interest rate under ""Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana"" to 12% on a fixed maximum amount and the tenure should be extended, so that senior citizens could earn a decent monthly income for subsistence.

Sisters and Brothers,

What should have been a natural social norm of caring our elders and sharing their burden has to be enforced through legislation, ""Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007"". Parents will hate to evoke legal measures against their own children. But the very need for such a legislative measure indicates the crisis and marginalization our elders face in their families. I am told that the Act is being suitably amended to make more effective and beneficial. I also understand that the Government is finalizing a new National Policy for Senior Citizens.

Thank you for your patient hearing.

 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India has been unequivocal in its commitment to the preservation and protection of human rights globally as well as within the country. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the National Human Rights Conclave being organized as a part of the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of the National Human Rights Commission, here today. The Chairperson, National Human Rights Commission, Justice H.L. Dattu and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President reaffirmed that human rights were the most natural rights, inherent to all human beings without discrimination. He also tasked the state with the primary responsibility of upholding, respecting, protecting and fulfilling these inalienable rights and he applauded India’s robust human rights protection framework comprising of a fiercely independent and fair judiciary, media, civil society and a number of proactive and independent human right bodies, such as the National Human Rights Commission. India is also a signatory to several of the core UN Human Rights and International Labour Organization’s conventions, he added.

The Vice President appreciated the good work done by NHRC as a diligent watchdog of human rights protection and said that the massive rise in the number of complaints received by the NHRC from 496 in 1993 to 79,612 cases in 2018 were a testament to the faith that the people of India placed on the NHRC. He lauded the efforts of NHRC towards eradication of the abhorrent practices of bonded labor child labor and manual scavenging. 

The Vice President insisted that special focus should be placed on protecting the rights of the vulnerable sections of the society, especially women and children. He reserved a few proud words to speak of India’s strong track record of affirmative action, especially women’s reservation in Local Self governing bodies. He said that the contribution of women, who are ‘Shaktiswarupinis’, was indispensable to nation building and added that the principle of gender equality was enshrined in the constitution. He placed the onus on parents and teachers to inculcate the principles of gender equality in children. He declared that no civilized society would tolerate or accept any form of violence or discrimination against women and children. 

The Vice President highlighted several challenges that lay in the path towards securing human rights. He observed that Indian democracy allows space for everyone to express their opinions. He welcomed ‘dissent’ but warned that ‘disintegration’ would not be tolerated.

The Vice President argued that human rights did not confer unfettered liberty to anyone to speak against the state or nation and added that human rights are best upheld if they are in harmony with the interests of the nation and fellow citizens. He lamented that the misuse of provisions of the human rights emerged as recent phenomenon. He observed that Human Rights are for everyone, in equal measure and therefore the rights of one person could not transgress the rights of another. In this context, he condemned acts of terrorism and said that India had lost several of its luminary leaders including Shri Rajiv Gandhi, Smt. Indira Gandhi and a number of MLAs and MPs to mindless acts of terror. 

He extended a warm welcome to delegates from all over the world and told them that their presence in the Conclave reflected the deep concerns they had for the protection of human rights in their countries. He expressed hope that the conclave would act as a platform for dwelling upon diverse challenges to protection of human rights. He hoped that we would soon be able to ensure that the dignity and rights of all people, without exception are protected and a respect for human life and natural environment is fostered. 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to participate in this INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS CONCLAVE and share my thoughts with all of you.

Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings without discrimination. The primary responsibility for upholding human rights rests with States which have the responsibility to respect, protect and fulfill those rights. 

The human rights discourse has assumed great importance, especially in the last few decades, with human rights being viewed by governments and civil society alike, as indispensable to the realization of peaceful existence and human development, including the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The arena of human rights and social justice has gradually expanded over the decades to include among others, the right to healthcare, education, food, business responsibility to respect human rights, policy-level interventions in the form of affirmative action for the historically marginalized and discriminated. Further, issues of gender, youth, the differently-abled, and the elderly are also recognized as important human right concerns today.

India has been unequivocal in its commitment to the preservation and protection of human rights globally as well as within the country. It is a signatory to several of the core UN human rights and International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966; International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, 1966; Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 1979; Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989; and the Conventions on Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Racial Discrimination, Forced Labour, and Equal Remuneration, among others.

In addition to being a signatory to these important human rights conventions, the country also boasts of a robust human rights protection framework comprising a fiercely independent and fair judiciary, media, civil society and independent human right bodies, such as, the National Human Rights Commission, National Commissions for Women, Children, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Minorities, and State Human Rights Commissions. Collectively, these institutions provide a vigorous and effective network for human rights protection and an effective system of checks and balances. 

The establishment of urban and rural local self-government, notably the three-tier Panchayati Raj system is also a crucial component of this human rights protection framework, for it has taken development, human rights, and socio-economic welfare down to the very grass-root level. Local self-governance in India has opened up new vistas in women's empowerment and the participation of historically marginalized groups such as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in local governance/public affairs, thus, bolstering our shared vision for the realization of human rights and human empowerment.

 It was in keeping with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 and the Paris Principles, adopted at the first international workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Paris in October 1991 and endorsed by the General Assembly of the United Nations through its Resolution of 20 December 1993, that countries across the world established their respective National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs). 

The National Human Rights Commission of India was also instituted by the Parliament of India with a view to realizing the cherished goal of equal rights and life opportunities for all people.

Since its establishment on 12 October 1993, the NHRC, India has played a pivotal role in the enforcement of the fundamental rights outlined in our Constitution and those contained in key international human rights instruments to which India is a party. The Commission has earned the confidence and trust of all stakeholders, given its constructive and growing role as a watchdog of human rights protection in society. There has been a surge in the number of complaints received by the Commission over the years – from a mere 496 complaints in the year of its inception, to 79,612 cases registered and 64,670 cases disposed off during the period 2017-18 (up to 31.03.2018). The phenomenal increase in the number of complaints received by the Commission is indicative of the growing awareness of their rights among the people as also their growing faith in the Commission to obtain relief and redress for rights violations.

The phenomenal range of activities of the Commission has been aimed at the protection of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. It has directed its efforts towards the eradication of the abhorrent practices of bonded and child labour and manual scavenging, as well as protection of the rights of vulnerable sections including, children, women, under trial prisoners, and other marginalized sections of society. 

The Commission has also undertaken work in areas such as the right to health, food, silicosis, business and human rights, prisons and police reforms, displacement, education, and the rights of the differently-abled and elderly. 

NHRIs under the Paris Principles, were envisioned as important actors to further realize the goals set out by the international comity of nations within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and UN Charter. Acknowledging the important role played by these domestic bodies in protecting and promoting human rights, the UN has actively advocated for a more prominent role for NHRIs within the domestic, regional and international framework of human rights protection and promotion.

NHRC, India is a member of the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) and a Founder Member of the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF).

In addition to its international engagement, NHRC, India has done much by way of spreading human rights awareness and sensitization among governments and members of civil society on the importance of safeguarding human rights. It is a matter of immense pride for each citizen of the country therefore, to celebrate the 25th year of the Commission’s pioneering work in the field of human rights protection and promotion.

I am delighted to witness the participation of delegates from across the world at this important International Human Rights Conclave being organized by the Commission to commemorate its Silver Jubilee year. We heartily welcome delegates from other National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), global and regional networks of NHRIs, including the Global Alliance of NHRIs (GANHRI), and regional networks of Americas, Africa, Europe and the Asia-Pacific. Your presence at this Conclave reflects your deep concern for the protection and promotion of human rights within your respective countries and regions. 

I am sure you would all agree that despite formidable human rights protection frameworks – nationally, regionally, and internationally, and the significant strides that have been made since the setting up of the United Nations, there are several human rights challenges that continue to confront us as a global society. Questions continue to arise with regard to the gaps in actual implementation of the various international and domestic treaties, legislations and declarations in effectively realizing human rights standards on ground. 

Legislation alone does not guarantee human rights – for every piece of progressive legislation, there is still the struggle against the tardy implementation of these laws. These gaps in existence and implementation of legislation are further exacerbated by other important, structural causes which impede the effective realization of human rights, including poverty, corruption, terrorism, climate change, challenges of universal healthcare and education, and changing demographic realities of our times.   

It is precisely with a view to deliberating on these important concerns that the National Human Rights Commission of India has organized this International Conclave – to enable each of you to share your experiences, best practices and successes and challenges. 

I am delighted therefore, that the Commission has chosen to deliberate upon these three vital human rights concerns at this conclave -- 1) Emerging Dimensions of Human Rights with focus on Trafficking/Migrant/Forced Labour and Rights of Marginalised Sections of Society; 2) Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework of Business and Human Rights; and 3)Empowerment and Protection of Women and Children: Challenges and Road Ahead.

As you all are aware, human trafficking has become a global menace and all countries need to collaborate closely to stamp out this evil. Trafficking and all forms of forced labour result in the violation of a whole range of human rights – among them, the very right to life, liberty and security of person, the right to freedom from torture or cruelty, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to a home and family, the right to education and proper employment, and the right to health care – everything that makes for a life of dignity. 

In the expanding ambit of human rights, the concern with business and human rights has also gained salience. While economic globalization has lifted large numbers out of the clutches of poverty, there is a visible tension today between human rights and globalization processes. Rapid economic globalization and liberalization processes have also had a downside, in terms of environmental degradation-- a huge carbon footprint of corporate, making the challenge of climate change more real and urgent and rendering the already marginalized more vulnerable to the vagaries of the free market.

The contribution of women is indispensable to the creation of peaceful, just and progressive societies, given their focus on human relationships and their engagement with the demanding responsibilities, both at home and work. The principle of gender equality is enshrined in the Indian Constitution in its Preamble, Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties and Directive Principles. The Constitution not only grants equality to women, but also empowers the State to adopt measures of positive discrimination in favour of women. 

Within the framework of a democratic polity, our laws, development policies, plans and programmes have aimed at women’s advancement in different spheres. However, this does not take away from the fact that women and children, do face a disproportionate violation of their rights and are more vulnerable to violence and unequal economic and social opportunities. 

No civilized society can tolerate or accept any form of discrimination against women and children.

I have time and again stated that mere enactment of laws was not enough to prevent atrocities against women. There has to be a change of mindset - and this change has to begin at home from an early age - it is the duty of parents to ensure that the girl child is not discriminated in any manner at home. Similarly, teachers have to ensure gender equality at schools. Thus, parents and teachers have an enormous responsibility in laying strong ethical and moral foundations and building a new India which is free from gender discrimination.

 Indian culture from times immemorial has treated women with reverence. Youth of today should be made to understand the importance of our culture and tradition in respecting women.

Before concluding I would like to point out that human rights are equal for all-irrespective of caste, creed and gender.  Unfortunately, some human rights activists or groups seem to think differently.  While they raise a hue and cry whenever there is an incident involving the police or security forces, a stoic silence is maintained when innocents are killed by left wing extremists or terrorists.

I am certain that this Conclave will provide all of you an opportunity to collectively reflect on what measures we can undertake in our individual and institutional capacities to address the human rights gaps and overcome the challenges. Progress on human rights in India and on the larger global scale will depend on the steps we take to ensure justice and accountability for all citizens, protect vulnerable communities, protect the free exchange of ideas and dissent, increase accountability among public servants, private sector as well as police and other security forces.

It is heartening to note that the NHRC, India on its part has been striving to protect and promote the constitutional rights of the common citizens over the last 25 years, and has gradually expanded its scope of activity to embrace newer human right challenges and concerns with a view to promoting a culture of human rights in the country.

On this important occasion of the Commission’s Silver Jubilee, I extend my heartfelt felicitations to the Commission, delegates and dignitaries present at this International Human Rights Conclave. I hope the deliberations that will lead to important recommendations as well as a blueprint for the future on how best to ensure that the dignity and rights of all people without exception are protected and how we can foster the spirit of respect for all human life and our natural environment.

 

JAI HIND!”

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today dedicated the world’s tallest statue, the ‘Statue of Unity’, to the nation. 

The 182 metre statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was dedicated to the nation on his birth anniversary, at Kevadiya in Narmada District of Gujarat.

At the launch ceremony, the Prime Minister and other dignitaries’ poured soil and Narmada water into a Kalash to mark the dedication of the ‘Statue of Unity’ to the nation. The Prime Minister pressed a lever to commence a Virtual Abhishek of the statue.

He inaugurated the Wall of Unity. At the feet of the Statue of Unity, the Prime Minister performed a special prayer. He visited the Museum and Exhibition, and the Viewers’ Gallery. This gallery, at 153 metres height, can accommodate upto 200 visitors at one time. It offers a spectacular view of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, its reservoir, and the Satpura and Vindhya mountain ranges.

The dedication ceremony was punctuated by flypast of IAF aircraft, and performances of cultural troupes. 

Greeting the people of India on this occasion, the Prime Minister said that the entire country is celebrating Rashtriya Ekta Divas today.

He said today marks a special moment in the history of India. He said that with the Statue of Unity, India has given itself today, a towering inspiration for the future. He said the Statue will continue to remind future generations of the courage, capability and resolve of Sardar Patel. He said that the integration of India by Sardar Patel, has resulted today in India’s march towards becoming a big economic and strategic power.

The Prime Minister also recalled Sardar Patel’s vision of the administrative services as a steel frame.

He described the Statue of Unity as a symbol of the self-respect of the farmers who gave soil from their land, and iron from their farming implements for the Statue. He said the aspirations of the youth of India can be achieved only through the mantra of “Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat.” He congratulated everyone associated with the construction of this Statue. He said the Statue would generate considerable tourism opportunities for the region.

The Prime Minister mentioned that several memorials have been made to recall the contributions of freedom fighters and great leaders, in recent years. Besides the Statue of Unity, he mentioned the museum dedicated to Sardar Patel in Delhi, Mahatma Mandir and Dandi Kutir in Gandhinagar, the Panchtirth dedicated to Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, the Statue of Sri Chhotu Ram in Haryana, and the memorials of Shyamji Krishna Varma and Veer Nayak Govind Guru in Kutch. He said work is in progress for the museum dedicated to Subhash Chandra Bose in Delhi, the Shivaji statue in Mumbai, and tribal museums across the country.

The Prime Minister spoke of Sardar Patel’s vision of a strong and inclusive India, and said the Union Government is working towards making this dream a reality. He mentioned the efforts to provide a home to all, to provide electricity to all, and towards road connectivity and digital connectivity. He also mentioned the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana. He said that efforts such as GST, e-NAM, and “One-Nation, One-Grid” have also contributed to integrating the nation in various ways.

The Prime Minister spoke of our collective responsibility to maintain the unity and integrity of the nation, and to counter all divisive forces.

'Sardar Patel. Amar Rahe, Amar Rahe'

'Sardar Patel. Amar Rahe, Amar Rahe'

'Sardar Patel. Amar Rahe, Amar Rahe'

I would like to raise another slogan that will resonate from this land to the entire country every moment. I will say 'Desh ki Ekta’ (Country’s Unity) and you will say 'Zindabad! Zindabad!'

'Desh ki ekta! Zindabad! Zindabad!'

'Desh ki ekta! Zindabad! Zindabad!'

'Desh ki ekta! Zindabad! Zindabad!'

'Desh ki ekta! Zindabad! Zindabad!'

On stage, the Governor of Gujarat Shri Om Prakash Kohli ji, the popular Chief Minister of the state Shri Vijay Rupani ji, Governor of Karnataka Vajubhai Vala ji, Governor of Madhya Pradesh Smt. Anandiben Patel, my colleague in Parliament and Member of Rajya Sabha Shri Amit Bhai Shah, Deputy Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Nitin Bhai, Speaker of the Assembly Rajendra ji, dignitaries who have come here from around the world and across the country and my dear brothers and sisters.

On this historic occasion, on the banks of the holy river Narmada and close to Vindhyas and Satpura, I greet you all, my countrymen, Indians around the world and everyone who loves India.

Today the entire nation is celebrating National Unity Day in the memory of Sardar Valabh Bhai Patel. On this occasion, our youngsters are running marathon in every corner of the country for India's unity and integrity. I also greet the participants of 'Run for Unity'. Our culture has been flourishing just because of your devotion towards the country for thousands of years. Friends, in the history of every country, there are times when they make us feel complete. The day gets recorded in the history of the nation forever and is difficult to erase it. Similarly, this day too marks a significant occasion in the history of India. Even so many years after independence we failed to show proper respect to a towering personality who had dedicated his life to get India her identity and due respect.  

Today India's present moment has revived a golden personality. As Sardar Saheb is getting coroneted from the land to the skies today, India has not only written a new history but has also constructed an edifice of inspiration for the future. I am fortunate that I am getting this opportunity to dedicate this huge statue of Sardar Saheb to the country. When I had envisaged this concept as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I had never thought that someday the fortune of inaugurating it as the Prime Minister will be upon me. I am thankful for the blessings of Sardar Saheb and the crores of people of India. I am extremely grateful to the people of Gujarat for the congratulatory letter. It is rather a letter of honour for me. When a mother puts her hand on her child, the son’s strength and energy increases manifold; similarly, this letter of honour is giving me a feeling of mother’s blessing. I have also received a piece of iron that was collected during the Loha Abhiyan. I have also received the flag that was wavered during the launch of the Abhiyan in Ahmedabad. I am really grateful to you all and to the people of Gujarat. And I will leave the things here so that you can place these in the Museum and the country knows about it.

I am reminded of the olden days and I feel like speaking my heart out today. I am reminded of those days when the villages and farmers across the country were asked to give the soil and the collection of old agricultural iron tools or equipment was going on. A mass movement developed when lakhs of farmer families of these villages came forward to make their contributions in the building of this statue. A robust base was constructed with crores of metric tonnes of iron taken out of the tools provided by them.

Friends,

I also remember that when this idea was placed, there were doubts and apprehensions and I wish to reveal something today. When this idea came up in my mind, I was looking for a massive hillock from where Sardar Saheb's statue could be carved out. After a lot of assessment, it came out that it was not possible to get such a massive rock or even if such a rock was available, the carved-out statue wouldn't have been strong enough. So I had to change my mind and whatever you are witnessing today was born out of that. I always kept thinking about it, took advice and suggestions from the people and today I am glad that all the people associated with this important project have upheld the faith and capability of this country.

Brothers and sisters,

This is the tallest statue of the world. It will keep reminding our future generations of that personality's courage, abilities and resolutions; about the one who thwarted the conspiracy of disintegrating Mother India into pieces; about the great personality who ended such desires forever, something that the world was expecting about the future of India. I salute such a Man of Steel Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.

Friends,

Sardar Saheb's abilities were put to work at a time when mother India was divided into more than 550 princely states. There was pessimism regarding India's future around the world. Pessimistic people existed even at that time. The pessimists felt that India would disintegrate due to its diversity. However, even in that period of pessimism, people could see a ray of hope and that ray of hope was Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. Sardar Patel was a blend of Kautilya's diplomacy and Shivaji Maharaj's bravery. He had said on 5th July, 1947 addressing the princely states - 'our internal conflicts and enmity were the main reasons for our defeat against the foreign invaders. Now we must not repeat the same mistakes or to be someone's slave again.' 

I believe that Sardar Saheb's words are still valid today.

On hearing Sardar Saheb's words and understanding the power of unity, the princely states merged their states. Soon India became one. On the call of Sardar Saheb, several princely states had made sacrifices. We must not as well forget the sacrifices made by the princely states. And it is my dream to create a virtual museum linked to this place for remembering the steps taken by more than 550 princely states towards integration of the nation. Nowadays, if a democratically elected leader, even a Tehsildar is asked to step down one year before his tenure gets over, it will create havoc! But those kings had handed over the possessions belonging to their forefathers to the country. We can never forget this and we must always remember that.

Friends,

The thing that was considered as a weakness of India by the world, Sardar Patel converted that weakness into strength and showed the way to the nation. Walking on the same path, the world that was once apprehensive about India is being subjected to India’s own terms and conditions today. India is moving towards emerging as world's largest economic and strategic power. This was possible only because of the contribution of the extraordinary personality i.e. Sardar Saheb who was born in an ordinary farmer family. He had played a major role. Despite the pressure and difference of opinions, Sardar Saheb had showed how governance could be established in the administration. Today we can freely travel from Kutch to Kohima and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari; this was made possible only by Sardar Saheb and his resolution. Just imagine for a moment, if Sardar Saheb had not done that work or had not taken those resolutions, then in order to see the Lions of Gir or the Charminar of Hyderabad or for Somnath Puja the devotees of Shiva and the other people would have to get a Visa. Had Sardar Saheb's resolution not been there, one could not even imagine a direct train from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and one would have to face many obstacles in setting up an administrative framework like Civil Services.

Brothers and sisters,

On 21 April 1947, while addressing the probationers of All India Administrative Services, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had said something really important. Even the current IAS, IPS and IFS and everyone else must remember it. He had said - the hitherto Indian Civil Services didn't have any trace of 'Indian' or of 'civil' and not even of 'service'. He had appealed to the youth to change that situation. He had asked the youth that they ought to increase the pride of Indian Administrative Service with transparency and honesty. They need to establish it for rebuilding India. It was for Sardar's inspiration that India's Administrative Service was compared to steel frame.

Brothers and sisters,

Sardar Patel was made the Home Minister at the most difficult time for the country. He was responsible for rebuilding the country's systems and was also entrusted with the responsibility of taking care of the country's law and order system. He had pulled the country out of that difficult situation and also created a base for our modern police force.

Friends,

Sardar Saheb was dedicated every moment to connect the masses of the country with democracy. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had also played a major role in getting women their rights in making active contribution to Indian politics. Sardar Saheb had raised his voice against the system wherein mothers and sisters could not even participate in elections of Panchayats or of civic institutions in cities. This discrimination was removed several decades prior to independence on his initiative. It was because of Sardar Saheb that today the fundamental rights are an integral part of our democracy.

Friends,

This statue is an auspicious manifestation of Sardar Patel's love, talent, foresight and spirituality. This statue is not only a token of respect for his strength and dedication, but is also an expression of New India's new self-confidence. This statue is also a reminder to those who questioned the existence of India that India had always been eternal; India is eternal and India will always be eternal.

It is a symbol of self-respect for all those farmers who donated the soil of their fields and also the iron from their tool and equipment, from which the foundation of this statue was built and the soul of this statue was from their expressions of producing food grains by fighting against all odds. This statue is also the contribution of those tribal brothers and sisters who had made their contribution since the freedom movement up to the journey of development. These great heights are to remind the country's youth that the India of the future is like your towering dreams and aspirations. It is massive. There is just one and only mantra of fulfilling these aspirations - 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat', 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat', 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'.

Friends,

Statue of Unity is also a symbol of our engineering and technical competence. In the last three and a half years, on an average 2500 workers have worked daily on mission mode. Some of them will be honoured in a short while from now.   More than 90 year old Shri Ram Sutar ji is one such eminent sculptor, under whose leadership this prestigious statue was completed by a group of marvelous sculptors. It is because of the feeling of working on a mission, devotion to national unity and towards India that this work could be accomplished in such a short span of time. The foundation of the Sardar Sarovar dam was laid such a long time back, but that was inaugurated decades later. However, this project has been completed right before our eyes, in such a short period of time. I congratulate everyone, every worker, every craftsman, every architect and every engineer associated with this commendable job. All the names associated with it directly and indirectly have also become an important part of history of the statue of Sardar.

Friends,

Today this journey has reached a milestone. The journey had begun 8 years ago on this very day. I had placed this idea in front of everyone in Ahmedabad on 31 October 2010. At that time, just like crores of Indians, there was just one thought in my mind i.e. the great personality who had done such a great work to unite the nation must receive the honour that he rightly deserved. I also desired that the honour must be received by the drops of sweat of that farmer and worker for whom Sardar Patel had fought all his life.

Friends,

Sardar Patel not only led the Satyagraha movement or raised voice against the exploitation of the farmers from Kheda to Bardoli, but also provided solutions to it. Today's cooperative movement that has become a strong base for the economy of many villages in the country is the result of the far-sightedness of Sardar Saheb.

Friends,

This Memorial of Sardar Patel is not only a symbol of respect that crores of Indians have towards him and the capability of the Indians but will also prove to be an important place of economy and employment generation in the country. It will provide employment to thousands of tribal brothers and sisters every year.  Whatever the nature has gifted you in this region of Satpura and Vindhyas will benefit you in a modern way. The entire world will now be acquainted with the forests and tribal culture about which the country had hitherto only read in poems. The tourists coming to see the statue of Sardar Saheb will now be able to witness the Sardar Sarovar dam as well as the mountains of Vindhyas and Satpuras. I would once again like to compliment the Gujarat government for developing the nearby areas of the statue as tourist spots. The 'valley of flowers' that has been developed will enhance the beauty of this statue. And I would like one 'Ekta nursery' to also come up here from where people can take one plant of unity to their homes, sow the seed of unity tree and remind themselves of the country's unity every moment. Also, tourism is going to change the lives of the people living here.

Friends,

The traditional knowledge of this region has always been rich. When tourism develops due to the Statue of Unity, this traditional knowledge too will disseminate and this place will get a new identity. I have been associated with this region for a long time; hence I am aware of a lot of things. The tourists will love the delicacies and dishes of this region made of rice like una manda, tehla manda, thokala manda. Probably the people sitting here feel like having the dishes. Similarly, the people associated with Ayurveda must be aware of the herbal plant Khati bhindi that grow here in abundance. This plant is endowed with a lot of medicinal properties and people around the world will come to know about it. And therefore, I am confident that this place will be the center of research to improve agriculture here and to improve the lives of the tribals.

Friends,

During the last four years, the government has initiated a massive campaign for commemorating the contributions made by the heroes of the nation. Even when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I was always interested in such things! This is our ancient culture and values that we are carrying along with us. Apart from this skyscraper statue of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, we have also created a modern museum in Delhi in his memory. We have set up other such memorials of several great men in the last four years such as Mahatma Mandir at Gandhinagar, Dandi kutir, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's Panchteerth, farmer leader Sir Chotu Ram's tallest statue in Haryana, the memorial of the freedom fighter from Mandavi, Kutch and the son of Gujarat Shyamji Krishna Verma or the hero of tribal brothers and sisters Vir Nayak Govind Guru.

Besides, we are also trying to re-live the history by setting up museum in the memory of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose or by building a grand statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Mumbai or a museum in the memory of our tribal heroes during the freedom movement or to celebrate constitution day on 26 November to commemorate the contribution made by Baba Saheb or by announcing a National Award in Netaji's name. All these things have been started by our government. However friends, I am astonished that some people of our country try to see this initiative through the lens of politics.

I don't know why we are criticized even for praising the great personalities like Sardar Patel and the sons of our country. We are made to feel that as if we have committed a grave crime. I want to ask you - Is it a crime to commemorate the great personalities born in our country?'

Friends, it is our attempt to ensure that every Citizen of India carries forward the vision of Sardar Patel with his hard work and capabilities.

Brothers and sisters,

Sardar Patel had mentioned about the type of villages that he had dreamt of for independent India in his speech 3-4 months before independence during the establishment of the Vitthalbhai Patel College. During the construction of that college, he had said - we are constructing houses in our villages in an unplanned way, the roads too are being constructed mindlessly and garbage accumulates in front of the houses. At that time he had called upon the villages to be Open Defecation Free and to be free from garbage. I am glad that today the country is moving forward towards accomplishing the dream of Sardar Saheb. Today the percentage of village cleanliness in the country has reached 95% due to public participation.

Brothers and sisters,

Sardar Patel had always desired that India be empowered, gentle, sensitive, alert and inclusive. All our efforts are in the direction of realizing his dreams. We are working on the Bhagiratha scheme to give a pacca house to every homeless in the country. We provided electricity to 18000 villages where electricity had not reached even after several years of independence. Our government is engaged day in and day out to provide power connections to every household in the country under the Saubhagya Yojana. Today the work of connecting every village of the country with roads, Optical Fibre Network, digital connectivity is going on at a rapid pace. The work of delivering gas connections and helping to build toilets in every household is also going on along with it.

The government has started the world's largest health scheme. When I tell the people around the world about it, they are amazed! The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana or the Ayushman Bharat Yojana caters to a population more than the collective population of America, Mexico and Canada. Some people call it Modicare. This scheme will help in building a healthy India. 'Sabka sath sabka vikas' is our mantra on our mission to fulfil our mission of making inclusive and an empowered India.

Brothers and sisters,

Sardar Saheb had done political unification of the nation by merging the princely states. Similarly, our government has done economic integration of the country with GST. It has fulfilled the dream of one nation one tax. We are relentlessly extending the determination of Sardar Saheb. It includes the e-NAM scheme of integrating all the big agricultural Mandis of the country or the work on one nation one grid, or Bharatmala project, setu bharatam project or the bharatnet etc. With these projects, our government is striving to fulfil the dreams of Sardar Saheb -  'Ek Bharat Sreshtha Bharat'.

Friends,

Today we have the strength of the youngsters who are concerned about the country. This is the only way for development and the countrymen need to move ahead with it. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had entrusted all the Indians with the responsibility of maintaining the country's unity, integrity and sovereignty. It is our responsibility to strongly retaliate against any attempt to divide the country. Therefore, we need to be always alert in every possible way and must remain United as a society. We must take a vow that we will not keep any stone unturned in bequeathing to the future generations the values imparted to us by Sardar.

Friends,

Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel used to tell everyone, and I am quoting his statement - every Indian must forget his caste or class and must only remember only one thing that he is an Indian; and he has as much duties for his country as he has the rights over it. May Sardar Saheb's magnificent ideas keep inspiring us like this lofty statue! This statue of unity is a wonder for the entire world and therefore today the entire world's attention has been drawn towards the banks of mother Narmada. I would like to congratulate every person associated with it and everyone who has been striving to fulfil this dream. My best wishes to every tribal brother and sister settled in the valleys of Narmada and Tapti for a better future.

The entire nation is associated with this event. People from all over the world are associated with this event. And with a great excitement and zeal this pilgrimage of unity has been prepared to carry the mantra of unity forward. We are receiving the inspiration of unity from this centre of inspiration. We must stride ahead with this feeling and also take others along with us and must carry forward the dream of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'.

Say along with me -

Sardar Patel - Jai ho!

Sardar Patel - Jai ho!

Hail the Unity of the Nation!

Hail the Unity of the Nation!

Hail the Unity of the Nation!

Hail the Unity of the Nation!

Hail the Unity of the Nation!

Thanks a lot!

                His Excellency, Prime Minister of Italy, Prof. Giuseppe Conte, my cabinet colleague Dr.Harshvardhan, eminent technocrats from Italy and India attending this Tech Summit, ladies and gentlemen!

Greetings! Namaskar!

Ciao!Comestai!*

I extend my heartfelt greetings especially to our guests who have come all the way from Italy to attend this summit. 

Benvenuto* in India!

Friends,

This is the 24th Tech Summit. It is a matter of great pride for us to have Italy's participation in this summit as Partner Country, along with the dignified presence of Prime Minister Prof Conte.  

Prior to this event, we had a detailed conversation during my dogmatically meeting with Prime Minister Prof Conte.I have personally experienced his enthusiasm and commitment towards relations with India.

This year is also monumental for us as it is the 70th year of Diplomatic Relations between India and Italy. This year, we also achieved a milestone by completing our 40 years of cooperation in the field of Science and Technology. Hence, Prime Minister Prof Conte’s visit to India on this opportune occasion holds an exceptional significance.

Friends,

We are in the era when technology is all pervasive and it is unimaginable to live without it. Today almost every person's life is connected to technology in some form or the other. In the last few years, there has been a rapid change in the field of technology. Its speed is so meteoric, that by the time the benefits of a technology touches the last end of the society, a new advanced technology emerges. This situation has undoubtedly posed challenges in front of all the countries to keep pace with changing technology;however, it has also opened several doors to new opportunities.

India has made technology a medium of social justice, empowerment, inclusion, competent governance and transparency. The effective LAST-MILE DELIVERY of government services is being consolidated through technology. Especially a comprehensive infrastructure of Digital Technology is being developed so that the general public can easily reap the benefits of these facilities. We consider technology as an important medium of ease of living.

Friends,

Today one of the world's largest Direct Benefit Scheme is being implemented in India. Citizens are now receiving Government benefits directly to the beneficiaries' bank accounts. Many facilities are now available online whether be it Birth Certificate or old age pension. More than 300 centres and state government services have been brought on a platform through the robust Umang App.

Digital payments are now seen achieving a meteoric growth at a speed of about two and a half million transactions per month. More than three lakhs Common Service Centres across the country are providing online services across several villages.

In the last 4 years, the cost of one GB data in India has decreased by more than 90 percent. This cheap availability of data in India has proved to be an effective medium for delivering digital technology to every person in the country. 

Friends,

India is now moving forward to take the IT Software Power's identity to the next orbit. We are simulating India into leapfrogging from Scientific Temper to Technological Temperament. 

Through the Atal Innovation Mission, a network of youth is being created across the country, which is expected to become the strongest pillar of the fourth industrial revolution. Technological Temperament is being developed for future technology and innovation in schools by establishingAtal Tinkering Labs throughout the country. 

The result of all of the government's efforts is that we have come up 21 places in the Global Innovation Index ranking by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Apart from this, today India is proud to have become world’s second largest start-up ecosystem.

There is also emphasis on quality in the innovations that are taking place in India. India's Space Program is a great example of this, and Italy has also realized its success.

Today India, like Italy and several other nations of the world, has succeeded in sending the satellites in many countries of the world at a very low cost to space. They are proving useful in extending the benefits of satellite technology to every doorstep.

Friends

Today, when the world is discussing Industry 4.0, strengthening cooperation between the ancient civilizations of India and Italy for science and technology will not only create new opportunities, but will also help in handling the challenges effectively.

Friends,

Today, India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. India's vast Domestic Market, Young Population and the ecosystem of Technology and Innovation is certainly going to be a strong driver of growth in the world.

Italy has a rich heritage in science and technology and has a reckoning in the world in the manufacturing sector for class and best quality. Therefore, India and Italy together can strengthen their cooperation in High Quality Research and foster technological solutions to addressand solve global challenges.

This is the reason that it is now of utmost priority for both the countries to strengthen cooperation in science and technology leading towards human welfare, clean environment, improving the lives of people. I am happy that the scientific community and business leaders of both countries are collaborating in the areas of cutting edge Research and Innovation. We have extensive cooperation in areas such as Renewable Energy, Environmental Science, Neuroscience, and IT to preserve our rich cultural heritage. 

Friends,

Apart from strengthening this path of cooperation, our goal is also to ensure that the results of research and development are not confined to laboratories, but their benefits also reach the society and the general public. That's why I always say ""science is universal, technology has to be local"". 

In India, we have started the Science and Heritage Research Initiative, i.e. SHRI for the protection of our historical heritage. Its aim is to find solutions related to technology for the preservation and restoration of historical monuments. Technology, Tourism and History –SHRI is an amalgamationof these three.

I believe that by promoting science, technology and innovation, new speed of development will be ensured. They will also have an important role in the development of our bilateral relations. This is the key agenda of this Tech Summit.

I am confident that in the last two days Summit will help in enhancing the technology transfer, Joint Ventures and Market Access between the two countries. It will surely play a pivotal role in the discussions on the future of mutual cooperation between our nations. 

Friends,

Today, I am very happy to announce the introduction of the next phase of Indo-Italian bilateral Industrial Research and Development Cooperation Program. This will enable our industry and research institute to develop new products and prototypes without any interruption. It is the need of the hour to change ""Know how"" to ""Show how"".

In order to strengthen economic relations between the two countries, we have also agreed to constitute a CEO Forum under the guidance of the Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation. Along with this, there has been consensus on creating a Fast Track Mechanism to overcome the bottlenecks in ease of doing business by enhancing two-way investments between the two countries, 

I am also happy that India and Italy have agreed to increase cooperation in the field of LAD i.e. Life Style Accessories Design. There will also be special focus on leather sector and Transportation & Automobile Design (TAD).

Along with this advancement, I feel happy to state that both countries will further establish Indo-Italian Centres of Excellence based on skills in select areas like Conservation of Cultural Heritage, Renewable Energy, Life Sciences and Geo-Hazards. Not only will these high-class universities, research institutes and industry work in synergy, but they will also aim to provide technical solutions to the challenges being faced by us in these sectors. 

Friends,

I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the organizers for the success of this Tech Summit. I am indeed grateful to the Italian government who consented to join us as a partner country. I am very grateful to all the participants of Tech Summit. The contribution and presence of all of you have been important for the success of this Summit.

Once again, I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Prof Conte for his august presence during this program. Not only that, he has also given a valuable gift to us by offering his personal mentoring, guidance and commitment to this newly-formed Indo-Italian Partnership.

Grazie mille!*

Thanks a lot !!!

India-Japan Cooperation in Railways

Mumbai Ahmedabad High Speed Rail


To revolutionize the connectivity in India and introduce the High Speed Rail, India and Japan are cooperating to construct the Mumbai Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR). Given the significance of the project, it is being monitored at the apex-level in the form of Joint Committee Meeting (JCM) presently co-chaired by Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman NITI Aayog, from the Indian side and Dr. Hiroto Izumi, Special Adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on the Japanese side.


The 8th JCM on MAHSR project held in Delhi on 17 September 2018 confirmed the steady progress of the project and it was also agreed that both sides will continue to advance mutual efforts to facilitate the smooth achievement of the project. Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Mr. Keiichi Ishii and Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport & Tourism Mr. Masatoshi Akimoto visited India respectively in December 2017 and in May 2018 from the perspective of MAHSR Project, including station area development such as the approach roads, station plaza and multimodal integration plan.


During the summit meeting, Exchange of Notes and Loan Agreement for the second tranche of Japanese ODA Loan for MAHSR Project were signed, following completion of JICA’s Appraisal Mission in September 2018 and signing of the Loan Agreement for the first tranche of Japanese ODA Loan between JICA and DEA on 28 September, 2018.


Current status: National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) is the implementing agency of the project. Final Location Survey of the project has already been completed. Based on final alignment, all underground & overhead utilities have been identified. The process of land acquisition has begun between Mumbai & Ahmedabad with target of completion by December 2018. Joint Measurement Survey has been completed for 328 km out of 487km. The entire project, including the High-Speed Rail training institute, has been divided into 26 contract packages, out of which 4 packages are already awarded. Multimodal Transport Integration Plan, an important component for creating a smart and sustainable integrated transport network, is ongoing for all the 12 stations. Memorandum for general consultancy has been signed by JICA with the Ministry of Railways, NHSRCL and JV of Japanese consultants and marks an important development in the project timeline.


Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC)


Western DFC, a corridor of 1,522 km from Jawaharlal Nehru Port Terminal (JNPT) to Dadri visualized for reducing the congestion in the Mumbai-Delhi route, being executed through JICA funding.


Current Status: DFC has achieved overall 48% physical progress of civil packages and track laying of 802Km has been completed. Approx. 99% land acquisition has been made and tenders have been awarded worth Rs. 33,130 Cr (JPY 523 billion). Trial run of an Indian Railways Freight train was conducted successfully on 15 August 2018 on the 190km long Ateli-Phulera section of the DFC falling on the Jaipur Division of North Western Railway between the National Capital Region (NCR) and Mumbai and thus marked an important milestone in this game-changer project.


Future cooperation


(i) Make in India: In order to realize the Make in India objectives in MAHSR project, a Task Force comprising DIPP, Embassy of Japan, NHSRCL, MLIT and METI was constituted and recommendations have been agreed for four sub-groups i.e. Civil works, Track Works, Electrical Works (including Signal & Telecom) and Rolling Stock. Six train sets will be done under Make in India out of a total 24 train sets.


(ii) Training: A new High-Speed Rail Training Institute is being built at the National Academy of Indian Railways campus in Vadodara utilizing Japanese ODA Loan through JICA. Two contracts out of total Three have been awarded. Last tender of training institute was invited in July 2018 and is expected to be finalized by December 2018. The construction of Training Institute has started and it is planned to open by December 2020. In order to have sufficient human resources for operation of the important High Speed Rail Project, training of 480 Ministry of Railways and 120 NHSRCL officials for 2018&2019 was agreed to during the 7th JCM. Already, 287 young officers of Indian Railways have undergone training in Japan in 2017-18 about High-Speed Rail technology.

                Prime Minister of India H.E. Shri Narendra Modi visited Japan on October 28-29, 2018 for the India-Japan Annual Summit with Prime Minister of Japan H.E. Mr. Shinzo Abe. During the visit, recognizing the unparalleled potential for development of relations between the two countries, Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Abe reviewed the significant milestones achieved over the last four years and outlined the following shared vision for the future of India-Japan relations: 

 


	The India-Japan Special Strategic and Global Partnership, firmly rooted in history and based on common values is the mainspring for advancing the two countries’ shared strategic objectives and achieving peace, prosperity and progress to realize a better future for the people of the two countries. As the two Prime Ministers resonantly elucidated in the series of SAMVAD dialogues, the universal values of freedom, humanism, democracy, tolerance and non-violence, which have been shared between India and Japan throughout a long history of academic, spiritual and scholarly exchanges, not only constitute the basis for the India-Japan bilateral relationship but also underscore the principles for the two countries to work together for the benefit of the Indo-Pacific region and the world at large.


 


	The two leaders shared their view that in order to achieve this shared vision, India and Japan must endeavour to work together for a rules-based and inclusive world order that fosters trust and confidence by enhancing communication and connectivity to ensure rule of law, unimpeded trade and flow of people, technology and ideas for shared prosperity.


 


	Prime Minister Modi recognised that the India-Japan relationship has been transformed into a partnership with great substance and purpose and is a corner stone of India’s Act East Policy. Prime Minster Abe underscored the basic importance of India-Japan relationship for the regional order and is determined to advancing the ""new era in India-Japan relations” so as to further cooperate for peace, stability and prosperity of Indo-Pacific. Based on their shared vision, the two Prime Ministers reiterated their unwavering commitment to working together towards a free and open Indo-Pacific. The two leaders also affirmed that ASEAN unity and centrality are at the heart of the Indo-Pacific concept, which is inclusive and open to all. They shared willingness to expand concrete cooperation with the U.S. and other partners. The two leaders’ vision for the Indo-Pacific is based on a rules-based order that respects sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, ensures freedom of navigation and overflight as well as unimpeded lawful commerce, and seeks peaceful resolution of disputes with full respect for legal and diplomatic processes in accordance with the universally recognised principles of international law, including those reflected in the UNCLOS, without resorting to threat or use of force. 



Partnership for Prosperity

 


	The two Prime Ministers reviewed with satisfaction the cooperation on development of connectivity via quality infrastructure, and other projects including capacity building for shared prosperity, carried out bilaterally and with other partners, in an open, transparent and non-exclusive manner and based on international standards, responsible debt financing practices, and in alignment with local economic and development strategies and priorities. This synergy is embodied in collaborative projects between India and Japan in the Indo-Pacific region, including in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bangladesh as well as in Africa. In this regard, the two Prime Ministers welcomed the discussions for establishing the ""Platform for Japan-India Business Cooperation in Asia-Africa Region” to further enhance the exchanges between Japanese and Indian businesses toward developing industrial corridors and industrial network in the region.


 


	The two Prime Ministers welcomed the progress made for the development of India’s North Eastern Region through the India-Japan Act East Forum by identifying and implementing projects for enhancing connectivity, sustainable forest and ecological management, disaster risk reduction and people-to-people exchanges. They also highlighted the importance of development of smart islands in India.


 


	Prime Minister Modi expressed his appreciation for the significant contribution of Japan’s ODA to the socio-economic development of India. Prime Minister Abe expressed Japan’s intention to continue to support India’s efforts for social and industrial development, including through key quality infrastructure projects and capacity building. The two leaders reviewed with satisfaction the progress made, including the signing of the Exchange of Notes for yen loan, on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail project, which is an important symbol of India-Japan collaboration marked by the 75th anniversary of India’s independence. They also welcomed the continued cooperation on Metro Projects which support smarter development of Indian cities. India further appreciated Japan’s role in promoting connectivity through quality infrastructure projects such as the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor and the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor.


 


	The two Prime Ministers remain committed to synergising India’s demographic dividend and Japan’s capital and technology to realise the true potential of the India-Japan economic partnership for a prosperous future. In this regard, India welcomed Japan’s strong support for key transformational initiatives such as ""Make in India”, ""Skill India” and ""Clean India Mission”, through sharing of resources and advanced technologies, and active mobilisation of Japanese public and private sector investments. Recognising the close cooperation in Intellectual Property Rights between the Intellectual Property Offices of the two countries, the two leaders concurred to start a bilateral Patent Prosecution Highway programme on a pilot basis in certain identified fields of inventions in the first quarter of FY 2019. They welcomed the expansion of Japan’s Foreign Direct Investment in India under the ""India-Japan Investment Promotion Partnership”, the progress made in Japan Industrial Townships (JIT) and other initiatives included in the Japan-India Roadmap for Investment Promotion. With a view to enhancing financial and economic cooperation, Governments of Japan and India welcomed the agreement to conclude a Bilateral Swap Arrangement (BSA) of USD 75 billion. With regard to External Commercial Borrowing (ECB), no mandatory hedging will be required for infrastructure ECB of more than 5 years minimum average maturity.


 


	The two leaders shared the intention to further augment cooperation in skill development by expanding the scope and number of Japan-India Institutes for Manufacturing (JIMs) as well as the Japanese Endowed Courses (JEC) in various Indian states. Cooperation in human resource development and exchanges, including through utilising frameworks such as Japan’s ""Innovative Asia” initiative, and the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) will be further promoted, aligning with emerging demands of industry.


 


	Both leaders welcomed the launching of a comprehensive India-Japan Digital Partnership with the vision to develop IoT and AI solutions for societal benefits and explore joint collaboration in emerging technologies by utilizing the ""Japan-India Start-Up Hub” in Bengaluru and NASSCOM’s IT corridor project in Hiroshima Prefecture, attracting highly skilled talent and establishing collaboration between their respective industries and institutions. This will bring about a convergence between India’s flagship programmes such as ""Digital India”, ""Start-Up India” and ""Smart City” with Japan’s ""Society 5.0” to promote societal benefits. Both sides will encourage and support the creation of funds to invest in start-ups in India with participation by Japanese stakeholders.


 


	As they strive to provide affordable healthcare to their people, including addressing the challenges such as aging population, both leaders welcome the linking of Japan’s Asia Health and Well being Initiative (AHWIN) with India’s healthcare initiatives such as Ayushman Bharat, by introducing affordable technology, skill development and best practices in healthcare through reciprocal and mutually beneficial approaches. They will also exchange more information and work towards cooperation in the domain of traditional medicine, including Ayurveda, which, along with Yoga, has a rich history of providing holistic alternative healthcare.


 


	Both leaders also welcomed the progress made by the two sides in taking forward the bilateral cooperation in agriculture, food processing and forestry among various public and private stakeholders which would improve productivity of agriculture and decrease harvest and post-harvest losses.


 


	The two leaders reaffirmed that people-to-people exchanges are at the core of the India-Japan partnership and noted with satisfaction the growing cultural, educational, parliamentary, academic and Track 1.5 engagements, including the ""Indo-Pacific Forum”. They also regarded tourism as an area with huge untapped potential and shared views to make efforts to enhance two-way flows, including through further easing of the visa requirements and tourism promotions. Both leaders shared the view to further promote India-Japan partnerships in higher education and empowerment of women, and facilitate academic, youth and sports exchanges. The collaborative launch of the Japanese Language Teachers’ Training Centre in India will build new bridges between the two peoples. The two leaders underscored the importance of steady expansion of contacts between Indian states and Japanese prefectures.



Partnership for Peace

 


	The two Prime Ministers viewed with great satisfaction the enormous progress made in the last decade in fostering joint efforts towards shared security since the signing of the India-Japan Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation in 2008. They reaffirmed their desire to further deepen bilateral security and defence cooperation and institute Foreign and Defence Ministerial Dialogue (2+2), in addition to existing mechanisms, including the Annual Defence Ministerial Dialogue, Defence Policy Dialogue, the National Security Advisers’ Dialogue, Staff-level Dialogue of each service. The two leaders welcomed the joint exercise between each of the three services and the commencement of negotiations on the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), which will enhance the strategic depth of bilateral security and defence cooperation.


 


	Both leaders acknowledged the significant progress in maritime security cooperation, as seen in the high frequency of bilateral naval exercises and deepening level of the Malabar exercises, as well as long standing dialogues and training between the Coast Guards.

After India’s full accession to three international export control regimes, the two leaders pledged to continue working together for India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, with the aim of strengthening the global non-proliferation efforts.


 


	The two Prime Ministers condemned in the strongest terms the growing threat of terrorism and its universal reach. They called upon all countries to work towards rooting out terrorist safe havens and infrastructure, disrupting terrorist networks and financing channels, and halting cross-border movement of terrorists. They underlined the need for all countries to ensure that their territory is not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries in any manner. They emphasised the need for stronger international partnership in countering terrorism and violent extremism, including through increased sharing of information and intelligence. They called upon Pakistan to bring to justice the perpetrators of terrorist attacks, including those of November 2008 in Mumbai and January 2016 in Pathankot. They looked forward to strengthening cooperation against terrorist threats from groups including Al-Qaida, ISIS, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lakshar-e-Tayyiba, and their affiliates.

Prime Minister and my close friend, Mr. Abe, 

Distinguished delegates, 

Friends,
Namaste,
Konichiwa,

The affectionate way in which Abe San has welcomed me here in Tokyo, and earlier in Yamanashi and in his home, has made this visit of mine to Japan even more unforgettable. Japan is the best amalgamation of best values of eastern and western cultures. This is the same great country which has taught us that the path of human development is not the one of conflict between the ancient and the new ways but it is about their co-existence and creation. Acceptance of new and respect for the old – this is the key contribution of Japan to the world civilization. And it is also one of the very close similarities of India and Japan.

Excellencies, 

India and Japan relations have the depths and expanse of Indian and Pacific oceans. These relations are based on shared commitment to democratic values ​​and freedoms and the Rule of Law. Yesterday and todayI had a very useful conversation with Abe San on great vision for the future development of our relations. Today, we have signed this shared vision. Tomorrow it will provide a new light to our future. We are in complete agreement that we will give unhindered pace to our cooperation in digital partnership to cyber space, from health to defense and security and from sea to space. I have been told that today Japan's investors have announced a fresh investment of $ 2.5 billion in India. This will provide employment to about 30 thousand people in India. Agreement on Bilateral Currency Swap Arrangement during this visit clearly reflects our mutual trust and our ever increasing closeness in economic partnership.

Friends, 

21st century is the century of Asia, but there are questions regarding its form and factor. Who will benefit, what needs to be done, there are many such questions. However one thing is very clear that without the cooperation between India and Japan 21st century cannot be a century of Asia. 


Abe San and I have agreed to the 2 + 2 Dialogue between our Foreign and Defense Ministers. Its purpose is to promote peace and stability in the world. Japan's entry into the International Solar Alliance will be another shining example of such cooperation in the interest of the world. 


Friends, 

Next year Japan will host the G-20 Summit in Osaka. The Rugby World Cup will also be held in Japan next year. This tournament will be held in Asia for the first time. And after that 2020 Olympics) will be held in Tokyo. For all these important global events, on my behalf, and on behalf of whole India, our warmest wishes are with you. 


Friends,

Progress in India-Japan relations is limitless like Japan's Kaizen philosophy. Together with Prime Minister Abe, I am committed to strengthen these relations further. Once again I thank Abe San, the Government of Japan and all of you and convey my heartfelt wishes. 

 

Domo Arigato Gozaimasu.

Present here in large numbers business leaders and CEOs from Japan and India,
Senior officials of Keidanren, Jetro, NIKKI, CII, and NASCOM,

Speaking with the business community here after coming to Japan always gives me great pleasure. I still remember that for the last ten years I have been having detailed conversations with the entrepreneurs here. I understood your vision and learned many new things from you. In the last decade your intimacy towards India has been growing steadily over time.

Efforts of government of India at every level are such so as to change the business environment in the country in such a way that at every step you have a feeling of ease of doing business and ease of living.

Friends,

A few years ago I talked about making a mini Japan in India. It is a great pleasure for me that today you are working in India at a much larger level.

For many decades, there were about 1150 Japanese companies in India, however between the years 2014 to 2017, more than 200 new companies of Japan have started operating in India. These numbers are increasing day by day. You all deserve congratulations for this.

Today Japanese companies in India are working in areas from car manufacturing to communications and from infrastructure to services. This pleasant journey between India and Japan becomes even more pleasurable and result-oriented, for this also my congratulations to all of you.

Friends,

The spirit of co-existence of India and Japan is based on trust and our shared heritage, it is based on our intimacy. The foundation of close relationships between the two countries is this spirit and ritual.

This is the reason that during my first visit as a Prime Minister in 2014, we had decided that both countries will take this relationship to a new height by upgrading it to the level of Special Strategic and Global Partnership. Since then, the Hon'ble Prime Minister of Japan, Abe and I have been continuously meeting each-other. Prime Minister Mr. Abe and we together have overcome many business related obstacles between the two countries.

Friends,

Over last few years Japanese government has assisted in many of our ambitious infrastructure projects. Our Western Dedicated Freight Corridor is now about to be completed. After one year it will reach the state of being fully operational. Connected with it our project of Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor is going on well with the cooperation of Japanese government and Japanese companies.

During last visit of Hon'ble Abe San to India, we decided to work together on High Speed Rail Project. India's first High Speed Rail project has started between Mumbai-Ahmedabad and work on this project is going on at a great pace.

Friends,

It has been almost four and half years since the formation of my government in India. During this period, issue related to business which have been on top of my priority list is - Ease of Doing Business. Its result is now in front of the world. In 2014, when I took over the reins of the government, India's position in World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking was 142th. Now we are on hundredth rank and are still working on a very extensive scale to improve the rankings. We are taking one step after the other at the level of the federal government, at the level of State Government and at local government level. This will produce even better results in the coming years.

Such a big improvement has been made possible with quick and decisive actions, and changing archaic laws.

Here I would like to tell you another important thing. Government of India has started ranking of its 36 States and Union Territories to further promote Ease of Doing business.

There has been a major benefit because of this, that now there is healthy competition between the states, which has started to show very pleasant results.

Friends,

Capital investment is the need of our country. That is the reason we are taking sincere steps in the area of Ease of Doing Business. When capital investment will be created, new employment opportunities will be created for the unemployed, there will be improvement in the country's infrastructure, and value addition in agriculture, mineral, sea resources and all other natural resources of the country.

Our efforts to provide our citizens with the ease of living is an extension of the Ease of Doing Business.

Therefore, we have worked in the area of Ease of Doing Business using a super campaign. We achieved a lot of other things due to these super efforts:

• We have scaled up 21 places in the Global Innovation Index rankings of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

• In World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, we have climbed 31 places in 2 years.

• India is firmly named in 10 FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD.

• In the last few years we have done quite a lot of reforms in the field of FDI. Today, we have become the most open economy in terms of FDI. More than 90 percent of permissions are now given on Automatic Route.

• The result is that our FDI has increased from $ 36 billion in the last 3 years to $ 60 billion.

• Today we are the fastest growing major economy of the world.

• Now we are an economy of $ 2.59 trillion. We are world’s sixth largest economy and soon to be the fifth largest economy.

At the domestic level, the commitment with which we have made reforms has resulted in changes in Indian economy such as:

• Its shifting from being an informal Economy to a formal economy.

• Transactions are now conducted online rather than on paper, which has led to increased stability and transparency.

• Transportation has become easy due to GST being implemented across the country and the Logistics sector has become stronger.

• Over the time we have been reducing corporate tax. There is a special focus so that MSME i.e. small industries derive maximum benefit out of it.

Demand of business class for Stability and Transparency in policies has now become the identity of the Government of India.

Friends,

During my first visit to Japan as the Prime Minister, I talked about setting up an organization named Japan Plus. I am very happy to say that JETRO and you all have used that system.

On this occasion, I would like to share another information. Japan Plus works with our Invest India. Just a few days back United Nations has rewarded Invest India with a global honor for its marvelous work.

Friends,

Fast growing economy of India, its rapidly growing middle class, rapidly growing urban population and our Young Demography provides a very wide scope to Japanese companies working here.

Let me give some examples-

In the last four years under special programs like Make in India we have progressed towards making India a Global Hub in the field of Manufacturing and Research.

There is a lot of potential especially for Japanese MSME companies to work in India. Here I would like to say that while every major Japanese company coming to India is welcome but through MSME also Japanese business leaders can take their business to new heights. The results for MSMEs are visible in less time.

One of the benefits of doing business in India is also the Low cost manufacturing. Behind it, is the Competitive Labor Cost which is a huge force in India.

Similarly our IT industry is also a big force. I have come here earlier and said it that if our software meets with your hardware, then I believe that we can create miracles in the world.

Not only this, India is rapidly moving towards industry 4.0 through new inventions in the field of technology like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, 3D Printing, and Robotics etc.

Similarly, Electric Mobility is an area in which cooperation between India and Japan is going to prove to be extremely profitable for both countries.

Friends,

Apart from this, we are doing unprecedented work in India on Infrastructure too. Now our emphasis is on Next Generation Infrastructure. We intend that we create such a Competitive Economy whose foundations are Skill, Speed ​​and Scale. To realize this idea, we are constantly trying to improve the investment climate.

Today, from this forum, I invite all of you for the vast business opportunities that are being created in India. I would like to give you some more examples of this immense opportunity:

• Our Sagarmala program through which we want to connect the coastal regions to the regional areas of the country is a great opportunity for you.

• A lot of new opportunities are also being created due to the Smart City program. We also want to introduce metro rail in 50 of our cities.

• Similarly our rail and road extension and modernization program is also very huge. We still have to build many high speed corridors.

• With the modernization of the existing ports and airports, establishment of new ports and airports is also on our agenda.

• Inland Water Transport and Green Energy is our new commitment and that too is a great opportunity for you.

• Our steel consumption is currently very low. Iron is also abundant. I want to produce high grade steel in India.

Friends,

Both India and Japan are strong supporters of democratic values ​​and freedoms.

Also, there are many similarities in our approach and outlook to policies for development.

Apart from infrastructure and capacity building, there is strong potential for cooperation between Japan and India in third countries in health and agriculture sectors.

Therefore, whether it is Indo-Pacific or South Asia or Africa, India and Japan will strengthen their participation in the development of third countries on the basis of priorities of our partner countries.

With the entry of Japan into the International Solar Alliance, new partnership doors are open between our two countries on the topics of solar energy and climate change in third countries.

I am happy that in today’s meeting of the India Japan Business Leaders Forum many members of the forum presented a number of good ideas for enhancing the cooperation between Indian and Japanese businessmen in these areas in Africa.

Friends,

I've always been talking about Strong India - Strong Japan.

On this occasion I express our gratitude to Japan's entrepreneurial class for having special faith in India.

I would also like to invite all of you to increase the pace of investment in India.

I assure you that you will be helped in every possible way to further strengthen trade relations between Japan and India.

Once again I am very thankful to all of you for joining this event.

Thank you.

Hello! (Namaskar!) 

A country like Japan, this atmosphere of AKI season and your company, it truly is a phenomenal confluence. If you have to call at 9:00 am on a working Monday morning in India, but to turn up in such large numbers so early in the morning, I am grateful from the depths of my heart for such love and blessings. 

Today's meeting is also special because I am meeting my kinsfolk residing in Japan after the year 2016.


On this occasion, I congratulate our best friend, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on behalf of India, on behalf of all of you, for being elected as the President of LDP again.

Prime Minister Abe always had a feeling of love and affection for the people of India and for me. The kind of special reception that has been accorded to me gave a new dimension to this love and affection, once again I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Abe and to the people of Japan. 


Along with this my heartiest wishes to all of you for Deepawali. Just like in Deepawali a lamp illuminates the place where it is lighted, similarly it is my wish that you illuminate your and country’s name in Japan and everywhere in the world.

Friends, 

This is my third visit to Japan as the Prime Minister of India. Whenever I come to Japan, I have a very affectionate experience here. That is because relations between India and Japan are rooted from cultures to trends. Be it Hinduism or Buddhism, our heritage is shared. A glimpse of this heritage is reflected in the people that we adore to our alphabets.

Be it Goddess Saraswati, Goddess Lakshmi, Lord Shiva or Ganesh, equivalents of all are present in the Japanese society. The word ""service"" means the same in Japanese and Hindi. Home became Goma here and the Festoon became Tori in Japanese.The traditional white attire that Japanese pilgrims wear who go to the Holy Mount Ontake, also get something written on it inthe ancient script of Sanskrit-Sidham. When they wear white Japanese Tengui, OM is written on it.

Friends, 

There are many such strong threads of the past woven inthe relations of India and Japan. While Buddha and Bose connect the history of India and Japan, the present of new India is being strengthenedby emissaries like you. The ambassador of the government is one but thousands of envoys of our nation are present here. 


You are the bridge that connects India and Japan,its people, culture and aspirations of both countries. I am glad you are carrying this responsibility successfully.

Friends, 

Whenever I talk to Prime Minister Abe, he praises Indian community which makes me feel so happy. You people have earned great respect here from your skillsand your cultural values.

You have succeeded in making Yoga a part of Japan's life. You have introduced Kadhi-Chawal in the menus here, and now youeven celebrate Diwali with your Japanese friends here. You have given this martial arts skilled country the art of kabaddi and now you are engaged in developing the culture of cricket here. 

The way you have made a place in Japanese hearts with the mantra of Contribute, Co-exist to Conquer Hearts is really appreciable. I am happy that a diaspora of more than 30 thousand Indians is working here as the representative of our culture.

Friends, 

Many of you keep visiting India. Those who have not been there for a while come to know about the changes happening in India through the newspapers and through the Internet. Today, India is going through a major phase of change. Today, the world is praising India's efforts to serve humanity. The country is being honored for the work that is being done in the field of public service, and the kind of policies that are being formulated in India.

Recently, two great organizations of the world have appreciated and honored India's efforts. Due to contributions made towards Green Future, United Nations has conferred the Champion of the Earth award and Seoul Peace Foundation has honored India with the Seoul Peace Prize. 

Friends, 

These honors may have been given to me as a representative of 1.25 billion Indians but my contribution is only as much as the thread of the garland thatstrings the beads and encourages them to move ahead unitedly. Our country is full of such pearls and diamonds like you. Only a concerted effort was required which we have been doing for the past four years. Today, this collective power of the masses and public participation is being recognized by the world.

Today, India is playing a leading role in environment protection, world peace, and reducing economic disparity. I thank the Jury of Seoul Peace Prize for praising Modinomics. While respecting their feelings, I would like to say that instead of Modinomics it is an honor for Indonomics. 

Being the head of government, I am merely doing what is the culture and tradition of India. We are devoted to our ancient values of ‘Whole world is a family’and‘May all become happy and disease free.’ Our government have made only that much changes that the worldshould be seen with the glasses of India. 

Our government is constantly working with the spirit of Indian Solution, Global Application. First we are resolving problems of India and then presenting that model to other countries of the world.

Friends, 

You will be proud to know that the transparency created in India because of the trinity of JAM i.e. Jandhan, Aadhar and Mobile, is also inspiring other developing countries of the world. The systemsdeveloped in India arenow being studied. Apart from this, our modern arrangementsfor Digital Transactions, like BHIM App and Rupay Card, many countries of the world are also curious about these things.

I have been told that Japan is also increasingly making efforts towards a Less Cash Economy. You will be happy to know that today India has moved way ahead in this direction. Over the past four years, digital transactions have increased by almost 7 times through UPI, BHIM and other digital platforms. 

At the same time, India is taking Financial Inclusion to the next level and home delivery of Financial Services in villages is being done through the Post Offices. You have seen the postman in your childhood, that postman is now becoming a banker.

Friends, 

Today India is making unprecedented progress in the field of Digital Infrastructure. Broadband connectivity is reaching villages and more than one billion mobile phones are active in India today. Sometimes it is said that there are more mobile phones in India than the population of India. 1GB data in India is cheaper than the smallest bottle of cold drink. Today this cheap data is becoming an effective medium of service delivery.

On the other hand, Make in India has emerged as a global brand today. Today we are making great products not only for India but for the world also. India is becoming a global hub especially in Electronics and Automobile Manufacturing. We are moving ahead towards becoming number one in mobile phone manufacturing. 

Friends, 

The atmosphere behind the success of Make in India is thatwhich has been created for business in the past four years. We have made a jump of more than 40 points in the Ease of Doing Business Rankings.This year also we have improved our placein the Global Competitive Rankingsby five points. At the same time, in the case of innovation, today we have joined the list of the world's leading countries. This is the reason that India is now the second largest ecosystem for start-ups.

Friends, 

Whatever innovations are taking place in India, whatever solutions are being prepared, along with being inexpensive they are good in terms of quality also. India's Space Program is a great example of this. Today India is sendingspacesatellites of many countries and private companies in the worldat a very low cost. Last year, our scientists had created an unprecedented record of launching more than one hundred satellites at once.

We have sent Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan in very small budget, now we are preparing to send Gaganyaan by 2022. This Gaganyaan will be completely Indian and the person going to space in this will also be an Indian.

Friends, 

From ground to space, many such changes have been taking place in India today. Due to these changes, today India is the world's fastest growing major economy. Given these changes, all the agencies in the world are saying that in the coming decade, India will drive world growth. In this growth story of India, Japan and you alltoo are going to make a big contribution.

From the Bullet Train to the Smart Cities, whatever new infrastructure of New India is being prepared today, Japan is a partner in that. India's Manpower, India's Youth Power is also benefitting from Japan's skill.

Friends, 

I invite you all for your active participation in the creation of New India. Today, along with suitable opportunities for investment and innovation in India, itis also an important time to connect actively with your roots.


Indians settled in Japan,together with the Japanese friends have always contributed significantly for the country. The support that Swami VivekanandaJi, NetajiSubhash Chandra Bose and independence movement of India got from Japan, it will always remainetched in the heart of millions of Indians. 

We all have to make constant efforts so that in future our relations get more intense and our partnership becomes much stronger.

Today, from this forum I invite you to Pravasi Bharatiya Divas and Ardha-Kumbha in January next year. This year Pravasi Bharatiya Divas will be organized in Varanasi, where Prime Minister Abe got fascinated by seeing the Ganga Aarti. I am inviting you face to face to come to Varanasi because I am the MP from there and you all will be my guests.

Two days later, India is going to create one more new identity on the world map. 

31st October is the birth anniversary of SardarVallabhbhai Patel, which we celebrate every year, but this time it will have the attention of whole world as Gujarat, his birthplace, is going to have the world's tallest statueofSardarSahab i.e. the Statue of Unity which is twice as high as the Statue Of Liberty.The statue of SardarJi will be as high as was his brilliance. Every India can proudly say that the world's largest statue is in India. It will be inaugurated on October 31. I am sure that when you will visit India, your Japanese friends will visit India,then you will inspire them to see the statue of SardarVallabh Bhai Patel, this will be my request to you all.

At the end, once again my best wishes to you all for Deepawali. 

You all came in such large numberstoday morning, I once again heartily thank all of you.


Thank you.

                        My dear countrymen, Namaskar. The 31st of October is the birth anniversary of our beloved SardarVallabhbhai Patel. This year too, the youth of the country is all set, to take part in the ‘Run for Unity’. The weather too these days is pleasant. I urge you to participate in the largest possible numbers in this run for unity. Six months or so before Independence, on the 27th of January, 1947, the world – famous international Magazine ‘Time’ had a photograph of Sardar Patel on the cover page of that edition. In their lead story, they had depicted a map of India; it was nowhere close to what the map looks like now. It was the map of an India that was divided into myriad fragments. There existed over 550 princely states. The English had lost interest in India; they wanted to leave India fragmented into pieces. Time Magazine had opined that hovering over India then were the dangers of problems like partition, violence, food scarcity, price rise and power-politics. The magazine further observed that amidst that plethora of problems, if there was anyone who possessed the capability to unite the country and heal wounds, it was SardarVallabhbhai Patel. The story also brings to the fore other aspects of the life of the Iron Man of India… the manner in which he had managed relief operations during the Ahmedabad floods in the 1920s; the way he steered the BardoliSatyagrah. Such was his sense of honesty & commitment that the farmer, the worker right up to the industrialist trusted him with full faith. Gandhiji considered Sardar Patel as the only one capable of finding a lasting solution to the vexed issue of the states and asked him to act. Sardar Patel formulated solutions one by one, weaving the warp & weft of unity on the axis of a single thread. He ensured the merger of all princely states with the Dominion of India. Whether Junagadh, Hyderabad, Travancore, or for that matter the princely states of Rajasthan, if we are able to see a United India now, it was entirely on account of the sagacity & strategic wisdom of Sardar Patel. It is but natural for us to solemnly remember SardarVallabhbhai Patel as we exalt the spirit of unity that binds our Nation, our Mother India. The 31st of October this year will be special on one more account- on this day, we shall dedicate the statue of unity of the nation as a true tribute to Sardar Patel. Erected on the banks of river Narmada in Gujarat, the structure is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty. This is the world’s tallest scyscraping statue. Every Indian will now be proud to see the world’s tallest statue here on Indian soil. Sardar Patel, a true son of the soil will adorn our skies too. I hope every Indian being will swell with pride on this remarkable feat of mother India… and will sing paeans of glory in its praise with the head held high. Of course, the inner wish to visit the statue of unity will come naturally to every Indian. I am sure this will turn out to be a described destination for one & all across the country.

My dear brothers & sisters, we celebrated ‘Infantry Day’ yesterday. I respectfully bow before all of them who are part of the Indian Armed Forces. I also salute the families of our soldiers. But, do you know why we Indian citizens commemorate this day as Infantry Day? This is the very day when Indian Forces landed in Kashmir and saved the valley from the clutches of aggression. This incident too is directly related to SardarVallabhbhai Patel. I was reading an old interview with the celebrated Army officer samManekshaw. In that interview, field Marshal Sam Manekshaw was reminiscing on times when he was a Colonel. Around this time, military operations commenced in Kashmir. Field Marshal Manekshaw has mentioned how in a meeting,SardarVallabhbhai Patel was irked on the delay in sending troops to Kashmir During the proceedings, Sardar Patel gave him  a characteristic glance and reiterated that there should be no delay in our Army operation and that a solution should be sought swiftly. And immediately after that, our troops flew to Kashmir… we’ve seen how our Army was successful. The 31st of October also is the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Our respectful tributes to Indira ji too.

        My dear countrymen, who doesn’t love sports? Elements like spirit, strength, skill, stamina are extremely important in the world of sports. They are the ultimate test for a sportsperson’s mettle… all four of these virtues form the core foundation of nation – building universally. If the youth of a country possess these qualities, that country will progress not only in areas such as Economy and Science & Technology but also bring laurels home in the field of sports. Just recently I had two memorable meetings. First, I got an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held at Jakarta. These athletes bagged a tally of 72 medals, creating a new, unprecedented record, bringing glory to the nation. I was fortunate to get an opportunity to meet all these talented athletes personally. I congratulated them. Their grit & determination; their resolve to overcome all odds in the path of success is indeed inspiring for all our countrymen. Similarly, I was blessed with a chance to meet our winners of the Summer youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina. You will be pleased to know that in the Summer Youth Olympics 2018, the performance of our youth was the best ever. At this event we won 13 medals besides 3 in mixed events. You may recall that even, in the recent Asian Games, India’s performance was par excellence. Have you observed the way I have frequently used terms such as ‘the best ever’ or ‘new, unprecedented record’? This is the real story of Indian Sports which are witnessing an upswing with each passing day. India is setting new records not just in the field of sports but also in hitherto uncharted areas. To give you an example, I would like to mention about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur, who won a gold medal for the country in the 2018 Para Asian Games. He is a Divyang by birth. When he turned eight he lost his father. Then he spent another eight years in an orphanage. After leaving the orphanage, he eked out a living cleaning DTC buses and working as waiter at roadside eateries. The same Narayan is winning medals for India at International events. Not just that, just observe the rapidly enhancing levels of excellence in Indian sports !Hitherto, India had never won a medal in a Judo event, at the junior or senior level. But Tabaabi Devi created history by bagging the silver medal at the youth Olympics. 16 year old player Tabaabi Devi hails from a village in Manipur. Her father is a labourer and mother a fish-seller. There were times when the family had no money to buy food. Even such hardships were not able to cow down her zest & devotion. And she has created history by winning a medal for the country. Stories like these are innumerable. Every life, every being is a source of inspiration. Every young sportsperson’s passion & dedication is the hallmark of New India. 

        My dear countrymen, you may recall that we had successfully organized FIFA Under- 17 World Cup in the year2017. The whole world acclaimed this as a very successful tournament. FIFA Under -17 World Cup had created a record in terms of the number of viewers on the ground. More than 12 lakh enthusiasts enjoyed the romance of Football matches in various stadia across the country and  boosted the morale of the young players. This year also, we have been fortunate to be the hosts of the Men’s Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneshwar. The Hockey World Cup will commence on the 28th November to be concluded on the 16th December. Each Indian who plays any game or has interest in any game has a definite interest in Hockey. India has a golden history in Hockey. India has won gold medals in various tournaments and has been the World Champion once. India has produced many great hockey players. Wheneverthere will be reference to Hockey,the story will remain incomplete without a mention of these legends. Hockey maestro Major Dhyan Chand is a renowned name all over the world. Then, from Balbeer Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhan Raj Pillai, Indian Hockey has had a very long journey. Even today, players of Team India are encouraging the younger generation through their hard work and focused attention. 

        It is a good chance for the sport lovers to witness closely contested matches. Go to Bhubaneshwar and cheer up the Indian team and also encourage each team there. Odisha has a dignified historical background and has a very rich cultural tradition. People of the state are full of warmth. This is a chance for the sports lovers to see Odisha. They can visit the world famous holy places like the Sun Temple of Konark, Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and Chilka Lake along with enjoying the games there. I convey my best wishes to our Men’s Hockey Team for this tournament and assure them that 125 crore Indians are supporting them. I also convey my wishes to all the teams from around the world coming to participate in the tournament. 

        My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward and volunteering for social works is really inspirational and encouraging for all our countrymen. “Service is Supreme” has been India’s tradition since centuries and we can feel the scent of this tradition in each and every sector today as well. But, in this new era, the new generation is coming forward in a new way with a fresh vigour and spirit to fulfill their new dream. Recently, I attended a programme where a portal was launched, its name is ‘Self 4 Society’, MyGov and the IT and Electronics industry of the country have launched this portal with a view to motivating their employees for social activities and providing  them with opportunities to perform in this field. Their dedication and vigour can make each Indian feel proud. A fresh and pleasant air of IT to society, We-not I, a transformation from the individual to the community is imbibed in this. Someone is teaching the old people; someone is involved in the campaign of cleanliness whereas someone is helping out the farmers. And there is no vested interest behind all these activities but a pure feeling of dedication and resolve is the driving force. One young person learned to play wheelchair basket ball in order to be able to help the wheelchair basket ball team of differently abled, divyang players. This spirit, this dedication is a mission mode activity. Will this not make every Indian feel proud. This spirit of  ‘We, not I’ will surely inspire all of us. 

        My dear brothers and sisters, when I was going through your suggestion for Mann Ki Baat this time, I found a very interesting comment from Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pudducherry. He wrote on Mygov- Please take up the topic “in Mann Ki Baat” as to how the tribes and their traditions and rituals are the best examples of coexistence with the nature. How do we need to adopt their traditions in our lives for achieving sustainable development and learn from those traditions?Manishji, I appreciate you for bringing this subject among the listeners of  Mann Ki Baat. This is one subject that inspires us to look into our dignified past and our ancient traditions, Today, the whole world and specially the western countries are discussing about environment protection and are trying to find new ways to adopt a balanced life style. Our country is also facing this problem. But, for its solution we only have to look inwards, to look into our glorious past and our rich traditions and have especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities. To live in consonance and closed coordination with the nature has been an integral part of our tribal communities. Our tribal brethren worship trees and plants and flowers like gods and goddesses. The Bhil tribes of  Central India and specially those in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship Peepal and Arjun trees religiously. TheBishnoi community in the desert land of Rajasthan has shown us a way of environment protection. Specially, in the context of serving trees, they prefer laying down their lives but cannot tolerate any harm to a single tree. Mishmi tribes of Arunachal Pradesh claim their relationship with tigers. They even treat them like their brothers and sisters. In Nagaland as well, tigers are seen as the forest guardians. People of Warli Community in Maharashtra consider tigers as their guests and for them the presence of tigers is a good omen indicating prosperity. There is a belief among the Kol community in Central India that their fortune is directly connected with the tigers and they firmly believe that if the tigers do not get food, the villagers will have to facehunger . The Gond  tribes in Central Indai stop fishing in some parts of Kaithan river during the breeding season. They consider this area as a fish reserve and they get plentiful of healthy fishes because of this belief of theirs. Tribal communities make their dwelling units from natural material which are strong as well as eco-friendly. In the isolated regions of the Nilgiri plateau in South India, a small wanderer community Toda make their settlements using locally available material only. 

        My dear brothers and sisters, this is a fact that the tribal community believes in very peaceful and harmonious co-existence but, if somebody tries to harm and cause damage to their natural resources, they do not shy away from fighting for their rights. There is no wonder that our foremost freedom fighters were the brave people from our tribal communities. Who can forget BhagwanBirsaMunda who struggled hard against the British Empire to save their own forest land. Besides whatever I have said, there is a very long list of examples of the tribal communities which teach us how to keep a close coordination and make adjustments with the nature and the nation is indebted to our tribal people for the forest land that is still remaining with us. Come on, let us express our gratitude towards them.

        My dear countrymen, in “Mann Ki Baat”, we talk about those persons and institutions who make extra-ordinary contribution for the society. These works may seem small but have a very deep impact in changing our thinking and in giving a new direction to the society. A few days ago, I was reading about a farmer brother Gurbachan Singh from Punjab. The son of this  hard working farmer Gurbachan Singh ji was to be married. Gurbachan Singh ji had told the bride’s parents that the marriage would be performed in a solemn manner. There is absolutely no need to spend much on wedding reception or any other item. We have to keep it a very very simple event. But then he suddenly said that he had one condition. And, when a condition is put these days, generally it is thought that the other side is going to make a big demand which will be really difficult for the bride’s family to fulfill. But, you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurbachan Singh was a simple farmer and what he told the bride’s father and the condition he placed reflects the true strength of our society. Gurbachan Singh ji asked him to promise that they will not burn parali or stubble in their fields. You can well imagine the social strength this statement had. This point made by Gurbachan Singh ji appears quite ordinary but this reveals how tall and strong his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who connect their individual matters with the benefit of the society as a whole. ShrimanGurbachan Singh ji’s family has presented one such example before us. I have also read about a village KallarMajra which is near Nabha in Punjab.  KallarMajra came into lime light as the farmers there mix the stubble with the sand by ploughing their fields rather than burning the stubble and adopt the necessary technology for the process. Congratulations to bhaiGurbachan Singh ji ! Congratulations to the people of KallarMajra and of all those places who are making their best efforts to keep the environment clean and pollution free. All of you are carrying forward the Indian tradition of a healthy life style as a true successor. Just as a sea is formed by collection of tiny drops, similarly,a small constructive step, plays a vital role in creating a positive environment. 

        My dear countrymen, it has been told in our epics:- 

ॐ द्यौ: शान्तिः अन्तरिक्षं शान्तिः,

पृथिवी शान्तिः आपः शान्तिः ओषधयः शान्तिः |

वनस्पतयः शान्तिः विश्वेदेवाः शान्तिः  ब्रह्म शान्तिः,

सर्वं शान्तिःशान्तिरेव शान्तिः सामा शान्तिरेधि||

ॐ शान्ति: शान्ति:शान्ति:||

        It means- O, Lord, peace should prevail all around in all three “Lokas”,in water, in air, in space, in fire, in wind, in medicines, in vegetation, in gardens, in sub conscious, in the whole creation. Grant peace to each soul, each heart, in me, in you, in every particle and everywhere in the Universe. Om Shanti: Shanti: Shanti:.

        Wherever there will be a talk of world peace, India’s name and contribution will be written in golden letters. For India, 11th of November this year has a special significance because on 11thNovember a hundred years back the World War I had ended. Ending of that war is completing one hundred years meaning thereby that a century of ending of the vast devastation and human loss would also get completed. For India, World War I was an important event. Rightly speaking we had no direct connection with that war. Despite this, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice. Indian soldiers showed it to the world that they are second to none if it comes to war. Our soldiers have displayed great valour in difficult areas and adverse conditions. There has just been a single objective behind it- Restoration of peace. The world witnessed a dance of death and devastation during the World War I; According to estimates, around one crore soldiers and almost the same number of civilians lost their lives. This made the whole world realize and understand the importance of peace. The definition of peace has changed in the last hundred years. Today, peace does not only mean ‘no war’. There is a need to work unitedly to address issues such as terrorism, climate change, economic development to social justice through universal cooperation and co-ordination. Development of the poorest of the poor is the real indicator of peace. 

        My dear countrymen, our North-East has a unique distinction of its own. The natural beauty of North –East has no parallel and the people of this area are extremely talented. Now our North-east is also known for all best deeds. North east is one region that has made grand progress in organic farming. A few days ago Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award, 2018 for encouraging the sustainable food system. This award is given by the UN body ‘Food & Agriculture Organisation’ – FAO. You will be delighted to know that this best policy making award is equivalent to an Oscar in the sector. Not only this, our Sikkim  outperformed 51 nominated policies of 25 countries to win this award. For this, I heartily compliment the people of Sikkim. 

        My dear countrymen, October is about to end. Quite a change is being felt in the weather. Winter has set in and with the changing weather, the season of festivals has also set in - Dhanteras, Deepawali, BhaiyaDooj, Chhatth – in a way it can be said that the month of November is the month of festivals. I extend my best wishes to all countrymen for these festivals. 

        I would request all of you to take best care of yourselves and take care of your health as well and also take care of social interests. I am sure these festivals are an opportunity to make new resolves. These festivals prove a chance to advance in a mission mode and to make firm resolves in your life. Your progress is a vital part of the country’s progress. The more you progress, the more will the country progress. My best wishes to you all. Thank you very very much.

                My Cabinet colleague, Radhamohan Singh ji; the popular, successful and zealous Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath ji; Assistant Deputy Minister of the government of Japan, Takami Nakada ji; Israel's Ambassador Maya Kadosh ji; agricultural scientists, other dignitaries and my dear farmer brothers and sisters who have come here from every corner of UP.

There are still a few months remaining for the Ardha-Kumbh mela of Prayagraj. However, another Kumbh has begun in UP from today. About 50 thousand farmers from different villages of UP and scientists and entrepreneurs from around the world and within the country are becoming a part of this Agricultural Kumbh in Lucknow. I welcome you all. And as a Parliamentarian from UP, it's my responsibility to stand with you at all times and make efforts in your journey of development.

A few months back, during Krishi Unnati Mela, I had advised to organize large farmer fairs. Krishi Kumbh Mela is just an extension of that. I congratulate Yogi ji and his entire team for this great effort. I also want to offer my gratitude to the government of Japan and the government of Israel for partnering with us in this event. At the same time, the partner state of Haryana will also benefit out of it.

Friends,

Whenever the word 'Kumbh' gets associated with any event, its significance increases manifold. The Kumbh, in a way, is an inter-flow of ideas and the expression of humanity. I believe that the Krishi Kumbh will fulfill this tradition and in the next three days, new paths will open up for modern techniques and other opportunities.

Friends,

I was told that there are almost 200 stalls in this fair that are informing the farmers about modern techniques and machines related to agriculture. I believe that every farmer will benefit from this and at the same time it will help the farmers in ensuring quality.

 

Friends,

The Kharif season is about to get over everywhere around the country. All the farmer brothers and sisters are busy these days. Even this time, a record production is expected. UP is a place where the hard-working farmers produce the country's 20% of the food grains. I congratulate you all for the same. Several crops including rice and pulses are being purchased in Mandis across the country. I was told that in several parts of Uttar Pradesh too, grand arrangements have been made. This time the value received by the farmers for their crops is based upon the new Minimum Support Price. You all are aware of the fact that the government has made a historic increase in the MSP of 21 crops. It has been decided that the farmer should get direct profit of at least 50% of the cost.

Friends,

As the farmers of UP are engaged in record production, Yogi ji's government is breaking records in the purchase of that produce. Therefore, I congratulate Yogi ji's government. This time about 50-55 lakh metric tonnes of wheat has been purchased whereas the previous government used to purchase only 7-8 lakh metric tonnes of wheat. This means that considering that the farmers get a fair price, the purchase made by the Bharatiya Janata Party's Yogi Government has been 7-8 times more. Moreover, this purchase has been made directly from the farmers by the use of technology i.e. e-Uparjan so as to keep the middlemen away.

Friends,

This transformation is visible not only in the case of wheat and paddy but also in the case of sugarcane. Farmers have been paid more than Rs 27 thousand crores this season. Besides, Rs.11 thousand crores from the amount due have also been paid to the farmers. I was told that the Yogi government is trying to clear the amount due by the sugar Mills. I am glad that the UP government, for the first time, has decided to purchase potatoes. This will definitely help the farmers who don't get the fair price for their potatoes.

Friends,

These efforts in UP are part of that commitment of the central government as a result of which the villages and the farmers have become an important part of our economic planning. As per our clear conviction, it is the farmer that takes the nation forward, not the other way round. Therefore, the government is working on the problems associated with agriculture and farmers holistically and not in bits and pieces. Our focus is on removing every little problem faced by the farmers.

 

Friends,

The government is committed to doubling the farmer’s income by 2022 that will mark 75 years of Indian independence. Following the policy of minimum cost and maximum profit, scientific techniques have been beautifully blended with agriculture. A strong system of 'seed to the market' is being prepared in the country. Several initiatives are being taken in different areas ranging from soil health to improvement in Mandis. More than 16 crore soil health cards have been handed over to the farmers across the country of which 3 crores have been distributed in UP. This will help the farmers to decide which crop is suitable for a particular soil type and the amount of fertilizer required for the crops.

Friends,

In order to keep the characteristics and fertility of the soil intact, organic farming is being promoted. The farmers are being encouraged to maximize their use of fertilizers made from waste, so as to ensure production according to the needs of the country. The availability of the fertilizers like Urea in adequate amounts is also being ensured. At the same time, the irrigation facilities are also being strengthened. Apart from the major irrigation projects, new technologies in irrigation are also being promoted. Farmers are being encouraged to use 'Per Drop More Crop'. Micro irrigation systems like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation are becoming part of our irrigation system.

Israel has received accolades in new irrigation techniques. At the same time, Japan is doing a commendable job in agricultural technologies. Therefore, as a partner in the Agriculture Kumbh, you are going to draw the benefits from the expertise of the two countries. 

Friends,

Besides, we are rapidly moving forward in converting the electric and Diesel pumps into solar pumps. Besides these systems, pumps are important part of irrigation and major efforts are going on in this direction. A massive campaign is being run to convert these electric and diesel pumps to solar pumps. Under this, in the next four years, solar pumps will be installed in the fields of about 28 lakh farmers across the country. Firstly, the farmers will get free electricity and secondly, the surplus electricity can be sold to the power discoms.

 

Friends,

The farmer who was once 'Annadata' or producer of food grains now has the capability of being 'Urjadata' or producer of energy. The Annadata will now be Urjadata.

Friends,

The fact that this will bring a sea change in the lives of the farmers can be exemplified from one instance. I was in Gujarat a few days back. There I noticed that in a village, a few farmer families had collectively installed solar panels and solar pumps inside their fields. They have started generating electricity from solar energy. That was used in their fields and in solar pumps. It fulfilled their need of electricity. Moreover, they are earning Rs.50 thousand more annually by selling the surplus electricity.

Friends,

The government has made serious attempts to deliver the benefits of science to the farmers. The work of connecting the farmers and the scientists directly with the research centres has begun, so that the knowledge and information related to farming and seeds as a result of the research and discovery can reach the farmers at the shortest possible time. Therefore, about 700 Krishi Vigyan Kendras have been set up throughout the country. Modern institutions related to agriculture research are also being set up. Rice Research Centre is being established in Varanasi. The government has made efforts to ensure maximum price for the farmers' crops and for value addition. The government has allowed 100% FDI in the food processing sector. We all are aware of the fact that selling tomatoes will generate less income than selling tomato sauce in a bottle. Selling raw mangoes will fetch lower income than selling pickles made from raw mangoes. Similarly, selling green chillies will generate less income but selling chilli powder will generate greater income. This is called value addition. Moreover, TOP scheme with a cost of Rs.500 crores which is related to value addition of Tomatoes, Onions and Potatoes was announced in this year's budget. This will benefit the potato farmers of UP to a great extent. This has opened up new opportunities for investment in the field of agriculture which is benefitting UP. I was told that in UP Investors Summit, proposals of about Rs.16 thousand crores were made in food processing sector. Out of these, 14 projects worth Rs.3500 crores have already been launched.

Friends,

These steps are for making agriculture profitable. Besides, other steps are also being taken to increase the income of the farmers. After the success of Green Revolution, we have started walking on the new paths of white revolution, sweet revolution and blue revolution. We are creating record in the field of milk production, honey production and eggs or fish production. Two days ago, the government of India has taken a major decision for the fishermen families associated with fish production. The government has given approval to a new fund of Rs.7500 crores.

Friends,

All of you, the farmers, agriculture experts, scientists who are present here in Krishi Kumbh are important part of India's economy. This is because your efforts will have a major impact on our fast growing economy in the coming days. I urge you all to sit together and discuss about the techniques related to agriculture. It is essential to discuss on myriad issues like how to use less fertilizers, how to maximize the utilization of less water, how to improve warehouses for crops and how to use techniques like robots and drones effectively in agriculture.

Besides, how can we turn crop stubble into wealth with the help of new technology. Waste can be turned into wealth. Nothing is useless inside an agricultural field before and after harvest. Everything related to the field is gold. If the farmer uses his field effectively, nothing will go waste. Wealth can be created out of waste. There is a need to work more effectively in this direction. The government is giving a discount of 50-80% on crop waste to stop stubble burning. However, with technology-based solutions, we have to put an end to the compulsion of our farmer brothers of burning the crop stubble. This will protect the environment.

I believe that in the next three days, effective discussion will take place to find ways of making agriculture profitable and making value addition. The discussion should especially focus upon how new experiments can be conducted in the different districts of UP according to their needs.

I hope that the Krishi Kumbh will give a new direction to the agriculture system of the UP as well as the entire country. With this expectation, once again, my best wishes to you all.

Thank you!

                Following is the text of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's departure statement prior to his visit to Japan. 

""I will visit Japan on 28-29 October 2018 for the Annual Summit. This will be my twelfth meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe since my first visit to Japan as Prime Minister in September 2014. Thereafter, I had visited Japan in 2016 for the Annual Summit.

Last year, I had the pleasure of hosting Prime Minister Abe and Mrs. Akie Abe in my home state Gujarat also. Japan is India’s valued partner. We have a Special Strategic and Global Partnership. Our ties with Japan, both economic and strategic, stand completely transformed in recent years. It is today a partnership of great substance and purpose. It rests on the strong pillars of India’s Act East Policy, and our shared vision and commitment to a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.

As democracies, we have shared values. We seek peace and prosperity for all.

Our complementarities make India and Japan a winning combination. Japan today is one of the most trusted partners in India’s economic and technological modernisations and one of the top investors in India. Projects like Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail and Dedicated Freight Corridors reflect the high level and strength of our economic engagement. Japan is also at the forefront of engaging in our national initiatives, such as ‘Make in India’, ‘Skill India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Start Up India’, etc.

Japanese investors have faith in India’s economic future, which is marked with myriad opportunities. 

We value Japan’s global leadership in innovation, technologies and best practices. During this visit, I will have a chance to see some of Japan’s high-tech capabilities in robotics.

I will have wide-ranging talks with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and interact with business leaders and captains of industry from both countries. I will also address the Indian community.

These interactions will help to further strengthen our trade and investment ties, and cooperation in new areas, such as healthcare, digital technologies, agriculture and food processing, disaster risk reduction and disaster resilient infrastructure.

I greatly welcome the growing ties between our parliamentarians, and between our states and Japan’s prefectures. It is a matter of happiness that direct relations between the peoples of our two countries continue to grow through active interaction in areas such as education, skill development, culture and tourism.

My visit will promote our traditional friendship that is deeply rooted in history, and consolidate our partnership for a better and more prosperous future.""

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Krishi Kumbh in Lucknow, via video conference.

The Prime Minister expressed confidence that this gathering of farmers would pave the way for new technology to be imbibed and better opportunities to be created in the agriculture sector.

The Prime Minister appreciated the State Government of Uttar Pradesh, for its efforts in augmenting substantially, the procurement of foodgrains. He asserted that the farmers are the ones, who take the country forward. He reiterated the Union Government’s commitment to double the income of farmers by 2022. In this context, he mentioned the series of steps that the Government is pursuing to reduce input costs and raise profits. He mentioned that a large number of solar pumps will be installed in farms across the country in the near future. He said the Government is working to deliver the benefits of science to agriculture. He said the Rice Research Centre being set up in Varanasi, is a step in this direction.

The Prime Minister also spoke of the importance of value addition in farming. He mentioned the steps being taken in the Food Processing Sector. He said that after the Green Revolution, the emphasis now is on milk production, honey production, and also on poultry and fisheries.       

The Prime Minister called for discussions on matters such as judicious use of water resources, better technology for storage, and use of latest technology in farming, during this Krishi Kumbh. He emphasized the need to evolve new technologies and ways that will help eliminate the need for farmers to burn crop stubble (Parali).

                All my colleagues in the council of ministers; all the experienced dignitaries who provide momentum to India’s industrial life; who provide strength to IT profession; and our young generation associated with the field of IT; students of our school and colleges present in the CSC centers of our villages who have been living with a lot of dreams; students of IIT and several other institutions; it’s a matter of happiness for me that today I got the opportunity to come amongst you which is the most favorite thing for me. 

Our minister Sri Ravishankar Ji was giving the details of the work done by the government, however, I have come not amongst you for this purpose. Any person who attains any success in his career, no matter how much money or prestige he may earn and even if he was able to realise all his dreams in his lifetime through his own efforts even then he craves for some kind of satisfaction. How can he get that satisfaction? And we have experienced this thing that even if he has accomplished everything but thereafter if he does something for someone else, if he tries to live for others then his satisfaction level goes up considerably. 

I was listening to ShrimanAzimPremJi in the film at the start. When I was chief minister of Gujarat in 2003-04 then he used to visit me and used to talk about his business and some other work related to the government. However, I have seen that in the last 10-15 years thereafter whenever I got the opportunity to meet him he never talked about his work, his company or his corporate work. If he talks about anything then it is the mission that he is working on these days, it is about education and he is working on it with so much involvement that he did not use to work for his company with this kind of involvement. 

So I feel that in this age, the person who established such a large company, who had such a successful journey but he is getting satisfaction from the work he is doing now. 

It does not mean that a person does not serve anyone in his life in the profession he may be, suppose if someone is a doctor that does not mean that he doesnot serve. He does serve! If someone is a scientist and he spends his lifetime in a laboratory and he discovers something that is going to change the life of people generation after generation then it does not mean that he was not working for the society. It does not mean that he was living or working for himself or for his name. It is not like that. 

He was working for others, but if he does something in front of his eyes, in his presence then he gets a different kind of satisfaction. And today, that satisfaction, that basic feeling of satisfaction is different for every human being. You can experience it yourself, you can judge it from your own life, SwantahSukhay (for personal happiness), some people say that they get satisfaction, inner happiness and energy. 

We have been listening about this thing in Ramayan that a squirrel got associated with Lord Ram in the work for construction of Ram Setu (Bridge of Ram). That a squirrel considered it a novel work to be associated with it after being inspired. However, there can be another perspective, that even if Lord Ram were to succeed, even if he was God, he too needed a squirrel and when a squirrel joined him then he succeeded. 

No matter, the government may take any number of initiatives, no matter how much money it may spend but unless there is people’s participation in it, we cannot get the result that we want. And India cannot wait. 

And now the world also does not want to see an India waiting for something. Even the world is expecting India to lead; the world has this expectation from India. And if this is the expectation of the world then we will have to develop our country in that manner. And if we want to do that then how can we bring about change in the life of the common man of India. Can I utilise my skills, capabilities, power and experience for others, can I make use of it for someone else? 

One thing is for certain that there are a place like this that if a poor person, if a hungry person visits them for food then it is offered to him. The people who are there to serve they serve in a very dedicated manner. And the person who goes there in expectation of food, then there comes a situation that he also feels that there is an institutional arrangement and if he goes there then he will get something to eat. Even the person who visits these places he does not have any special attention that who are the providers. Even the people who provide for they are not conscious about the seekers, they are not concerned who comes and why?  Why it is so? Because they have formed a habit that if someone comes then they offer food and the person leaves thereafter. 

However, if a poor person, who is hungry, if he goes to the doors of another poor family and if that poor family shares half of its meal then both of them remember thing for the rest of their lives. They derive satisfaction from it. 

All of us have seen these things that what a big change is being brought about by those things that are done because of self-inspiration rather than those things that happen due to some system. If we are traveling in an airplane and some old person who is sitting next to us, if he wants to drink water and he has a bottle but he is finding it difficult to open it. If we notice it then we immediately open it. It givessatisfaction to us. It means that living life for others gives a unique pleasure. 

I have tried to develop a tradition after becoming the Prime Minister, I used to do it even when I was the chief minister that if I go to convocation of any university then I request the organizers that if there is a government school near the university where poor children from nearby slums are getting educated in class 8th, 9th or 10th then they will be my special guests, and I ask them to provide space and offer them seats in the convocation program. I ask them to invite those children in the convocation and these children do come. 

I feel that these children have been studying in their schools, even if it was in dilapidated condition. However, when they come to the convocation then they see that someone is coming to the dais by wearing a huge robe, that he has donned a cap and everyone is giving a certificate to him so they also have a dream. A seed is planted that one day he will also be there and hetoo will also receive that. 

Perhaps it is much more than what he receives in the classroom. I mean to say that there are several things because of them we can do this thing. Our Anand Ji is sitting here, and since the time of my tenure as a chief minister to till date I have marked one thing about him that whenever I went to see him for development of Gujarat or for some investment, whenever I used to organizea meeting of industrialists then this gentleman never asked any question or talked about that. 

He always used to ask: sir, what can be done about the social work. See, this temperament which he has, this temperament is a big strength for the country and society. 

And, in the end, why I am happy and content after joining this program? I am a person connected with the social media so that I am not a victim ofthe information that is being given to me. I search and get the information myself that I was looking for and because of that I come across to new things.

And today this new platform of technology provides me that facility. And I have seen this thing that several children, several youth are doing so much work. They will form a group of three-four people, they will visit villages on Saturdays and Sundays. They will go to villages, they will stay in their colonies, they will stay among the people and sometimes they will teach children. They keep doing this kind of things. 

It means that in the current generation of India, the people in the age group of 25 to 40, this tendency is developing in them naturally, it can be seen. However, if it becomes collective then it emerges as a power and if we connect it with some mission then we don’t require structure of the system, we just need to connect it with a mission, it needs a platform, a flexible one. 

Everyone works as per his wishes, but whatever he or she does, if it is compiled somewhere, if the results are compiled then change also becomes visible. 

And this thing is certain: India’s destiny lies in technology. The technology that you people have it has India’s destiny with it. 

How can we work by combining these two things? If there is a gardener, if he scatters the seeds under the sky like this only, if the weather is right then a plant will take roots and it will also grow flowers. However, no one would be inclined to see it by visiting the place. 

However, if the same gardener plants those flowers in a very organized manner that flowers of this color, this size, so much height will be planted here, if it is planted here and if that is planted there then it will look like this, if he does that then the same garden can become a source of inspiration for everyone to visit it. 

What is the reason! He has done his job; he did this work in an organised manner, in a systematic manner. Our power to serve, which is scattered, and I see this thing that these days a new era of social start ups has stared. And those youth when they meet then they ask each other: what do you do? Then the other one says that he has done enough. I have seen that there was a young guy in Bangalore, he was in IT sector, I had seen it somewhere in social media that he drives, he said he drives for three-four hours in a day. When he was asked the reason then he said that he transports poor people. He said: I do some work, I help them, I take them to hospitals and I feel good. 

I have seen this kind of auto rickshaw drivers that have this thing written on the back of their vehicles: ‘if you need to go to a hospital then I will take you there free of cost.’ The poor auto rickshaw driver of my country! Suppose if he comes across to six people in a day that were to be taken to hospitals then his kids will starve. But he is least concerned. He puts up a board and does this thing with honesty. 

So this is the fundamental nature of humans that they need to do something for somebody and this is the feeling of ‘not me but us’ (main nahin hum). 

It does not mean that we must shunourselves; we just need to expand that ‘I’. We need to travel from ‘I’ to ‘All’. Why a person expands his family? Why does he feel happy in the midst of a larger family? This extended family of the society, of the entire country is bigger than our extended family and it becomes strength in itself. 

Today, this is a journey from IT to Society with the same feeling. While on the one hand it is the journey of IT to Society and on the other it is also from IIT to Society. So we have to move forward with this feeling. And I would like to start discussion as I need to talk to the people at seven-eight tables. 

There is a general perception in our country to abuse rich people; to say foul things about industrialists and traders has become a fashion. I don’t know why it is so? I’m surprised with this thing. And I am completely opposed to it. Everybody contributes in the nation building. If you look at this thing today then you will come to know that all these companies have told their brilliant staff that if they want to do some service for five days through their CSR that they can and do that their job will continue. These are not small things. They have a huge contribution in the ordinary life.

However, today when it has been brought to a single platform then it will be an eye opener for everyone. Is it so! People in every nook and corner of country are doing this kind of good work! This power of working together is an extremely big power. And I feel that this thing which is the basis for the inspiration – We – even in this thing, our angle of self and service will play and extremely important role. And you people are the people of communication world, people of the world of technology and if you people can very easily create all these things then it can certainly have a big impact and a massive reach.

And you people are connected to those things which are low cost. So the more we do them, the more we will become the source of inspiration. And these efforts made by us will become the basis of source of inspiration for maximum number of people. And one flower, so many flowers collected from different places, however, once they have been organised in a bouquet then it gives a unique pleasure. 

I believe that the work of preparing a bouquet of these tendencies for serving people has been done today. Today, here at this place, through this effort, with this kind of devotion to duty, people those who dedicate themselves, and the people those who work in new and newer areas and this thing is being done by our young generation, Mother India will be proud that this kind of flowers have blossomed inside our country who continue to spread the fragrance, who continue to do the job of changing the lives of others. 

I congratulate to all those youngsters who have done this job with total commitment and with complete dedication. 

I congratulate all those companies that have used their resources and their talent for fulfilling the social responsibilities in addition to their own economic development.

In our country, people’s participation is a must for the development of the country. If 1.25 billion will decide to march ahead then there is no power in the world that can keep India backward. India must develop and it must develop in the right direction and it has to develop with the help of power of 1.25 billion Indians.

The results cannot be achieved if everyone is moving in its own direction. Results will be there only when all the people together move in one direction. And I am a very optimistic person, and I can tell with my little experience of four years that why India remained backward so far. This is a question for me. I don’t have this question in my mind that whether the country will progress or not? I am confident that the country will progress a lot. Our country will be able to carve out a place for itself in the world by overcoming all the challenges. With this belief, I thank you all for planning this programme. All of you have turned up here in such a large numbers, and I got the opportunity to hear you and talk to you after such a long time. 

Thank you very much! 

Thank you!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched the “Main Nahin Hum” portal and app, in New Delhi. 

The portal, which works on the theme “Self4Society”, will enable IT professionals and organizations to bring together their efforts towards social causes, and service to society, on one platform. In doing so, the portal is expected to help catalyse greater collaboration towards the service of the weaker sections of society, especially by leveraging the benefits of technology. It is also expected to generate wider participation of interested people who are motivated to work for the benefit of society.

Interacting with a wide cross-section of IT and electronic manufacturing professionals, captains of industry and technocrats on the occasion, the Prime Minister said he is sure that people want to work for others, serve society and make a positive difference.

Among those who interacted with the Prime Minister today were Shri Anand Mahindra, SmtSudhaMurthy, and a number of young professionals, from India’s top IT companies. 

Every effort, however big or small, must be valued, the Prime Minister said, adding that Governments may have schemes and budgets but the success of any initiative lies in public involvement.Let us think about how we can use our strengths to bring a positive difference in the lives of others, the Prime Minister exhorted the gathering. 

The Prime Minister noted that he observes India's youngsters leveraging the power of technology very well. He said that they are using technology not only for themselves but also for the welfare of others. He described this as a wonderful sign. Noting that there are many start-ups in the social sector, the Prime Minister wished the young social entrepreneurs well. 

Responding to questions in a townhall style interaction, the Prime Minister said that it is essential to step out of our comfort zone. There is so much to learn and discover, he added.

IT professionals explained their efforts towards social volunteering, especially in skilling and cleanliness.In response to an observation, the Prime Minister asserted that the symbol of the Swachh Bharat Mission is the spectacles of Bapu, the inspiration is Bapu and we are fulfilling Bapu's vision. 

The Prime Minister said that on many occasions, what the “Sarkar” cannot do, “Sanskar” can do. Let us make cleanliness a part of our value systems, he added.

Speaking on the importance of conserving water, the Prime Minister said that in order to learn about water conservation, people should visit Porbandar in Gujarat, and see the home of Mahatma Gandhi. We need to conserve water and recycle water, he added. I appeal to my hardworking farmers to embrace drip irrigation, the Prime Minister said. 

The Prime Minister said that through volunteering efforts, a lot can be done in the agriculture sector. Youngsters must venture out and work for the welfare of farmers, he added.

The Prime Minister asserted that more people are paying taxes because they have faith that their money is being used properly and for the welfare of people. 

He said that India is making a mark in the start-up sector due to the talent of its youth. 

Responding to a team that is working to create rural digital entrepreneurs, the Prime Minister said that it is important to create an India where everyone has equal opportunities.

The Prime Minister said doing social work should be a matter of great pride for everyone. 

Expressing disagreement with the trend to criticize business and industry, the Prime Minister said that this townhall programme has illustrated how leading corporates are doing excellent social work, and urging their employees to venture out and serve the people.

Greetings! 

My colleague in the Council of Ministers, Smriti Irani Ji who is present in Varanasi,  the entrepreneurs associated with the carpet industry, my weaver brothers and sisters, and all other distinguished people present here. I convey my regards to all of you who have gathered here from across India and abroad on this sacred land of Kashi. I am told that more than 250 guests from 38 countries are here. In addition, the people from Jammu & Kashmir, West Bengal and several other states who are associated with the carpet industry are also  present here. As the MP from Benaras I welcome all of you to this expo. 

Friends, 

This is the festival season in the country. This is for the first time after Dussehera and Durga Puja that I have got the opportunity to connect with Banaras with the help of technology. Now all of you will be busy in making preparations for Dhanteras and Deepawali. This is that time of the year when you remain most occupied. This period is slightly more hectic because the demand goes up during this time. Also, this is the best time for you to get the rewards for your hard work and for your craft. 

Friends,

These festivals have brought twice the happiness for the weavers and traders of Varanasi and UP. I sincerely congratulate all of you for the organisation of first India Carpet Expo in Deendayal HastkalaSankul. Now the carpet industry of the country, our weavers, designers and businessmen have got the opportunity to showcase their skill and products to the world in Varanasi.

Friends,

I am happy that we are moving at a fast speed in the direction to achieve those objectives for which Deendayal HastkalaSankul was developed. It is also important because this region is a hub of the carpet industry. Nearly a  quarter of the country’s weavers, labourers and trader brothers and sisters associated with the handicraft sector live here. Whether it is Varanasi, Bhadohi or Mirzapur, these have been the centres of carpet industry and now the entire Eastern India, the whole region is turniogn into a global hub for the country’s textile export. Not only that, Deendayal HastkalaSankul has also been playing an important role in strengthening this global recognition in handicrafts. 

Friends,

        The government has always been emphasising on the use of technology and publicity to encourage the small and medium scale industries in this sector and also to reach these facilities at the places where the goods are produced.        This India Carpet Expo, which has been organised in Varanasi this time, is not just a major step in this direction but also an important pillar of our vision of Five Fs for the textile sector. Five Fs means Farm to Fiber, Fiber to Factory,  Factory to Fashion and Fashion to Foreign. This is a massive effort to directly connect the farmers and weavers with the markets across the world.

In the next four days, several top designs will be showcased in this expo, business worth crores and crores of rupees will be done, deals will be made, new avenues for business will be opened and weavers will get new orders. I believe that those trader friends who have come from abroad they will also be able to understand our culture and the changed business environment of Kashi as well as whole of India. 

Friends,

There has been an old tradition of handicrafts in India. Even today, the spinning wheel is widely used in India’s rural areas to make thread. And the land of Banaras had played even a greater role in this matter. Banaras is equally famous for both its handicrafts Saint Kabir. Kabir used to make thread and through it convey his message.KabirdasJi has said: 

“KahiKabirSuno Ho Santo Charkha Lakhe Jo Koy,

Jo Yah Charkha LakhiBhaye, TakoAvagaman Na Hoy.”

It means that this spinning wheel is the essence of life, the one who has understood it, he has also understood the meaning of life. I get a sense of satisfaction for development of this kind of facilities for making the lives of weavers easier at a place where handicraft has been linked to such an important philosophy of life. 

Friends,

In our country, handicraft has been a medium of inspiration, of struggle for the freedom and self-dependence over and above business and trade. We are very much familiar with the importance of Gandhi Ji, Satyagrah and spinning wheel. 

With the cooperation from all of you, the government has been making a constant effort to strengthen this message of self-reliance through handicrafts. This is the reason that India has become the world’s largest producer of carpet today. In the last  four and a half years, we have been on top of the world in terms of hand woven carpets. This became possible because of hard work of millions of weavers, designers and traders and also of the policies of the government. 

Friends,

Today, India has more than one-third share of the global carpet market, it means 35%. It is estimated that in the next two-three years it will go up to 50% which means that in the next few years you people will command half of the global trade in carpets. 

We exported carpets worth Rs. 9,000 crore last year. This year we have exported carpets to nearly a hundred countries. This is commendable, but we have to take it further. We have to make efforts to take this figure of export to Rs. 25,000 crore by 2022 when we will complete 75 years of our independence. It’s not just exports, the domestic trade of carpet in the country has gone up by three times in the last four years. The trade which was worth Rs. 500 crore four years ago, that trade has become worth Rs. 1600 crore today. If the country’s carpet market has expanded, there are two reasons for it. First, the middle class in the country has been expanding continuously, and second the facilities which were earlier not available to the casrpet industry, are now available to it. Besides, carpet industry is now getting publicity and efforts are being made to make carpets popular.

Friends,

If we just follow this trend the future of carpet industry and textile sector in the country is bright. Today, India is the only country in the world that produces from smallest to the largest carpet in the world. Not just this, Indian carpets are excellent in terms of arts and crafts. They are also environment friendly. This is the wonder performed by your knowledge and skill because of which this ‘Made in India Carpet’ has emerged as a big brand in the world. 

Friends,

The government is committed to further strengthen this brand. Logistical support is being further strengthened so that there is no lack of facilities for carpet exporters. The work to provide showrooms and go-downs across the country has been done at a fast pace. Not only that, facilities are also being developed in terms of technology and quality. A world class laboratory has been established for testing of carpets in Bhadohi and Srinagar in Indian Institute of Carpet Technology, IICT. Our effort is to make our products zero defect and zero effect, to make products that are flawless and they should also reflect a concern for the environment. 

In addition to this, several facilities have been developed for providing other assistance to the weavers and for marketing of other handicraft products besides carpets. Nine common facility centres, common service centres have been developed  in Varanasi and these centres are benefiting thousands of weavers. 

Friends,

      Besides ensuring quality, several other efforts are being made so that weavers and small traders don’t have to face the fund related problems. Guarantee free loans worth Rs. 50 thousand to Rs. 10 lakh under the Mudra Scheme have been extremely helpful. A provision of margin money of Rs. 10,000 has been made for weavers under Mudra scheme. Now whatever assistance or loan is being given to the weavers, that is being directly credited to their bank accounts in a very short span of time. The identity cards that have been issued to weavers under the ‘Pahchan’ name, have been extremely helpful in eliminating middlemen. 

      Modern looms are also being provided to weavers in Bhadohi-Mirzapur Mega Carpet Cluster and Srinagar Carpet Cluster. Training is also provided to them so that the skill to operate the loom can be developed. Several programmes of skill development are running to improve skills of weavers. 

Friends,

Earlier whenever I talked to weaver brothers and sisters, they would say:  our children no longer want to join this trade. What could be more serious than this? Today, when we are at the top of the world in terms of carpet trade it is  time we encourage the future generations. 

A programme of B. Tech in carpet technology has been started in IICT, Bhadohi. There is a plan to start this kind of programmes in other training institutes in other parts of the country as well. In addition to skilling of weavers, the attention is also being paid for education to them and their children. Seventy-five per cent fee of the children of poor weaver families is being paid by the government. 

Friends,

This government is also committed to convert your craft and labour into a national strength. In the coming days, there will be huge opportunities for the country, for Banaras to showcase this craft. 

The PravasiBhartiyaSammelan, which is going to be organised in Kashi in January next year, will be a huge occasion for publicity. I am confident that the businessmen from the world over will be able to understand our cultural heritage, our handicraft and also a changing Kashi.

Once again I congratulate all of you in advance for DhanTeras, Deepawali and Chhath Puja. Once again I congratulate the Textile Ministry for successfully organising this event and for bringing global respect toKashi and my weaver brothers and sisters. My congratualations are also to all the people associated with export - import for visiting Kashi and for bringing Kashi to the centre of recognition. 

Thank you very much.

                My Cabinet colleague Mahesh Sharma ji, member of the Azad Hind Fauj and the heroic son of the country present among us all, Mr. Lalti Ram Ji, nephew of Subhas Babu,  Chandrakumar Bose, Brigadier R.S. Chikara ji and all the officers of the defence forces, other dignitaries, brothers and sisters. 

This day, 21 October, is a historic one. I consider myself fortunate to be present on this occasion of flag hoisting. This is the same Red Fort where 75 years ago Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had dreamt of a victory parade. Taking oath as the first Prime Minister of the Azad Hind Government, Netaji had announced that the Tricolor would be hoisted with full glory one day at the Red Fort. The Azad Hind Government was the government of undivided India. I congratulate the countrymen for 75 years of Azad Hind Government.

Friends,

Generation after generation gets inspired just by commemorating a person who had such a clear vision, who was ever-ready to put his everything at stake to achieve his goals and who was dedicated only to the nation. Today I salute the parents who gave this country a son like Netaji, who produced brave-hearts who sacrificed their lives for the nation. I bow down to those soldiers and their families who had sacrificed everything for the freedom struggle. I also commemorate all the Indians across the world, who had supported this mission of Netaji with all their efforts and dedication and had made valuable contribution to build an independent, rich and an empowered India.

Friends,

Azad Hind Government was not just a name. Several schemes related to every sector were formulated by the government under the leadership of Netaji. That government had its own bank, currency, postage stamp and intelligence network. I believe it was an extraordinary work to develop such a massive government staying outside the country with limited resources.

Netaji had united the people against a government that was still having a stronghold in a large expanse of the world. If we read the writings of Netaji, we will find that the foundation of showing that extent of valour was already laid during his childhood.

Around the year 1912 that is 106 years ago, a letter written by Subhas Babu to his mother was evidence to the fact that he had tremendous  pain and anguish due to the enslaved India. Mind it; he was barely 15-16 years of age at that time.

The pain that he felt due to the condition of the country owning to so many years of colonial rule was conveyed to his mother through the letter. He had asked his mother a question - 'Mother, will our country continue to have downfall over time? Is there not a single son of the poor Bharat Mata who shall dedicate his life to the service of the motherland by giving up his vested interests? Tell me mother, when will we wake up from the slumber?' The 15-16 year old Subhas Babu had asked this question to his mother.

Brothers and sisters,

He had also answered these questions asked to his mother in the same letter. He had clearly told his mother that it was no longer possible to wait. One could not remain dormant. It was time to wake up from the slumber; shake off laziness and start working. That was Subhas Babu all of 15-16 year old! That intense passion in his heart turned the teenage Subhas Babu to Netaji Subhas. 

Netaji had only one purpose - only one mission - freedom of India and to free India from the shackles of slavery. That was his ideology and workplace.

Friends,

Subhas Babu got the mantra of deciding the aim of his life and dedicating the purpose of his existence from Swami Vivekananda and his teachings - 

आत्मनोमोक्षार्दम जगत हिताय च– that is, one gets salvation only by serving the world. The main basis of his ideology was - service to the people. He had suffered every pain, had overcome every challenge and foiled every conspiracy due to this feeling of service to India.

Brothers and sisters,

Subhas Babu was among the soldiers who transformed themselves with time and took steps keeping their goal in mind. This is the reason why  initially he made efforts within the country along with Mahatma Gandhi by being a member of the Congress and later as per the circumstances he chose the path of armed revolution. This path played a vital role in carrying the freedom movement forward.

Friends,

The nectar of the ideas that were propagated by him across the world was savoured not only by India but also by the other countries. All those countries fighting for freedom used to get inspired from Subhas Chandra Bose. They had realized that nothing was impossible. They too could unite, challenge the British and get their freedom. The great freedom fighter and Bharat Ratna Nelson Mandela had said that during the student movement in South Africa, he considered Subhas Babu to be his leader and hero.

Brothers and sisters,

Today we are celebrating 75 years of Azad Hind Government and four years later we will be celebrating 75 years of Indian independence in 2022. Seventy-five years ago, while taking oath Netaji had promised to build an India where everyone will have equal rights and opportunities. He had promised to build a content and rich India by taking inspiration from the ancient traditions. He had promised for balanced development of the country and development of every region. He had promised to eradicate the 'divide and rule policy' from its roots due to which the country had been enslaved for so long. 

Even after several years of independence, Netaji's dream has not been fulfilled. India has travelled a long way but it still has to touch new heights. In order to achieve this target, today India's 125 crore people are moving ahead with the resolution of a New India; a New India that was also envisaged by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

Today, at a time when the destructive powers are attacking our independence, unity and the sovereignty from outside and within the country, it is the duty of every citizen of India to seek inspiration from Netaji to fight against those powers, defeat them and also to take the pledge of making unstinted contribution to the development of the country.

But friends, one more thing is equally important along with these resolutions - the feeling and expression of nationalism and Indian-ness. During the hearing of Red Fort trials, the soldier of Azad Hind Fauj, Shahnawaz Khan had said that Subhas Chandra Bose was the first person to have ignited the feeling of existence of India in his mind.

He was the first person to show India from the point of view of an Indian. What were those circumstances as a result of which Shahnawaz Khan had said those things? Why was it essential to see India from the point of view of an Indian? We understand these things better when we look at the present condition of the country.

Brothers and sisters,

Remembering his Cambridge days, Subhas Babu had written that we Indians were taught that Europe was a larger form of Great Britain. Therefore, we were habituated to look at Europe through the prism of England. 

Our culture, the great languages, the education system, the structure of the syllabus and the entire system had to bear the brunt of this phenomenon. Today I can confidently assert that if we had the guidance of great personalities like Subhas Babu and Sardar Patel during the decades that followed independence to look after India, then that foreign influence would not have existed and the situation would have been different.

Friends,

It is unfortunate that just to promote one family, all-out attempt had been made to negate the contributions made by several sons of the country like Sardar Patel, Baba Saheb Ambedkar and Netaji. Now our government is trying to change the situation. You all must have got to know that before arriving here, I was attending the programme to dedicate the National Police Memorial. There, I have made an announcement of a National Award in the name of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. 

The brave-hearts and police personnel who engage in disaster management and rescue operations by putting their lives at stake during a natural calamity will be given this honour in the name of Netaji every year. The Police personnel and the soldiers of paramilitary forces will be eligible for this honour.

Friends,

Balanced development across the different categories of the society and the role of every person in nation building are important parts of Netaji's wider vision. The Azad Hind Government formed under the leadership of Netaji had made Eastern India a gateway to India's independence. In April 1944, the Azad Hind Fauj under the leadership of Col. Shaukat Malik had unfurled the Tricolour in Moirang of Manipur. 

It is unfortunate for us that the contribution of such brave-hearts from the Northeast and Eastern India in the freedom movement was not highlighted enough. Even in terms of development, this significant part of the country remained behind. Today I am satisfied that the current government is giving the same importance to Eastern India that once Bose had given and is working in the direction of making this region the country's engine of growth and development.

Brothers and sisters,

I consider myself fortunate to be able to time and again get the opportunity to place Netaji's contributions in front of the country and to walk the path shown by him. Therefore, when I got the invitation to attend this programme, my memories of Subhas Chandra Bose's work during his Gujarat days also returned. 

Friends,

In 2009 when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, we had revived the memories of the historic Haripura Congress Session. We had recreated a similar situation just like in the convention, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel and the people of Gujarat had led a long procession with bullock carts; a similar scene was recreated in 2009 and the history was re-lived. Even though it was the convention of Congress, it was an important chapter in the history and we re-lived it.

Friends,

The people who had laid down their lives for freedom were fortunate to have got that opportunity. People like us who didn't get the opportunity still have an option of living for the nation and dedicating their lives for its development. We have gained Swaraj after a lot of sacrifices. Now we the 125 crore Indians have the responsibility of maintaining the Swaraj with good governance. Netaji had said - you have to gain independence from the strength of the weapons and at the cost of your blood. After independence, you have to make a standing army for the country to always safeguard this freedom. 

Today I can assert that India is moving towards the formation of an army of Subhas Bose's dreams. Enthusiasm and zeal have always been a part of our military traditions. Now, modern technology and modern weapons are being added to it. Our military strength has always been for self-defence and will always remain so. We never had any greed for other's land. Even historically it was the same. However, if anyone challenges India's sovereignty, India will retaliate with double the power.

Friends,

Several initiatives have been taken in the last four years to strengthen the army. The best technology around the world is being made a part of the Indian army. Be it improvement of the capability of the army or making the lives of these valiant soldiers easier - this government has the courage to take robust decisions and it will remain the same in the future as well. It is our government that took the decisions ranging from undertaking the surgical strike to the decision of making the files related to Netaji public. Several ex-servicemen present here are witness to the fact that it was our government that fulfilled the several decades old demand for One Rank One Pension as per the promise.

Moreover, the arrear of about Rs.11000 crores was given to the retired army personnel that benefitted lakhs of army men. Besides, as per the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission, there has been an increase in their pension amount after its implementation. That means my soldier brothers have received a double bonanza on their pensions.

Several such initiatives have been taken in the past for making the lives of the soldiers better. Besides, the work on the National War Museum is in the last phase. This is to ensure that the future generations get to know about the valour of the soldiers.

Friends,

Tomorrow i.e. on 22 October, the Jhansi regiment will complete 75 years. The foundation of including women in the Armed Forces for their equal participation was laid by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. The country's first all-women military regiment was the result of Subhas Babu's unfaltering belief towards India's rich traditions. He had received the guard of honour from the women soldiers despite all the opposition.

I can assert with pride that this government has taken forward the work started 75 years ago by Netaji in true sense. On 15th August this year, I had made an announcement from the Red Fort - I had said that the women officers appointed through the Short Service Commission in the Armed Forces would be given permanent commission through a transparent selection process just like their male counterpart.

Friends,

This is an extension of government's efforts that are being taken for the past four years. In March 2016, a decision was taken to include women as pilots in the Navy. Just a few days ago, the Indian Navy's 6 brave women officers have conquered the sea and have showcased the women power to the world. Besides, the first female fighter pilot of the country emerged during the tenure of this government.

I am also glad that for the first time after independence, the responsibility of maintaining and strengthening India's armed forces is in the hands of a woman Raksha Mantri  - Sitharaman ji.

 

Friends,

Due to your cooperation and the dedication and skills of the armed forces today the country is completely secured and capable and is rapidly moving towards the path of development and achieving its targets.

Once again, I heartily congratulate you all, the 125 crore Indians on this important occasion. May our journey of unity, integrity and self-confidence steadily progresses with the blessings of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose ji.

Say aloud with me -

Victory to Mother India!

Victory to Mother India!

Victory to Mother India!

Vande Mataram!

Vande Mataram!

Vande Mataram!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, addressed via video conference, the India Carpet Expo at Varanasi. 

Welcoming guests from India and abroad, the Prime Minister noted that this is the first time that the India Carpet Expo is being organized at the Deendayal Hastkala Sankul, in Varanasi. He mentioned Varanasi, Bhadohi and Mirzapur as important centres of the carpet industry. He spoke of efforts being made to encourage handicrafts, small and medium industries. 

The Prime Minister said that India has a long tradition of handicrafts, and Varanasi has played a key role in this regard. In this context, he mentioned the great saint poet, Kabir, who also belonged to the same region. 

He said handicrafts have been a source of inspiration, in the freedom struggle, and for self-reliance. In this context, the Prime Minister mentioned Mahatma Gandhi, Satyagraha, and the Charkha. 

The Prime Minister said that India is today the biggest producer of carpets, and has about 35 percent of the global marketshare. He spoke of the impressive export performance of this sector. He said the rising middle class, and the support provided to the carpet industry are two key factors behind the growth in this sector. He appreciated the skills of the carpet makers, which have made the “Made in India carpet” a big brand. He spoke of the logistic support being provided to carpet exporters, and the creation of world class laboratories to ensure quality. He also spoke of other facilitation measures, including modern looms and credit facilities being made available to the sector. 

The Prime Minister asserted that the Union Government is committed to ensuring that the skill and hard work of the carpet makers, becomes one of the strengths of the nation.

                Honorable former Vice Prime Minister of our country, respected Lal Krishna Advani Ji, union home minister Shri Rajnath Singh Ji, other colleagues in the council of ministers, my colleagues in the parliament, award winners ofpolice forces, the brave sons who witnessed the Hot Spring Incident, family members of the martyrs present here and other dignitaries and my dear brother and sisters,

There are several moments in the lives of all of us when we must bow down to the valour. We are full of pride but we also feel a tide of emotions inside us. For me, this moment is similar to that. 

I respectfully bow down to every single person dedicated to the security of the country; I respectfully bow down to the families of martyrs present here on the occasion of Police Memorial Day. Today is the day to remember the supreme sacrifices made by you people in addition to the services rendered by you people which has been a tradition ofour police and paramilitary forces. 

Police Memorial Day is also an occasion to remember the stories of those brave hearts of police forces who discharged the duties as the first line of defense on the snow clad mountains of Ladakh and had laid down their lives. Today is also an occasion to remember those thousands of martyrs of police forces who have laid down their lives, who laid down everything, their youth and their life by following the path of duty since independence to till date. I bow down to every such brave man and women. I bow down to all of you, I bow down to the family of every martyrs, several family members of them are also present here, those who have made such a big sacrifice for the country. 

Friends,

I am fortunate that I got the opportunity to dedicate National Police Memorial, which is a symbol of immortal stories of service and dedication to the nation. The central structure built in this memorial is a symbol of every policeman’s capability, valor, service and emotions. 

The water flowing beneath the rock is a symbol of ever flowing harmony in our society. The wall of valor contains the names of those 34,844 police personnel who have made supreme sacrifice in different states of the country while fighting separate challenges. 

I am confident that everything kept in this newly constructed memorial, every single memory will inspire every citizen, will inspire our young colleagues, it will inspire the future of our country – our children - about the glorious history of our police and paramilitary forces. 

The way you people remain steadfast on the path of your duties throughout day and night and without being tired when you people man your posts in all the seasons, in summers, in winter, in rainy season, in snow and on every festival and always, similarly the same feelings reflects inside us just by having a glance of this memorial. 

Friends,

This is the testimony of your noble-mindedness that the elements who want to disrupt the peace of the country end up being disappointed. You people have foiled several attempts to create an atmosphere of fear and insecurity in the country. This kind of conspiracies, details of which are not disclosed to public, this kind of bravery for which you people are never appreciated publicly, every moment of the country and its citizens that passes peacefully, it is possible only due to this kind of sense and devotion of you people towards the duty. 

Friends,

Today is the occasion to remember every Jawan of the country who is fighting terrorism to establish peace and stability in Jammu & Kashmir. I would say the same thing to every Jawan who is deployed in Naxal affected districts of the country that you people are doing excellent work, and you people are marching ahead at a fast pace towards restoring the peace. 

If the numbers of Naxal affected districts are coming down today, if more and more numbers of youth of those areas are joining the mainstream then the efforts made by you people have played key role in it. Today, we are feeling the valor and sacrifices made by our colleagues in the North East. Your contribution is there in the development of our North East which is becoming a symbol of peace and prosperity. 

Friends,

Today is also an occasion to remember those Jawans whose service is not discussed much, who are dedicated for disaster management, who provide relief work at the time of any mishappening or natural disaster. 

Today, I would like to tell the countrymen that if any natural calamity strikes any place then in the last few years you people would have seen that the Jawans, wearing the uniforms with NDRF and SDRF written on it, have been working hard day and night to save the lives of people. 

However, the country is not aware that these are the same Jawans of our police forces wearing the Khaki uniform. May the country never forget their courage, their dedication and service! Many people don’t even know that who are the people that take charge of relief and rescue work after collapse of a building, or when a boat tragedy occurs, or when there is a fire and or when there is an accident inside the train. Today, I sincerely congratulate all of you, to all the colleagues who have been deployed to every police post, to every police station in every state of the country, to those who have been dedicated in the security of every national asset, on the occasion of this commemoration day. 

Friends,

This memorial is dedicated to the service and valor but it also reflects the government’s commitment. And the basis for which is the respect for every Indian associated with the national security which is a symbol of the country and nation building. Today, I am proud of the National Police Memorial but I also have a few questions. Why 70 years since independence have passed in accepting the need for this police memorial? The Hot Spring Incident, which is behind the celebration of Police Day, even that incident too occurred 60 years ago. Then why wait for so many years? 

Friends,

The idea for this memorial dedicated to the police forces of the country first occurred 20-25 years ago. Then government had approved it, however, the first step to make it a reality on the ground was taken by the government of AtalBihar Vajpayee Jiand the then home minister respected Advani Ji had also laid a foundation stone for it in 2002. Today, Advani Ji himself is present here and he is proud of realisation of his dream. However, he is very well aware that how the work could not progress after laying of foundation stone by him. 

I accept that the work was stalled for a few years due to some laws, however, if this was the intent of the previous government and if they had made a genuine attempt then this memorial would have been constructed several years ago. However, the previous government allowed the dust to settle on the stone installed by Advani Ji. 

In 2014, when NDA government came to power once again then we allocated the fund and today this grand building is being dedicated to the nation. Perhaps, God has chosen me, God has selected me for doing such a noble thing. This is the style of work of our government, today, a culture to achieve the target within time has been developed. 

You people would remember it that Ambedkar International Centre was dedicated to the people here in Delhi. The discussion for that memorial had also stared around 1992, however, its file was gathering dust for two decades. The file was retrieved after formation of this government. The foundation was laid for the centre and it was dedicated to the nation as well. Similarly, the work to construct a national memorial at Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s residence at 26, Alipur road was started during the time of AtalJi. However, the work on project was stopped after his government went out of power. Foundation stone for that was laid after formation of our government and I got the good opportunity to dedicate that memorial to public in April this year. I am happy that this grand memorial has been inspiring the world today.

Friends,

Sometimes, I grapple with very serious questions in my mind that what is the reason behind the previous government’s contemptuous attitude towards those people who sacrificed everything for the country and who showed the bravery for the country and who made the supreme sacrifice for the country. This has never been part of our tradition and culture. We are the people who sacrificed everything for the glory of the country despite being starving for the food. 

I am proud that in the last four years we have again succeeded in establishing that tradition where the respect for every such individual has been ensured who has contributed to the nation building and who is a guardian of nation building. 

Today, the public dedication of national police memorial is a part of the series of that tradition. Exactly 10 days from today, I will get the opportunity to dedicate the sky-high statue of Sardar Bhai Patel at Kewadia in Gujarat on October 31. The world’s tallest statue will reflect the contribution made by Sardar Saheb for the country.

Friends,

I believe that this memorial should not just become a place for visit but it should be developed as a mean that imparts the knowledge about the country’s tradition and glory to the next generation; that provides the information about the bravery of police forces. I would suggest that the statute of every martyr who worked hard and made sacrifices for our country should be installed in those schools where they have studied. When our students will see the statues of our brave hearts then they will get a new inspiration. 

Friends,

We should create such kind of atmosphere that if any Jawan of police, paramilitary or military passes from a place then there should be a natural respect for him. This police memorial, the statues of martyrs and their stories are taking us in that direction. Today, on this occasion, I would like to make an important and historic announcement before you people. 

Friends,

The Jawans of our police and paramilitary are the first one to respond in case of any tragedy or natural calamity in our country. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) can’t even be imagined without them. They risk their lives for saving other’s lives during the time of emergency. However, it is also true that we don’t pay attention on this thing during those difficult times. They go back to their place of posting or to their battalions after the return of normalcy. Today, I am announcing a new honor for those brave hearts dedicated to the service of saving other’s lives during the disaster management. 

This award will be declared on the name of valiant son of mother India Neta Ji Subhash Chandra Bose on 23rd January every year on the occasion of his birth anniversary. Subhash Babu’s name, who made the impossible possible, who played an important role in forcing the British to leave India, will make the award more glorious. It’s a matter of even more pride that 75 years of the foundation of Azad Hind Sarkar established by him is being completed today. 

Brothers and sisters,

In addition to the glorious tradition and spectacular past of valour, bravery and sacrifice, I would like to draw your attention to the challenges of future. 

Today, technology has completely revolutionized the life. It’s obvious that it also impacts the way crime is being committed. Criminals are using technology as a weapon. Rumours and cyber crime are emerging as a big challenge. In such a situation, policing apparatus has to include technology and innovation in its functioning in addition to maintaining better coordination with other agencies. 

Friends,

In this direction, several worthwhile efforts have also been made in the country. Police have been providing the facility of filing FIR or social media or online in several states of the country. Traffic related problems are also being handled through social media. It’s a commendable step and we have to take them to such a level that for routine complaints and for minor verification no one needs to come to a police station. 

Friends,

All of you are aware that just last year the government took a major initiative for police reforms. MPF or Modernisation of Police Schemes, it means that nearly Rs. 45,000 are being spent on the police infrastructure, technology or training by 2019-20. Under this scheme, several works of modernizationare being undertaken like technology communication and modernization of systems so that police force can move at a fast pace with modern weapons. Besides, work is going on a scheme for creating a national database of crime and criminals by integrating police stations. The efforts are being made to integrate this database with other systems of administration of justice like forensic labs and courts. 

The government has been trying to provide smart technology to every state, every city for improving our law and order and traffic management. However, technology can never substitute for human sensitivities. This is the reason that the role of every member of police force is very important. You people are the first line of defence of the oppressed, persecuted, exploited section of the society. You are the first friend who is the most sought after in the difficult times. Therefore, you do have a responsibility in establishing the law and order but you also have a responsibility of understanding the grievances of people in a sensible manner and wiping off their tears. 

This bond between the police and society will become even stronger by offering a glass of cold water, and by speaking two words of love to every persecuted and exploited person who comes to a police station. The system of cooperation and public participation will become even strong when this bond becomes stronger. It will also help all of you in a big manner in controlling the crime with the help of society. I firmly believe in this thing.

In the end, once again I congratulate all of you for this modern National Police Memorial on the occasion of Police Commemoration Day. 

I would like to especially urge to the chief ministers of all the states that they should visit the memorial by making a programme and pay tribute to these police personnel. 

And they should specially honor those people who are in their state’s list. They must visit the memorial, they should plan it with the help of officers. I conclude my speech by bowing down to your duty and dedication and by conveying my best wishes for the upcoming festivals to these families of policemen. 

Thank you very much to all of you.

                Governor of Maharashtra Mr. Vidyasagar Rao Ji, Chief Minister of Maharashtra Shri Devendra ji, Speaker of the Assembly Haribabu Ji, my Cabinet colleague Subhash Bhamre ji, Chairman of Shri Sai Baba Sansthan Trust Mr. Suresh Haware Ji, all the ministers of Maharashtra, all my Parliamentary colleagues, MLAs of Maharashtra and my dear brothers and sisters who are present here in large numbers. My best wishes to the entire Maharashtra, the people of India, for Vijayadashami and Dussehra.

Every year we try to celebrate festivities with our close and loved ones. Even I try to celebrate every festival with my countrymen. With these feelings, today I got the opportunity to be present amongst you. You all have come to shower your blessings on me in such large numbers on the auspicious occasion of Dussehra. I can see that there is no space under the tent. Half of the people are standing out in the sun. This bond and closeness constantly provides me with strength and your love and affection energizes and revitalizes me. 

Friends,

Apart from Dussehra, today we are witnessing another auspicious occasion in this holy land of Shirdi. This day also marks the centenary of the completion of Saibaba's Samadhi. Just a few moments ago, I had got the opportunity to seek Saibaba's blessings. Whenever I get the opportunity to seek the blessings of Lord Saibaba, like countless devotees the same feeling of dedicating myself for the welfare of the people emanates from within me.

Brothers and sisters,

In every nook and corner of Shirdi lie the mantra and the teachings of Saibaba. Whenever we talk of service to the people, sacrifice and penance, everyone presents the example of Shirdi. Shirdi is the town of Tatya Patil ji. It is the town of Dada Kote Patil. This soil has produced great personalities like Madhavrao Deshpande and Mhalsapati. Kashiram Shimpi and Appa Jagle served Saibaba till his last breath. Who can ever forget Konda ji, Gava ji and Tukaram ji. I salute the great sons of this sacred soil.

Brothers and sisters,

According to Saibaba's mantra, everyone's god is one. These four words from the Sai had become the thread of society's unity. Sai belonged to the society and the society belonged to Sai. Sai had told some ways of social service and I am glad that Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust is relentlessly serving the society by walking the path shown by Saibaba. Your efforts in the direction of empowerment through education, transformation through spirituality or spreading the message of social harmony in the society are indeed commendable.

Even today, many projects related to faith, spirituality and development have started in this soil. And I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra as there cannot be any place better than this for carrying out the grand welfare scheme for the poor. What can be a greater source of gratification than sitting at the feet of Saibaba and working for the poor? Therefore, I congratulate the government of Maharashtra. I am delighted to be present here on the occasion of Bhumipujan of the new complex constructed for the devotees. The foundation stone of Saibaba English medium school Kanya Vidyalaya and college is being laid on this very day. I am confident that the upcoming Sai Knowledge Park related to the life and philosophy of Sai will help the people to understand the teachings of Sai in a better and lucid way. 

Friends,

The work on a 10 MW solar unit has also begun today. This will increase the resources of the institute. The institute will have a major share in clean energy. In a way, it is a gift on behalf of the Sai Trust to thousands of devotees on the occasion of Vijayadashami.

Friends,

Usually Indians make purchases of several things like houses, cars and jewellery in the period between Navratri and Deepavali. People spend according to their capacity and gift their families. I am glad that on this auspicious occasion of Dussehra, I have got the opportunity of handing over houses to 2.5 lakh brothers and sisters of Maharashtra.

It has always been the dream of my brothers and sisters to have a house of their own. I believe that there cannot be a greater service on my part than serving those poor brothers and sisters of mine by arranging for the house warming ceremony for those families on the occasion of Dussehra. My best wishes to you all for the new houses built under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and for this auspicious occasion in your lives. These new houses symbolize your dreams. These also add a new dimension to your aspirations. Now your lives and the lives of your children have moved forward on the path of a positive change. It is a major first step towards victory over poverty.

Friends,

Owning a house makes life easier and develops an enthusiasm for fighting against poverty. A sense of respect is associated with it. Keeping this in mind, we have decided to work in the direction of providing a house to every homeless family by 2022 that marks 75 years of Indian independence.

I am glad that we are almost halfway through in such a short span of time. Brothers and sisters, whether the person belongs to a poor family or a middle class family, the government has made serious attempts in the last four years in pulling them out of slums and rented accommodations and providing them with their own houses. Efforts were also made before, but unfortunately their motive was to glorify and publicize the name of one family by providing houses to the poor instead of empowering them. Their motive was to create a vote bank. No thought was given to the fact that the house should be of good quality with amenities like electricity, toilet, water, and gas connection. No one would give any attention to those things if political interests were central to any scheme. Instead of political interests, if only the welfare of the poor is the focus of a scheme then it inspires to make his life easier. Then the work progresses at an accelerated rate. This is a living example in front of the nation.

Friends,

The previous government had built only 25 lakh houses in the last four years of their regime. They built only 25 lakh houses in 4 years. How many? What happened? Say aloud. How many houses in 4 years? They built 25 lakh houses in 4 years; whereas our BJP-led government has built 1 crore 25 lakh houses within four years after getting elected to the centre. They had constructed 25 lakh houses in 4 years while we have constructed 1 crore 25 lakh in 4 years. If the same government existed now, it would have taken 20 years for them for constructing these many houses. You too would have had to wait for 20 years for the houses. This is an example of how a government working at a fast pace delivers quickly to the poor. And just see, everything is the same; the same medium, the same resources and the same people; but if the work is done with an expression of service to the poor with an honest intention, then results are quick to follow.

Brothers and sisters,

Earlier, the previous government used to take 18 months or 1.5 years to build one house while this government takes less than 12 months to build a house. Besides shortening the time period, the size of the house has also increased. Moreover, the financial assistance provided by the government for the construction of houses has been increased from Rs.70 thousand to Rs.1 lakh 20 thousand. Most importantly, the funds get directly deposited to the beneficiary's bank account. And the selection of the beneficiaries has been done in a scientific and transparent manner. Moreover, care is being taken to ensure that the houses are durable with toilets and all the amenities.

Once again I congratulate the beneficiaries from the bottom of my heart for getting their houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. And today I got the opportunity to interact with some of the families from different districts. No one can guess the elation that I feel on looking at the self-confidence and happiness on the faces of those sisters. The life becomes blessed on seeing the happiness on the faces of the poor families. This gives a new energy to work. With the blessings that I received from the sisters, I would like to reiterate the resolution that we will devote our lives to your service every moment.

Brothers and sisters,

The campaign of connecting every house of the country to toilets is in the final phase. Maharashtra has done a commendable job in this direction. You all and the entire Maharashtra have declared Maharashtra to be Open Defection Free. My heartiest congratulations to the state's 11 crore people. This will not only keep the streets and villages of Maharashtra clean but will also protect the lives of the children belonging to the poor farmer families by preventing several diseases like diarrhoea. 

Friends,

When it comes to the lives and the health of the poor, everyone around the world is talking about Ayushman Bharat i.e. Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY). Under this scheme, about 50 crore people will get free treatment for serious diseases.

The benefits of this scheme are also reaching lakhs of families in Maharashtra. Not even a month has passed since its launch, and till date about 1 lakh patients throughout the country have availed the benefits of this scheme. While someone has been treated for his stone, someone else has been treated for his tumour under this scheme. Someone's medical expenses of Rs.50 thousand have been met while yet another person's medical expenses of Rs.3 lakhs have been met.

Friends,

So far, the claim amount given is on an average Rs.20 thousand per person. Just imagine, earlier the poor had to shell out thousands of rupees from his pocket which was difficult for him. So he avoided going to the hospital. Now the government is standing behind the poor;   so that they need not worry about money and get them treated first. 

Friends,

Due to the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a new framework of modern medical infrastructure has been developed. The possibility of setting up many new hospitals especially in tier 2 and tier 3 cities have opened up. This will open up employment opportunities for lakhs of youngsters across the country.

Brothers and sisters,

The government is working with the goal of ensuring an easy and a satisfactory life for every section of the society. As per my information, this time Varun devta has not been kind to the state; rainfall has been scanty in some parts of Maharashtra. Rest assured that under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana you will get relief very soon. Besides, the central government is walking hand in hand with the Maharashtra government for the initiatives taken by it.

Brothers and sisters,

The government is working towards completing the stalled projects under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana to pull the farmers of the country out of the water problem. Under this, work is underway for a number of major projects in Maharashtra. The Maharashtra government has also made an unprecedented effort to tackle water scarcity through its Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan. It is a matter of gratification that this campaign has made 16000 villages of this state drought-free and the work of making 9000 additional villages drought-free is progressing at a rapid pace.

I would like to praise the people of Maharashtra also for successfully carrying out the de-siltation campaign of cleaning the irrigation tanks. It is not an easy job to clean 9 crore cubic metre of silt from the irrigation tanks. However, you have shown the way to the entire country by accomplishing this unprecedented task through public participation. I was told that if the same task was entrusted to a contractor, it would have cost more than Rs.600 crores; but you have done this job by pulling out all the stops.

Friends,

We are relentlessly working to ensure that the farmers get fair price for their crops even during bumper production. It is our government that fulfilled the age-old demand related to MSP. The government has set the profit at 50% more than the cost price for 21 Rabi and Kharif crops including sugarcane. This historic decision will ensure an income of more than thousands of crores of rupees to the farmers this year.

Friends,

Besides the agricultural sector, the government is also focusing upon the tourism sector. Maharashtra has pilgrimage centres like Shirdi on one hand as well as attractive destinations like Ajanta and Ellora that attract tourists from across the world. We have started a massive campaign to connect the employment opportunities of youngsters with devotion, spirituality and history.

The tourist circuits throughout the country are being linked. Amenities are being developed in those places. Last time when our honourable President had visited Shirdi to inaugurate the centenary functions, he had launched one Airport. I was told that in the future there will be a hike in the number of flights that are operating from here so that every devotee of Sai from within the country and abroad can easily come here.

Brothers and sisters,

The land of Maharashtra has always taught the lessons of social harmony to the country. Great personalities like Shivaji, Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar ji or the Respected Mahatma Jyotiba Phule had established the values of equality and unity and believed that these values held the strength of the society. We need to always keep in mind the lessons taught by these great saintly men and to defeat every evil and power that tends to divide the society for its selfish interests. It is easy to divide but very difficult to unite. We need to strengthen the uniting power and defeat the power that is dividing us. We need to take the vow of 'Sabka Sath Sabka vikas' and 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat' on this Vijayadashami. Therefore, I would like to urge you all to move ahead with this message and walk the path of this message. We should walk the path shown by Saibaba. I am extremely elated.

 

Friends,

I am at a holy place today and attending the valedictory function of the centenary celebrations. On 31st October, your state government will complete four years. I congratulate Devendra Fadnavis ji and his entire team in advance. I hope that you will continue to serve the people of Maharashtra with all your strength like this. And I hope that you keep receiving the blessings of every person of the state.

With this belief once again I congratulate all the families that have received their dream houses today. I hope that the new houses become a medium of fulfilling your dreams; may you progress in life and your children touch new heights of success. With this expectation I end my speech. I express my gratitude to Shri Sai Trust for inviting me here on this auspicious occasion and giving me the opportunity to serve. May all the upcoming festivals bring happiness to your lives! With these good wishes, I thank you all.

Thank you!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, visited Shirdi, in Maharashtra, today.

At a public meeting, he unveiled the plaque to mark the laying of foundation stone of various development works of Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust. He also released a silver coin to commemorate the Centenary year of Shri Saibaba Samadhi.

Shri Narendra Modi handed over keys to mark the Grihapravesh of Prime Minister Awas Yojana- Grameen (PMAY-G) beneficiaries in Maharashtra. He also interacted with beneficiaries from various districts in Maharashtra like Satara, Latur, Nandurbar, Amaravati, Thane, Solapur, Nagpur through video conference. The beneficiaries, mostly women, thanked the Prime Minister for their new good quality houses, easy availability of credit and corruption free processes associated with PMAY-G scheme. Prime Minister later addressed the gathering.

Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister extended Dussehra greetings to all Indians. He said that being amongst people during the auspicious occasion of Dussehra gives him energy and renewed vigour to work for the betterment of the country.

Recalling the contributions of Shri Saibaba to the society, Prime Minister said that his teachings give us the mantra to build a strong unified society and to serve humanity with love. He added that Shirdi is always considered as an epitome of public service. He expressed happiness that Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust is following the path laid down by Saibaba. He also complimented the contributions of the trust in empowering the society through education and in transforming thoughts through spiritual teachings.

Expressing happiness in handing over new houses to over 2 lakh beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Grameen (PMAY-G) on occasion of Dussehra, Prime Minister said that it is a big step towards the fight against poverty. Underlining the efforts of Government in ensuring ‘Housing for All’ by 2022, Prime Minister said that in the last four years, Government has built over 1.25 crore houses. He said that the Government is also ensuring that the every house built is not only of good quality but also has a toilet, gas connection and electricity.

Addressing the gathering, Prime Minister congratulated the people of Maharashtra for making the state Open Defecation Free. He also commended the efforts of the Maharashtra Government towards Swacchh Bharat activities. In this context, Prime Minister spoke about Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) and said that around one lakh people have benefited from the scheme so far. He added that under PMJAY, modern medical infrastructure is getting readied.

Prime Minister also underlined the efforts taken by the Government to deal with drought faced by Maharashtra. In this context, he mentioned Krishi Sinchai Yojana and Fazal Bima Yojana and appreciated the Jalyukt Shivir Abhiyan of Maharashtra Government. He also commended the people’s participation in the de-siltation of irrigation canals undertaken by the Maharashtra Government. 

Remembering the teachings of B R Ambedkar, Jyotirao Phule and Chattrapati Shivaji, Prime Minister asked the countrymen to follow their noble ideals and teachings and work towards creating a strong undivided society. He urged the people to work towards attaining Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Ek Bharat Shresht Bharat.

Earlier in the day, Prime Minister visited the Shri Saibaba Samadhi Temple Complex and offered prayers. He also attended the valedictory function of centenary celebration of Shri Saibaba.

                The President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena called Prime Minister Modi on telephone today.  

The President of Sri Lanka stated that he categorically rejected the reports in sections of media about him alluding to the involvement of India in any manner whatsoever in an alleged plot to assassinate the President and a former Defence Secretary of Sri Lanka. 

He mentioned that the mischievous and malafide reports were utterly baseless and false, and seemed intended to create misunderstanding between the two leaders as well as damage the cordial relations between the two friendly neighbours. 

The President apprised the Prime Minister of the urgent steps taken by him personally and the Government of Sri Lanka to publicly reject these reports. In this context, he also recalled his meeting with the High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka today morning.    

The President also stated that he regards the Prime Minister as a true friend of Sri Lanka, as also a close personal friend.  He stressed that he greatly valued the mutually beneficial ties between India and Sri Lanka, and remained steadfast to work with the Prime Minister for futher strengtheing them.

The Prime Minister appreciated the prompt steps taken by the President and his Government to firmly refute the malicious reports by publicly clarifying the matters. He also reiterated India’s emphasis on ‘neighbourhood first’ policy and the priority the Government of India and he personally attach to developing even stronger all-round cooperation between the two countries.

CEOs and Experts from the Oil and Gas sector, from both India and abroad, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi today. 

The gathering included Ministers from Saudi Arabia and UAE, and CEOs and experts from organisations including Saudi ARAMCO, ADNOC, BP, Rosneft, IHS Markit, Pioneer Natural Resources Company, Emerson Electric Company, Tellurian, Mubadala Investment Company, Schlumberger Ltd., Wood Mackenzie, World Bank, International Energy Agency (IEA), NIPFP, Brookings India and various Indian companies involved in both upstream and downstream operations. 

Union Ministers Shri Arun Jaitley and Shri Dharmendra Pradhan; Vice-Chairman NITI Aayog Dr. Rajiv Kumar and senior officials from the Union Government and NITI Aayog were also present at the interaction. 

During the interaction global CEOs and Experts appreciated the steps taken by the Union Government over the last four years, for ease of doing business, and specifically in the energy sector in India. The experts made a special mention of India’s competitive ranking from the upstream investment point of view which has gone up from 56 to 44. Subjects such as expansion of oil and gas infrastructure in India; enhancing exploration and production; potential in solar energy and biofuels; and the Union Government’s  holistic approach to the energy sector came up for discussion. The experts appreciated the unique initiative of this kind of a dialogue, which brings various stakeholders together on policy matters. 

Interacting with the global leaders of the energy sector, Prime Minister highlighted the significant positioning of India in the oil and gas market. He noted that the oil market is producer driven; and both the quantity and prices are determined by the oil producing countries. Though there is enough production, the unique features of marketing in the oil sector have pushed up the oil prices.  Prime Minister Modi made a strong case for a partnership between the producers and consumers, in the oil market, as it exists in other markets. This will help stabilise the global economy which is on path of recovery.

Mr. Modi drew attention of the experts on certain key policy issues relevant to India. Firstly, he highlighted that the consuming countries, due to rising crude oil prices, face many other economic challenges including serious resource crunch.  The cooperation of the oil producing countries would be very critical to bridge this gap.  He appealed to oil producing countries to channel their investible surplus to pursue commercial exploitation in oil sector in the developing countries. Secondly, he spoke of higher acreage under exploration and sought cooperation of the developed countries both in terms of technology and extension of coverage. Thirdly, he sought the role of private participation in the distribution of gas sector. Talking of technology, he appealed for assistance in areas where high pressure and high temperature technology applications are relevant to commercial exploitation of natural gas. Lastly and importantly, he requested for review of payment terms so as to provide temporary relief to the local currency.

Prime Minister also spoke about the various policy initiatives and developmental measures undertaken by his Government in the sector.  He highlighted the liberalisation in gas pricing and marketing which has been particularly in deep waters and requiring technology for high pressure high temperature exploitation. He made a mention of open acreage licensing policy, early monetisation of coal bed methane, incentives for discovery of small fields and seismic survey at a national level. Talking of ongoing commercial exploitation, he made a special mention of extension of production sharing contracts.

                 My cabinet colleagues on stage Shri Rajnath Singh ji and Shri Manoj Sinha ji, NHRC Chairperson Justice H.L. Dattu Ji, members of the Commission, all the dignitaries present here, ladies and gentlemen!

The National Human Rights Commission has completed 25 years today. I congratulate you and every citizen of the country for reaching this important milestone. I am extremely delighted to be with you all on this significant occasion.

Friends,

The National Human Rights Commission has given a direction to nation building by being the voice of the common man, the deprived section of the society and the oppressed class for the past two and a half decades. The international human rights institutions have always conferred 'A' status on you for the role that you have played by walking the path of law and justice.

Friends,

Protection of human rights is an essential part of our culture. Our tradition always recognizes a person's life sustaining equality and respect for dignity. The shloka that was uttered at the outset has been reiterated in detail by Rajnath ji - the expression of 'sarve bhavantu Sukhinaha' has always been embedded in our traditions.

The freedom movements during the colonial period also played a crucial role. After independence a strong mechanism was developed to preserve these ideals. We have a three-tier governance system, an independent and a fair judicial system, active media and a proactive civil society. There are also several institutions like NHRC, commissions and tribunals to secure the rights. Our system is grateful to all those institutions that are committed to the protection of rights of every citizen of the country including the poor, women, children, the oppressed and the deprived classes and the tribal communities. The Panchayati Raj system or the systems of local bodies play a vital role in securing human rights. These institutions are playing a vital role in ensuring the implementation of welfare schemes and delivery of benefits of development to the common people. These institutions make a crucial contribution to empower women and the deprived section of the society. 

Friends,

This dedication towards human rights had rescued the nation from a grave adversary in the 70s decade. During the dark period of emergency, the right to life itself was snatched away, let alone the other rights. Thousands and lakhs of people who had raised their voices against the then government were put behind the bars during that period. But the Indians have regained this important aspect of their lives - human rights - with their own efforts. I salute the people and the institutions that have re-established the nobility of the human rights, the fundamental rights on this auspicious occasion today.

Friends,

Human Rights should not merely be a slogan but our cultural values and the basis of our democracy. I believe that serious attempts were made to raise the dignity of the oppressed, the poor, the deprived and the exploited section of our society during the last four and a half years. This is a great achievement. Whatever initiatives, campaigns and the schemes were formulated during the last four years, the basic aim of those was this. And that has been achieved. 

The focus of the government is on the fact that the common man can fulfill his basic necessities not by the power of his own pocket but naturally by his identity as an Indian. Our government considers the mantra of 'sabka sath sabka vikas' as a medium to serve people. This in itself guarantees the protection of human rights.

Friends,

You are well aware of the fact that there used to be several questions regarding daughters' right to life. Considering the daughters unwanted, the distorted mentality of killing them in the womb was prevalent among some narrow-minded people of the society. 

Today I can say with immense pride that due to the 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' campaign, there has been a huge increase in the number of daughters in many states including Haryana and Rajasthan. Several Innocents have got the right to life. Life is not just about breathing-in and breathing-out but the honour of a person is equally important.

I am glad that today the word 'Divyang' conveys respect and honour to some Indians. Moreover, to make their lives easier, several steps are being taken to make special arrangements in public buildings, airports, railway stations etc. under the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.

The poor people are compelled to sleep under the sky, in dilapidated slums and have to tolerate the harsh climate.  This is also breach of rights of the poor.

To pull the poor out of this situation, efforts are going on to provide a house to every homeless poor under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. And it is a dream that by 2022 that will mark 75 years of Indian independence, every homeless Indian should have a house. Till date more than 1.25 crore brothers and sisters have received the keys of their houses.

Friends,

Besides houses, free gas connections are also being given to the poor under the Ujjwala Yojana. This is not only a welfare scheme but also a medium through which people can lead their lives with pride and equality. Today about 5.5 crore mothers and sisters of the country have got their rights to clean and smoke-free kitchens. These families were deprived of the right for so long because they couldn't afford it; their pockets were empty.

Moreover, crores of families were living in darkness despite a well-established system of electricity and a system of power generation. This was only because they were poor and lived in remote areas. I am glad that electricity has now reached those 18,000 villages that were compelled to live without electricity in 18th century -like conditions even after so many years of independence. 

Moreover, under 'Saubhagya Yojana', the houses of more than 1.5 crore families have been illuminated within 10-11 months.

Friends,

Apart from darkness, open defecation was also a hindrance to a dignified life. The poor remained tight-lipped about the indignation that he had to undergo due to lack of toilets. It was a breach of right to live with dignity especially for crores of sisters and mothers. It in fact raised a serious question about their right to life. More than 9.5 crore toilets that have been constructed in the cities and villages of the country in the last four years have ensured my poor brothers and sisters the right to live with cleanliness and dignity. And the government of Uttar Pradesh has named toilets as 'Izzatghar' (abode of dignity). Every toilet has this caption of 'Izzatghar'.

One more right associated with the health of the poor has been conferred very recently and Shri Rajnath Singh ji had mentioned about that - the PMJAY i.e. the Ayushman Bharat Yojana. You are daily getting the proof of its enormity. The news from every corner of the country related to this scheme is extremely satiating. The people, who were hither to unable to get good quality treatment despite the presence of best hospitals due to unavailability of resources, have got the right to treatment today. Within 2-2.5 weeks of the launch of this scheme, more than 50,000 brothers and sisters have either been treated or are in the process of getting treated.

Friends,

 Apart from health, long after several years of independence, the financial independence of the people was also limited. Only a few people could use banks and raise loans. However, a large chunk of the population was compelled to make small savings by putting away the amount in the containers hidden in kitchens. We acknowledged the seriousness of the situation and started the Jan Dhan Yojana. And today about 35 crore people have been linked to banks. We have secured their right to financial independence.

Moreover, with the help of Mudra Yojana, those people who were once dependent upon moneylenders are being given guarantee-free loans by the banks.

Brothers and sisters,

Our government has upheld human rights through laws and policies and has tried to strengthen them further. The recent formulation of the law liberating the Muslim women from 'triple talaq' is also a part of this objective. I hope that this crucial effort associated with the rights of Muslim women gets the approval of the Parliament. 

The decision to increase the paid holidays for pregnant women from 12 weeks to 26 weeks is also a result of our thinking. In this way, we have also protected the rights of the newborn babies. This decision that aims to ensure that the mother stays with the child for 6 months after birth itself is a big thing. This decision is yet to be taken in the progressive countries of the world.

Our government has also made efforts to remove legal barriers for women to work in night shifts and to ensure adequate security in the process.

The initiatives like the ‘Rights of Persons with Disability Act’ for increasing reservation in jobs for 'Divyangs' or the 'Transgender Persons Protection of Rights Bill' show the government's commitment to human rights.

We have worked in the direction to ensure that there is no discrimination against the people suffering from HIV, and they get equal treatment, through law.

 

Friends, 

The government is increasing the number of e-courts to strengthen the right to seek justice, and is empowering the National Judicial data grid. So far, more than 17 thousand courts have been added to the national judicial data grid. Information related to cases and judgments are available online which has expedited the process of justice and has reduced the number of pending cases.

Legal support is being provided to the people living in remote and far-flung areas of the country through Tele-law scheme.

Brothers and sisters,

The government is insisting on the use of modern technology and increasing the transparency of the system in order to ensure the rights of the citizens. By formulating the UIDAI Act, the government has not only strengthened Aadhaar legally but has also successfully made an attempt to deliver the benefits of the schemes to poor by increasing the use of Aadhaar.

Aadhaar has become one of the largest technology-based empowerment programmes in the country. Recently, the Supreme Court has praised the government's work. Similarly, by making the public distribution system transparent, the Government has ensured that the poor receives food grains at a cheaper price. Otherwise, we are all aware of the situation that existed earlier. 

Similarly, several procedures have been modified and rules and regulations have been changed so that the people do not face any obstacle in exercising their rights. Promoting self-attestation or appointment of women through Short Service Commission in the Indian Armed Forces at par with men is both part of the government's same approach.

Such minute changes in rules and regulations have made an impact on greater levels. Like changing the definition of bamboo has allowed my tribal brothers and sisters living in remote and far-flung areas to cut and transport bamboo. This has drastically increased their incomes.

Friends,

Several tasks have been accomplished keeping the goal of earning for all, education for all, medicines for all and justice for all in mind that have pulled out crores of Indians out of extreme poverty. The country is moving towards a very large system for the middle class at a rapid pace. Whatever success we have got with this, is not only because of the efforts of the government but more so because of public participation. Crores of Indians have realized and understood their responsibilities and inspired themselves for behavioral change.

Brothers and sisters,

Our decisions and programmes are successful only when people associate themselves with the same. I can say on the basis of my experience that there is no greater mantra of success than public participation.

I was told that during the silver jubilee programme, several public awareness programmes were run across the country by NHRC. This is being done with the help of technology. A few moments ago, a postal stamp was launched. The new version of the NHRC's website has also been launched. This will definitely benefit the people who are in need. As per my suggestion, I would like NHRC to use social media for extensive publicity. Awareness of human rights is definitely essential but at the same time it is also important to remind the people of their duties and responsibilities. 

I realize that you receive plenty of complaints of which several are of serious nature. You hear every complaint and dispose of the cases but is it possible to maintain a database about the classes and the areas related to the complaints which can be analyzed? I am sure that during this process we can get brilliant solutions to some problems. 

The role of NHRC in the government's efforts to achieve sustainable development goals is very important. The government has always welcomed your suggestions. The government is always committed to make the lives of the citizens better and secure their rights. Once again, I congratulate NHRC on the occasion of Silver Jubilee and my best wishes to you all. We all will continue to move forward for a constructive change in the country.

With this expectation, I thank you all.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Silver Jubilee Foundation Day function of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).

He said that in the last two and a half decades, NHRC has contributed to nation building, by becoming the voice of the deprived and the oppressed. He said that the protection of human rights has been an important part of our culture. He said that after independence, elements such as an independent and impartial judiciary; an active media; an active civil society, and organizations such as NHRC are in place to protect human rights. 

The Prime Minister said that human rights should not be merely a slogan, but also a part of our ethos. He said that in the last four years or so, a lot of serious efforts have been made to improve the quality of life of the poor. He said that the Government’s focus has been to ensure that all Indians have access to the basic needs of human beings. In this context, he mentioned the achievements of schemes such as BetiBachao, BetiPadhao, Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, Pradhan MantriAwaasYojana, UjjwalaYojana, and SaubhagyaYojana; and the transformation that has been brought about in the lives of the people as a result of these schemes. He said that the construction of more than 9 crore toilets, has ensured sanitation, and a life of dignity, for crores of poor people. He also mentioned the recently launched health assurance initiative – PMJAY – under Ayushman Bharat. He also spoke of the financial inclusion initiatives of the Union Government. He said that the law which provides relief to Muslim women from triple talaq, is also part of this series of steps taken to ensure basic rights for people. 

The Prime Minister mentioned steps taken to improve ease of access to justice, such as increasing the number of e-courts, and strengthening of the National Judicial Data Grid. He described Aadhaar is a technology-based empowerment initiative. 

The Prime Minister said that the success of these initiatives has also been because of Jan Bhagidaari – public participation. He said that along with awareness of human rights, citizens should also be aware of their duties and responsibilities. He said those who understand their responsibilities, also know how to respect the rights of others. 

The Prime Minister said that the role of NHRC is also crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

                      President of World Economic Forum (WEF), MrBorgeBrende, honourable members of the industry, other guests from across the globe and dear friends! I welcome you all on this special occasion and am indeed grateful to all of you for sparing your valuable time to be here.  It is an honour for me that WEF found me worthy to be included in the launch event of India’s first and world’s fourth Centre of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Friends, Industry 4.0  is not just about industry but also its components which are surely going to be a game-changer for the humanity in future. 

      The way the disruptive and interconnected technologies are emerging in today's global scenario, it is unprecedented. This collaboration and convergence of varied technologies form the basis of Fourth Industrial Revolution. Various dimensions of these technologies are touching every aspect of the lives of people and transforming the way they work and communicate with the whole world. Given this senario, the opening of such an important centre in India after San Francisco, Tokyo and Beijing certainly opens up upboundless possibilities for the future. 

      I congratulate and thank the World Economic Forum for such a pathbreaking initiative. I am sure all of you can see how Fourth Industrial Revolution is impacting lives of people all over the world. Being experts in this field all of you are mindful of the nuances of it. It is very important for all of us to understand why this revolution is important to India, and why India has the potential today to take full advantage of this revolution.

        India has a robust ecosystem which has potential to use emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning(ML), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, Big Data, and it can catapult India's development to new heights by creating millions of new opportunities of employment. We are capable of improving the life of every person in the country. Indian youth with decades of experience in the field of information technology are leveraging from the vibrant eco system of startups. Today, while India is moving ahead with the resolve of a New India by strengthening its power and resources, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is indeed an icing on the cake.

       India not only sees this as a change in the industrial senario, but as a catalyst to change its social fabric. While Industry is a platform, production is a process and technology is a tool, but its ultimate goal is to benefit and transform the marginalised and the outliers of the society. 

        Friends, I am visualising the strengths in the Industry 4.0 which can eliminate many weaknesses related to the social and economic system forever. India is slated to witness an e-reversible positive change. I firmly believe that using Industry 4.0 can play a pivotal role in eradication poverty in India. The poor, deprived and marginalised sections of the country can benefit from this revolution. E-revolution can help us a lot in the escalating the speed and scale of development which we need to work on in a vast and diverse country like India.

      Friends, without a strong foundation no infrastructure can stand firmly. The success of Industry 4.0 is largely dependant on how ready and prepared a country is to support the revolution strongly. Today, I am proud that in the last four and a half years our government has taken several important initiatives towards preparing India for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and has achieved great success in its endeavors. I would like to present in detail the reasons of my enthusiasm and confidence before you.

       Friends, with respect to Industry 4.0, if you remove just one word, it loses its meaning.  And that word is digital; a word which has become synonymous with the emerging New India. The Digital India campaign has taken the telecom data accessibility to the nook and corner of the villages of India. In the past four-and-a-half years, the government has taken the initiative to strengthen the country's telecom infrastructure by investing six times more than before in this infrastructure.

        Friends, while there were only 70 million people in India with a digital identity in 2014, today more than 120 million people of India have Aadhar card, their digital identity. In 2014, India had less than eight lakh mobile based trans-receiver stations.Today their number has exceeded 18 lakhs. In 2014, the total tally density was 75% which has increased today to 93%.  While, the number of mobile internet subscriptions in India was 23 crores at that time, today it has more than doubled to above 50 crores. In the last four years, internet coverage has increased by more than 75%. In these years, the Government of India has laid out more than three lakh kilometers of optical fiber. 

      This is a result of robust engagement of local administrative infrastructure. Prior to 2014, only fifty Panchayats of the country were connected by optical fiber whereas today more than one lakh panchayats are connected. Very soon we are going to achieve the goal of connecting all the 2.5 lakh panchayats in the country with optical fiber.

      Friends, there were only 83 thousand common service centers in the country before 2014. Today there are more than three lakh common service centers in India. In the rural areas of the country, the government is working to provide more than 32,000 Wi-Fi hot spots in the remote areas. The Digital India campaign has changed the way in which Indians have lived in the last four years.

     Friends, such is the impact of Industry 4.0, an Indian citizen is using more than thirty times more mobile data than what was available in 2014. It is also interesting that today, while the highest mobile data consumption in the world is reported in India, the cheapest data in the whole world is also available in India. This is because after 2014, the value of mobile data in India has decreased by more than ninety percent.

       Friends, nowhere in the world have you heard of such a compelling growth story. It is indeed an unprecedented journey fro 2014. Today India is reckoned as one of the world's largest digital infrastructure countries. Unique interfaces like Aadhaar, unified payment interface i.e. UPI, e-sign, e-national agricultural market ie ENAM, government e-market place i.e. GEM, digi-locker are helping India become a technology leader through Artificial Intelligence. Due to these, more and more people are increasingly connecting with digital technology. India's digital infrastructure has given the country's startups the opportunity to innovate on these platforms. These innovations are also working to strengthen the country's MSME sector.

     Friends, India has already developed a national strategy to prepare for the development of AI research based robbers eco system in India. Following the vision of inclusive growth “sabkasath, sabkavikas”, the government has now given a call of “Artificial Intelligence for all”. The important topics have already been addressed in detail as to how the research eco system shall be created, adaption of it be promoted and the relevant skilling challenges shall be dealt with.

      Special attention has been given to those sectors which are also associated with the Indian public, such as agriculture, health and education. In these areas, the government has initited work on several pilot projects. Aligned with the same, we have recently organized a big conference in India on Mobility.

     This new WEF Center in Mumbai will work to consolidate this initiative further. These centers will take forward the vision of inclusive growth and motivate and complement the efforts being made in this direction of “sabkasath, sabkavikas”. This center will help design the policies of the government around new emerging technologies. It will also help the public sector and private sectors of India. It will certainly awaken new consciousness in the work of various state governments to help in fostering new dimensions of industry 4.0.

       I am told that this Centre in collaboration with Government of Maharashtra, has started working on a DRONE and IoT projects to improve government services. And for this proactiveness, I congratulate the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. I hope that many such projects will start in every state in the days to come.

      Friends, in India, with the strengthening of Industry 4.0 coupled with the expansion of AI, our people will  get better and affordable health care facilities. By extending it to the agricultural sector, the yield of farmers on one side will increase, while wastage of grains will stop. Thus, their incomes will also increase. This technique can help the farmers of India to make the right decision by being well informed about the weather, crop and seed sowing cycle. The Centre is slated to strengthen the 21st Century infrastructure like Smart cities, and also help to increase the connectivity between villages of the country.

       The centre shall also address concerns related to solutions for Smart Mobility, transportation and even how to get rid of the problem of jams in cities. Our country is endowed with linguistic diversity, and with the help of AI, the exchange of ideas in different dialects and languages ​​will be possible now. .

    In the same way, AI with its multiple uses can enhance the capabilities by providing a solution to several day to day problems faced by my specially-abled brothers and sisters in India.

       Friends, work has already begun at different levels o address these concerns.  This also integrates the aim of “Solve for India, Solve for the world”. We are also advancing from local solution towards global application. The role of another technology is very important, and that is Block chain. This technology enhances and propels the vision of “minimum government, maximum governance”. With this technology, self governance and self certification are being expanded and future prospects are being explored. All government procedures, conflicts, bottlenecks can be overcome with its help. Improvement in these processes will increase transparency, reduce corruption and crime, and hence improve the ease of living of our country men. 

       Friends, the expansion of the Block chain technology has the potential to push India up in the “Ease of doing Business” global ranking as well. All the services of the government, management of natural resources, registration of property, contract, power connection, and so many other kinds of administrative work can be accelerated with its application. In the wake of this, India is also working to create a national strategy on the use of Block chain. WEF center in Mumbai shall also be assisting in this.

    I would also like to inform you that India is going to announce its Drones policy very soon. Friends, when the first industrial revolution happened, India was a slave. Even during the second industrial revolution, India was still a slave. When the Third Industrial Revolution took place, India was struggling to deal with the challenges faced post independence. But now the 21st century India has changed. Today, with full confidence, I can say that the power of 130 million people of our country, India will not be deprived of the benefits of the fourth industrial revolution. I strongly believe that India's contribution in the fourth industrial revolution will astonish the whole world; An unprecedented, unpredictable, unimaginable contribution will be from India.

       Our diversity, our demographic potential, fast growing market size and digital infrastructure have the potential to make India a global hub of research and implementation. The benefits of innovations made here shall be reaped by the whole world and humanity at a large. 

      Friends, today I want to bring to light another important topic on this forum. Some people are anxious that this uptake of technology will reduce employment, but the truth is that the realities of human life which haven’t been touched till today, are now opened up by Industry 4.0. This will change the nature of job to a large extent, and will create new opportunities. Preempting this reality, the Indian government is running programs such as Skill India Mission, Start Up India, Stand Up India, Atal Innovation Mission etc where the youth of our country can be prepared for the emerging techniques.

       Friends, how the world will shape up over the next decade none of us can foresee. Nobody can even tell how far the fifth industrial revolution is. Well, the first three industrial revolution came at an interval of about 100 years, but we are also seeing that the fourth revolution has beckoned 30-40 years early. Seeing the last one or two decades, innumerable things were invented and they became extinct. Technology has squeezed time. The change from the Industry 4.0 to 5.0 will not wait for 100 years, so India is very serious about the industry 4.0. This is the time to get together with your optimal potential.

    I also wish that in the coming months we will have an Industry 4.0 park in India also. I invoke all of you, the industries of the country, the state governments, civil society, and entrepreneurs, to join this revolution and work to realize this dream.

       Friends, ours is a forward looking and open minded government. We are ready to develop any framework, protocol or policy that is in the interest of the New India, in the interest of the Indians. We are always open to receiving suggestions from you. We are determined to take our India to greater heights. We shall never let it down.  

    To conclude I once again wish the Center for Fourth Industrial Revolution all success in its future endeavors.

Thanks you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended, and delivered an address at the event to mark the launch of the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 

He said the components of “Industry 4.0” actually have the ability to transform the present and future of human life. He said the launch of this Centre, the fourth in the world after San Francisco, Tokyo and Beijing, opens the door to immense possibilities in the future. 

He said emerging fields, including Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, Blockchain, and Big Data, can take India to new heights of development, and improve the quality of life of its citizens. He said that for India, this is not just an industrial transformation, but a social transformation. He said Industry 4.0 has the strength to drive irreversible positive change in India. He added that it will help bring the required speed and scale to work being done in India.    

The Prime Minister mentioned how the Digital India movement has brought data to villages of India. He explained how tele-density, internet coverage, and mobile internet subscriptions have increased in the recent past. He spoke of the rapid growth in number of Common Service Centres in India. He said that India has the highest mobile data consumption in the world, and is also the country where data is available at the lowest price. In this context he spoke of India’s digital infrastructure, and its interfaces including Aadhaar, UPI, e-NAM, and GeM. He said that a national strategy for creating a robust infrastructure for research in Artificial Intelligence has been prepared a few months ago. He said this new Centre will strengthen this process. He said that Industry 4.0, and the expansion of Artificial Intelligence, would lead to better healthcare, and reduce expenditure on health. He said it would also help farmers, and be of immense help in the agriculture sector. He mentioned other areas such as transportation and smart mobility, where it could play a key role. He said that as work progresses in India, in these areas, one of the targets is “Solve for India, Solve for the World.

The Prime Minister expressed confidence that India would be able to take advantage of the fourth Industrial Revolution. He added that India would also make an immense contribution to it. He said that Government initiatives including Skill India Mission, Start Up India, and Atal Innovation Mission are preparing our youth for new and emerging technologies.

Sir Chhotu Ram! Amar Rahe! Amar Rahe!

Sir Chhotu Ram! Amar Rahe! Amar Rahe!

 

I salute the soil of Haryana that pioneers in producing the soldiers who are defending the country's borders; that has the farmers who feed crores of people of the country and has the best players who win maximum number of medals in sports. There is no match for the people of Haryana in carrying the name and the honour of the country forward.

The Governor of Haryana, Shri Satyadev Narayan Arya ji, my cabinet colleagues Chaudhary Birendra Singh ji and Shri Krishna pal Gurjar ji, the popular Chief Minister of Haryana Shri Manohar Lal ji, the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Shri Satpal Malik ji, the Governor of Himachal Pradesh and the son of this soil Shri Acharya Devvrat ji, Minister in the Government of Haryana and my old colleague, brother O.P Dhankad ji, MLA Shri Subhash Barala ji and my dear brothers and sisters from Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan.

Today I have come here to hand over the statue of Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram to you. What could be more delightful than this for me?

 

Friends,

I am really fortunate that today I have got the opportunity to unveil the magnificent statue of Rahbare Azam Deenbandhu Chaudhary Chhotu Ram ji who was the voice and the Messiah of the farmers in Sampla. Before attending this programme, I had visited the Museum built in the memory of Chaudhary Chhotu Ram ji. The tallest statue of Haryana along with the museum has become yet another identity of Sampla, Rohtak. I am extremely fortunate that I have got the opportunity to launch the tallest statue of the Messiah of the farmers Sir Chhotu Ram ji in Haryana in the month of October and I will get the opportunity to launch the tallest statue of the world on 31st October i.e. on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. Both of the great personalities were farmers; they worked for farmers and worked for connecting the farmers to the nation. The second characteristic feature is that the statue is built by Shri Sutar ji. He is more than 90 years of age but still continues to work. The same Sutar ji has also built the world's largest statue of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. I congratulate the people of Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab and the entire country.

Brothers and sisters,

From time to time, such great men take birth in our country and dedicate their entire life to the service of the society and to show the direction to the country. There is a lot of poverty, scarcity, problems and conflicts; but such people have been able to strengthen the society by crossing every challenge and sacrificing their lives. It is a matter of pride for all of us that Chaudhari Chhotu Ram ji was born in this land of Haryana.

Chaudhary Chhotu Ram ji was one of those social reformers in the country who played a key role in rebuilding India. He was a robust voice of the farmers, labourers, the deprived and the oppressed section of the society. He valiantly fought against every powerful force that divided the society or created any kind of discrimination. He closely observed and understood the issues related to agriculture, farmers and the challenges faced by the small businessmen and tried to address those challenges.

Friends,

The soul of Chhotu Ram ji will be glad that on this very day the foundation-stone of a railway coach factory equipped with modern technology will be laid in Sonepat.

This factory will be established with a cost of about Rs.500 crores. Every year 250 coaches of passenger trains will be repaired and modernized in this railway coach factory. After the construction of this railway coach factory, the compulsion of taking these passenger coaches to distant factories for maintenance will end. This will increase the number of passenger coaches in the trains running in this area and the people will get the facility of comfortable coaches.

Brothers and sisters,

This factory will help in industrial development of not only Sonepat but also the entire Haryana. The requirement of tools for repair can be fulfilled by small businessmen who in turn will get new opportunities. These requirements will range from seat covers to fans to electric fittings or other tools for coaches. The small businesses will get new opportunities for work.

Just imagine, the coach factory will provide job opportunities to several youngsters here. There will be another advantage of this factory - due to this factory engineers and technicians will also develop local expertise in the field of repair of rail coaches. That means that the engineers and technicians here will develop a different type of expertise. In the future, the experts of this place will be able to benefit the nation by offering their expertise in other parts of the country as well.

Friends,

I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to work in Haryana for several years. When I was engaged with party work here, almost every day I used to hear about the greatness of Sir Chhotu Ram from someone or the other. Whatever I have read and heard about him is indeed inspiring for someone who wants to fight against all the challenges and work for the welfare of the society. Chaudhary Saheb had once said in Rohtak - for me a farmer is not only the symbol of poverty but also a soldier who stands with the flag held high against the atrocities of the English army. These were the words of Sir Chhotu Ram.

Friends,

There is not a single village in Haryana whose members are not in the Indian army. The credit for developing this feeling of service to the nation and joining the Indian army goes to Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram ji to a great extent. It was him who had encouraged such a large number of farmers to join the army. During the World War I, many of the soldiers from this region had fought for world peace.

Friends,

He couldn't see an independent India during his lifetime but he had very well understood the challenges, hopes, aspirations and requirements of India. He had always raised his voice against the Britishers' 'divide and rule' policy. In every stream of politics, Sir Chhotu Ram ji was honoured because of these ideas. One can gauge the greatness of his personality from the fact that once Sardar Patel had said something for Sir Chhotu Ram and I believe that every person of Haryana would feel proud of it. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had said - if Chaudhary Chhotu Ram ji was alive today, I wouldn't have had to worry about Punjab after the partition of India. He would have taken care of it. In this way, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had narrated the strength and ability of Sir Chhotu Ram.

His influence was spread across a vast part of the western and the northern India so much so that even the English rulers were forced to think hundred times before disobeying him. I must have heard about the incident related to Chaudhary Chhotu Ram ji and Sahukar at least 100 times. You all too must be aware of it. The Sahukar had suggested him to be the Patwari instead of paying the loan. But even the Sahukar had no idea that the person he was asking to become the Patwari was to decide the fate of thousands of Patwaris of Punjab one day. Just on the basis of his merit and with a lot of struggle, Chaudhary Saheb had become the Revenue Minister of Punjab.

Brothers and sisters,

During his tenure as a minister, he had worked for the welfare of the farmers of not only Punjab but the entire nation as well as the agricultural labourers. Chaudhary Saheb had pioneered the work in the field of revenue system, had made laws for marketing of crops that are still part of our system, had made laws for ensuring easy access of loans to the farmers and laws related to Minimum Support Price and Mandis.

We should not forget that this work had been accomplished at a time when we were still under the British rule. Despite the plethora of limitations, Chaudhary Saheb had not only thought of the welfare of the farmers but had also taken steps in that direction. He was also in favour of promoting Agro-industries. During that period, he had emphasized upon strengthening cottage and small industries. He had ceaselessly motivated the industrialists to connect with the farmers. Everyone should associate with the agricultural sector.

Friends,

In view of this vision of Chhotu Ram ji, Chakravarty Rajagopalachari ji had said - Chaudhary Chhotu Ram ji not only sets the goals high but also knows very well to accomplish those goals.

Brothers and sisters,

Probably many people are not aware of the fact that the idea of this Bhakra Nangal dam was first envisaged by Chaudhary Saheb. He along with the Raja of Bilaspur had signed the papers for Bhakra dam. We can clearly see the benefits that the people of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan are reaping as a result of this decision. Just think of the grand vision that he had.

Friends,

It is the right of everyone to know about the person who had brought so many reforms and had placed such a distant vision before everyone. Often I am surprised and I wonder why is the knowledge about such a great personality limited to just one region? I believe that although it has not impacted the greatness of Chaudhary Saheb but several generations of the country was deprived of the lessons from his life.

Brothers and sisters,

Our government is working towards reviving the glory of every person who has dedicated his life for the country. For the last four years, we are not only glorifying the great personalities but also being guided by the path shown by them. The banks have been made easily accessible to the farmers and the small entrepreneurs so that they don't have to depend upon the money lenders. Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, bank accounts of almost 66.5 lakh brothers and sisters have been created in Haryana. Raising loans from cooperative banks has been made easier by the government. Recently, India Post Payment Bank has been started that has ensured banking services at your doorstep with the help of postman.

Friends,

Just as Chaudhary Saheb had holistically thought of the welfare of the farmers and the labourers, our government too is making efforts to create a strong system from the seeds to the market. We are relentlessly working so as to ensure that the farmers get fair price for their crops; the farmers are protected against the atrocities of the weather; they receive modern seeds, adequate urea and proper irrigation facility along with a good soil health. I am happy that Haryana is getting benefitted. About 50 lakh farmer families have got Soil Health Cards. About 6.5 lakh farmers are currently associated with the crop insurance and they have already received their claim amount of more than Rs.350 crores. Water has reached the areas that were dry for about 30-40 years. A historic agreement has been signed between 6 states for Lakhwar dam. This will benefit Haryana to a great extent. About 8-10 decades ago, Chaudhary Saheb had formulated the Agricultural Produce Market Act to give the farmers fair price for their crops. Our government too has started the PM-AASHA i.e. Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan. Under the scheme, the government has ensured that even if the farmers get below the minimum support price for their produce in the market, the state government will be able to pay the balance to them. Moreover, our promise of providing at least 50% more than the production cost to the farmers has also been fulfilled. 

Friends,

The government has increased the Minimum Support Price of 21 important crops including paddy, wheat and sugarcane. The Minimum Support Price of paddy has been increased by Rs.200 per quintal. Now its price has increased from Rs.1550 to Rs.1750 per quintal. Likewise, the MSP of maize has been increased by Rs.275, Sunflower by Rs.1300 and of bajra by Rs.500 per quintal.

Brothers and sisters,

Recall, for how long our farmers have been demanding this. Now, that demand has been fulfilled by our government.

Friends,

On one hand, it is being ensured that the income of the villages and farmers of Haryana increases, while at the same time steps are being taken to ensure that the income doesn't get diverted to medical expenses.

I would like to congratulate the people of Haryana as the first beneficiary of Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a daughter of your state. It is satisfying to know that within two weeks of launching this scheme, more than 50 thousand poor brothers and sisters have either been treated or are in the process of getting treated.

I am extremely glad that Haryana has declared itself Open Defection Free. I want to especially thank Rohtak because its Maharishi Dayanand University has been ranked first in Swachhta rankings.

Friends,

The soul of Chaudhary Saheb would be extremely delighted to see the success of 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao'campaign in Haryana. He had not only voiced for reforms but had also started the campaign for changing the mindset right from his home. He had always opposed the kind of attitude that we had towards the daughters in our society. That is why despite all the pressures from the society, he had always stood firmly for his two daughters.

Brothers and sisters,

Today, When we see that the daughters from small villages of Haryana are raising the honour of the country on international platforms; the youngsters from Haryana are relentlessly trying to make India a world power in sports and when the youngsters from the country's poorest of the poor families are moving ahead, we realize that we are rapidly moving forward to fulfil the dreams of Chaudhary Saheb.

Friends,

Haryana is giving impetus to the country's development. We have to work to ensure that this pace continues to increase. This is the message from Chaudhary Chhotu Ram ji to all of us. We will be able to pay true obeisance to the national personality dedicated to social harmony and national unity only when we will create the India of his dreams, a New India.

In a few days we will be celebrating Haryana Day. I offer my best wishes in advance to the people of Haryana. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for coming here in large numbers and paying homage to Sir Chhotu Ram ji.

Thanks a lot!

                Governor of Uttarakhand, Smt. Baby Rani Maurya Ji, all my Cabinet colleagues, Chief Minister of the State, Trivendra Singh Rawat Ji, all the members of the Uttarakhand Cabinet, the Minister of Communications and Information of Singapore, Mr. S. Iswaran, the Ambassadors of Japan and the Czech Republic, the entrepreneurs from around the world, ladies and gentlemen.

I welcome and greet all the friends who have come from across the country and the world to this sacred place of Baba Kedar nath ji and Char Dham:  Uttarakhand. I believe that you will experience India's economic environment along with our cultural diversity which is thousands of years old, get acquainted with it and return with a new feeling.

Friends,

We have gathered here on the land of Uttarakhand at a time when both economic and social transformations are sweeping India. The country is passing through a major phase of transformation. We are moving towards a new India. Every major international organization is saying that India is going to be the main engine of world's growth in the coming decades. Now, India's economy has stabilized, fiscal deficit has narrowed down and the inflation rate is under control. The middle class is growing at a rapid pace. The youth power of more than 80 crores that has made up the demographic dividend is full of aspirations and capabilities.

Friends,

Economic reforms in speed and skill are going on in India at an unprecedented rate. More than 10000 initiatives have been taken by the Central and the State governments in the last two years. India has improved 42 points in Ease of Doing Business just because of these initiatives. In the process of reforms, we have done away with more than 1400 laws. Besides, reforms have also been made in the taxation system of India. Efforts are being made to make tax-related solutions more transparent and efficient.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has made doing business easier and has strengthened the banking system. The greatest tax reform in India since independence has been in the form of GST. GST has turned the country into a single market and has helped in expanding the tax base.

Our infrastructure sector is also growing at a record speed. Last year, 10 thousand kilometers long National Highway was constructed in India. This means that the work was progressing at a rate of 27kilometer per day. This speed is double than that of the previous governments.

The railway lines are also being constructed at double speed. Besides, work is underway for new metro, high speed rail projects, dedicated freight corridor in several cities. The government is moving ahead with the modernization of 400 railway stations.

India's aviation sector is also growing at a rapid pace. To speed up the process further, about 100 more airports and helipads are being constructed. Work is going on to improve the air connectivity to tier-2 and Tier 3 cities through UDAN scheme. Work is also underway to create more than 100 national waterways.

Friends,

Besides, targets of myriad schemes like housing for all, power for all, clean fuel for all, health for all and banking for all are about to be soon achieved. In short, we can say that because of this all-round change there is a favourable environment for you and the investors from around the world.

The recently launched Ayushman Bharat Yojana has increased the possibility of investment in the medical sector in India. In the near future, new hospitals, medical colleges, paramedical human resource development institutions will come up and paramedical infrastructure will be strengthened in tier-2 and tier-3 cities because of this scheme. You can imagine that more than 50 crore Indians will be getting health insurance assurance of up to Rs.5 lakh under Ayushman Bharat Yojana. That is, a population of more than the total population of America, Canada and Mexico put together will receive this benefit. Population of more than that of entire Europe will get this benefit. Thus, we will require a number of hospitals as well as doctors to deliver these benefits. There is an immense possibility of investment and the payment for the patients is ready beforehand. This means that there is an assurance of return for the investors. This is a major opportunity for capital investment that opens up the possibility of setting up best quality hospitals in tier-2 and tier-3 cities.

Friends,

Today the rate at which expenditure on infrastructure is being made is like never before. Therefore, immense possibilities of investment are also opening up lakhs of opportunities for employment. Potentiality, policy and performance are the means of progress. New India is the best destination for investment and Destination Uttarakhand is a shining part of that. Uttarakhand is among those states that represent New India and our demographic dividend. Today's Uttarakhand represents the youth and their zeal. I believe that the government under Trivendra Rawat Ji is making tremendous efforts to turn the seamless possibilities of this region into opportunities. This platform of Destination Uttarakhand represents these efforts. Now it is pertinent to put these discussions, confidence and enthusiasm on ground as soon as possible so that the youngsters of Uttarakhand get maximum opportunities for employment.

Friends,

When Late Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had decided to create Uttarakhand, circumstances were not favourable. Apart from political instability we had an uphill task before us to a better future. However, today Uttarakhand is moving ahead at a rapid pace on the path of development.

Several steps have been taken to promote and empower Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME). The emphasis is being laid on providing higher credit, support capital, interest subsidy, lower tax and innovation for small enterprises. Recently, it has been decided that loans of up to Rs.1 crore for the MSMEs will be approved in a very short time.

Several facilities are now available online to ensure that no investor has to visit government offices for getting project clearances. A web portal named 'PARIVESH' is for online environmental clearances which has not only simplified the process but has also accelerated it.

Several steps have been taken in the last four years to expand connectivity in Uttarakhand in every possible way. Uttarakhand is being connected through highways, railways and airways. Every village is now getting metaled roads. Moreover, the work for Char Dham all-weather road and Hrishikesh- Karnaprayag rail line is progressing at a rapid pace.

Friends,

The tourism sector in particular is going to benefit from better connectivity. The nature has not only enriched this state with abundance, but it is also blessed with religious faith and culture. Uttarakhand tourism is a complete package of nature, adventure, culture, yoga and meditation. It is an ideal destination. With a separate tourism policy, the Uttarakhand government has given tourism the status of an industry. For the first time in 18 years, 13 new tourist destinations in 13 districts have been identified for developing. This will definitely open up employment opportunities for the state's youth.

Friends,

Uttarakhand has the potential to become an organic state. I am glad that efforts are going on under the cluster based organic farming to make it an organic state. The central government is also working hard to provide a market for organic farming.

Also, food processing is being emphasized along with it. The government has approved 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the food processing sector to strengthen it. India is one of the pioneering countries in the field of food processing. It includes production of food grains, fruits, vegetables and milk. In all of these fields, India stands within first three ranks. Our focus is on food processing sector so as to ensure that there is no wastage in farmers' production and they take maximum advantage out of it. Uttarakhand has a bright future in this regard.

I would like to make a special request to you all for making greater investments in agriculture and agri-business. The impending value addition in the agriculture will play a pivotal role in increasing the incomes of the farmers. And I believe that with greater private investments in the agriculture sector, food processing, value addition, cold storage, warehousing or transportation with special types of carriages and tapping into the strength and potential of the rural economy will give a new dimension to the economic potential of India.

India is heading towards becoming a world leader in terms of renewable energy today. Today, India has the power to lead the world. We have decided that by 2030, 40% of the electricity generation will be from non-fossil fuel based resources. Moreover, by 2022 that marks 75 years of Indian independence, we have set a target of producing 175 GW of renewable energy. Solar power forms a major part of this target. This is the concept behind International Solar Alliance (ISA). To ensure that the energy needs of the world are fulfilled and the environment is protected, we have one mantra - ’one world, one sun, one grid'. The state government is also making efforts to promote renewable energy in Uttarakhand. Hydel power is the strength of this state. Uttarakhand has the potential of becoming an energy surplus state with the addition of power like solar energy. Uttarakhand has the power and the potential to make India energy-rich. 

Friends,

In the last four years, Make in India has turned into a major brand. We urge Make in India to be not only for India but for the whole world. The world has accepted our invitation and now India is becoming the hub for not only Information Technology but also for electronic manufacturing. Today, the world's largest mobile phone manufacturing unit is operating in India along with more than 120 factories. World's several major brands are now part of Make in India.

At the same time, India is making great strides in the field of automobile sector. Japan is the partner of Uttarakhand for this event. Friends, you will be glad to know that Japan’s products, its cars are now manufactured in India and Japan imports the cars.

Friends,

Today through this programme, I invite you all to invest in different sectors and to become a part of the growth story of Uttarakhand and New India.

I believe that the MoUs that are going to be signed in the next two days will fructify very soon and if we channelize the potential of the states to the maximum level, no one can stop India's progress and growth story. It is wonderful that today a healthy competition has started among the states. Every state wants to beat the other and be more innovative. Every state wants to do it according to its capability. When a state progresses with its capabilities, I don't think it will lag behind for long.

The strength of our states is greater than many of the countries of the world. The potential of our states is immense compared to several of the smaller countries of the world.

I want every state to dream big. I still remember when I had become the Chief Minister of Gujarat. Even that date was 7th October. The year was 2001. I had no experience. I didn't know how a government functioned. I had not seen any office. I was completely new. Journalists came and started posing difficult questions. They were trying hard so that I made a mistake or said something that would not allow my career to take off in the first place. So, one person asked me that as I wanted to build Gujarat, who was my idol? Whom would I follow to build Gujarat? Usually it is assumed that while answering such questions, people say they want to follow America or England. I gave a different answer. I said that I would like to build it like South Korea. They were confused. I said ""please shut off your cameras. Let me explain it to you. You must not face any difficulty”. I said that the population of Gujarat is almost similar to that of South Korea. Both have coastal boundaries; their journey for development is the same. I said, 'I have studied it in so much detail that if we follow that path, we will definitely move ahead; and we will never stop’.

I believe that every state has that potential. It can compete and leave many such countries behind. Every state of our country can move ahead with this capability. Our youngsters have that strength, potential and capabilities.

The Russian President was here the day before yesterday. First of all, we had attended a very different programme. He was very fond of an educational institution of Russia. He had once taken me there. I had requested him to bring those students to India. And I said that I also wished to send some of the students from India to your place. So this time he had brought 20 students with him. 20 Russian students had worked with 20 Indian students for 5-6 days. Those students had done such a wonderful task that both I and the Russian President were stupefied! There is immense potential in our children. They should get the right opportunities and exposure. Today Uttarakhand has taken one step forward in that direction. 18th year is very significant. Uttarakhand is age-old but the Uttarakhand government is 18 year old. The enthusiasm and dreams of 18 years, the intensions of 18 years to do something new are amazing! Uttarakhand must be careful to not waste this 18th year. It is an extremely valuable time. 

We have been hearing about Special Economic Zones (SEZs) for economic development for the past several decades. However, Uttarakhand has a different SEZ. It is there for centuries due to the penance of rishis and sages, mother Ganga and Devadidev Himalayas. This is rather a region of Spiritual Eco Zone. The strength of the Spiritual Eco Zone is million times greater than the Special Economic Zone. Uttarakhand must extend its schemes centred on it for development.

I believe that under the leadership of Rawat Ji, this 18 year old enthusiastic government will help the state to scale new heights and in 2025, when you will attain the age of 25 years, several of your dreams will already be fulfilled. This great effort has given an auspicious start. I am extremely delighted and I assure you that you will get complete support from the central government.

Thanks a lot!

रूसी संघ के राष्ट्रपति और मेरे घनिष्ठ मित्र व्लादीमिर व्लादीमिरोविच,  
दोनों देशों के सम्माननीय प्रतिनिधि,  नमस्कार।


दोब्री दीन। 


उन्नीसवें वार्षिक शिखर सम्मेलन के लिए भारत में राष्ट्रपति पूतिन तथा उनके delegation का स्वागत करते हुए मुझे बहुत प्रसन्नता हो रही है।

हम एक ऐसे देश के राष्ट्रपति के रूप में आपका स्वागत कर रहे हैं, जिस के साथ हमारे अद्वितीय संबंध हैं। इन संबंधों के लिए आपने अमूल्य व्यक्तिगत योगदान दिया है।

राष्ट्रपति पूतिन द्वारा Sochi में आयोजित की गई अनौपचारिक शिखर सम्मेलन की स्मृतियां मेरे मन में ताज़ा हैं। उस खास मुलाक़ात से हम दोनों को खुलकर गहन चर्चा करने का अवसर प्राप्त हुआ।

राष्ट्रपति जी, 


रूस के साथ अपने संबंधों को भारत सर्वोच्च प्राथमिकता देता है। तेजी से बदलते हुए इस विश्व में हमारे संबंध और अधिक प्रासंगिक हो गए हैं।


उन्नीस शिखर सम्मेलनों की निरन्तर श्रृंखला से हमारी Special और Privileged Strategic Partnership को लगातार नई ऊर्जा और दिशा मिली है। और वैश्विक मामलों पर हमारे सहयोग को नए मायने एवं मकसद भी मिले हैं।


हमारे सहयोग को आपकी यात्रा से strategic direction मिला है। आज हमने ऐसे महत्वपूर्ण निर्णय लिए हैं, जो दीर्घाकालिक दृष्टि से हमारे संबंधों को और अधिक ताकतवर बनाएँगे। 

Human resource development से लेकर natural और energy resources तक, trade से लेकर investment तक, नाभिकीय ऊर्जा के शान्तिपूर्ण सहयोग से लेकर सौर ऊर्जा तक, technology से लेकर tiger कन्ज़र्वेशन तक, आर्कटिक से लेकर Far East तक, और सागर से लेकर अंन्तरिक्ष तक भारत और रूस के सम्बन्धों का और भी विशाल विस्तार होगा। यह विस्तार हमारे सहयोग को अतीत के कुछ गिने-चुने दायरों के पार ले जाएगा। 

साथ ही, हमारे संबंधों के महत्वपूर्ण आधार स्तंभ और मज़बूत होंगे।

भारत की विकास यात्रा में रुस हमेशा हमारे साथ रहा है। हमारा अंतरिक्ष में अगला लक्ष्य भारत के Gaganyaan में भारतीय अंतरिक्षयात्री को भेजना है। मुझे बहुत खुशी है कि आपने इस Mission में रूस के पूरे सहयोग का आश्वासन दिया है।


युवाओं में हमारे देशों के भविष्य का कायाकल्प करने की क्षमता है। मुझे इस बात की खुशी है कि भारत एवं रूस के प्रतिभा संपन्न बच्चे सम्मिलित रुप से अपने innovative ideas का प्रदर्शन आज दोपहर बाद करेंगे। ये ideas उन्होंने मिलजुल कर विकसित किए हैं।

हम भारत के फ्लैगशिप कार्यक्रमों में और Business के व्यापक अवसरों में रूस की भागदारी का स्वागत करते हैं। मुझे इस बात की भी खुशी है कि अब से कुछ समय बाद हम India-Russia Business Summit में भाग लेंगें। इसमें दोनों देशों से करीब 200 प्रमुख आर्थिक उद्यमी भाग ले रहे हैं।

भारत एवं रूस पारस्परिक हित के सभी अंतर्राष्ट्रीय मामलों में घनिष्ठता से सहयोग करते रहे हैं। President Putin तथा मैंने इन पर भी विस्तार से चर्चा की है।


भारत और रुस तेजी से बदलते हुए विश्व में Multi-polarity (मल्टी-पोलेरिटी) और Multi-laterism (मल्टी-लेटरलिस्म) को सुदृढ़ करने पर एकमत हैं। आतंकवाद के विरूद्ध संघर्ष, अफगानिस्तान तथा Indo Pacific के घटनाक्रम, जलवायु परिवर्तन, SCO, BRICS जैसे क्षेत्रीय संगठनों एवं G20 तथा ASEAN जैसे बहुपक्षीय संगठनों में सहयोग करने में हमारे दोनों देशों के साझा हित हैं। हम अंतरराष्ट्रीय संस्थानों में अपने लाभप्रद सहयोग और समन्वय को जारी रखने पर सहमत हुए हैं।

मैं President Putin द्वारा रुस के सुदूर पूर्व के विकास के लिए उठाए गए कदमों से बहुत प्रभावित हुआ हूँ। भारत इस क्षेत्र में सहयोग के लिए तत्पर है।


आज लिए गए निर्णयों से हमारे सहयोग में और वृद्धि होगी तथा चुनौतियों भरे विश्व में शांति एवं स्थिरता की बहाली में योगदान मिलेगा।


भाइयो बहनों, 

 

भारत और रुस के सम्बन्धों की शक्ति का स्त्रोत सामान्य जन में एक दूसरे के प्रति सद्भाव और मैत्री है। हमने आज ऐसे कई प्रयासों पर विचार किया है जिनसे people-to-people सम्बन्ध और मज़बूत हों। और दोनों देशों के लोगों की, विशेषतः युवाओं की एक-दूसरे के बारे में जानकारी और आपसी समझ और बढ़े। इससे भारत-रुस के सम्बन्धों के भविष्य की एक नई नींव का निर्माण होगा।

Friends, 

मैं विश्वासपूर्वक कह सकता हूं कि भारत- रूस मैत्री अपने आप में अनूठी है। मुझे पूरा विश्वास है कि इस विशिष्ट रिश्ते के लिए President Putin की प्रतिबद्धता से इन संबंधों को और भी ऊर्जा मिलेगी। और हमारे बीच प्रगाढ़ विश्वास एवं मैत्री और सुदृढ़ होगी और हमारी Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership को नई बुलंदियां प्राप्त होंगी।


Thank you. 


स्पासिबा.

                A group of about 40 enthusiasts with experience in mountaineering, who are embarking on an expedition to raise awareness on cleaning the River Ganga, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi today. The group includes 8 mountaineers who have successfully climbed Mount Everest, and is led by Ms. Bachendri Pal, the first Indian woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest. 

The expedition, which has been inspired by the Union Government’s “Namami Gange” campaign, has been named “Mission Gange.” The month long rafting expedition, will see the group travel through the river from Haridwar to Patna, with halts at Bijnor, Narora, Farrukhabad, Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, and Buxar. At each of these nine cities, the group will raise awareness about keeping the Ganga clean, and also undertake cleaning activities. 

Interacting with the group, the Prime Minister appreciated the group members for undertaking this initiative. He underlined the importance of a clean and vibrant River Ganga. He particularly urged the group to reach out to schoolchildren as part of their awareness activities in the cities they are transiting through.

Secretary General of United Nations, His Excellency António Guterres Ji, my colleague in Council of ministers Sushma Swaraj Ji, Dr. Harsh Vardhan Ji, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Executive Director of United Nations’ Environment Programme Erik Solheim, guests from India and abroad who are present here, 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I am extremely grateful to the United Nations for this honor. It’s a matter of great pride for us that this programme is organised on Indian soil and Secretary General of United Nations, Erik and his entire team have come here. As I have already said that this honor is the result of the commitment of 1.25 billion people of India towards the environment. Champions of the Earth Award is an honor to that ancient tradition of India that sees the God in  nature, that invokes the God in the five basic elements of the creation -  earth, sky, fire, water and air. 

This honour is for those tribal brothers and sisters inhabiting the forests of India who love forests more than their lives. This honor is for those Indian fishermen who take away from rivers only as much that is required for their livelihoods. These are those people who perhaps have not attended any school or college but these people stop going to seas during the time of breeding of fishes. They stop their work. 

This honor is for those millions and millions of Indian farmers for whom the cycle of weather is synonymous with the cycle of life and those who love this soil more than their lives. 

This is an honor to that Indian lady for whom reuse and recycle has been part of daily life for centuries, who sees the form of god in the plants, who plucks the leaves of Tulsi plant by counting them and for whom feeding food-grain to ants is an act of righteous deed.

This honor is for those unknown faces in India who have dedicated their life for the protection of nature and environment in the country and for those who have been working in some remote village or habitation or on some hill or in some tribal areas for years without concerns of  loss and gain or happiness or prosperity. 

Once again, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for this honor. 

It is also an occasion of two honors for India because Kochi airport is also awarded. It is a symbol of our commitment for the sustainable energy. 

On this occasion, I congratulate to all those colleagues and institutions who have been awarded in different countries of the world. 

Friends,

I talk of Indian philosophy with regard to environment and nature because climate and calamity are directly related to the culture. It is difficult to escape calamity till the time concerns about climate become part of the culture. 

Today, the world is accepting India’s sensitivity towards environment. However, as I have said earlier that it has been part of our lifestyle for thousands of years and Sushma ji has referred to this just a while ago. We are a part of that society where the first thing we do after waking up in the morning is to seek forgiveness of the Mother Earth because we are going to step on it, in a way we are going to place our burden on the earth. 

It is said in our tradition: 

Samudra Vasane Devi Parvat Stan Mandite,

Vishnu Patni Namastubhyam Pad Sparsham Kshamasvamev. 

It means, O Goddess Earth, the wife of Lord Vishnu, who dons the seas as her clothes and whose body is in the form of mountains, I bow down to you. Please forgive me because I place my feet on you. 

This sensitivity is part of our life. Worshipping the plants and trees, celebrating the weather and seasons for fasting and as festivals, talking about the relationship with nature in our folklores, we have always considered the nature as a living being. And it’s not just that we have considered it as a living being but a living being with whom we live. In our tradition, the well being of the entire universe is considered the most important thing because of this relationship with the nature. 

And in this context the Yajurved says; 

Om Dwaiah Shanti Antariksham Shantih,

Prithvi Shantih Rapah Shantiroshadhayah Shanti,

Vanaspatayah Shantir, Vishve Devah Shanti, Brahmam Shantih,

Sarvam Shantih, Shantirev Shantih, Sa Ma Shanti Redhi.

Om Shantih, Shantih, Shantih. 

Friends, 

In this Sanskrit Shlok (verse) it is prayed to God: May there be peace in air; may there be peace in the space; may there be peace on the earth; may there be peace in water; may there be peace in herbs and medicines; may there be peace in the trees and plants; may there be peace in the world; may there be peace in all the gods. 

In our tradition, no yajna or ritual is being considered complete without invoking this mantra for the peace in the entire world, it is not considered complete till the time it is invoked. Moreover, when God had to introduce himself, when God is required to explain about his expanse then God himself says: 

Shrotasya Asmi Jahnavi

Sansar Asmi Sagar. 

It means that I am the lake, I am the river and I am the sea too. That is why the award that you bestowed upon me, is an honour to the people of India and  an honour to the beliefs held by them. 

Friends,

Today, the economy of India is growing at a rapid pace. Every year millions and millions of people are coming out of abject poverty. We are committed to further increase this speed of development. It’s not because that we need to compete against somebody or we are greedy for money, it is because we cannot leave one part of our population to bear the brunt of poverty. 

It is the responsibility of all of us to provide them a dignified life. The poorest people in several countries of the world have been facing the adverse impact of mindless exploitation of the nature. The intensity of drought and floods is increasing every year. And  people who are poor, who have limited means, are the worst sufferers of these developments. 

That is why there is a need to provide assistance to connect these people, who are extremely large in numbers, with the development without putting extra burden on the nature. There is a need to hold their hand. 

And that is why I have advocated for it in Paris too. And I have placed a word before the world and I have advocated about climate justice. We can’t come out of this challenge of climate change without ensuring climate justice, we can’t come out of this situation. I am happy that the world has accepted it in the Paris agreement and has shown commitment on climate justice. However, we need to do a lot more to realise it on the ground and we need to do it fast. 

I am particularly grateful to His Excellency António Guteres because he accepted this demand of the time and he has made all out efforts for implementing the sustainable development goals and for the ratification process of the second commitment of the Kyoto Protocol. 

And that is why we have been moving ahead on the path of Sabka Satha, Sabka Vikas in India. And when I talk about Sabka Vikas then the nature is also included in it and I also appeal for the active participation of all, it means active participation of 1.25 billion countrymen. 

Friends,

Both villages and cities are important pillars of our economy. In our country, a big part of employment is related to villages and farming and our cities are the hubs for services and manufacturing. And that is why the government has been working with a holistic approach. 

For the country’s present and its future, the basis for every government policy is a clean and green environment. 

Friends, 

Our villages have always been conscious about the nature, they have remained connected to the nature. In the last four years, the villages of our country have further expanded this eternal strength of them. 

The efforts like ‘waste to wealth’ and ‘waste to energy’ for converting bio-waste into energy have been made in the villages too. ‘More crop Per Drop’ has been encouraged from Organic Farm to Soil heath Cards. 

It has been helping in setting our land and water sources free of poisonous chemicals and it has strengthened the need for proper utilization of water. And when we talk about industry and manufacturing then our motto is zero defect and zero effect. And when we talk about agriculture then our motto is more crop per drop.

Friends,

Today, India is among those countries of the world where urbanization is taking place at the fastest speed. In such a situation we have been laying emphasis on making our city life smart and sustainable. 

Today, whatever next generation infrastructure is required in the country that is being developed with the objective of sustainable environment and inclusive growth. Today, the work is going on at a fast speed to develop 100 smart cities. Smart services from sewer to surveillance are being developed. 

As per the suggestions given by the local people, cutting-edge technology and renewable energy is adopted as the basis of these systems. National highways and expressways of the country are being made eco- friendly. Green corridors are being developed along the highways. We have been making every possible effort to meet all the energy requirements of the other services developed along the new highways through solar power. City transport network like metro rail are being connected to the solar energy and we are also trying to reduce the railways’ dependence on fossil fuels. 

Friends,

Today, in India, a movement for water and energy conservation is going at a fast pace from homes to lanes, from offices to roads and from port to airport.  New technologies are being promoted from LED bulbs to rainwater harvesting. 

Not only this, we have been working at a fast speed to turn household kitchens to transport sector into clean fuel based kitchens and transportation. 

In the last four years, more than 10 crore households have been linked with LPG and more than 5.5 crore gas connections were given free through the Ujjwala scheme. In addition to setting the households free of smoke, the movement to set the mobility free of smoke is also going on. The work on NCAP or National Clean Air Programme is going on to improve the air quality. When the issue of setting the emission standards for vehicle was discussed then we decided to straight away implement the BS-6 standards from existing BS-4. 

Friends,

Today, at a time when the focus of India is on ease of living, when homes for all, electricity for all, food for all, education for all and employment for all are the important aspects for us even at such a time our commitment towards employment has gone up, we never allowed any laxity on it. Our effort is to bring the emission intensity down by 20-25% in the next two years in comparison with the level witnessed in 2005. We have been trying to bring it down by 30-35% by 2030. If we have attained the biggest success in all this, then it is because of the change that has come about in the behavior and thought process of the people. 

In addition to our faith, now our inclination towards environment is being strengthened in our deeds as well. And that is the reason that India could set itself free of single use plastic by 2022. 

I am confident that India will realise these resolves by taking inspiration from the towering personality of Mahatma Gandhi and it will emerge as a role model for the world. I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the United Nations for honouring the efforts made by India. 

All of you have participated in this important occasion by taking out your time. It is my personal responsibility that we should not leave any stone unturned in achieving those goals for which we have marched ahead. I convey my heartfelt thanks to all of you for coming forward to encourage us. 

Thank you.

Secretary General of United Nations, Excellency, Antonio Guterres, All the ministers of Indian Ocean Rim Association countries and International Solar Alliance Assembly who are present here, all my cabinet colleagues present here, friends from industry, distinguished guests, particularly the young student friends, ladies and gentlemen, 

Today morning, along with Excellency, Antonio Guterres I got the opportunity to participate in an important function related to cleanliness. The celebrations on the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in the country and the world too have been starting from today itself. There cannot be a more appropriate occasion than today for the beginning of this deliberation of a green future. 

International Solar Alliance (ISA) and I would want that this word ISA should become popular; rather it should be ISA Assembly. Whether it is global renewable energy investment and expo or a re-invest meeting or whether it is Indian Ocean Rim Association Energy Meet, the broad objective of all these three are the same – preparing an alternative of clean energy for a green future. 

Friends, 

In the last 150-200 years, the human race has largely been dependant on the fossil fuels for meeting its energy requirements. And we all bear testimony to the fact that how nature has rejected it and even today it is rejecting it. The nature is constantly giving usthis message that the energy available above the ground, be it solar power, wind power or hydro power, that is the solution for a better and safe future. 

I am happy that today all of us have gathered to deliberate upon this message conveyed to us by the nature. 

Friends, 

I still remember that I had put forth India’s resolve for moving from megawatt to gigawatt in the field of renewable energy before our countrymen in the first meeting of re-invest three years ago. I had clarified this thing at that time that we will be able to take advantage of solar and green energy only when it becomes affordable and easily available. And I had also put forward a proposal to create a common platform of the countries rich in solar resources. I am happy that we have received unprecedented successin taking forward these schemes in an extremely short span of time. 

Friends,

Today, International Solar Alliance has emerged as a big ray of hope for the world. Within three years, this organization has become a treaty based inter governmental organization. 1.25 billion Indians are happy over this thing that the headquarter of ISA is located in India too. This further increases our affinity towards ISA. 

I believe that whenever the issue of top human welfare organizations established during the 21st century will be discussed then the ISA’s name will figure at the top of it. We have created a massive platform in form of the ISA for ensuring climate justice. All of us have collectively provided a huge gift linked to humanity to the future generations. 

Friends, 

I have always believed that International Solar Alliance (ISA) is going to play the same role which is being played by OPEC in meeting the energy needs of the world today. Sun rays are going to play the same role in future that is being played by oil wells today. I especially express gratitude to the United Nations for providing the active support in taking the initiative of the ISA where it is today. Presence of the then United Nations’ general secretary, Excellency Ban Ki-moon in the program to launch the ISA in Paris and the presence of Excellency, Antonio Guterres in today’s program shows that how much importance United Nations attaches to this forum. On this occasion, I also express my heartfelt gratitude for the President of France and French Government for their support and cooperation. 

Friends, 

Representatives of 40 countries are present in this first assembly of ISA. However, now we need to move forward in that direction where these options of solar energy do not remain confined to the one hundred or one hundred twenty five nations located around Capricorn but the entire world should benefit from it. 

As per the spirit of universal cooperation on solar energy, India is going to put forwardthe proposal for the membership of all the members of United Nations in the ISA assembly. 

Friends, 

India, being an important member of this organisation, gives a lot of importance toIndian Ocean Rim Association. We have similar challenges in the field of energy. That is why, given our energy security requirements, all of us need to lay a collective emphasis on the renewable energy. 

I have already placed the spirit of SAGAR - security and growth for all in the region before everybody earlier. I am confident that this meeting will open new doors of cooperation. 

Friends,

The impact of increasing use of renewable energy in India is now becoming visible. We have started to work on action plan for deployment of renewable energy to meet the targets set under the Paris Climate Agreement. We have decided to produce forty percent of our electricity through non-fossil fuel based resources by the year 2030.As per this target, we have doubled our renewable energy capacity to72 gigawatt in the last four years. In this thing, our solar energy capacity has grown by nine times. Today, non-hydro renewable energy accounts for 20% of the total electricity produced by us. Not only this, we are going to add nearly 50 gigawatt capacity to it very soon. It’s a clear indication that we have been successfully moving on the path to achieve the target of 175 gigawatt by 2022 that we have set for ourselves and we willcertainly be able to achieve it. 

Friends,

Today, India is fastening its speed of development with the new confidence of‘poverty to power’. We have selected the same source to provide strength to our new confidence that has been a source of our strength and energy for thousands of years. And this source is the Sun which has been worshipped by us, the people of India as the Sun God.

Friends,

The Sun is the God of light and energy for us. We believe that the Sun provides momentum to the entire creation. It has been a natural tradition of our social life to start the day by offering water to the first ray of the Sun and by chanting the mantra: Om SuryayNamah (I bow down to the Sun God). 

From Ved to Yog, the Sun has been the source of our thinking, our worship, and of our internal energy. We are now determined to convert this internal energy into a solution for our external energy requirements through the power of modern science. 

Friends,

India has been working in the field of solar power at a rapid pace. In the last four years, the solar power has become very affordable which has made possible our target to connect several poor people with the electricity at a rapid pace. 

‘Panel to Power’ and ‘Make in India’ are very important milestone in our target of providing electricity to every household. I am happy that India has emerged as the most preferred destination in the field of renewable energy in the last four years. An investment of nearly 42 billion has been made during this period. 

Friends,

These changes taking place in the field of solar power do not only provide an opportunity for foreign investment but they also provide an unprecedented opportunity for our entrepreneurs. We have been trying to create a strong eco-system for solar panel manufacturing in the country. 

This is the most appropriate time for investing into the renewable energy sector. I see the possibility of business worth nearly $70 to 80 billion in this sector in the next four years. 

Friends,

Along with power generation, power storage is also extremely important, and the work for creating necessary infrastructure for this thing has been done under the national energy storage mission. Under this mission, the government has been laying emphasis on providing necessary policy support for demand creation, indigenous manufacturing, innovationand for increasing theenergy storage capacity. 

The arrangements have been made to install solar panels in farms in villages and for connecting them with the grid through the KUSAM – KisanUrjaSurakshaEvamUtthanMahaAbhiyan. Nearly 28 lakh solar pumps will be installed across the country in the next four years. A target of producing nearly 10 gigawatt of electricity through them has been set. 

Friends,

In addition to solar and wind power, we have been working on B-3 which means biomass, bio-fuel and bio-energy at a fast pace. Serious efforts have been made to develop clean fuel based transport system in India. We have been turning this challenge into an opportunity by producing bio-fuel from bio-gas. We have put forward a massive scheme – GobarDhan (Make money through cow dung) for this purpose. Several novel experiments have been conducted across cities and villages for converting the waste into energy. 

Friends,

For protection of environment, the work is already being carried out in the field of renewable energy, but conservation of electricity is also among one of our priorities. 

Today, a massive movement to illuminate the homes, streets and roads through LED bulbs has been going on in every nook and corner of India under the Ujala scheme. Nearly 31 crore LED bulbs have been distributed under the scheme. These 31 crore LED bulbs, it’s a massive number and nearly 40,000 million kilowatt hour electricity is being saved every year due to this thing. Can anybody imagine its magnitude? Not only this, it has saved nearly Rs. 16,000 crore of the people of the country in a year on account of electricity bill and we have prevented generation of carbon dioxide in a big way. 

And I would like to say it once again that it is just the beginning. Future is full of several opportunities. We must look at the possibility of every opportunity related to the climate justice for the future generations and we must succeed.

I believe that all of you will thoroughly discuss these opportunities in the next three days and will contribute in further illumination and beautification of the renewable future. 

I assure you people that your every suggestion, every innovative idea will be extremely important for us. And that is why we openly bring to the fore all these things be it human resource development or be it technology up gradation or be it the small experiments conducted by ordinary people in the new countries of the world and I am confident that we can complete this mission. And the issue of globalization was discussed a lot in the economic world and technology brought the world extremely close to each other. We too have started with one dream: One World, One Sun, One Grid.

If we materialize this mission then you can imagine that if this grid starts at the place of sunrise and goes till the time sun sets then we can harness electricity from the Sun round the clock. Today, we only think in terms of availability of the sun light in hours in our own country, however, if we move ahead with the dream of One World, One Sun, One Grid, then it will not be impossible to produce electricity somewhere at some point of time because the Sun must be shining on someplace on the earth all the time, if the Sun never sets then why should the generation of electricity stop. 

There is a need to think in a novel way. And I believe thatwe will certainly move ahead to play our important role in building a new world with a new confidence, with new ideas, with a new energy and new resolve on the occasion of this important programme of ISA. 

Once again I express my sincere gratitude to you peoplefor visiting India, for participating in this important programto contribute in the bright future of the world. 

Thank you very much.

                His Excellency, Secretary General of United Nations AntónioGuterres, the honorable ministers of different countries from all over the world who are present here to support me in my pledge of cleanliness, my colleagues in the council of ministers Sushma Ji, Uma Bharti Ji, HardeepPuriJi, Ramesh Ji and distinguished guests from all over the world,  brothers and sisters, 

I wholeheartedly welcome all of you in India, in this land of venerable Bapu. I greet all of you on behalf of 1.25 billion Indians. I am extremely fortunate to be amongst all of you, amongst the world leaders, amongst the top personalities of the world in the field of sanitation and sustainable development because of your commitment towards for the important issue of cleanliness, and also for presenting it before the mankind in a collective manner and for inspiring them.  

I am extremely grateful to you people for your participation in Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention and sharing the experiences of your countries and in a way also for enriching this summit with your experiences, your ideas and your vision. 

Today, when the world is passing through a challenging phase then coming together of so many countries on such an important issue related concerning mankind and deliberating over the issue in itself is an unprecedented event. 

I believe that today’s programme, this opportunity is going to be a milestone in the direction of global sanitation, it’s going to be milestonein the programmes related to welfare of mankind because of the time spared by you people and your participation.

Friends, 

Today, we have been ushering into 150thyear of birth of Mahatma Gandhi and also taking steps to celebrate his 150th birth anniversary in a comprehensive manner throughout the world. I respectfully offer my tribute to venerable Bapu on behalf of everyone. And I see that venerable Bapu’s dream was a solemn pledge for cleanliness. And today when I got the opportunity to honor different people associated with thecleanliness then in a way we also got the opportunity to pay our respect by doing the job in addition to paying our homage. 

All of you have also spent a day at Bapu’sashram in Sabarmati, the place at the bank of river Sabarmati from where venerable Bapu had prepared the country for freedom struggle. You people have observed the simplicity and the life of that place from close quarters. I am confident that the ideas of Bapu would have certainly become an opportunity to provide a new energy, new spirit and new inspiration to the people associated with the cleanliness mission. And it is also worthwhile that we have also gathered here on the occasion of completion of Mahatma Gandhi International Convention today itself. 

I also got the opportunity to honor and reward some Swachchagrahis (cleanliness volunteers) here just a while ago. I congratulate all the award winners; I especially bow down to the venerable mother because in a way she has actively taken upon herself the responsibility of the campaign since the time of the start of this mission. A lot of such people have converted this cleanliness mission into a people’s movement and into an extremely powerful force by getting inspired from such great souls, from such people, from the lives of such stalwarts and sages.

Friends, 

When Gandhi Ji had been leading the freedom movement then once he had remarked that if someone asks him about the cleanliness and independence then he would say that he gave priority to cleanliness over independence. Gandhi Ji who spent his entire life for freedom struggle, even he had pledged to give priority to cleanliness over independence. 

In 1945, he had reduced his thoughts into writing, he penned them down and he had presented them in the published form of a constructive programme. The essential things that I have discussed, they also included the important aspect of rural cleanliness mentioned in that document of Mahatma Gandhi. 

The issue is that why Gandhi Ji consistently laid so much emphasis on cleanliness? Was it just because lack of cleanliness leads to diseases? My conscience says this was not the reason. It was not such a narrow objective. 

Friends, 

If you look at it carefully, if you think over it then you would realise that if you do not clean or remove filth then that lack of cleanliness becomes a reason for us to develop a tendency of accepting the circumstances, we tend to develop those habits. If something is unclean, if a place is not clean and if the person present there does not change the situation, if it does not clean it then gradually he starts to accept that filthiness and after sometime he develops this kind of state, this kind of mentality that he does not look dirtiness as dirtiness. So in a way that dirtiness grips the spirit of that person, it grips his thought process, it makes him stagnant. 

Now you think about just opposite situation when the person does not accept the dirtiness, lack of cleanliness and he makes an effort to clean it then his spirit also acquires a momentum and he develops a tendency of not accepting the situation as it is. 

When venerable Bapu turned cleanliness into the people’s movement then his thinking behind that thing was to change the mentality of that person. To take the people from the state of stagnation towards the state ofconsciousness; and this much was his effort to induce this spirit to end the stagnation and bring consciousness in its place. And when this consciousness was awakened in us Indians then we have seen the impact like freedom movement and the country achieved independence. 

Today, I accept this thing before you people, before the world that if we the people of India and several other people like me had not become familiar with the ideas of venerable Bapu, had we not made an attempt to understand his philosophy, had we not assessed his thoughts by giving it to the world; had we not understood them then perhaps this programme would not have become a priority for any government. 

Today, this has become a priority, and I also felt like to express it from the Red Fort on the 15th of August because the ideals and ideas of Gandhi Ji have left an impression on me. And precisely that is the reason that it has been giving inspirations to millions and millions of people, associating them in this work without any expectation. 

Today, I am proud that 1.25 billion Indians have made the Clean India Campaign the world’s biggest people’s movement by following the path shown by Gandhi Ji. 

And it is the result of this commitment of the people that the coverage of rural cleanliness which was nearly 38 per cent before 2014 has become 94 per cent today.Becoming 94% from 38% in just four years, this is the biggest and successful example of associating with the responsibilities of common man. 

Today, the number of open defecation free villages in India has crossed the figure of five lakh. Twenty five states of India have declared themselves open defecation free. 

Friends, 

Four years ago 60% of the world population who defecated in open were living in India. Today, it has come down from 60 per cent to 20 per cent. So in a way this effort made by us has been putting a new enthusiasm, new zeal in the world map. And this is also important that not only toilets are constructed, it’s not just that the villages and cities are becoming ODF, but more than 90% toilets are being used in regular manner. 

And the government is also constantly monitoring this thing that those villages and cities which have developed themselves free from open defecation should not fall back to their old habits. And for this thing, emphasis has constantly been laid on behavioural change and that is the most important thing. Investments are made for this purpose. 

Friends,

When we had started this work then this question was also raised that a lot of money will have to be spent on this programme. However, the government of India accorded more priority, placed more emphasis on the social change rather than allocation of money. And if the thinking changes then government is not needed to bring about the real change and people start doing it themselves. 

Today, when I hear or see about this thing that how Clean India Campaign has changed the behavior of the people of India, how the incidence of diseases has come down in the villages of India, how the expenditure on disease has come down and when I received this kind of information then I very much feel satisfied.  

Several institutions related to United Nations have also studied this thing and they have presented several dimensions of this Clean India Mission through their studies. 

Brothers and sisters,

Millions and millions of Indians have made this movement a symbol of hope and change. Today, Clean India Campaign is turning out to be the world’s biggest domino effect. 

Friends, 

Today, I also take pride over the fact that because of Clean India Mission, India has once again awakened towards its old insistence on cleanliness. This culture of cleanliness is inherent in our old tradition, thinking and culture. Bad habits cropped up at a later stage. Maharishi Patanjali had said this thing while talking about AshtankYogwhen he was explaining the correct path for mankind for leading a life.

Shauch, Santosh, Tapah, Swadhyay, Ishwar, Pranidhan Ni Niyamah,

It means that cleanliness is at the first place among those fives rules for leading a rich life for the man: personal cleanliness, being content, hard work, self-study and the consciousness of god, this was also advocated by Patanjali. Consciousness about god and penance too is possible only after achieving cleanliness. This virtue about cleanliness has been a part of India’s life.  

I got the opportunity to visit an exhibition on the way with His Excellency AntónioGuterres while coming to this hall. It has been depicted in the exhibition that what an excellent arrangement was made for toilets and sewerage in the Indus valley civilisation. 

Friends,

United Nations have been moving ahead to achieve sustainable development goals under the leadership of His Excellency AntónioGuterres. Seventeen targets like cleanliness in the world, freedom from open defecation and clean energy by 2030 have been set under it. It has been resolved to achieve them. 

Mr. Secretary General, 

Today, I assure you that India will play a leading role in it, and we will achieve our targets before time. Today, India is rapidly moving towards achieving the sustainable development goals with the help of rich tradition, ancient inspiration and modern speech and through effective programmes. 

Our government is laying equal emphasis on nutrition in addition to sanitation. In India, a people’s movement has also been started against malnutrition. VasudhaivaKutumbkam(the whole world is one family), it means that the job we have been doing, and our dedication for it, by considering the entire world as one family, is now before the entire world, before the mankind. 

Friends,

I would like to congratulate to all of you for this thing that after the four day long deliberations all of us have arrived at this conclusion that ‘four’ things are essential in order to make the world a clean place. And these ‘four Ps’ are our mantra: political leadership, public funding, partnership, people's participation. You people have recognised these four important mantras for comprehensive cleanliness through Delhi declaration. I express my gratitude to all of you for this thing. 

On this occasion, I would like express my gratitude for millions and millions of cleanliness volunteers and my friends in Media for taking forward this Clean India Mission, and I mention media because the Clean India Mission has changed the general perception about the media. My country can proudly say that every single small or big unit of the media of my country, be it print media or electronic media, they have regularly covered the people who are working for cleanliness, they have regularly covered good things and publicised them and in a way an atmosphere of inspiration was created through these news reports and that is why I would like to particularly thank media for its active contribution. 

Today, because of participation and contribution of all of you, our country is moving forward in the direction of realising this goal which seemed difficult, otherwise it would have been difficult. Our work is not over yet. We have not gathered here to be content. We have gathered here to get inspiration to finish the unfinished work at an even greater space. 

We need to move ahead and we need to pay our glorious homage of a clean and healthy India to the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. I am hopeful and I have full confidence that we the people of India will certainly be able to realise this dream, we will fulfill this solemn pledge and no Indian will lag behind in taking up whatever responsibility and in doing whatever hard work is required for this purpose. 

All of you have come here on this important occasion, you provided us the opportunity to welcome you in India and I thank all of you, I thank all the guests for this thing. 

Today, we also got the opportunity to release a stamp on revered Bapu on this important occasion on behalf of postal department of government of India. I….the active approach of the postal department of government of India and postal stamp is a messenger in itself, it connects with the history and also with the changing influence of the society. 

Today, I saw an important occasion – Vaishnav Jan To Tene Re Kahiye–revered Bapu was a global person. And it was said about him that if someone will be told about Bapu Ji after several centuries that there was a man like him then perhaps he will say: no, it’s not true, it may be an imagination, is it possible that there was a man like him! 

Revered Bapu was such a great soul and the thing that inspired him – Vaishnav Jan To TeneKahiye – a small idea had occurred to me that in 150 countries of the world, the well known lyricists, musicians, singers  etc., that all of them should come together to once again present Vaishnav Jan – in the same form. 

I had told Sushma Ji this thing in a routine way but the way Sushma Ji and her entire team, with the kind of commitment that our colleagues posted in all the missions world over accorded importance to it, and the kind of quality, and the way these foreigners have sung these things, I believe that perhaps they would have practiced it for several days, so in a way they would have immersed in the philosophy of Gandhi Ji. 

We have received a cassette but I can say this thing with confidence that these artists of those countries would be completely immersed in the philosophy of Gandhi Ji. They must have this question in their minds that what’s the matter, who is this great soul and they would have tried to understand the meaning of these things. This is for the first time that the global edition of the VaishnavBhajanhas been presented to the world. 

And I believe that this effort which has been made with regard to 150 years, this word, this scene, this has the identity of all the countries of the world and I was telling the Secretary General of United Nations  that today the flutistsfrom his mother land, from his home country were playing flute in the song. 

When the people of those countries will see, when they will hear the artist of their countries then a curiosity will be generated, and efforts will be made to understand it. 

We Indians are not even aware about the language in which this VaishnavBhajan (Devotional song) has been written. We have internalised it so much in our minds that no one knows about the original language of the song but we keep singing. We may have been educated or raised in any language but in every corner of the country you will find the people who sing it. 

And I believe that it will certainly carve out a place for itself throughout the world, it will carve out a place for itself in the minds of human race throughout the world. Once again I sincerely congratulate Sushma Ji’s team for this thing. 

 

Today, the results that we have got in the field of cleanliness, these results provide us the inspiration to do much more. We have never claimed that we have done everything. However, now we have this confidence that the filth that we were abhorrent of, the filth that we were not even ready to touch and we used to run away from it, we have succeeded in ensuring cleanliness by touching it and we can achieve even greater success. This belief has been strengthened that: the common man doesn’t like filth and that he is ready to associate itself with cleanliness. 

And Uma Bharti Ji, her department and her entire team, and all those citizens and different organizations of the country, those who have done this thing deserve to be praised, they deserve to be congratulated today. And I….to Uma Ji and Ramesh Ji and their entire team, and no one can imagine it from outside with what kind of dedication this work has been done even if government servants have some particular image outside. With regard to this thing, I can say that there is no bureaucracy, there is only one thing that is to follow the principles of Gandhi Ji and cleanliness. 

Such a massive work has been done as a team. Every official and employee big and small has made this programme his own. It’s very rare. 

And when I observe it thoroughly because of my emotional attachment only then I realise that how many people have been working on itso hard, how much effort they have been putting in, they are completely dedicated to it. Only then we experience a change in the country. 

Today, it is an occasion for me to make a solemn pledge and it is also an occasion to take satisfaction because my countrymen have taken it forward as a tribute, as a homage which is expressed in form of this work to honor the venerable Bapu in true sense of word. I once again thank all of you. 

Mr. Secretary General himself took time out to be with us on the occasion of birth anniversary of respected Bapu. And how we have been taking forward the goals set by United Nations in India, and he has graced the occasion by attending this programme when so many friends of the world are associated with it and today I sincerely thank him for thing too. 

Thank you very much to all of you.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the first Assembly of the International Solar Alliance at Vigyan Bhawan. The same event also marked the inauguration of the second IORA Renewable Energy Ministerial Meeting, and the 2nd Global RE-Invest (Renewable Energy Investors’ Meet and Expo). The Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, was present on the occasion.

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that in the last 150 to 200 years, mankind has depended on fossil fuels for energy needs. He said nature is now indicating that options such as solar, wind and water, offer more sustainable energy solutions. In this context, he expressed confidence that in future, when people talk of organisations for the welfare of mankind established in the 21st century, the International Solar Alliance will be at the top of the list. He said this is a great forum to work towards ensuring climate justice. He said the International Solar Alliance could replace OPEC as the key global energy supplier in the future.

The Prime Minister said that the effect of increased use of renewable energy is now visible in India. He added that India is working towards the goals of the Paris Agreement through an action plan. He said that the target is to generate 40 percent of India's total energy requirements in 2030, by non fossil fuel based sources. He said India is developing with a new self-confidence of ""Poverty to Power.""

The Prime Minister said that along with power generation, power storage is also important. In this context, he mentioned the National Energy Storage Mission. He said that under this Mission, the Government is focusing on demand creation, indigenous manufacturing, innovation and  energy storage.

The Prime Minister said that besides solar and wind power, India is working on biomass, biofuel and bio-energy. He said efforts are being made to make India's transport system clean fuel based. He said that by converting bio-waste to biofuel, India is converting a challenge into an opportunity.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC) in New Delhi. MGISC has been a 4-day international conference that has brought together Sanitation Ministers and other leaders in WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) from around the world. The Prime Minister visited a Digital Exhibition, accompanied by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres. From the dais, the dignitaries launched commemorative postage stamps on Mahatma Gandhi, and a medley CD based on Mahatma Gandhi’s favourite hymn – “Vaishnav Jana To.” The Swachh Bharat Awards were also distributed on this occasion.

In his address, the Prime Minister mentioned the emphasis that Mahatma Gandhi placed on cleanliness. He recalled Mahatma Gandhi's ""Constructive Programme"", published in 1945, where rural sanitation was an important subject.

The Prime Minister said that an unclean environment, if not cleaned, leads to a situation where one starts accepting circumstances. On the contrary, if one cleans up dirt in the surroundings, he gets energized, and then does not resign himself to existing adverse circumstances.

He said it was Mahatma Gandhi's inspiration, that led to the Swachh Bharat Mission. He added that inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, Indians have made the Swachh Bharat Mission the world's biggest people's movement. He said that rural sanitation, which stood at 38 percent in 2014, has now reached 94 percent. More than 5 lakh villages are now ODF, he added. He expressed satisfaction at the changing lifestyle of people in India, following Swachh Bharat Mission. He said India is on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. He highlighted the importance of the ""4 Ps"" in making the world clean: Political Leadership, Public Funding, Partnerships, and People’s participation.

                Your Excellency 

और मेरे मित्र राष्ट्रपति मिर्ज़ियोयेव, 

उज़्बेकिस्तान से आए सम्मानीय अतिथि और मित्रगण, 

भारतीय शिष्टमंडल के सदस्य, 


नमस्कार।
राष्ट्रपति जी, 



यह आपकी भारत की पहली state visit है। मुझे बेहद खुशी है कि यह यात्रा आप अपने परिवार और एक सशक्त delegation के साथ कर रहे हैं। आपका और आपके परिवार तथा delegation का स्वागत करते हुए मुझे बहुत हर्ष हो रहा है। उज्बेकिस्तान और भारत के बीच समानताएं और नज़दीकी रिश्तों के गवाह हमारे साझा इतिहास और संस्कृति हैं। ‘मेहमान’, ‘दोस्त’ और ‘अज़ीज़’ – ऐसे कितने ही शब्द दोनों देशों में सामान रूप से जाने जाते हैं। यह सिर्फ भाषा की समानता नहीं। यह दिलों और भावनाओं का मिलन है। मुझे गर्व है और प्रसन्नता भी, कि हमारे देशों के रिश्तों की बुनियाद इतनी मज़बूत नींव पर बनी है। राष्ट्रपति जी, आपसे मेरा परिचय 2015 में मेरी उज़्बेकिस्तान यात्रा के दौरान हुआ था। आपकी भारत के प्रति सदभावना और मित्रता ने, और आपके व्यक्तित्व ने मुझे बहुत प्रभावित किया है। यह हमारी चौथी मुलाकात है। मुझे ऐसा महसूस होता है कि आप एक घनिष्ठ मित्र हैं। अज़ीज दोस्त हैं। मुझे और भी अधिक प्रसन्नता है कि आपके साथ एक सशक्त delegation है। आपके आदेश और मार्गदर्शन पर पिछले कुछ दिनों में भारत में उनकी उपयोगी मुलाकाते हुई हैं। आज हमारे बीच बहुत ही सार्थक चर्चा हुई। भारत और उज़्बेकिस्तान के ऐतिहासिक संबंधों को और गहरा बनाने, और हमारी strategic partnership को और मज़बूत करने के हमारे vision और plans को हमने साझा किया है। हमारे पुराने दोस्ताना रिश्तों को आज के सन्दर्भ में और भी समृद्ध करने के लिए हमने long-term view लिया है। क्षेत्रीय महत्व के मुद्दे, जिनसे हमारी सुरक्षा, शान्ति, समृद्धि और सहयोग जुड़े हैं, उन पर भी सार्थक विचार-विमर्श हुआ है। इन मुद्दों पर, और Shanghai Cooperation Organisation समेत अंतरराष्ट्रीय मंचों पर, हमने हमारे सहयोग को और गहरा बनाने का निर्णय लिया है। आज की मुलाकात में हम इस बात पर पूरी तरह सहमत हुए हैं कि अब हमारे देशों के बीच के प्राचीन और प्रगाढ़ संबंधों को हमारे लोगों की आशाओं और अपेक्षाओं के अनुरूप विस्तार देने का समय आ गया है।

Excellency, 

आपके कई साहसी और ठोस क़दमों और सुधारों से उज़्बेकिस्तान पुरानी व्यवस्था को पीछे छोड़कर आधुनिकता की ओर तेज़ी से आगे बढ़ा है। यह आपके नेतृत्व और विज़न का परिणाम है। मैं इसका स्वागत करता हूँ। आपको बहुत बधाई देता हूँ और आगे और भी सफलता के लिए शुभकामनाएँ भी देता हूँ। 


Excellency, 

उज़्बेकिस्तान की प्राथमिकताओं के अनुसार भारत उन प्रयासों में सहयोग करने के लिए प्रतिबद्ध है। हमारे मौजूदा सहयोग को नए क्षेत्रों में बढ़ाने के लिए हमनें आज खासतौर पर चर्चा की। हम व्यापार और निवेश के रिश्तों को बढ़ाने पर सहमत हुए हैं। हमने 2020 तक एक बिलियन डॉलर का द्विपक्षीय व्यापार का target रखा हैं। हमने प्रिफरेन्शियल Trade Agreement पर negotiations शुरू करने का भी निर्णय लिया है। उज़्बेकिस्तान के प्रस्ताव पर, हमने उज़्बेकिस्तान के सामाजिक क्षेत्रों में कम लागत के घरों और ऐसे और भी social infrastructure projects के लिए 200 मिलियन डॉलर की Line of Credit प्रदान करने का निर्णय लिया है। इसके अलावा, 800 मिलियन डॉलर की Lines of Credit तथा Exim Bank द्वारा buyers क्रेडिट के अन्तर्गत भी हम उज़्बेकिस्तान के प्रस्तावों का स्वागत करेंगे। अंतरिक्ष, human resource development और Information Technology के क्षेत्रों में उज़्बेकिस्तान के हित के लिए भारत के अनुभव से लाभ उठाने का प्रस्ताव हमने रखा है। भारत और उज़्बेकिस्तान के राज्यों के बीच बढ़ते सहयोग का हम स्वागत करते हैं। आज आगरा और समरकंद के बीच ट्विनिंग agreement और गुजरात और उज़्बेकिस्तान के अंदिजन के बीच समझौते हुए हैं। भारत और उज़्बेकिस्तान के बीच connectivity में वृद्धि करने के रास्तों पर हमने विचार किया है। व्यापार और connectivity के लिए चाहबहार एक महत्वपूर्ण कड़ी है। भारत Ashgabat Agreement का February 2018 में सदस्य बना है। इसमें समर्थन के लिए हम उज़्बेकिस्तान के आभारी हैं। हमे ख़ुशी हैं कि उज़्बेकिस्तान International North South Transport Corridor में शामिल होने पर सहमत हुआ है।


Excellency, 

आपके वरिष्ठ सलाहकार और मन्त्री कल Gandhi Sanitation Convention के समापन समारोह में शामिल हो रहे हैं। महात्मा गांधी के सत्य, अहिंसा और शान्ति के संदेश के प्रति आपके मन में जो सम्मान है, उसने भारतीयों के हृदय को छू लिया है। ताशकंद से भारत के पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री श्री लाल बहादुर शास्त्री की स्मृति जुड़ी है। Shastri Jiके स्मारक और Lalbahadur Shastri School के renovation के लिए मैं आपका धन्यवाद करता हूँ। इन दोनों महान नेताओं की जन्मतिथि की पूर्व संध्या पर आपकी भारत में मौजूदगी हमारे लिए विशेष महत्व रखती है।

Excellency, 

यह प्रसन्नता का विषय है कि हमारे रक्षा संबंधों में वृद्धि हो रही है। आज की मुलाकात के दौरान हमने संयुक्त सैन्य अभ्यास और सैन्य शिक्षा एवं प्रशिक्षण समेत अन्य आवश्यक क्षेत्रों में रक्षा सहयोग बढ़ाने पर चर्चा की है। राष्ट्रपति जी, आपसे विचार-विमर्श ने एक बार फिर स्पष्ट किया है कि भारत और उज़्बेकिस्तान एक सुरक्षित और समृद्ध external environment चाहते हैं। क्षेत्रीय शांति और स्थिरता के लिए उज़्बेकिस्तान के प्रयासों की हम सराहना करते हैं। इसमें भारत उज़्बेकिस्तान के साथ हर संभव सहयोग करेगा। स्थिर, लोकतांत्रिक और समावेशी एवं समृद्ध अफ़ग़ानिस्तान हमारे पूरे क्षेत्र के हित में है। मुझे खुशी है कि इस संदर्भ में हमारे दोनों देशों के बीच नियमित रूप से सम्पर्क बनाए रखने का निर्णय हमने लिया है। सांस्कृतिक और people-to-people contacts हमारे संबंधों के आधार स्तंभ हैं। e-वीजा, पर्यटन, academic exchanges और air connectivity इत्यादि विषयों पर आज हमने चर्चा की है।

Excellency, 

अब हम एक नए दौर की ओर बढ़ रहे हैं जिसमें हमारे द्विपक्षीय संबंध नई ऊँचाइयां छुएंगे और हमारी strategic partnership को और मजबूत करेंगे। एक बार फिर आपका और आपके delegation का स्वागत करते हुए मैं भारत में आपके सुखद और फलदायी प्रवास की कामना करता हूँ।


बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद।

Thank you.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the signing of Bilateral Investment Agreement (BIA) between India Taipei Association (ITA) in Taipei and Taipei Economic and Cultural Center (TECC) in India.

 

The BIA is likely to increase investment flows between the parties. It will provide appropriate protection to investments on a reciprocal basis between ITA and TECC.  BIA is likely to increase the comfort level and boost the confidence of investors by assuring a level playing field and non-discrimination in matters related to investments, thus providing conducive investment climate to investors. It would help project India as a preferred foreigndirect investment (FDI) destination.

	High Level Steering Committee will review the National Indicator Framework on regular basis for its improvement.
	Data source Ministries / Departments will be responsible for providing regular information to MoSPI on these indicators at required intervals and disaggregation for national and sub-national reporting of SDGs.
	Advanced IT tools will be used for close and effective monitoring.


 

Major impact:

 


	SDGs integrate economic, social and environmental dimensions of development. It intends eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world with basic motto of 'SabkaSaathSabkaVikash'.
	SDGs with 17 Goals and 169 Targets intend for promotion of sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems.
	NIF will help in outcome-based monitoring & reportingon progress on SDGs at National level.


 

There is no direct financial implication on implementation of the National Indicator Framework.  However, the respective Ministries will need to re-align and strengthen their data systemsto facilitate monitoring of the SDG indicators.

 

SDGs are expected to bring change in the lives of people and the monitoring of progress of implementation of SDGs will benefit the entire nation.

 

Background:

 

At the Millennium Summit held in 2000 at the UN Headquarters in New York, eight development goals known as the 'Millennium Development Goals' (MDGs) were adopted, which formed the blueprint for countries to pursue their national development strategies from 2000 to 2015. The MDGscomprised eight Goals and addressed various development issues. The MDGs targets were unevenly achieved across the countries and a need was felt to start fresh discussions to assess the usefulness of the MDGs and to explore possible successor to guide development cooperation in the world beyond 2015.

 

The UN General Assemblyin its 70thSession considered and adopted the Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs) for the next 15 years. The 17 SDGs came into force with effect from 1stJanuary, 2016.Though not legally binding, the SDGs have become de facto international obligations and have potential to reorient domestic spending priorities of the countries during the next fifteen years. Countries are expected to take ownership and establish a national framework for achieving these Goals. Implementation and success will rely on countries' own sustainable development policies, plans and programmes. Countries would be responsible for follow-up and review at the national level, with regard to the progress made in implementing the Goals and targets. Actions at the national level to monitor progress under SDGs will require quality, accessible and timely data.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the closure of National Jute Manufactures Corporation Ltd. (NJMC) and its subsidiary Birds Jute & Exports Ltd. (BJEL). 

 

Procedure for Closure:

 


	Disposal of fixed assets as well as current assets will be in accordance with the guidelines of DPE dated 14.06.2018 and the proceeds from the sale of assets, after meeting the liabilities, will be deposited in Consolidated Fund of India.


 


	In accordance with the DPE guidelines dated 14.06.2018, a Land Management Agency (LMA) will be engaged for disposal of assets. The LMA will be directed to carry out a thorough verification of the assets before undertaking their disposal in accordance with the DPE guidelines.


 


	Ministry of Textiles does not propose to use any land or building of BJEL for its own purposes or for any of its other CPSEs and the Land Management Agency will be informed upfront accordingly.


 

Benefits:

The decision will benefit the Government exchequer in reducing recurring expenditure incurred in operating both the sick CPSEs in running their activities. The proposal will help in closing loss making companies and ensuring release of valuable assets for productive use, or for generating financial resources for developmental progress.

 

The available land with both the CPSEs will be put up for public use/other government use for overall development of society.

 

Background:


	NJMC has been incurring losses for several years and was under reference to BIFR since 1993. The company's primary product was hessian jute bags used for packaging of food grain used by the various State Governments. Over the years, the demand for hessian bags has eroded and to that extent, it has been found to be no longer commercially viable to run the company;


 


	The Mills of NJMC which were proposed for revival, namely, Kinnison Mill at Titagarh, Khardah Mill at Khardah and RBHM Mill at Katihar are under suspension since August, 2016 (the last mill to be closed was Kinnison Jute Mill on 31.8.2016), because of the failure of the Job Contractor to execute the job efficiently and problems with the local labour. The different models of outsourcing operations which were attempted have not been successful. Looking at its past performance, market conditions and the competition from plastics and the capacity of private jute mills, it was noted that NJMC would not be in a position to recoup its negative net worth through operational profits. Also, NJMC has no staff/workers on its rolls. Hence, the closure; 


 


	BJEL, the subsidiary of NJMC, was referred to BIFR, which had considered a Revival Scheme. The Draft Revival Scheme could not be implemented because conversion of land use was not agreed to by the West Bengal Government and the representative of the State Government to the ASC was nominated after a three year delay. BJEL has no staff and as the factory is not in operation; closure does not have any adverse implications.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the payment of Productivity Linked Bonus (PLB) equivalent to 78 days’ wages for the financial year 2017-18 for all eligible non-gazetted Railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel). The financial implication of payment of 78 days’ PLB to railway employees has been estimated to be Rs.2044.31 crore.  The wage calculation ceiling prescribed for payment of PLB to the eligible non-gazetted railway employees is Rs.7000/- p.m.  The maximum amount payable per eligible railway employee is  Rs.17,951 for 78 days. About 11.91 lakh non-gazetted Railway employees are likely to benefit from the decision.

 

The Productivity Linked Bonus on Railway covers all non-gazetted railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) who are spread over the entire country.  Payment of PLB to eligible railway employees is made each year before the Dusshera/ Puja holidays.  The decision of the Cabinet shall be implemented before the holidays for this year as well.  For the year 2017-18 PLB equivalent to 78 days’ wages will be paid which is expected to motivate the employees for working towards improving the performance of the Railways.

 

Background:

 

Railways were the first departmental undertaking of the Government of India wherein the concept of PLB was introduced in the year 1979-80. The main consideration at that time was the important role of the Railways as an infrastructural support in the performance of the economy as a whole. In the overall context of Railway working, it was considered desirable to introduce the concept of PLB as against the concept of Bonus on the lines of ‘The Payment of Bonus Act - 1965’.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the merger of the existing regulatory institutions in the skills space - National Council for Vocational Training (NCVT) and the National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) into the National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET).

 

Details: 

NCVET will regulate the functioning of entities engaged in vocational education and training, both long-term and short-term and establish minimum standards for the functioning of such entities. The primary functions of NCVET will include -


	recognition and regulation of awarding bodies, assessment bodies and skill related information providers; 
	approval of qualifications developed by awarding bodies and Sector Skill Councils (SSCs); 
	indirect regulation of vocational training institutes through awarding bodies and assessment agencies; 
	research and information dissemination; 
	grievance redressal.


 

The Council would be headed by a Chairperson and will have Executive and Non-Executive Members. Since NCVET is proposed to be set up through merger of two existing bodies, the existing infrastructure and resources will be utilized for the most part. In addition, a few more posts will be created for its smooth functioning. The regulator will follow the best practices of regulatory processes, which will help ensure that it performs its functions professionally and as per the applicable laws.

Benefits:

 

This institutional reform will lead to improvement in quality and market relevance of skill development programs lending credibility to vocational education and training encouraging greater private investment and employer participation in the skills space. This in turn will help achieve the twin objectives of enhancing aspirational value of vocational education and of increasing skilled manpower furthering the Prime Minister's agenda of making India the skill capital of the world.

 

Being a regulator of India's skill ecosystem, NCVET will have a positive impact on each individual who is a part of vocational education and training in the country. The idea of skill-based education will be seen in a more inspirational manner which would further encourage students to apply for skill-based educational courses. This is also expected to facilitate the ease of doing business by providing a steady supply of skilled workforce to the industry and services.

 

Background:

 

In an effort to realize India's demographic dividend, its workforce needs to be equipped with employable skills and knowledge so that they can contribute to economic growth in a substantive manner.  In the past, most of the country's skill training needs were met through courses offered by the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and under the Modular Employable Scheme (MES), regulated by NCVT. Since this infrastructure was not enough to meet the increasing skill requirements of the country as well as the skilling needs of the growing workforce, the Government took a number of initiatives to scale up the skilling efforts. These efforts resulted in a large expansion of training infrastructure much of which is in the private sector. At present, there are 20 Ministries/ Departments implementing skill development programs mostly using private sector training providers.

 

However, in the absence of adequate regulatory oversight, numerous stakeholders have been offering training programs of varying standards with multiplicity in assessment and certification systems which are not comparable, with serious consequences for the vocational training system and thus the employability of the country's youth. An attempt towards some measure of regulation was made with the establishment of the National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) in 2013, to coordinate and harmonize the skill development efforts of the government and the private sector. The primary role of NSDA has been to anchor and operationalize the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) to ensure that quality and standards meet sector specific requirements.

 

However, a need was felt for an overarching regulatory authority which could tend to all aspects of short-term and long-term skill-based training. In view of this, NCVET is envisaged as an institution which will perform the regulatory functions so far vested in NCVT and NSDA. Regulatory functions currently being carried out by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) through the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) will also be housed in the NCVET.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the redevelopment of Railway Stations by Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC) as Nodal Agency and main Project Development Agency, through simplified procedures adapting various business model and for longer lease tenure of upto 99 years. Thus, paving the way for large scale modernisation and ensure world class infrastructure.

Redevelopment of major stations across the country is planned by leveraging commercial development of land and air space in and around the station. This program will help provide state-of-the-art amenities for passengers, generate additional revenues and will be overall at least cost neutral to Ministry of Railways (MoR) over a basket of stations. Furthermore, redevelopment of railway stations across the country will have a multiplier effect in the economy with increased job creation and improved economic growth.

IRSDC being the Nodal agency will prepare the overall strategic plan and business plans for individual or a group of stations ensuring cost neutrality of this program. Upon approval of business plans by MoR, IRSDC or other Project Development Agencies will take up the work of station redevelopment. Railway/RLDA/IRSDC will be planning and development authority for Railway land in consultation with urban local bodies, DDA or other UTs, to transfer land on free hold basis to Railways. This would enable Ministry of Railways to accelerate the redevelopment of major stations across the country on an overall cost neutral basis. These redevelopment efforts will lead to creation of State-of-the-art smart stations that will function as mini smart cities.

Railway passengers and Industry shall be benefited at large. Passengers will now get amenities at par with international railway terminals and a large number of local job creation is expected as a positive external outcome of this program. 

Background:

A Cabinet approval was obtained on 24th June 2015 to redevelop ‘A1’ and ‘A’ category stations by Zonal Railways through Cabinet approved procedures and for a lease period of 45 years.  However, insufficient interest was visible amongst the prospective bidders. During various interactions with developers, investors and other stakeholders, various issues including multiple sub leasing, simplified bid procedures etc. were repeatedly raised. Therefore, an improvised and simpler program design including these issues and under a specialized executing agency (IRSDC), incorporating suitable structural, process and parameters changes, has been adopted to revamp the station redevelopment program.

Considering Russia's proven experience in adoption of technology in the road transport sector, it would be beneficial to learn from such best practices through close interaction. India is implementing at a rapid pace its highway infrastructure augmentation plans.  To make full use of the road infrastructure it is necessary to embrace technology to enhance transport productivity and safety. This will also help in reducing overall logistic cost.  India's own plans for massive highway and expressway infrastructure development can be attractive opportunity to infrastructure development entitles in the Russia. A partnership between the two countries will provide a platform for interaction at the operational level and supplement initiatives associated with all International groupings and forums where both countries are members.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the increase in supervisory visit charges for ASHA Facilitators from Rs. 250/-per visit to Rs. 300/- per visit for 2018-2019 to 2019- 2020 w.e.f from October 2018 (to be paid in November, 2018). ASHA Facilitator will undertake about 20 supervisory visits per month. With the proposed increase, ASHA Facilitators would receive about Rs 6000 per month against Rs 5000 per month that is an increase of Rs 1000/- per month.

Details:


	Enrolment of ASHA facilitators under Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana as part of ASHA Benefit package.
	To motivate ASHA facilitators to perform better, the supervisory visit charges for ASHA Facilitators has been increased from Rs. 250/-per visit to Rs. 300/- per visit w.e.f from October 2018 (to be paid in November, 2018). 
	With the approved increase, ASHA Facilitators would receive about Rs 6000 per month against Rs 5000 per month, that is an increase of Rs 1000/- per month.


The existing institutional mechanisms for the National Health Mission (NHM) would be utilised to implement the decision.

The proposal entails an estimated additional expenditure of Rs.46.95 crore comprising of Rs 15.65 crore during 2018-19 (for six months) and Rs.31.30 crore during 2019-20 as central share.

Benefits:


	41,405  ASHA facilitators 
	This is in addition to the following benefits extended by earlier Cabinet Decision on 19.9.2018:



	Coverage of 10, 63, 670 ASHAs and ASHA Facilitators  under Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana.
	Increase in routine and recurring incentives from Rs 1000/- per month to Rs 2000/- per month to benefit 10, 22,265 ASHAs.
	Increase in honorarium for nearly 27,00,000 Anganwadi Workers/ Anganwadi Helpers


 

This will be implemented as part of ASHA Benefit Package approved in September, 2018.

Background:


	As part of support mechanism, an ASHA facilitator is in place for between 10 to 25 ASHAs, to provide handholding and mentoring support, and monitor performance. She is a critical link of the support structure network. Substantial progress has been made by states in setting up support structures during the last three years, as states have increasingly become cognizant of the correlation between strong support structures and an effective ASHA programme. The ASHA facilitators are generally selected from amongst the ASHAs themselves. This position also serves as a career opportunity for ASHAs with the requisite qualifications, experience and aptitude. 
	All states except Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala, Nagaland, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, West Bengal, Rajasthan and UTs have selected ASHA Facilitators.  In these states, on-the- job mentoring support to ASHAs is provided by ANMs or, as in the case of West Bengal, by the Supervisor appointed by the Gram Panchayat or PHC supervisors at PHC level, as in the case of Rajasthan.  Over half of the states (11 out of 19) that have ASHA Facilitators, have selected them from amongst a cluster of ASHAs, provided they meet all the selection criteria. These include states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Karnataka, Punjab and Sikkim. In other states, preference is given to ASHAs in selection of ASHA facilitators.Maharashtra, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and Gujarat. Goa does not have ASHAs.
	ASHA Facilitator undertakes about 20 supervisory visits per month.
	The role of ASHA Facilitators is broadly summarized as under:



	Conduct village visits (comprising of accompanying ASHA on household visits, conducting community/VHSNC meetings, attending Village Health and Nutrition Days). 
	Conduct cluster meetings of all ASHAs in the area once a month. 
	Enable ASHAs in reaching the most marginalized households.
	Support ASHA training at the block level.
	Facilitate selection of new ASHAs. 
	Facilitate grievance redressal. 



	Subsequent to the Cabinet approval, representations were received from ASHA Facilitators seeking increase in the supervisory visit charges. While the benefit of Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana was also provided to ASHA facilitators, ASHA Facilitators have been representing that their supervisory visit charges may also be enhanced which will motivate them to perform better.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved new Railway Line between Bahraich and Khalilabad via Bhinga, Shravasti, Balrampur, Utraula, Domariyaganj, Mehdawal, Bansi.   The total length of the new Broad Gauge line will be 240.26 kilometers. 

 

The total estimated cost of the project is Rs. 4939.78 crore. The project will be completed by 2024-25 and will lie in North Eastern Railway. This project will generate direct employment during construction for about 57.67 lakh man-days.

 

The new line will provide basic infrastructure support for industrial development having large socio-economic ramification. It will provide a direct broad gauge route to the project area which may boost the economic development of the region. This will also provide an alternative route of Bahraich-Khalilabad and connect border districts to each other. 

 

The approved line is passing through the district Shravasti (Bhinga) which is an important tourist place and closely associated with the life of Gautam Buddha.  Shravasti is also an important tourist centre for Jains as the Sobhanath temple is believed to be the birthplace of the Tirthankara Sambhavanath. The Devi Patan temple in Tulsipur which is close to Balrampur town, is one of the famous 51 Shakti Peethas of Maa Durga. The line will promote tourism in the region.

 

The project will provide rail facility to the people of the area falling under the project line and will help to grow small scale industries in the area. Four districts falling in this project length i.e. Bahraich, Balrampur, Shravasti and Siddharth Nagar are among the 115 aspirational districts identified by NITI Aayog. Hence, this project is needed for better socio economic development of the hinterland of this area with the help of rail network.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for closure of the Biecco Lawrie Limited (BLL) including giving Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS)/ Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) to the employees of the Company.

The idling assets of BLL will be subsequently put into productive use after meeting all the liabilities in accordance with the extant guidelines of the Government.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has taken various steps for revival of the Company from time to time. However, the Company could not be revived and further, there appeared no possibility of revival of the Company considering the competitive business environment as well as huge capital requirement. Continued loss has made further operations of the company not only unviable but also resulted in substantial distress to officials and staff due to uncertain future.

Background:

BLL is a Schedule ‘C’ Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) with 67.33% and 32.33% equity share held by Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB) and Government of India respectively. The remaining 0.44% shares are held by others.

The Company, having its registered Office and Headquarters at Kolkata, West Bengal operates in four business segments: Switchgear Manufacturing, Electrical Repair, Projects Division and Lube blending & filling facility.

The Company has consistently been under financial stress and has had performance-related issues. It has been making losses for the last several years. BLL’s accumulated losses had become more than the equity and the net worth had become negative. The Net worth of the Company stood  ₹ (-) 78.88 crore at the end of the FY 2017-18 and accumulated loss as on 31.03.2018 was  ₹ (-) 153.95 crore.

                Giving a boost to farmers’ income, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the increase in the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for all Rabi crops for 2018-19 to be marketed in 2019-20 season.  The farmer friendly initiative will give additional return to the farmers of Rs 62,635 crore by way of increasing MSP of notified crops to at least 50 per cent return over cost of production and will aid in doubling farmers’ income.

The increase in the MSPs of wheat has been raised by Rs.105 per quintal, safflower by Rs.845 per quintal, barley by Rs.30 per quintal, masur (lentil) by Rs.225 per quintal, gram by Rs.220 per quintal and rapeseed & mustard by Rs.200 per quintal is another major step in this regard.

 

Details:


	The MSPs fixed by the government for wheat, barley, gram, masur, rapeseed & mustard and safflower are much higher than the cost of production.
	For wheat the cost of production is Rs 866 per quintal and MSP is Rs 1840 per quintal which gives a return of 112.5 per cent over cost of production;
	for barley the cost of production is Rs 860 per quintal and MSP is Rs 1440 per quintal giving a return of 67.4 per cent;
	for gram cost of production is Rs 2637 per quintal and MSP is Rs 4620 per quintal giving a return of 75.2 per cent;
	for masur cost of production is Rs 2532 per quintal and MSP is Rs 4475 per quintal giving a return of 76.7 per cent;
	for rapeseed & mustard the cost of production is Rs 2212 per quintal and MSP is Rs 4200 per quintal giving a return of 89.9 per cent and
	for safflower the cost of production is Rs 3294 per quintal and MSP is Rs 4945 per quintal giving a return of 50.1 per cent.

                The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) signed an MoU with the Central University of Jammu (CUJ) in Jammu today for setting up of the Satish Dhawan Center for Space Science in the University in the presence of the Union Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Space, Dr Jitendra Singh. Secretary, Department of Space and ISRO Chairman, Dr.  K. Sivan, Prof. Ashok Aima, Vice Chancellor, CUJ and former ISRO Chairman Dr. K. Radhakrishnan were  also present on the occasion.

Another MoU was signed between CUJ and the Central Scientific Instruments Organization (CSIR-CSIO). To create awareness about space research and to motivate young minds to take up research related to space, astronomy, geology, atmospheric sciences and related fields, a two day workshop was also inaugurated at the CUJ campus. 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Jitendra Singh that the collaboration between ISRO and CUJ for establishing an ISRO Center at Jammu is a landmark achievement for the State. He urged the youth and the faculty of the Institute to develop scientific temper and generate interest in space research. He said that space technology has become an important part of our day-to-day lives from communication and weather forecasting to better rail-traffic management, better border surveillance and even searching for nearest toilets through mobile app etc. 

While taking about the establishment of the Satish Dhawan Center for Space Science at Central University of Jammu, Dr. K Sivan said that the Center will help in tapping potential of Space Applications for the region of J&K in various fields like disaster management, health, education, communication, weather forecasting, land use planning, etc. He said that this would provide opportunity to the youth of the region to contribute to the field of space science as well as to the nation. He further said ISRO is dedicated to the mission of utilizing space sciences for the benefit of mankind as envisaged by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and Prof Satish Dhawan, the founding fathers of ISRO.

The area of space applications is of particular interest to J&K and the larger Himalayan region as its economy and habitations are affected by vegetation cover, forest area, snow, landslides, avalanches, ground water, cloud cover, atmospheric conditions etc. which can be easily monitored from space through remote sensing. Considering the recurring natural calamities in the region, requirement of strengthening ground-based observational capabilities of this region for weather and atmospheric research is also of utmost important. The setting up of this Center will take care of the emerging Geospatial and Space Technology requirements for the development of the region.

The Satish Dhawan Centre for Space Science at CUJ will have facilities for Geospatial Data analysis that will help in sustainable use of natural resources and planning land-use pattern. It will have ground-based observations for Atmospheric Studies, research lab for astrophysics, Atmospheric Sensing and Glacier studies Lab for better use of large quantity of water stored in the form of seasonal snow, ice and glaciers in the rivers of North India. Apart from this, Disaster Management Center will also be set up here that would be able to take up research in the area of different disasters like flood, Landslides, forest fires, drought and climate change.

The establishment of Materials Sciences Lab for space applications as a part of the Satish Dhawan Center for Space Science at CUJ will be another outstanding feature of the Center where special focus will be to synthesize and design new sensors and materials for space applications.

This is the first of its kind institute coming up in Jammu and Kashmir and the building is proposed in an area of about 1,150 sq. m.

As part of outreach, Research and Development, awareness creation, training and skill development, ISRO has also started many other activities like setting up of Regional Academic Centers (RAC), Space Technology Incubation Centers (S-TIC), setting up of ISRO Chairs and Space Technology Cells in various parts of the country.

Space Sciences is a multidisciplinary subject which involves basic sciences such as physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, geology, planetary science, mathematics, atmospheric sciences, geography, space engineering and even space law.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that India has vindicated the vision of the founding father of country’s Nuclear Energy Programme, Dr Homi J. Bhabha, when he had said that India’s nuclear programme will be used for peaceful purposes. Delivering the inaugural address at the 10th Nuclear Energy Conclave here today, he said that the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Government has focussed on non-power applications of nuclear energy. The same principle has been promoted in other departments also such as Department of Space where use of space technology is being encouraged for the benefit of common man.

 

Dr Singh said that the Cabinet has given its approval for construction of 10 units of India’s indigenous Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR). This significant decision has been taken to fast-track India’s domestic nuclear power programme, and give a push to country’s nuclear industry, he added. Speaking about other initiatives, he said that the Government has amended sections of the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 through the Atomic Energy (Amendment) Bill, 2015, which would enable Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) to form joint venture companies with other Indian PSUs to meet the additional funding requirements for further expansion of our nuclear power programme. The Minister said that previously the atomic energy programme was confined mostly in Southern India, but now an atomic plant is in the process of being set up in Gorakhpur, Haryana near Delhi, which indicates the expansion of nuclear programme in other parts of country, he added. He also informed the audience about the “Hall of Nuclear Power”- India’s first permanent exhibition on nuclear power, has been built in the national capital. This helps the students and the younger generation to understand the basics of nuclear energy, the Minister said.  

 

While delivering his keynote address, the Chairman AEC and Secretary, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) Dr K N Vyas said that organising such conclaves has wide ranging benefits in understanding the benefits and allying any fears about nuclear energy. He spoke about the benefits of nuclear energy for power and non-power applications. Elaborating on non-power applications, he said that nuclear agriculture developed with the cooperation of agriculture universities and ICAR is one such example, others being nuclear medicine, low cost solution for water purification, urban waste management and food preservation programme, etc. Dr Vyas said we need a paradigm shift in power policy of our country for climate change mitigation and meeting the increasing need for power.  He announced that the Kaiga Atomic Power Station (KAPS) has set a new world record among pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs) with one of its units operating uninterrupted for 895 days as of today. The AEC Chairman said that at present, there are nine (9) nuclear power reactors at various stages of construction in India and twelve (12) more nuclear power reactors have been accorded administrative approval.

 

Speaking about the utility of nuclear energy, the President, Indian Energy Forum (IEF) and former Secretary, Ministry of Power, Shri Anil Razdan, said that earth temperature has to be brought down as per Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and this is possible essentially by de-carbonising the energy resources. He added that energy resources are very important as GDP is directly related to them. Shri Razdan said that per capita energy consumption in the country needs to be enhanced, but it has to be as clean as possible. He also spoke about the benefits of radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals. He elaborated on the use of nuclear energy for ‘Clean India Mission’ and other areas like food irradiation. 

 

During his address, the Chairman, Nuclear Energy Group, India Energy Forum and Chancellor Homi Bhabha National Institute and former Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Dr. Srikumar Banerjee, compared the features of nuclear energy and other sources of renewable energy. Both are complementary to each other, he added. Dr Banerjee said that the real challenge is to bring down the cost of nuclear energy during the gestation period. He said presently the share of nuclear energy in India is just 3%, as compared to global average of about 10% and this needs to be improved.  

 

Prof. Raman Srikant, Professor and Head, Energy and Environment Programme, National Institute of Advance Studies delivered special address on the topic ‘Primary Energy Sources: Nuclear and Solar’. He said although the share of renewable energy is growing, still about 75% of energy is coming from coal. Prof. Srikant said to ensure the integrity, security and reliability of the Grid as well as demand-supply match, a combination of Renewable energy and conventional sources of electricity are required.   

 

The roundtable on “Growth of Nuclear Power: Fleet Mode Implementation” chaired by the Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), NPCIL, Shri S K Sharma, is another highlight of the conclave. During the conclave, two sessions titled ‘Nuclear Energy Applications in Medical and Agriculture’ and ‘Long term perspective of Nuclear Power’ were chaired by Shri S A Bhadwaj, Chairman, AERB and Dr S Banerjee, former Chairman, AEC respectively.

 

The eminent scholars in the field of nuclear energy & medicine and foreign delegates also attended the conclave.

Vyas called on Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today.

Dr Vyas was the Director of the prestigious Bhaba Atomic Research Centre (BARC) before being elevated to the present position.

While congratulating Dr Vyas on taking over his new assignment, Dr Jitendra Singh hailed the Modi Government's initiatives over the last four years for having made functional new Reactor Units in the existing Atomic Energy Plants and at the same time, seeking to explore the possibility of setting up new Atomic Energy Plants in other parts of the country. This, he said, will certainly help India's Nuclear programme assume a pan-India presence and will be a befitting tribute to the founding father Dr Homi Bhabha.

Dr Jitendra Singh also discussed the current status of the upcoming Atomic Energy plant in Haryana in a town called Gorakhpur. He was informed that the work was in full progress and the Plant may become functional in the next few years. The Minister was also briefed about the efforts to explore possibility of setting up new Atomic Energy Plants in other States. 

In a fast developing country like India, Dr Jitendra Singh said, Atomic Energy will, in future, serve as a major source to fulfill the growing energy needs of the country. In addition, he observed, it will have the advantage of providing clean and pollution-free source of energy.

Dr Vyas also updated Dr Jitendra Singh about the various ongoing projects in the Department of Atomic Energy. He also discussed details of some of the important upcoming events and academic seminars relating to Nuclear Energy.

                The schedule for holding general election to the Legislative Assemblies of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Mizoram & Telangana, 2018 has been announced on 06.10.2018. Poll is scheduled to be held in multiple phases on 12.11.2018 & 20.11.2018 in Chhattisgarh, on 28.11.2018 in Madhya Pradesh & Mizoram and on 07.11.2018 in Rajasthan & Telangana. Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, prohibits displaying any election matter by means, inter alia, of television or similar apparatus, during the period of 48 hours before the hour fixed for conclusion of poll in a constituency. The relevant portions of the said Section 126 are re- produced below: -

(126. Prohibition of public meeting during period of forty-eight hours ending with hour fixed for conclusion of poll-

(1) No person shall –

(a) ………………….                                   

(b) Display to the public any election matter by means of cinematograph, television or other similar apparatus;

(c) ……………………. 

In any polling area during the period of forty-eight hours ending with the hour fixed for the conclusion of the poll for any election in the polling area.

(2)  Any person who contravenes the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.

(3)  In this Section, the expression “election matter” means any matter intended or calculated to influence or affect the result of an election.)

2.       During elections, there are sometimes allegations of violation of the provisions of the above Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by TV channels in the telecast of their panel discussions/debates and other news and current affairs programmes. As mentioned above the said Section 126 prohibits displaying any election matter by means, inter alia, of television or similar apparatus, during the period of 48 hours ending with the hour fixed for conclusion of poll in a constituency. “Election matter” has been defined in that Section as any matter intended or calculated to influence or affect the result of an election. Violation of the aforesaid provisions of Section 126 is punishable with imprisonment up to a period of two years, or with fine or both.

3.       The Commission once again reiterates that the TV/Radio channels and cable networks should ensure that the contents of the programme telecast/broadcast/displayed by them during the period of 48 hours referred to in Section 126 do not contain any material, including views/appeals by panelists/participants that may be construed as promoting/prejudicing the prospect of any particular party or candidate(s) or influencing/affecting the result of the election. This shall, among other things include display of result of any opinion poll and of standard debates, analysis, visuals and sound-bytes.

4.       In this connection, attention is also invited to Section 126A of the R.P. Act 1951, which prohibits conduct of Exit poll and dissemination of their results during the period reckoned from the commencement of polls in first Phase and half an hour after the close of poll in last phase in all the State, in respect of current round of elections.

5.       During the period not covered by Section 126 or Section 126A, concerned TV/Radio/Cable/FM channels are free to approach the state/district/local authorities for necessary permission for conducting any broadcast related events which must also conform to the provisions of the model code of conduct and the programme code laid down by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting under the Cable Network (Regulation) Act with regard to decency, maintenance of communal harmony, etc. Concerned Chief Electoral Officer/District Election Officer will take into account all relevant aspects including the law and order situation while extending such permission. As regards political advertisements, the same needs pre-telecast/broadcast certification by the Committees set up at the State/District level as per the Commission’s order No. 509/75/2004/JS-I dt 15.04.2004.

6.       Attention of all print media is also drawn to the following guidelines issued by Press Council of India on 30.07.2010 to be followed for observance during the election: 

(i)      It will be the duty of the Press to give objective reports about elections and the candidates. The newspapers are not expected to indulge in unhealthy election campaigns, exaggerated reports about any candidate/party or incident during the elections. In practice, two or three closely contesting candidates attract all the media attention. While reporting on the actual campaign, a newspaper may not leave out any important point raised by a candidate and make an attack on his or her opponent.

(ii)     Election campaign along communal or caste lines is banned under the election rules. Hence, the Press should eschew reports, which tend to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between people on the ground of religion, race, caste, community or language.

(iii)    The Press should refrain from publishing false or critical statements in regard to the personal character and conduct of any candidate or in relation to the candidature or withdrawal of any candidate or his candidature, to prejudice the prospects of that candidate in the elections. The Press shall not publish unverified allegations against any candidate/party.

(iv)     The Press shall not accept any kind of inducement, financial or otherwise, to project a candidate/party. It shall not accept hospitality or other facilities offered to them by or on behalf of any candidate/party.

(v)      The Press is not expected to indulge in canvassing of a particular candidate/party. If it does, it shall allow the right of reply to the other candidate/party.

(vi)     The Press shall not accept/publish any advertisement at the cost of public exchequer regarding achievements of a party/government in power.

(vii)    The Press shall observe all the directions/orders/instructions of the Election Commission/Returning Officers or Chief Electoral Officer issued from time to time.

7.       Attention of the electronic media is invited to the “Guidelines for Election Broadcasts” issued by NBSA dt 03.03.2014.

 


	News broadcasters should endeavour to inform the public in an objective manner, about relevant electoral matters, political parties, candidates, campaign issues and voting processes as per rules and regulations laid down under The Representation of the People Act 1951 and by the Election Commission of India.
	News channel shall disclose any political affiliations, either towards a party or candidate. News broadcasters have a duty to be balanced and impartial, especially in their election reporting.


 


	 News broadcasters must endeavour to avoid all forms of rumor, baseless speculation and disinformation, particularly when these concern specific political parties or candidates. Any candidate/political party, which has been defamed or is a victim of misrepresentation, misinformation or other similar injury by broadcast of information should be afforded prompt correction, and where appropriate granted an opportunity of reply.


 

(iv)     News broadcasters must resist all political and financial pressures which may affect coverage of elections and election related matters.

 

(v)      News broadcasters should maintain a clear distinction between editorial and expert opinion carried on their news channels.

 

(vi)     News broadcasters that use video feed from political parties should disclose it and appropriately tag it.

 

(vii)    Special care must be taken to ensure that every element of a news/programmes dealing with elections and election related matters is accurate on all facts relating to events, dates, places and quotes. If by mistake or inadvertence any inaccurate information is broadcast, the broadcaster must correct it as soon as it comes to the broadcaster’s notice with the same prominence as was given to the original broadcast.

 

(viii)   News broadcasters, their journalists and officials must not accept any money, or gifts, or any favour that could influence or appear to influence, create a conflict of interest or damage the credibility of the broadcaster or their personnel.

 

(ix)     News broadcasters must not broadcast any form of  ‘hate speech’ or other obnoxious content that may lead to incitement of violence or promote public unrest or disorder as election campaigning based on communal or caste factors is prohibited under Election laws. News broadcasters should strictly avoid reports which tend to promote feelings of enmity or hatred among people, on the ground of religion, race, caste, community, region or language.

 

(x)      News broadcasters are required to scrupulously maintain a distinction between news and paid content. All paid content should be clearly marked as “Paid Advertisement” or “Paid Content” : and paid content must be carried in compliance with the  “Norms & Guidelines on Paid News” dated 24.11.2011.

 

(xi)     Special care must be taken to report opinion polls accurately and fairly, by disclosing to viewers as to who commissioned, conducted and paid for the conduct of the opinion polls and the broadcast. If a news broadcaster carries the results of an opinion poll or other election projection, it must also explain the context, and the scope and limits of such polls with their limitations. Broadcast of opinion polls should be accompanied by information to assist viewers to understand the poll’s significance, such as the methodology used, the sample size, the margin of error, the fieldwork dates, and data used. Broadcasters should also disclose how vote shares are converted to seat shares.

 

(xii)    The Election Commission of India (ECI) will monitor the broadcasts made by news broadcasters from the time elections are announced until the conclusion and announcement of election results. Any violation by member broadcasters reported to the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) by the Election Commission will be dealt with by the NBSA under its regulations.

 

(xiii)   Broadcasters should, to the extent possible, carry voter education programmes to effectively inform voters about the voting process, the importance of voting, including how, when and where to vote, to register to vote and the secrecy of the ballot.

 

(xiv)    News broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results until such results are formally announced by the Returning Officer, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.

 

      The above guidelines should be duly observed for compliance by all the concerned media.

                It is understood that some newspapers have reported that the Commission on the one hand announced the bye elections to fill the three casual vacancies in Lok Sabha from Karnataka while the bye elections to fill five vacancies in Lok Sabha from Andhra Pradesh have not been announced. 

In this connection, it is to be noted that vacancies from 9-Bellary(ST), 14-Shimoga and 20-Mandya Parliamentary Constituencies of Karnataka have occurred on 18th May, 18th May and 21st May, 2018 respectively,  whereas vacancies from the five parliamentary constituencies from Andhra Pradesh have occurred on 20th June, 2018. 

Section 151A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 mandates the Election Commission to fill the casual vacancies in the Houses of Parliament and State Legislatures through bye elections within six months from the date of occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the remainder of the term of a member in relation to a vacancy is one year or more.  

The term of sixteenth Lok Sabha is upto 3rd June, 2019. As the vacancies from Karnataka have occurred more than one year before the expiration of the term of House, bye elections are required to be held under Section 151A of R. P. Act 1951 to fill these vacancies within six months from the date of occurrence of vacancies that is 18th& 21st May, 2018. In the case of vacancies from Andhra Pradesh, there is no need to hold bye elections as the remaining term of the Lok Sabha is less than one year from the date of occurrence of vacancies that is 20th June, 2018. 

Section 151A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 is reproduced below:

151A. Time limit for filling vacancies referred to in sections 147, 149, 150 and 151.—Notwithstanding anything contained in section 147, section 149, section 150 and section 151, a bye-election for filling any vacancy referred to in any of the said sections shall be held within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence of the vacancy: Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply if— (a) the remainder of the term of a member in relation to a vacancy is less than one year; or (b) the Election Commission in consultation with the Central Government certifies that it is difficult to hold the bye-election within the said period.

                The Election Commission of India is making all preparatory arrangements to ensure EVM VVPAT allocation well in time for General Elections across States. The mandatory First Level Checks and training to District Officers are also being ensured to meet the requirement of 100% VVPATs across approximately 10.6 lakh polling stations for the upcoming Lok Sabha Election in 2019.

The Commission has been consistently reviewing the status of production and supply of EVMs and VVPATs with the CMDs of PSUs. Around22.3 lakh Ballot Units, 16.3lakh Control Units and nearly 17.3 lakh VVPATs will be used for the forthcoming elections in 2019. This number of machines includes the buffer stock for training as well as replacements. 

The EVM VVPAT inventory is securely managed through a robust tracking system to track all operations on machine movement, First Level Checks, randomization, poll day defects. A more user friendly EVM management Software will be pilot tested in the forthcoming Assembly elections in select Districts namely Ajmer, Indore, Durg, Aizawl and Mehboobnagar. 

Till date,Electronic Voting Machines have been used in 113 General Elections of State Assemblies and 3 LokSabha Elections since 2000.Use of EVMs has ended the days of booth capturing and the delays and errors in counting of ballot papers.  Also during the ballot paper era, large number of votes in each Assembly constituency ended up being invalid. There have been instances of invalid votes being higher than even the winning margin in several elections. 

Addition of Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) to the EVM has helped strengthen the voters’ trust and transparency of the voting process. A VVPAT is an independent printer system attached with the Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) that allows the voters to verify that their votes are cast as intended.  VVPAT slips will be visible to the voter for seven seconds behind the transparent screen of VVPAT, before falling into the sealed compartment at the base of the machine. The specially designed thermal paper to be used in the VVPAT is capable of retaining the printout for more than five years so that the printout is available for manual verification by the Court,if required in need of a dispute for cross checking the counting of votes cast.So far, VVPATs have been used in 933 State Assembly Constituencies and 18 Parliamentary Constituencies. Till date, VVPATs have been used in all ACs at 100% polling stations during the General Assembly Elections in 7 States,namely, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura and Karnataka, held in 2017-18.Since December 2017 Commission has been suomoto doing a verification of VVPAT count from one randomly selected Polling Station selected per Assembly Constituency. VVPAT slips of 873 VVPATs machines have been counted till now and each of these has exactly matched the count taken from EVMs.

The EVMs and VVPATS being used in the ECI election process are manufactured only at the two premium PSUs - Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) under the technical expertise of an independent Technical Expert Committee and supervision of the Election Commission making them absolutely tamper proof.

Union Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister Shri Radha Mohan Singh has said  that with an aim to double farmers’ income, the budget outlay of the agriculture sector has been enhanced by 74.5% to Rs 2,11,694 crore during 2014-2019 as compared to Rs 1,21,082 crore during 2009-2014. On the occasion of inauguration ceremony of Krishi Kumbh 2018 organised in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh today he said that the Government is implementing various schemes to ensure higher gains for farmers. The Soil Health Card (SHC) ensures judicious use of fertilizer application thus saving money for farmers. Neem-coated urea is being promoted as it enhances availability of nitrogen to the crop and reduces cost of fertilizer application. Paramparagat  Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) is being implemented with a view to promote organic farming in the country.  This will improve soil health and organic matter content, and by receiving premium prices, net income of farmer will also increase. Realizing the possibility of organic farming in the northeast, Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCD-NER) has been initiated.

He added that the National Agriculture Market scheme (e-NAM) has revolutionized agri-markets by ensuring better price discovery, bringing in transparency and competition in order to enable farmers to get better remuneration for their produce thereby moving towards ‘One Nation One Market.’ The Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), electronically linked to e-NAM portal and exempted from regulations of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs), provides farmers facility to make direct sale to consumers and bulk purchasers. Giving further boost to farmers’ income, the government also increased MSP of all Kharif and Rabi crops for 2018-19 season by at least 150% of the cost of production.

The Minister said that Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) &  Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWCIS) provide insurance cover at all stages of the crop cycle including post-harvest risks to farmers at very low rates of premium. The government provides total interest subvention up to 5% (inclusive of 3% prompt repayment incentive) on short-term crop loans up to Rs 3 lakh. Thus, loan is available to farmers at a reduced rate of 4% per annum on prompt repayment.

During the course of the meeting, both the dignitaries discussed ways and means to reinforce trade and bilateral relations in agriculture.

The Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare stated that the main objective of this meeting was to create new opportunities for mutually beneficial trade and economic partnership with USA so that Indian economy could be strengthened. 

Shri Singh stated that USA expressed its satisfaction towards the systematic  approach  adopted by India for production of grapes and assured to expeditiously finalize the legislation related to the access of Indian commodities in USA markets so as to be able to export Indian table grapes to USA by November 2018 season.

 The purpose of celebrating World Food Day this year is to demonstrate our global commitment to achieve the goal of creating “Zero Hunger World” by 2030. Modi government is working continuously in a phased manner to achieve the goal of zero hunger. At the inauguration ceremony of Agri Startup & Entrepreneurship Conclave on the occasion of World Food Day today, Union Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the efforts of farmers and techniques developed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) have contributed to an increase in agricultural production and food security. As per the fourth advance estimate, foodgrain production is estimated at 284.83 million tonnes in 2017-18, an increase of over 20 million tonnes as compared to 2013-14. 

The Minister informed that horticulture crops, which contribute significantly to nutritional security, have witnessed record production this year at 307 million tonnes. Today, India occupies the top spot in horticulture production. In the year 2015-16, the production of pulses was 16.25 million tonnes, which increased to 25.23 million tonnes according to the fourth advance estimate in the year 2017-18, which is about 9 million tonnes higher compared to the production achieved in the year 2013-14. The role of high quality crop variety, seed and technology has been significant in increasing production, the Minister stated. He added that 795 crop varieties were released for production during 2014-18 as compared to 448 crop varieties during 2010-14. The demand and production of breeder seeds during 2013-14 was 8479 tonnes and 8927 tonnes respectively which rose to 10405 tonnes and 12265 tonnes in 2016-17.

 On ‘Skill India’ the Minister said that the Scheme was launched by the Indian government on a large scale nationwide. According to statistics, a requirement of 22 lakh skilled youth is in the agricultural sector, for which training of skill development is being conducted in various employment areas with the help of the Agriculture Department ICAR and Krishi Vigyan Kendras. The Modi Government has encouraged entrepreneurs through skill development and start-ups. 

To attract the youth of the country towards agriculture, a project called 'Arya' is being run through Krishi Vigyan Kendras and the Farmer Fest program is also playing a leading role in this direction. Skill development internships for youth are provided at the graduation level. There is tremendous potential for startups in the fields of seed and plant production, food processing and post-mortgage management, veterinary, farm machinery, poultry, fish production, biological products and bioplasty.

                World Food Day is a day of action dedicated to tackling global hunger. The theme of World Food Day 2018 is ‘Our actions are our future – A zero hunger world by 2030 is possible’.

Speaking on the World Food Day, Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the Indian Council of Agricultural Research takes action to remove  the suffering from hunger and ensure food security and a nutritious diet for all. The focus of the Government of India is that food is a basic need and fundamental human right. Zero hunger could save the lives of 301 million a year, and can help build a safer, more prosperous world for everyone. The Government of India aims to transform India’s agricultural sector to contribute to the achievements of global environmental objectives, and has launched a new project in association with FAO, India office known as ‘Green-agriculture: transforming Indian agriculture for global environmental benefits and the conservation of critical biodiversity and forest landscapes’. 

On farmers welfare the Minister said “the farmers, whom we respectfully call our ‘Annadaata’ or the providers of food, are central to our efforts in food processing. We have a stated target of doubling farm incomes by 2022. Recently, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana, a national level programme, was launched to create world-class food processing infrastructure. This is expected to leverage investment of five billion US dollars, benefit two million farmers and generate more than half a million jobs over the next two years.”

On Mega Food Parks the Minister said “Through these food parks, we aim to link agro-processing clusters with key production centres. This will offer immense value proposition in crops such as potato, pineapple, oranges and apples. Farmers groups are being encouraged to set up units in these parks, thereby reducing wastage and transportation costs, and creating new jobs.”

On digitalization in Agriculture the Minister said “We plan to link our villages through broadband connectivity, within a clear timeframe. We are digitizing land records, and providing various services to the people on mobile platforms. These steps are building momentum towards real-time transfer of information, knowledge and skills to farmers. The e-NAM, our national agriculture e-market, is connecting our agricultural markets nationwide, thereby giving our farmers the benefit of competitive pricing, and freedom of choice.”

The Minister stated that he was happy to learn that the Indian Farming, a monthly magazine of the ICAR, is dedicating a special issue on the theme of World Food Day 2018 – ‘Our actions are our future – A zero hunger world by 2030 is possible’. He said that qualitative information contributed by renowned scientists of FAO, CGIAR and ICAR systems will benefit  agriculture knowledge seekers.

The government has allocated more than 30% funds for women under various major schemes, programs and development related activities in order to bring women in the agriculture mainstream. Stating this   on the occasion of Mahila Kisan Diwas, today, Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh informed that about 18% of the agricultural households in India are led by women. In addition to agriculture, women have been making exceptional contribution in horticulture, fisheries, animal husbandry, beekeeping etc. The Minister disclosed that a research by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) conducted in nine states shows that the participation of women is 75% in the production of major crops, 79% in horticulture, 51% in post-harvest work and 95% in animal husbandry and fisheries. He further said that a National Gender Resource Centre in Agriculture, set up in the Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare, has developed a women sensitization module to bring about change in the mindset and behaviour of male program operators. In 2017-18, DAC&FW’s  MANAGE, EEI, SAMETI and other institutions have trained 5645 people through 222 programmes. Besides, more than 98.14 lakh women farmers have been trained so far under the ATMA scheme.

Shri Singh said that special importance is being given to the role of women in achieving the goal of doubling farmers’ income by 2022. Keeping this in mind, the inter-ministerial committee formed under the chairmanship of Dr. Dalwai has written a separate chapter on the empowerment of women to double the income of farmers. These efforts will certainly prove to be effective in enhancing the participation of women in agriculture. The Central Institute for Women in Agriculture, Bhubaneswar (Odisha), set up under the ICAR, has also been working in this direction. 

The Minister stated that cooperative education programs of women are organized through State Cooperative Societies to ensure womens participation in various activities in the field of cooperatives. Under the National Cooperative Union of India (NCUI), 38.78 lakh women have been trained in the last two years. Similarly, 6.07 lakh and 7000 women have benefited through KVKs and skill training respectively. A total of 53.34 lakh women have benefited during the year 2016-17 and 2017-18. He said that government’s revised ATMA scheme is providing support to the Food Security Groups of the farmers to ensure food security at the domestic and community levels. Under this, the Women's Food Security Groups are being given financial assistance at the rate of 2 groups / per block and at the rate of Rs 10,000 per group / per year. The Minister congratulated women farmers and praised their commendable contribution in taking India to the path of Second Green Revolution and in changing the landscape of development in the country.

Union Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister Shri Radha Mohan Singh has said that organic farming has the potential to provide livelihood to farmers and create employment opportunities for rural and urban people. Addressing Jaivik Krishi Sammelan organised by the National Centre of Organic Farming in Pandit Deen Dayal Dham, Mathura yesterday, he said that Sustainable production can be achieved through organic farming by way of improvement in soil health and fertility. The Minister said that the Modi government launched a new initiative the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) in 2015-16. From 2015-16 to 2018-19, Rs 1307 crore has been allocated to promote organic farming on cluster mode in the country. With the successful implementation of PKVY, Mission Organic Value Chain Development (MOVCD) and APEDA, more than 23.02 lakh hectares have been brought under certified organic farming till date in the country.

 

He added that the demand for Indian organic produce is high in the global market. During 2016-17, India produced 15 lakh tonne organic produce, where in, the export volume was 3.64 lakh tonne with value of Rs 2478 crore whereas the domestic market size is estimated at Rs 2000 crore which is expected to touch Rs 10000 crore in the next three years. The Minister called for adoption of organic farming and reducing dependence on chemical fertiliser and pesticide. He asserted it is imperative that we protect our environment, soil health and fertility, mitigate climate change & global warming and achieve sustainable & nutritional security. He expressed happiness over NCOF developing multi-action waste decomposer and its simple mass multiplication technology for farmers.

 

Shri Singh said that the Modi government is committed to promoting organic farming and is providing every possible help to farmers for the development of organic farming in the country. For an Organic Farming Revolution, he called upon farmers groups, NGOs and other stake holders to adopt organic farming in order to free the soil and environment from deadly chemicals.

                Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh while addressing the conclave of Chief Ministers of Himalayan states organized in Shimla said that Himalayan states are diverse in agricultural species, agricultural production systems and livestock breeds. This diversity is extremely useful for the future, not only for humans but also for the protection and development of all animals and plants. 

He said that organic farming should be emphasized for the coming generations. For the promotion of organic farming, there is a plan to develop clusters of 50 acres for which funds are being provided in the ratio of 90:10. In order to promote value chain in organic farming in North East region, financial assistance for advanced seed plantation materials, development of basic structure etc is being provided to Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura. 

The Minister said that under the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Rs 1307 crore has been allocated since 2015-16 for the development of organic farming in the cluster mode. 5 lakh farmers have benefited from this and 2.38 lakh hectare of land has been brought under organic farming. Under the Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCD-NER), 50,000 farmers have been engaged in organic farming and 2500 interested farmers group have been developed. Sikkim is the first state to adopt organic farming and learning from it, other states are also adopting organic farming.

He said that under the National Horticulture Mission, assistance is being provided mainly for the construction of ca storage, nurseries, processing units in the North Eastern and Himalayan states. So far, 26 CA (controlled atmospheric) storages have been established in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand with a capacity of 1 lakh metric tonne. 20 processing units have been established in North East and Himalayan states and 519 Marketing Infrastructure Units have been set up. 

Drawing attention towards climate change, the Minister said that in order to deal with this, 45 Integrated Farming System models have been developed by ICAR covering all 15 agro-climatic areas of the country. These climate-friendly technologies are being displayed and promoted in 29 states through KVKs.

In a separate event while addressing the 70th Foundation Day ceremony of ICAR- Central Potato Research Institute (CPRI) in Shimla, the Minister said that owing to the research work and innovative technology of the institute, India is today one of the leading potato producing countries of the world. In the last seven decades, a lot of progress has been made in potato production and acreage. While the area under potato cultivation was 2.30 lakh hectare and production was 15.4 lakh tonnes in 1949-50, it rose to 21.64 lakh hectares and 4.65 crore tonnes respectively in 2016-17.

The institute has developed several new technologies in order to increase potato production. The scientists of the institute have developed Indo-Blightcast model for forecasting potato late blight. The Institute has also developed multiple disease resistance advanced species of potato. Simultaneously, it has developed potato varieties for hilly regions like Kufri Himalini and Kufri Girdhari. Recently, CPRI have developed the aeroponic technology for the production of superior uniform size potato seeds free from viral diseases. The Institute also provides scientific backup to agencies for producing potato seeds using aeroponic technology. This has ensured easy availability of seed potatoes for the farmers. Annually the Institute is producing 3000 tonnes of potato breeder seed. Institute has developed and released six processing varieties viz., Kufri Chipsona 1-4, Kufri Himsona and Kirfri Frisona (chips and finger fry making). CPRI has also developed three processing and two storage technologies.

The Minister reiterated Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of Doubling Farmers’ Income which, he said, can be achieved through intervention of modern agricultural techniques. He said that agricultural loans are being made available to the farmers at a minimum interest rate (4%) by the government and the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY) has been launched to ensure compensation for crop loss. To reduce the cost of agriculture, the government has increased subsidy on agricultural investment. The government has also made a historic increase in MSP of various crops in order to make the farmers financially strong.

The Minister expressed hope that the ICAR-CPRI will continue to contribute in the production and development of potato with full commitment and take India to the top in global potato production.

The increase in the MSPs of wheat has been raised by Rs.105 per quintal, safflower by Rs.845 per quintal, barley by Rs.30 per quintal, masur (lentil) by Rs.225 per quintal, gram by Rs.220 per quintal and rapeseed & mustard by Rs.200 per quintal is another major step in this regard.

 

Details:


	The MSPs fixed by the government for wheat, barley, gram, masur, rapeseed & mustard and safflower are much higher than the cost of production.
	For wheat the cost of production is Rs 866 per quintal and MSP is Rs 1840 per quintal which gives a return of 112.5 per cent over cost of production;
	for barley the cost of production is Rs 860 per quintal and MSP is Rs 1440 per quintal giving a return of 67.4 per cent;
	for gram cost of production is Rs 2637 per quintal and MSP is Rs 4620 per quintal giving a return of 75.2 per cent;
	for masur cost of production is Rs 2532 per quintal and MSP is Rs 4475 per quintal giving a return of 76.7 per cent;
	for rapeseed & mustard the cost of production is Rs 2212 per quintal and MSP is Rs 4200 per quintal giving a return of 89.9 per cent and
	for safflower the cost of production is Rs 3294 per quintal and MSP is Rs 4945 per quintal giving a return of 50.1 per cent.

                Gram Sabhas across the country have been asked to inform the farmers about the enrolment and benefits of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojan (PMFBY) at the beginning of the Rabi Season today. The Gram Sabhas will also inform the farmers on how they can insure their crops under the Scheme. The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare has requested the Ministry of Panchayati Raj and the State Governments to include this as an agenda in the upcoming Gram Sabhas, especially for the one scheduled on 2nd October 2018, in connection with Gandhi Jayanti.  This is as part of the awareness initiatives taken up at various levels by the Govt and Insurance Companies to create awareness about the Scheme and mobilise farmers to insure their crops. 

This is also the first season for PMFBY with its revised operational guidelines in place.   The Govt expects the companies to reduce premium rates, especially as the general cut-off date for enrolment has been advanced by 15 days for both seasons.  As per the revised operational guidelines, the farmers get 72 hours to intimate individual claims against the existing 48 hours.  This can be done through any of the channels provided under the Scheme and directly on the portal of PMFBY. In case of any grievance, the farmers can access dedicated grievance redressal authorities.  Revised operational guidelines provide for appointment of District Level Grievance Redressal Officer and creation of State and District Grievance Redressal Cells for fast redressal of grievances. 

Non-loanee farmers can approach designated Common Service Centres, banks and insurance agents for insuring their crops or directly enrol on the portal.  Those farmers who avail short term crop loans from formal financial institutions at concessional rates of interest are automatically covered under the Scheme.

                Calling the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) a Silent revolution, Union Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh Mandaviya has, in a statement, said that Government of India’s endeavour to provide quality medicines at an affordable price is now making an impact on the lives of common masses. It is a revolution that is shaping the health of health care in India for common citizens, the Minister added.

 

Shri Mandaviya informed that in the financial year 2018-19 (up to October 2018), the total sales of Janaushadhi medicines have crossed Rs. 150 crores. This has led to total savings of approximately Rs. 600 crores for common people, as these medicines are cheaper by 50% to 90% as compared to average market price of branded medicines. He also stressed on the excellent quality of PMBJP medicines as these are procured from only WHO-GMP certified manufacturers and each batch is tested at NABL accredited independent labs.

 

Informing that the number of Janaushadhi stores in the country has grown to more than 4300 in 640 districts, Shri Mandaviya noted that this scheme is providing a valuable source of self-employment with sustainable and regular earnings. The average monthly sales per store have grown to Rs. 1.50 lakh, as per a recent survey conducted by the Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (BPPI), the Minister added. 

 

Laying down the future roadmap for the scheme, Shri Mandaviya said that by the end of 2018-19, the total number of Janaushadhi stores in the country would reach more than 5000 stores, with annual sales crossing Rs. 300 crores.

                Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri Nitin Gadkari today said it is time for the country to go for alternative fuel sources such as ethanol, methanol and bio-diesel. He was speaking at the inauguration of India Chem 2018 - the 10th Biennial International Exhibitions and Conference - Chemical and Petrochemicals - Advantage India, in Mumbai today. Stressing on the importance of alternative fuels, the Minister said that ethanol is the future and government has decided to increase its production. The Cabinet has given approval to finance ethanol factories. The Minister said that the country needs to reduce its imports and increase exports and new initiatives for import substitution are very important and need to be supported.

India Chem 2018 is the largest event of Chemicals and Petrochemical Industry in India, jointly organised by the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, Government of India and FICCI. India Chem 2018 is being held from October 04 – 06, 2018 in Mumbai.

Delivering his address on the occasion, Shri Gadkari said that India is the fastest growing large economy and those investing in India will have a huge advantage. He said, India is doing well in technology, entrepreneurship, innovation and R&D and that a lot of new research is happening through which India can work miracles in the world. Particularly in petrochemicals, India has huge potential but we need to be cost-effective and pollution-free. The Minister spoke of the importance of ecology and environment, and highlighted that bio-plastics can be made from ethanol. Organic plastics can give a new vision for the petrochemicals industry, he said.

Speaking about the importance of diversification in agriculture towards the needs of the energy and power sector, Shri Gadkari said that new crops have to be identified. The Minister exhorted the industry to explore the possibility of using agricultural material for making chemicals, which he said can be a great game changer for the country.



On the occasion, the Minister released India Chem 2018 knowledge paper.

Secretary, Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals, Shri P. Raghavendra Rao said that chemical and petrochemical production, start-up culture, ease of doing business and innovation are the factors because of which India is a global destination for investment. The chemicals and petrochemicals industry has been growing at 6.2%, he added.

“Chemical industry is growing rapidly due to the positive reforms undertaken by the Government of India. Between 2014 and 2018, net import of chemicals has grown at 5.8% in volume and is projected to reach US$ 304 billion by 2025. Government of India is very conscious of the positive role that the chemical industry plays for the welfare of the society. The industry has grown significantly in recent years and is a major employment generator with Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) sector playing a major role.”, the Secretary said.

The most important objective behind organizing the India Chem series is to highlight the investment possibilities in the country's chemical industry and give a fillip to ""Make in India"" initiative of the Government of India. A congregation of over 300 leading chemical and petrochemical companies from all over the world predominantly from Iran, China, Japan, United Kingdom, Spain, USA, Germany, Italy, Brazil, Turkey and South East Asian countries are participating as exhibitors, delegates and visitors.

                The Minister of State for Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha met with the Western Australian Tourism Minister Shri Paul Papalia here today to receive further commitments from the Western Australian State Government to establish direct non-stop flights between India and Perth.

The Ministers said the discussions were positive, agreeing there would be benefits for both Western Australia and India if a direct service was established. The Chairman and Managing Director of Air India, Mr Pradeep Kharola was also present in the meeting.

India is already a fast growing market for Western Australia with the number of visitors increasing by 38 per cent from the year ending December 2015 to the same period in 2017. The Western Australia Government has recently committed funds to market the State to Indian consumers for the first time and has appointed a dedicated marketing representative based in Mumbai.

Air India has agreed to explore the business case for the route.

Shri Jayant Sinha said that “India and Australia share strong trade, investment, sporting and education ties. Direct connectivity between India and Australia has the potential to deepen these relationships.”

He said that “India has a very open air service agreement with Australia. It encourages both Indian and Australian airlines to consider making use of the liberal arrangements to mount more flights between the two countries.” He added that “many Indian carries are now permitted to fly on international routes and we hope to see many new direct flights and increased frequency between the two countries.”

After the meeting, Shri Paul Papalia said that “today’s meeting was extremely productive and significantly progressed our efforts towards establishing direct flights between India and Perth.”  He said that “the Western Australian Government is serious about growing the number of visitors travelling to Western Australia from India, which is why we have committed marketing funds for the first time and appointed a market representative to work with travel trade and Tourism Australia to promote the State.” He added that “our extraordinary State has much to offer Indian travellers, whether they’re visiting for business, education or leisure.” He said that “Perth boasts the best hotels in Australia, with more than 3,000 new rooms opening in the past few years. It is also the perfect launching pad to visit our spectacular regions.”

                The Union Minister of Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviation, Shri Suresh Prabhu today released the policy on biometric based digital processing of passengers at airports called “Digi Yatra” at a press-conference here. Addressing the media, he said that the Ministry has taken the initiative to develop standards for digital processing of passengers at airport to ensure uniform implementation and passenger experience across Indian airports through a connected ecosystem. He said, a technical working committee having members from airport operators, airlines and industry has been formed for development of standards.

The media was told that DigiYatra Central Platform will be operational by end of February, 2019. Bangalore & Hyderabad International Airports will be ready with pilot implementation by end of February, 2019. Airport Authority of India (AAI) intends to roll out the programme initially at Kolkata, Varanasi, Pune & Vijayawada by April, 2019.

Shri Suresh Prabhu said, DigiYatra will provide a pan-India powerful platform for future, adding that Airports will have the possibility of providing innovative services and consent based  targeted services in future. “Any service provider involved in facilitating travel of passenger from door to door will be able to use this platform in future through innovative solutions” he said. The Minister asserted that the ultimate beneficiary will be the passengers, who will have all the travel related options available to them.

Elaborating on the contours of Digi Yatra, Minister of State of Civil Aviation, Shri Jayant Sinha said, it is a Facial Recognition based passenger processing which  is a common standard being adopted the world over. To provide a seamless experience right from the entry to the airport upto boarding the aircraft, Shri Sinha said, DigiYatra will have a centralised registration system for passengers. “Under the Digi Yatra, passenger can get a Digi Yatra ID by sharing minimum details like Name, e-mail ID, Mobile number and details of one approved Identity proof where Aadhar ID is not mandatory. This DigiYatra ID will be shared by passengers while Booking ticket. Airlines will share the passenger data and DigiYatraID with the departure airport”, he said.  Shri Sinha pointed out that a passenger who has created the Digi Yatra ID has to undergo a onetime verification at the departure airport during his/her first travel. “In case a passenger opted for Aadhar based verification, the identity will be verified online. On successful verification, facial biometric will be captured and stored in the Digi Yatra ID profile of the passenger. In case the passenger has chosen any other identity for creating Digi Yatra ID, verification will be done manually by Security personal and facial biometric will be captured and stored in the Digi Yatra ID profile. By this process the registration is complete”, he explained.

      Shri Jayant Sinha said, Digi Yatra will bring benefits to passengers and all stakeholders involved in the process, as Airport operator will have travel information in advance for better resource planning and the real-time data of passengers within the terminal will enable the operator to take proactive action to avoid congestion.

      The Secretary, MoCA, Shri Rajiv Nayan Choubey further elaborated on Digi Yatra mechanism saying that a successfully registered passenger can go directly to the entry point  E-Gate of the airport and scan the barcode/ QR code of the ticket/ Boarding pass. “A camera will capture the face for comparing with DigiYatraID Photo. On successful verification of the  travel details and facial matching, the E-Gate  will open. The system will also generate a token in the system combining the face of passenger with PNR of the ticket, so that at subsequent check points the ticket details will be available on face recognition.”

“At check-in counter or at the Self Bag Drop counter, the passenger will be identified by face and there is no need to show any document or ID for this purpose. The passenger will gain entry to the security check area through an E-Gate by facial recognition. Similarly at the boarding gate also the passenger will be identified by face for entering  through an E-Gate for boarding the aircraft.”

“Airlines will have the information of its passenger and their status within the terminal. No more missing passenger causing departure delays. Security will benefit from the ability of the technology to verify the passenger at every checkpoint in a non intrusive way except that physical frisking of the passenger as per security procedures will continue. Intentional Boarding pass exchange by passenger or wrong boarding by mistake will not happen.”

 As Indian Aviation is witnessing an unprecedented passenger growth for the past 50 months and it is likely to continue, this would mean the existing airports have to handle more passengers for considerable time before additional infrastructure is created. “The passengers are expecting better facilitation at the airport and Security remains a key concern in air travel. Leveraging technology is the only solution to meet such challenging requirements”, Shri Choubey said.  Pointing out that multiple stakeholders are involved in a seamless travel process for a passenger, he emphasised that it was important that the stakeholders work in a connected environment for reaping the benefits of technology. He said, in order to achieve this objective, the Ministry of Civil Aviation evolved the concept of “DigiYatra” which  envisages a connected ecosystem enhancing the seamless travel experience for the passengers and simultaneously improving the security.

                The World Bank released its latest Doing Business Report(DBR, 2019) todayin New Delhi. India has recorded a jump of 23 positions against its rank of 100 in 2017 to be placed now at 77thrank among 190 countries assessed by the World Bank. India'sleap of23 ranks in the Ease of Doing Business ranking is significant considering that last year India had improved its rank by 30 places, a rare feat for any large and diverse country of the size of India. As a result of continued efforts by the Government, India has improved its rank by 53 positions in last two years and 65positions in last four years.

The Doing Business assessment provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies on ten parameters affecting a business through its life cycle. The DBR ranks countries on the basis of Distance to Frontier (DTF), a score that shows the gap of aneconomy to the global best practice. This year, India’s DTF score improved to 67.23 from 60.76 in the previous year.

India has improved its rank in 6 out of 10 indicators and has moved closer to international best practices (Distance to Frontier score) on 7 out of the 10 indicators. But, the most dramatic improvements have been registered in the indicators related to 'Construction Permits' and 'Trading across Borders'. In grant of construction permits, India's rank improved from 181 in 2017 to 52in 2018, an improvement of 129 ranks in a single year. In 'Trading across Borders', India's rank improved by 66 positions moving from 146 in 2017 to 80in 2018. The changes in six indicators where India improved its rank are as follows:

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu,met a high level Russian business delegation on Saturday in New Delhi. Discussions were held on increasing investments and business engagementswith Russia. 

Russia has invested USD 1.2 billion in India between 2000 and 2017. In the 18th annual summit that took place in St. Petersburg between Prime Minister of India and President of Russia in 2017it was decided to increase it by 10 times in 6 to 7 years. The key areas of Russian investments have been oil and gas,defence equipment supplies, power and energy and large scale infrastructure project. 

There is immense potential for the two countries to further expand economic ties and move beyond buyer – seller relationship. The Minister said that in order to facilitate this India has set up a onestopshop for Russian companies in Invest India called Russia Plus, which will fast track investments. Minister further stated that there is possibility for Russian investments in Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor,smart cities, railways, public transport, sanitation and low cost housing. Commerce Minister said that Russia canbe a valuable market in information technology and services sector considering IT and services are India’s largest exports. Indian companies may also explore links with Russian companies in software for the manufacturing sector. 

India’s pharma exports to Russia constitute a sizable chunk butpossibilities of joint investments are being considered by leading Indian pharma companies under Russia’s Pharma 2020 programme. Commerce Minister further said that although Russia is a primary source of defenceequipment supply to India, ample opportunities have further opened up for both countries with the opening of FDI in defence production in India. Russian companies may consider investing in a dedicated industrial park for defence manufacturing under the new norms to supply parts to helicopters, nuclear reactors and solar panels. The Minister further stated that India intends to create avibrant startup eco-system and Russia can actively partner by providing technology, assistance in setting up incubation centers and actively investing in startups. During the meeting thepossibility of potential cooperation in areas of oil and gas sector, aerospace, ports and shipping and railways and also in the sectors of fertilizers, gems and jewelry and tourismwere discussed.

Commerce Minister also explained the procedure and policy for establishing green field and brown field airports in tier-II and III cities in India. Russian investments may also be explored in the pilot training center coming up in the country. Suresh Prabhu invited Russian aerospace companies to participate in the global aviation summit to be held in India in January 2019.

In 2017 total trade between India and Russia wasUSD10.13 billion. Imports to Russia stood atUSD8.04 billion and exports from India wasUSD 2.08 billion. Commerce Minister emphasized that all efforts should be made to narrow down the trade deficit. One of the major reasons for having low trade is due to trade barriers like banking, sanitary and phytosanitary issues, language barrier and visa issues.

The Minister informed that the International North South Corridor (INSTC) is an important initiative taken by India, Russia and Iran to promote transportation cooperation and to enhance connectivity with central Asian countries. The INSTC is the shortest multimodal transportation route linking the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf via Iran to Russia and North Europe. The estimated capacity of the corridor is 20 to 30 million tonnes of goods per year and will reduce time and cost by30% to 40%. The Ministeremphasized that in the 23rd November 2018 trilateral meeting on INSTC all issues may be resolved in order to operationalize the route as early as possible.

The Minister further said that today India produces 600 MT of agricultural produce and has the capacity to export the excess production to the world. The Commerce Ministry is ready with an Agriculture Export Policy so that farmer’s income can be doubled by 2022. He further said that the various schemes introduced by the Government like Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Fasal Bima Yojana, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, Soil Health Card, Kisan Credit Card and eNAM will make agriculture a profitable venture.

Suresh Prabhuaddressing the Export Summit 2018in New Delhi

 

India’s exports rose by 9.8%, in financial year 2017-18, which is the highest rate of growth in six years. This positive growth in exports has taken place at a time when there is a lot of negative headwinds globally. This was stated by Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, at the Export Summit 2018 organised by Confederation of Indian Industry in New Delhi today. The Minister further stated that Commerce Ministry is working on a strategy to revitalize India’s exports and is working with key exporting ministries to formulate sectoral, commodity and territory specific export strategy. Meetings with concerned ministries have already been held where differentministries and stakeholders have been consulted after which a matrix of specific action points have been prepared sector wise, commodity wise and territory wise.

Suresh Prabhu further stated that he is personally monitoring the progress and regular meetings are beingheld withsectoral ministries,export promotion councils and exporters.Certain issues which were affecting growth of exports have been specifically taken up with Department of Revenue and Ministry of Environment.

The Commerce Minister also said that the soon to be unveiled agri export policy will give a major boost to the agricultural sector and will pave the way for Indian farmer’s income to be doubled.

India produces 600 MT of agricultural produce and has the capacity to export the excess productiontothe world.

Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), AlokVardhanChaturvedi, spoke about the recent initiatives taken by the Commerce Ministry to smoothen procedures for exporters. Most procedures are now online and hard copy of documents are not required to be submitted. DGFT is also planning to have online export related courses to inform, train and facilitate first time exporters. The DGFT is also in the process of overhauling the IT network of the DGFTso thatthere is no wastage of time for online submission of documents.

                          Five more rice mills have been cleared for exporting non-basmati rice, from India to China, taking the total to 24 rice mills. The first consignment of non-basmati rice, of 100 tonnes, was shipped to China, from Nagpur, in September this year.        

          In May this year, officials from China inspected rice mills that are capable of exporting non-basmati rice to China and 19 rice mills and processing units were registered for export to China.

          During Prime Minister, Narendra Modi's, visit to China, in June this year, an MoU was signed between China’s General Administration of Customs and India’s Department of Agriculture on phytosanitaryrequirements for exporting rice from India to China. The 2006 protocol on phytosanitary requirements was amended to include the export of non-basmati varieties of rice from India. 

          China is the world’s largest producer and importer of rice and buys more than 5 MT/year. There is potential for India to export 1 MT of rice to China in a few years.India’s total rice exports increased from 10.8 MT a year earlier to 12.7 MT last fiscal. This allowed India to retain the top slot in global trade of the commodity. 

          Recently China also lifted the ban on import of rapeseed meal from India. The ban was imposed in 2011 and India’s export of rapeseed meal was worth USD 161 million that year. India has surplus of 500,000 tonnes of rapeseed meal to export to China every year. 

          Rapeseed and soybean meal are used as protein source for animal feed in China.

          China has imposed tariffs of 25% on a list of American products including rapeseed meal and soybean meal in July this year and has removed tariffs on these products from five Asian countries including India.

          India is keen to export agri products like rice and sugar to China in order to bridge widening trade deficit.

                            A high level Vietnamese delegation from Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Vietnamis meeting a Trade Promotion Council of India (TPCI) delegation, in Delhi today, to discuss avenues to enhance bilateral trade between the two countries. The delegation is led by Mr. Tran Thanh Nam, Deputy Minister of the Ministry. He is accompanied by senior government officials and Vietnamese businessmen from the agriculture sector. The Vietnamese ambassador to India Mr. Pham Sanh Chau will also be present in the meeting. The TPCI delegation is led by its Chairman, Mohit Singla. 

            Vietnamese and TPCI delegations will discuss business opportunities and future cooperation between India and Vietnam as well as ways and means to promote Indusfood in Vietnam. 

            Vietnam is seeing high economic growth and expansion of trade and investment, which has resulted in Vietnam moving out of the category of Least Developed Country (LDC) and become part of new lower middle income country (MIC). It has also seen sharp truncation in poverty levels, which has resulted in bolstering the growth of GDP, currently estimated at USD 200.8 billion. 

            India-Vietnam bilateral trade stood at USD 7.8 billion in 2015-16 with India maintaining a positive trade balance. During 2016, 16 MoUs were signed between the two countries during the visits of Indian Prime Minister to Vietnam and Vietnamese President to India. These agreements focused on information technology, cyber security, health, software development and training, aviation, shipping, civil nuclear cooperation. All these sectors are crucial in strengthening bilateral relations between the two countries and expanding the Vietnam-India comprehensive strategic partnership  

            Though India is an agrarian exporter, broadly it’s trade basket is complimentary and there is immense scope for increasing bilateral trade. Also, trade in services is another way for enhancing India’s trade, as under India-ASEAN services trade agreement, mobility of skilled and semi-skilled labourers has been liberalized andit can be used as a policy instrument. 

            Vietnam requires technological assistance for its socio-economic and trade logistics development for which India is an appropriate partner. Both countries have identified biotechnology in agriculture and healthcare, technology for new materials, IT and electronics, super-computing, nuclear energy for peaceful uses, science and technology, remote sensing and non-traditional energy for expanding trade and investment and achieving the target of USD 15 billion worth of bilateral trade by 2020. 

            During the meeting, the two sides are also expected to discuss ways to strengthen their relationship further, including tie-ups in food and beverage sector. Vietnam is an importer of rapeseed and there is scope to promote Indian fruits like oranges. 

            Trade Promotion Council of India (TPCI) is an apex trade body under the Ministry of Commerce which focuses on promoting and facilitating trade, with focus on agri and food, education, IT and entertainment as also chemicals, plastic and telecom sectors.

                The eleventh session of India – Czech Republic Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation (JCEC) was held on 22nd – 23rd October 2018 at Prague. The Indian delegation was led by Minister of State for Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs and Food & Public Distribution, C. R. Chaudhary. Miss Marta Nováková, Minister of Industry & Trade of Czech Republic led the Czech side. The deliberations were marked with the mutual desire to further expand and strengthen relations between the two countries in the economic field.

          C. R. Chaudhary said that India’s growth story and Czech technological expertise and manufacturing prowess make two natural partners.  He said that economies of both the countries have significant complementarity which can be leveraged for mutually beneficial cooperation. He also held a meeting with Mr. Martin Tlapa, Deputy Minister, Foreign Affairs, Czech Republic and discussed various issues including direct flight, long term study visa, strengthening of mutual Trade and investment relations. Technical meeting of 11th session of India-Czech Republic Joint Economic Commission was held simultaneously at Prague. A protocol was subsequently signed by C. R. Chaudhary and Ms. Marta Novakova, Minister of Trade and Industry, Czech Republic.

          The Czech side stressed that the Czech Government continues to rank India among the priority countries for promotion of mutual commercial, investment and economic activities and stated that Czech companies are interested to cooperate with Indian partners within the framework of the ‘Make in India’ programme. 

          Both sides welcomed the opening of the new Honorary Consulate of the Czech Republic in Bengaluru and expressed the hope that the process of the establishment of the Honorary Consulate of the Czech Republic in Chennai would be completed soon. 

          Both sides agreed that the recent growth of global protectionism had negatively affected many countries and concerted effort is required for a positive outlook for the future. Both sides shared the view that solutions should be sought for closer economic cooperation as well as for promotion of multilateral and inter-regional trade. 

          Stressing on the importance of a rule-based multilateral trading system embodied in WTO both sides expressed concern over the current protectionist and anti-globalist tendencies that threaten free trade. 

          Both sides reviewed developments in their bilateral trade since the 10th Session of the Joint Commission held in New Delhi in January 2015 and welcomed the increasing trend in the volume of trade. They appreciated a record level of trade exchange in 2017 and noted that this exchange was almost balanced. However, the Joint Commission expressed the opinion that the level of trade does not fully reflect the existing potential and should be further realised. The Indian side noted that as per the Indian statistics, bilateral trade between India and Czech Republic crossed USD 1 billion in 2016-17.

          Czechoslovakia is preparing a project called Czech Industrial Cluster (CIC) near Bengaluru. The CIC will comprise administrative and production units and will serve as a hub for Czech companies that intend to settle down in India. The CIC may also serve as a base of inter-academic cooperation between both the countries. The Czech side would appreciate support and cooperation of Indian authorities during creating CIC units and in setting of conditions for Czech investors coming to CIC.

          Both sides observed that tourism was an important area having great potential for increased interaction. Stating that both countries offer excellent opportunities for excursion tours as well as for group tourism, the sides appreciated contacts between both national tourism authorities and joint promotion of tourism. 

          The Czech side noted that arrivals of Indian tourist to the Czech Republic constantly grew up and in 2017, number of tourists from India reached almost 100 thousand people. The number of Czech tourists to India grew up as well last year, though this number is more modest – approximately 13 thousand people. Both sides shared the view that establishing direct flights between India and the Czech Republic would create favourable conditions for mutual tourism development. 

          The two sides reaffirmed their support to finalizing an ambitious and balanced Broad Based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) between India and the EU. The Czech side noted that India is one of the most important partners for the EU and liberalization of our markets would be beneficial in the long term for both sides. It is also vital to set the binding rules that may govern our trade relations and deepen the co-operation in the economic area. The India side stated that India is committed to an early and balanced outcome of India-EU BTIA negotiations of which investment is an important track. 

          It is important to resume negotiations at the earliest and without pre-conditions. Any FTA has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. India has been sensitive to EU’s concerns and has gone an extra mile to be accommodative.

She said that GeM isa platformwhere government has matched technology with transparency and the need for procurement from the government’s point of view along with all the stakeholders in the business.Shesaid that 400 products have been identified which are commonly consumed and the listhas been given to Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) to set out standards for them, so that there is no scope for discretion and buyers and suppliers know what they have to adhere to it.

Secretary, Commerce,Dr. Anup Wadhawan,said that procurement has been a very critical and sensitive subject in Government, notwithstanding the volume of rules, regulations, procedures, cross checks, safeguards and the various precautions taken by government officials.

                Headline Facts


	Mid-year assessment shows exports growing in a healthy manner, building on export growth seen in 2016-17 and 2017-18. 
	In first six months (April-September 2018), merchandise exports exhibited positive growth of 19.93 per cent in Rupee terms and 12.54 per cent in US$
	Merchandise Exports in September 2018 exhibited a positive growth of 9.65 per cent in Rupee terms.
	Merchandise Trade deficit is USD 13.98 Billion in September 2018 which is the lowest in last 5 months, despite high oil prices.


Exports


	Mid-year assessment of the first six months of this financial year shows that exports are growing in a healthy manner to build on the export growth seen in 2016-17 and 2017-18. In the first six months (April-September 2018),merchandise exports exhibited a positive growth of 19.93 per cent in Rupee terms and12.54 per cent in US$ terms over same period last year.
	Exports of Non-petroleum and Non Gems and Jewellery during April-September 2018 exhibited a positive growth of 17.51 per cent in Rupee terms and 10.32 per cent in US$ terms over same period last year. Thus the growth is robust and not confined to petroleum products alone. 



	Merchandise Exports in September 2018 exhibited a positive growth of 9.65 per cent in Rupee terms. In dollar terms there was a marginal negative growth in merchandise exports of 2.15 per cent in September 2018. This decline is entirely due to the base effect resulting from September 2017 being an abnormally high growth month of about 26% in dollar terms due to the imminent cut off then for drawbacks at pre-GST rates. This is a temporary out of trend phenomenon. Exporters continue to be resurgent with their realised incomes having gone up by almost 10 percent. October 2018 figures promise to be as per the ongoing six-month trend again.
	During September 2018, major commodity groups showing positive export growth over the corresponding month of last year are Petroleum Products (26.8%), Organic & Inorganic Chemicals (16.9%), Drugs & Pharmaceuticals (3.8%), Cotton Yarn/Fabs./made-ups, Handloom Products etc. (3.6%) and Plastic & Linoleum (28.2%) (in USD terms).

	In September 2018, imports exhibited a positive growth of 10.45 per cent in US$ terms (which is the lowest in last 5 months) and 23.78 in Rupee terms.


Trade deficit


	Merchandise Trade deficit during April-September 2018 is USD 94.32 Billion andUSD 13.98 Billion in September 2018 which is the lowest in last 5 months, despite high oil prices.

                The government of India is making all efforts to bring services closer to the people inclusively and create a window of opportunity for start-ups and young entrepreneurs. This was stated by Secretary, Ministry of Electronics & IT (Meity), Ajay Prakash Sawhney, at an interactive session on’ Language Localisation& CRM Services on GeM’, organised by FICCI and GeMhere today.

 Secretary, MeitY, said that language localisation was the key to capitalise on the opportunities in open and transparent public procurement services of the GeM for vendors and buyers. Although there are many challenges which include speech recognition in various languages, translating speech to text and text to speech, optical and handwriting recognition. But all efforts are being made to ensure that a Malayalam and Bangla speaking vendor or buyer is able to have a dialogue in real time.

 Radha Chauhan, CEO, GeM said that GeM was designed to make public procurement processes of the government transparent and it was imperative to have language localisation to make ‘Digital India’ a transformative movement. On Customer relationship management (CRM), Ms. Chauhan said that GeM was equipped to handle calls in 10 Indian languages which are transactional. The challenge to be overcome now is to create solutions in various languages for processing of services like public procurement bidding.

                The Minister of State for Commerce & Industry and Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution C. R. Chaudhary, attended the 6th RCEP Inter-sessional Ministerial Meeting (IMM) in Singapore on 12-13 October, 2018. The Ministers from 16 RCEP countries met in Singapore to discuss a modern, comprehensive and mutually beneficial economic partnership agreement among ASEAN and ASEAN's FTA partners.

The Ministers reviewed developments since the 6th RCEP Ministerial Meeting held on 30-31st August, 2018 in Singapore, which was attended by Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu. They welcomed the intensification of market negotiations. While appreciating some narrowing of gaps, the Ministers urged all RECP Participating Countries to continue to exert all efforts towards meeting the targets set in the Package of Year End Deliverables. 

C. R. Chaudhary held bilateral meetings, on the side lines of 6th RCEP IMM, with Trade Minister of Singapore, Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism & Investment of Australia, Minister of Trade & Export Growth of New Zealand and Vice Minister of China, Wang Shouwen. Singapore sought India's help in early conclusion of RCEP negotiations. Next round meeting of Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) is scheduled to be held in Auckland, New Zealand, later this month.

Suresh Prabhu and Mukhtar Babayev exchanging protocol on trade and economic, science and technology cooperation between India and Azerbaijan

            The 5th meeting of India-Azerbaijan Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade and Economic, Science and Technology Cooperation (IA-IGC) was held on 11-12 October, 2018 in New Delhi. The meeting was co-chaired by Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu and Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of the Government of Republic of Azerbaijan, Mukhtar Babayev.

            The two sides exchanged views on current economic situation and reviewed the current status of bilateral trade, investment and their cooperation in the fields of trade, economy, science and technology. They emphasised to further strengthen and expand their cooperation in trade and investment, transportation, energy and hydro-carbons, SMEs, agriculture, food safety and environmental protection, tourism, culture, health and pharmaceuticals, space technology, education and scientific research, chemicals and petrochemicals and mining. 

            Trade turnover between India and Azerbaijan in January-August 2018 was USD 657.9 million. Both sides felt that bilateral trade was far below the potential and there was a need to step up the cooperation to enlarge the trade basket and increase bilateral trade and investment. Both sides agreed to take measures to enhance trade relations and expand business relations between the two countries.

            It was decided to send trade delegations to raise awareness regarding economic developments and reforms in the two countries and have regular exchange of information about trade exhibitions, fairs, conferences and other business events.

            Both sides agreed to convene the next meeting of the India-Azerbaijan Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Science and Technology co-operation in Baku. The dates for the meeting will be mutually agreed through diplomatic channels.

Commerce & Industry Minister speaking about the challenges and opportunities of the 4th Industrial Revelation for India

The New Industrial Policy framed by the Ministry of Commerce in consultation with all Ministries of Government of India, State Governments, Industry and all stakeholders embodies the Government’s intention to align India with the emerging technologies of drones, artificial intelligence and block chain. This was stated by the Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, at the launch of the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, India, by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF) yesterday in New Delhi.

The Minister further said that the policy is in sync with the challenges and opportunities for India with the fourth industrial revolution technologies and will place the country firmly in the global supply and value chains.

Suresh Prabhu went on to state that the fourth Industrial revolution is driven by digital technology and India is on track to adopt digital technology in every aspect of governance. This will help the country to leap frog into the global supply chain. Minister gave the example of the recently launched Digi yatra by the Ministry of Civil Aviation as an example of India’s vision to transform the country into a digitally empowered society.

The WEF is setting up a Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Maharashtra. The other centres are in San Francisco, USA, Japan and China. Artificial intelligence, block chain and drones are the first three projects of the centre in India. WEF will work in collaboration with the NITI Aayog, business leaders, academia and start-ups in these projects.

The underlying strengths are indicative of the potential of India to achieve a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025. The current structure of the economy and the emerging dynamics provide us grounds to target achieving 1 trilliondollarfrom agriculture and allied activities, 1 trillion from manufacturing and 3 trillionfrom services. 

The Government has several ongoing initiatives across sectors focused on growth. In agriculture the Government is aiming to reorient policy focus from being production-centric to becoming income-centric. The emphasis on incomes provides a broader scope towards achieving the needed expansion of the sector. The proposed Industrial Policy 2018 provides an overarching, sector-agnostic agenda for the enterprises of the future and envisions creating a globally competitive Indian industry that is modern, sustainable and inclusive. 

The Champion Services sector initiative is also under way to accelerate the expansion of select service sectors. The Working Group has accounted for these initiatives and encourages a fresh impetus to achieve the target of a five trillion economy.

                Bangladesh is sending a strong buyer delegation to India during the upcoming Indus Food-II to be held in January, 2019, in Greater Noida, organized jointly with Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. This was announced by Jahangir Bin Alam, Secretary & CEO of Dhaka-based India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce & Industry (IBCCI), who visited Trade Promotion Council of India (TPCI) office in Delhi yesterday for talks. The bilateral trade between the two countries touches $9 billion out of which Bangladesh exports goods worth $900 million.

CEO, IBCCI said that trade growth depends on the developmental progress of Bangladesh. He further said that Bangladesh is growing and hence trade is increasing with India and the rest of the world. India being an immediate neighbour with whom Bangladesh not only shares a long border but also culture, traditions and language will be looking towards India to import the items it needs.

There is immense scope for increasing Food & Beverages (F&B) exports from India to Bangladesh. Presently, Bangladesh’s total import of F&B from the world is $5016.4 million, out of which India is 5th in ranking with exports worth $332.4 million. Bangladesh currently sources 17.2 % of its F&B requirements from Brazil, followed by Indonesia (12.1%), Canada (9.7%), Argentina (9.1%) and India (6.6%).

Fresh fruits going from India to Bangladesh are: mangoes, grapes, pomegranates and apples.  Among other F&B products, there is still great scope for added export of dried, shelled chickpeas, fresh or chilled onions and shallots, food preparations, cumin seeds, fresh grapes, semi-milled or wholly milled rice, black fermented tea and partly fermented tea, turmeric and cane sugar.

Improved connectivity between the two countries will help a lot in developing trade further. Till only a sometime back, maximum trade between India and Bangladesh was routed through ports in Singapore. The traditional river waterways that connected various cities in Bangladesh to India were operational till 1965. The recent thrust to rebuild those waterways and develop new routes to ease connectivity will not only be in the interest of bilateral trade between India and Bangladesh, but will also help Indian mainland to connect better with its own North Eastern States.

Indusfood is being billed as the World Food Supermarket – a one-stop event to source all requirements related to food and beverage from India.

                The Central Government has approved a special package for employment generation in leather and footwear sector. The package involves implementation of Central Sector Scheme - Indian Footwear, Leather & Accessories Development Programme (IFLADP) with an approved expenditure of Rs. 2600 Crore for 2017-20.

 

The scheme aims at development of infrastructure for the leather sector, address environmental concerns specific to the leather sector, facilitate additional investments, generate employment and increase production. Enhanced Tax incentives will attract large scale investments in this sector and reforms in labour laws taking into account the seasonal nature of the sector will support economies of scale.

 

In a major boost to the leather industry in Tamil Nadu under the IFLADP four projects with a total outlay of 107.33 crore have been approved by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) to facilitate upgradation of infrastructure, job creation and environmental sustainability.

 

The projects approved in Tamil Nadu are: upgradation of Tala Trichy Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) at Trichy, Pallavaram CETP at Nagalkeni Chrompet, and SIDCO Phase-I CEPT at Ranipet and Perundurai leather industries Eco Security Pvt. Ltd. at Erode.

 

DIPP has also given in-principal approval for mega leather cluster at Bantala in West Bengal. This will generate employment for around 7000 people and lead to an investment of Rs. 400 to 500 crore. 

The Leather Technology, Innovation and Environmental Issues sub-scheme under IFLADP provides financial support at 70% of the project cost to leather clusters to meet the prescribed pollution control discharge norms. This covers establishment, expansion, upgradation of CETPs, developing secure landfills, common recovery units, management of sludge and any other techniques for hazardous waste management.

A total of 9 projects for CETP upgradation with a gross value of Rs. 469.18 crore and GOI assistance of Rs.328.43 crore have already been approved under the sub-scheme. These projects are under implementation.

 

Additional proposals for CETP upgradation are under consideration of the Department.

Niger has appreciated India’s support to build Mahatma Gandhi International Convention Centre in Niamey

          Minister of State for Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs and Food & Public Distribution, C. R. Chaudhary, is leading the Indian delegation to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)- EXIM Bank, Regional Conclave on India-West Africa Project Partnership being held in Abuja, Nigeria on 8th – 9th October 2018. President and Vice President of Nigeria along with Ministers and Delegation of West African countries are participating in the Conclave. 

Minster of State, C. R. Chaudhary, also held bilateral talks with Cape Verde, Niger and other West African countries. C. R. Chaudhary, discussed issues of climate change, electric mobility, renewable energy,tourism, infrastructure development and HR building capacity with Trade Minister of Cape Verde. These are the key areas for collaborative projects between India and Cape Verde.

 Niger has appreciated India’s support to build Mahatma Gandhi International Convention Centre (MGICC)in Niamey in Niger at the cost of USD 35.5 million on grant basis. The foundation stone of the project has been laid recently. 

 India’s exports to Niger increased by more than 50% since 2014-15. There is tremendous scope for increase and diversification of trade between thetwo countries. Minister of State for Commerce & Industry held bilateral meeting with Mr. SadouSeydou, Niger Minister of Trade and Promotion of Private Sectorat the Conclave.

Bilateral relations between India and Niger have expanded significantly since 2009. India has provided lines of credit worth USD 96.54 million for projects in transport, electrification, solar energy and potable drinking water. India’s grant assistance for MGICC will further contribute towards enhancing of bilateral ties. Niger will host the African Union (AU) Summit in 2019 in this Convention Centre. The establishment of the Centre is the land mark of Niger-India friendship and also a symbol of India’s firm commitment towards Africa. 

India has offered to establish Mahatma Gandhi Convention Centre in more than 20 counties of Africa, of which,Centres in 9 countries are being taken up in the immediate future. 

West African countries have taken great strides over the past decade in liberalising their economies and increasing industrialisation.There is significant scope for investment across the region in financial services, energy and power, mining, manufacturing, consumer and retail, transport, heath care and agro processing. 

The Conclave is a two-day event with focus on business deliberations, Business to Government (B2G) and Business to Business (B2B) engagements. It will be an opportunity for the Indian private sector and key institutions, like EXIM Bank of India, to identify priority areas and key projects for Indian investment and partnership with long term commitment to the region.

West Africa region is now seen as the next investment frontier, with many economies of the region, like Ghana,Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal and Benin, recording continuing high economic growth. Despite the enormous potential, West Africa gets only 5 % of FDI that flows to the continent. Therefore, promoting sustainable and inclusive financing is a prerequisite for spurring economic transformation of the region.

                The SEZ Policy Review Committee, headed by Baba Kalyani, met in New Delhi today. This was the final round of consultations with the committee members under the chairmanship of the Commerce Secretary. The group held its first meeting on 22nd June this year under the chairmanship of Commerce & Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu. Subsequently, the group met again on 9th July and 20th August, 2018.      

The objective of the Committee was to evaluate the SEZ policy framed in 2000 and suggest measures to make the policy WTO compatible, give suggestions which will encourage manufacturing and services sector and lead to maximizing utilization of vacant land in SEZs and create seamlessness between SEZ policy and other schemes like Costal Economic Zone, Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, National Industrial Manufacturing Zone, Food Parks and Textile Parks.

The Committee held extensive discussions with representatives of Government of India and states. The changes in the macro-economic environment in India required a re-look at the SEZ Policy framework so that focus is on enabling generation of 100 million jobs in the manufacturing sector, manufacturing competitiveness within the framework of WTO rules, bringing in services sectors like health care, financial and legal services, repair and design services under SEZs. 

The Committee was of the opinion that SEZ should now transform into “Employment and Economic Enclaves” (3Es) which will be an integrated ecosystem that focuses on ease of doing business, quality and infrastructure in order to reduce costs.

The group will submit its final report soon.

Suresh Prabhu releasing a study on   India - China Trade 

            Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, released a study by the Department of Commerce on India-China Trade.  The report tries to analyzethe magnitude, extent and plausible reasons of India’s rising trade deficit with China.

            The Commerce Minister said that India’s trade relationship with China is unique and no other bilateral trading relationship evokes as much interest in India as the India-China trade relationship. From being a small trading partner of India in 2001, within a span of fifteen years, China has rapidly become India’s biggest trading partner. Trade between the two countries has been expanding but India’s trade deficit with China has been growing.

            While releasing the study the Minister said that most industry associations want the Government to pursue a defensive approach to Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and raise tariffs on the doctrine of domestic markets for domestic producers. Protectionist policies are on the rise globally. The global use of protectionist measures in 2018 was unprecedented with the trade wars looming between two of the largest economies of the world.

            Hence, a comparative analysis of the concessions ceded by China on 200 products in its Free Trade Agreements to India’s competing countries like Peru, Pakistan, Australia, South Korea and ASEAN has been carried out by the Department of Commerce. Also the imports of China from these countries as well as China’s Most Favored Nation (MFN) rates have been studied. This analysis helps in studying whether an FTA or tariff concessions by China to India (like China has yielded to India’s competing countries in FTA) can be beneficial in increasing India’s exports to China. The idea behind this exercise has been to identify whether tariff concessions by China to other countries impede raising the share of India’s exports in the Chinese market. These lines can be taken up by India for negotiations with China under agreements like Asia Pacific Free Trade Agreement (APTA) in which both India and China are involved during the review exercise.

            The study is divided into eight sections beginning with an introduction into the historical aspects of trade relations between India and China and the trends of bilateral trade between the two. It also looks into the trends of trade deficit, and analyses India’s exports and imports to and from China at the HS 6-digit level. It alsoanalyses at HS 6-digit level, China’s share in India’s import basket (extent of dependency on China as a source) and India’s share in China’s export basket.

            Competing countries who have FTAs with China, limits the scope for Indian exports. This is due to higher tariffs faced by exporters as compared to competing nations who have secured tariff concessions under their FTAs. The top 200 items of China’s imports from India (2017) wherein the tariff advantages available to India’s competing partners in the Chinese market have been analyzed. 

            The study also underlines the opportunity available for India in increasing its services exports to China. Indices like Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and Trade Complementarity Index (TCI) have been used to analyse the extent of India and China’s competiveness in this arena and the potential for the future.

            There is a separate section on the opportunities arising for India out of US - China trade standoff with a detailed analysis of specific tariff lines on which tariffs have been levied by China on the US amidst the ongoing trade war and the potential for India to fill in the gaps left by America in the Chinese market.

 Alphonso from Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Palghar, Thane and Raigad districts of  Maharashtra, is registered as Geographical Indication (GI).  A Geographical Indication or a GI is an indication used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. Such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness which is essentially attributable to its origin in that defined geographical locality. Darjeeling Tea, Mahabaleshwar Strawberry, Blue Pottery of Jaipur, Banarasi Sarees and TirupatiLaddus are some of the GIs.

GI products can benefit the rural economy in remote areas, by supplementing the incomes of artisans, farmers, weavers and craftsmen. Our rural artisans possess unique skills and knowledge of traditional practices and methods, passed down from generation to generation, which need to be protected and promoted.

Recently, Union Minister of Commerce and Industry, Suresh Prabhu, launched the logo and tagline for the Geographical Indications (GI) of India and said that the GI will give the rightful share in the intellectual property to the artisan and the place of origin of the product. He emphasised that it’s an area of strength and optimism for India, whereby GI tag has given protection to a large number of hand-made and manufactured products, especially in the informal sector. 

 The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion has taken several initiatives in this regard and is actively involved in promotion and marketing of GIs with a vision to enhance the horizon both socially and economically for GI producers. 

The king of mangoes, Alphonso, better known as ‘Hapus’ in Maharashtra, is in demand in domestic and international markets not only for its taste but also for pleasant fragrance and vibrant colour. It has long been one of the world's most popular fruit and is exported to various countries including Japan, Korea and Europe. New markets such as USA and Australia have recently opened up.

The first product to get a GI tag in India was the Darjeeling tea in 2004. There are a total of 325productsfrom India that carry this indication.

                India Mobile Congress(IMC) 2018 – a marquee event which provided a peep into the exciting future in the rapidly evolving area of digital communications – ended today, with participants and organisers promising to be back next year. This year’s event, with its’ theme of “New Digital Horizons – Connect. Create. Innovate.”, established the IMC as a regular platform for global and local stakeholders in the sector to collaborate in the cause of exploring opportunities and leveraging possibilities, with specific focus on South and South-East Asia.

Addressing members of the press and media on the last day of IMC 2018, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Communications, Shri Manoj Sinha said – “Having participated in the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona earlier this year, I can assure you that IMC 2018 was no less – in terms of substance, scale, and style. The IMC is just a two-year old baby, and it has already acquired a personality of its’ own. It will now be an important annual event on everyone’s calendar.”

The mega 3-day event was inaugurated on October 25 by Shri Manoj Sinha,Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Communications, in the august presence ofShri Suresh Prabhu, Minister for Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation; Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister for Electronics & Information Technology and Law & Justice, and Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Housing & Urban Affairs.

The IMC 2018 conference and exhibition was held over a total area of more than 50,000 square-metres, with more than 5,000 delegates in attendance. Delegations from 20 countriesparticipated in the event, which saw more than 300 companies showcasing their latest and best technologies, products, services, and applications. According to the organisers, more than 50,000 curious visitors attended the various sessions and viewed the futuristic solutions on display at the exhibition stalls.

An extremely relevant addition at this edition of the IMC was the presence of high-level ministerial delegations from several BIMSTEC and ASEAN countries. Hon’ble Ministers from the European Commission, Cambodia, Myanmar, Nepal, and Lao PDR led their respective delegations, and participated in plenary sessions which were focused on the specific needs, challenges, and opportunities applicable to member countries of these regional forums. The presence of the high-level delegations also offered them an opportunity for bilateral meetings with their Indian counterparts, where topics of mutual interest were discussed, and possibilities of strengthening cooperation were explored.

Among the companies whose participationcontributed to the success of IMC 2018 were global and local giants such as Samsung, Intel, Ericsson, Nokia, Cisco, NEC, Accenture, KPMG, E&Y, Facebook, Huawei, Sterlite, Vodafone Idea, Reliance Jio, Airtel, and BSNL.

The exhibition stalls covered a variety of interesting possibilities, hinged around 5G, Internet of Things, Augmented and Virtual Reality,Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Smart City Solutions, Fintech, Health-Tech, Autonomous Cars, and Cyber Security, amongst others.

An interesting feature of this edition of the IMC was the focused attention on the critical Start-ups ecosystem. More than 200 start-ups marked their presence at the event, with their booths displaying ideas and innovations which seek to leverage the potential of digital communications to create and meet ever-changing consumer needs – in areas such as artificial intelligence, integrated services, healthcare, pharma, security, safety, food, sports, social networking, travel, education, and disaster management, among others. As Shri Manoj Sinha, while inaugurating the simultaneous release of 250 start-up applications at the IMC 2018 today, said – “The sheer volume and quality of what I see here is amazing. Who knows, we may right now be releasing the WhatsApp and Google Maps of tomorrow!”

The event was also noteworthy for some very remarkable announcements which clearly established the direction of the Indian digital communications industry over the next several years. The Government of India announced the commitment of the industry to rollout One Million WiFi Hotspots in the Country by December 2019. The National Frequency Allocation Plan (NFAP) 2018 was also unveiled at the event. NFAP 2018 frees up a total of 605 MHz spectrum in the 5-GHz band for Wi-Fi services. Several spectrum bands for Short Range Devices and Ultra WideBand Devices have been made license exempt, benefitting the public as well as industry. As Ms. Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary (Telecom) and Chairman, Telecom Commission, Government of India said – “These initiatives provide an excellent launchpad for achieving the goals such as Broadband for All, which are outlined in our recently released National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP) 2018.”

In his concluding remarks, the Minister added – “Our Government, under the leadership of the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, remains committed to make the digital communications sector a core part of our national infrastructure. The initiatives and reforms we have announced here will provide a strong boost to employment generation and digital economic activity – especially in the rural and semi-rural areas of the country. We are determined to succeed in our endeavours, in partnership with industry, academia, regulators, and startups.”

Shri Sinha thanked the Department of Telecommunications and the Cellular Operators Association of India for designing and successfully organising a best-in-class event.

                India Mobile Congress (IMC) is one of the biggest marquee Mobile, Internet, and Technology event for South and South-East Asia, with the theme, “New Digital Horizons – Connect. Create. Innovate.”, 

IMC 2018 began on a grand-scale at Aero City, New Delhi with over 300 companies, 20 countries participating in this prestigious event in the Asia Pacific region. Shri Manoj Sinha, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Communications and Minister of State for Railways, accompanied by Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Minister of Electronics and Information Technology and Law & Justice, Shri Suresh Prabhu, Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Housing & Urban Affairs, Ministers and dignitaries from Cambodia, European Union, Lao-PDR, Myanmar, Mauritius, Nepal, South Africa inaugurated and participated in this 2nd edition of the epoch marking event, which began in 2017 to build a collaboration platform for technologies and services in next generation mobile communications. The inauguration ceremony was attended by over 5000 people from 10 partner countries, and included policy makers, ambassadors, opinion makers, change agents, bureaucrats and investors.

 Shri Manoj Sinha, announced that the Indian telecom industry will rollout one million WiFi hotspots in the country by December 2019, which is another step towards the digital empowerment of the nation. Bharat Wi-Fi, a country-wide common inter-operable platform of one million Wi-Fi Hotspots, owned and operated by Telecom Service Providers, Internet Service Providers and Virtual Network Operators will be rolled out across the country. This initiative allows consumers to access Wi-Fi Hotspots of any of the partnering operators.  

The National Frequency Allocation Plan 2018 (NFAP) was unveiled during the inauguration presenting a pioneering roadmap for the Indian digital communications industry. The NFAP released a quantum of 605 MHz license exempt spectrum in 5GHz band for Wireless Access Services and Radio Local Area Networks in outdoor, to meet the ever-growing appetite for data (from a current figure of 50 MHz since 2007). The NFAP also offered over 30 license exempt bands for Short Range Devices (SRDs), Ultra-Wideband Devices (UWDs) and additional spectrum for M2M services, creating opportunities for the public to enjoy benefits from technologies and enabling the industry to build domestic manufacturing ecosystem. India signalled its spectrum plans for 5G services aspiring to adopt the next generation technology as a leading market.

In a major policy initiative, which will give impetus to small and medium entrepreneurship in Telecom Sector, DoT decided to deduct payments for resources taken by Virtual Network Operators (VNOs) from telecom service providers, thereby reducing levies payable by VNOs. This avoids double taxation at various stages.

A concrete plan is in making by the DoT to enable homegrown technologies for trials in the field on a large scale to enable the development and the scaling up of the products and services.

The day 1 has witnessed many rousing announcements by the industry and demos of the state of the art 5G applications by global OEMs. Investments of approximately over INR 2000 crores and over 3 lakh jobs are expected to be created.

                The Department of Telecommunications (DOT) and Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) in a joint statement today clarified that a few news reports in the media which state that 50 Crore mobile numbers, almost half of the total mobiles in circulation, are at the risk of disconnection, are completely untrue and imaginary. The news report tries to create unnecessary panic among mobile users by claiming that “they stare a prospect of disconnection if SIM cards procured on the basis of Aadhaar verification are not backed up by a fresh identification”.  

The joint statement clarifies that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its judgement in Aadhaar case has nowhere directed that the mobile number which has been issued through Aadhaar eKYC has to be disconnected. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason for panic or fear at all. People should not believe in such rumours. The Court has also not asked to delete all the eKYC data of telecom customers after 6 months. What the apex Court has asked that UIDAI should not keep authentication log for more than 6 months. The restriction is on UIDAI and not on the telecom companies. Therefore, there is no need for telecom companies to delete authentication logs.

So in the light of the verdict if anybody wishes to get her/his Aadhaar eKYC replaced by the fresh KYC, s/he may request the service provider for delinking of her/his Aadhaar by submitting fresh OVDs as per earlier DOT Circulars on mobile KYC. But in any case his mobile number will not be disconnected. 

The Joint Statement said that what Supreme Court has done is that it has prohibited issue of new SIM cards through Aadhaar eKYC authentication process due to lack of a law. There is no direction to deactivate the old mobile phones. 

The statement said that in fact the Department of Telecom and UIDAI are in a process to bring out a completely hassle-free and digital process for issuing new SIM cards through a mobile App which will be fully compliant of the Supreme Court judgement in Aadhaar Case. In the proposed process, live photograph of the person with latitude, longitude, and time stamp will be captured. The photo of her ID such as Aadhaar card, voter ID, etc., will be captured. The SIM card agent will be authenticated through OTP and SIM card will be issued. This process will be completely hassle-free and digital. 

 The statement reiterates that there is no need to panic or get confused by the reports that have appeared in the media.

                Minister of State for Communications (Independent Charge), Shri Manoj Sinha today shared the details of the public outreach activities being undertaken by the Department of Posts (DoP) during the National Postal Week starting October 09, 2018. The Minister was addressing the media here on the occasion of World Post Day 2018. This day marks the creation of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) in 1874.

Addressing the gathering, the Minister said – “With the nation-wide launch of 650 branches and 3250 access points of IPPB by the Prime Minister last month, the trusted Postman has now become a banker to millions of unbanked and under-banked Indians who have so far had no access to financial services. More than 12 lakh IPPB accounts have been opened so far, with a balance of more than Rs. 13 crores. All the 1.55 lakh Post Offices in the country will be linked to the IPPB system by December 31, 2018.

Shri Sinha also shared that India Post is committed to provide responsive and convenient citizen-centric services to the people of the country. The Department has set up and operationalized 221 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs) in partnership with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), and processed more than 15 lakh passport appointments so far. Additionally, 13,352 Aadhar Enrolment and Updation Centres have been set up in partnership with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI),where more than 21 lakh enrolments and updates have been completed.

The benefits of the Postal Life Insurance (PLI) product have now been extended to doctors, engineers, management consultants, CAs, architects, teachers, lawyers, and bankers, as well as employees of companies listed on the NSE and BSE. More than 1600 villages in the country have been covered under the Sampoorna Bima Gram (SBG) Yojana, providing financial security to more than two lakh families in these villages. Of the 1.46 crore Sukanya Samriddhi Accounts opened in the country so far, 1.27 crore accounts reside with Post Offices. The Department has also launched creative initiatives such as the Deen Dayal Scholarship for Promotion of Aptitude and Research in Stamps as a Hobby (SPARSH), under which 841 students were awarded scholarships during the year 2017-18.

Shri Sinha also released a corporate brochure on the products and services being offered by India Post. Speaking on the occasion, Secretary (Posts) Shri Anant Narayan Nanda highlighted the setting up of a new Parcel Directorate in the department to focus on the parcel business which has undergone a radical transformation with the emergence of the e-Commerce business in the country. “We will continue to reinvent ourselves to keep pace with the changing needs of our countrymen”, he said.

Shri Sinha also emphasized that, under the leadership of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Government is committed to take care of it’s staff, who are the foundation to support the changing face of the Department. “The recent revision in the wages and allowances of more than 2.6 lakh Gramin Dak Sevaks (GDS), resulting in an average increase of more than 55% in the emoluments of this category, is only a small step in this direction”, he concluded.

The Chief Minister of Tripura, Shri Biplab Kumar Deb called on the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs,Food and Public Distribution Shri Ram Vilas Paswan at KrishiBhawan in New Delhitoday. In the meeting,theChief Minister of Tripura, Shri Biplab Kumar Deb requested that Food Corporation of India(FCI) should take up procurement of paddy and other food grains  in the state of Tripura for greater interest of the farmers in the region. It was discussed that FCI will explore feasibility of procurement within North Tripura and Unokoti Districts (adjacent to Assam) in the 1st phase and get the paddy milled from rice mills located at neighbouring Silchar/Karimganj districts of Assam, as per policy of the Government of India. The Chief Minister requested that a special policy should be made for the North-East state of Tripura for procurement by FCI. Shri Ram Vilas Paswan assured the Chief Minister that the matter would be referred to the Union Cabinet for a special policy for the state of Tripura.  

Existing induction of rice by  FCI from outsideTripura involves huge transportation and handling costs and in case of local procurement, there will be considerable savings. Annual production of Paddy in the State is around 12 lakh MT. Entire requirement of PDS (2.71 lakh MT) could be met out of the local production instead of induction from outside by the FCI.

                Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) reviewed the price and availability situation of Onion in Delhi in a High Level meeting chaired by the Secretary, DoCA Shri Avinash K. Srivastava with all the concerned stakeholders today. It was observed that while the wholesale prices of Onions had peaked during the middle of the month of October, they have now moderated marginally. To sustain the momentum, a decision was taken to further increase daily supply for Delhi from the existing buffer created under Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF).  

Measures to reduce gap in the prices at wholesale and retail levels in Delhi were also discussed in the meeting. In this context, Delhi government was advised to undertake supply of onions as was done during the previous high price year i.e. 2015 through its PDS outlets. Prices in Delhi would be monitored closely and Delhi government would consider intervening in the market in case prices start hardening. Safal/Mother Dairy was also directed to increase supply of Onion through its retail outlets and larger quantities of Onion would be made available to them from the buffer under PSF.

It was indicated by Horticulture division (DAC&FW) that sown area under the Kharif Onion Crop has increased by 37 percent as compared to 2017 and informed that the supply position of Onions in the market has improved as harvesting has begun in Rajasthan, Sholapur in Maharashtra, Hubli in Karnataka and Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh. This will improve availability in consuming areas, thereby, helping moderate prices in the coming days.

The Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan provided a point by point reply to the Punjab Chief Minister while assuring him of all possible help in this regard. Regarding the specific demand for ID Cess and Purchase Tax on Wheat (RMS 2017-18) stocks in hand as on 30th June 2017, Rs. 708.26 crore is the admissible amount for Punjab out of which 50% of the amount has already been paid while payment of balance 50% amount for Purchase Tax & ID Cess has been processed and is under examination. 

Regarding the demand for Subsidy under National Food Security Act for 2nd and 3rd quarter 2018, Shri Paswan said that due to issues with the submitted advance subsidy claim provided by the State to the Ministry, the claims could not be processed and the State had been advised to submit the bills in proper format. State has submitted rectified claims on 4.10.2018 which will be examined. Further, for disbursement of subsidy in future, State has been advised to implement PFMS fully as per directive of Ministry of Finance and ensure use of EAT Module by IAs.It was also stated that for the Financial Year 2017-18, 796.33 crores have been released.

Regarding the Custody & Maintenance Charges for Paddy, FCS up to KMS 2013-14 years have been issued by the Department. For future cases, State Government may present their claims during the time of finalization. FCI has also released Rs. 300 crore based on data/information submitted by State Government/Agencies as per FCS. The clarification sought by FCI is being examined.

The Punjab Chief Minister also requested for reimbursement of Custody and Maintenance Charges on the storage of wheat in open plinths in Punjab from the year 2007-08 onwards. Shri Paswan stated that this matter was examined in the Department and since State Govt. of Punjab could not produce any relevant documents/ supporting documents at the time of finalization of Cost Sheet, the Department of Food based on available documents finalized the Cost Sheet. Also, a view has been taken that all the closed issues prior to 2014-15 need not be reopened and there should not be any retrospective review of the decisions already taken.

Chief Minister of Puducherry to provide detailed proposal for distribution of food grains through PDS in next 15 days to Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & PD

 

The Chief Minister of Puducherry Shri V. Narayanasamy today met with the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan. The Puducherry Chief Minister explained that due to drought in the Union Territory (U.T) from the past 2 years and various other factors, the Public Distribution Scheme (PDS) model is more appropriate for the U.T. as compared to the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) model and requested that the U.T. be allowed to procure rice locally from the farmers directly. 

 

Shri Narayanasamy requested the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Shri Ram Vilas Paswan to allow procurement of 80,000 tonnes of Paddy locally from the farmers out of which 48,000 tonnes of Rice can be extracted. The National Food Security Act requirement of Puducherry is 45,000 tonnes. He also demanded that Single boiled Rice should be provided through the Public Distribution Scheme.

The Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan gave in principal approval to the demands of the Chief Minister of Puducherry but requested him to ensure that the beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act are provided their due share in a fair and transparent manner. Shri Paswan stressed that PDS shops should be accurately tagged with the beneficiaries, proper transportation should be arranged for taking the procured rice to the PDS shops, checks should be kept on PDS shops with regular inspections and any malpractice should be immediately reported.

This move is likely to reduce the costs involved with procurement and transportation of Rice from other states as the U.T. will be able to procure the required rice locally and also ensure that the local farmers are able to get the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) for their produce. The Chief Minister of Puducherry Shri V. Narayanasamy assured the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan that a detailed proposal in this regard will be given to the Ministry within 15 days.

                The Committee of Experts has submitted its report on Regulating audit firms and the Networks to the Government of India through the Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The Committee was constituted on April 20, 2018 pursuant to the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of S. Sukumar versus The Secretary, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.  The Committee consisted of Shri Anurag Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs,  Shri Sudhanshu Pandey, Additional Secretary, Department of Commerce and Shri Ravinder, Joint Secretary, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion.

 

The report addresses the issues raised by the Supreme Court with a focus to strengthen the legal regime of auditors and promote development of the audit profession in the country. The Committee scrutinised the networking arrangements adopted by the big four audit firms commonly referred as multi-national accounting firms to understand their legal structure and method of operation. The Committee also addressed serious concerns like conflict of interest and transparency arising out of non-audit services provided by auditors and their network, and suggested necessary checks and balances. Further, the report deals with the issue of concentration of market power which is another contemporary problem in the market for audit services. 

 

The global trend indicates a clear shift from self-regulation to independent regulatory structure in the domain of audit regulation due to the failure of self-regulatory model in regulating the professionals. In light of these developments, the Committee found establishment of the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) as a necessary institutional reform which would align the Indian audit landscape with the global position. The Committee also recommended measures to further strengthen the operation of NFRA to address contemporary challenges in relation to auditors, audit firms and networks operating in India. 

 

Since it is important to facilitate a business friendly environment for corporate and professionals in India, Indian laws and regulations on professional services needs to keep pace with changing market dynamics. Taking note of this requirement, the report delves into critical issues like advertising, multi-disciplinary practice firms and branding and suggested measures to rationalise the existing laws. These measures are expected to not only enhance the standards of services offered to corporates, but also facilitate the audit firms to expand in size and operation to compete globally.

 

For arriving at the findings and recommendations, the Committee adopted a holistic methodology which included internal meetings, engagement with relevant stakeholders, examining past reports discussed in the Supreme Court's judgment, global literature and best practices in the auditing landscape.

 

The Committee was ably supported by the research work of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and Certified Professional Accountants Afghanistan (CPA Afghanistan).  The MoU will establish mutual co-operation framework in the areas of Capacity Building of ""Afghanistan Accountancy Board (AAB)"", strengthening the IT Capacity and Quality Assurance in Afghanistan through facilitating Knowledge Transfer; Students and Members Exchange Programs; Conduct of Seminars, Conferences and Joint Activities mutually beneficial to both the parties.

 

Targets:

 


	Students and members exchange programs from their respective jurisdictions so as to update them on the emerging developments in the areas of accounting profession either in the form of study tours or as may be mutually decided by both the Institutions;



	Providing updates on the development of the accountancy profession in India, and promote international good professional practices;
	Strengthening the   quality   assurance   setup   in   Afghanistan   through facilitating knowledge transfer to help implement regime of necessary quality controls and periodic reviews in Afghanistan.


 

Major impact:

 

India and Afghanistan share a very strong partnership based on historical and cultural links. In the recent past, the partnership between the two countries has touched new heights when India's Afghanistan policy shifted to a more confident and multi-dimensional approach by opening Investment in Afghanistan's nascent democracy and economy; strengthening Kabul's defence capability and promoting regional connectivity and integration.

It is also believed that the relationship developed between the two countries over the past few years is strategic in nature and is of mutual benefit.

 

Background:

 

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament of India, 'The Chartered Accountants Act, 1949', to regulate the profession of Chartered Accountancy in India.

                The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code) is a modern economic legislation. Section 240 of the Code empowers the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) to make regulations subject to the conditions that the regulations: (a) carry out the provisions of the Code, (b) are consistent with the Code and the rules made thereunder; (c) are made by a notification published in the official gazette; and (d) are laid, as soon as possible, before each House of Parliament for 30 days. 

Given the importance of subordinate legislations for the various processes under the Code, it is essential that the IBBI has a structured, robust mechanism, which includes effective engagement with the stakeholders, for making regulations. Section 196 (1) (s) of the Code requires the IBBI to specify mechanisms for issuing regulations, including the conduct of public consultation processes, before notification of regulations. In sync with this philosophy and the statutory requirement, the IBBI notified the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Mechanism for Issuing Regulations) Regulations, 2018 (Issuing Regulations) to govern the process of making regulations and consulting the public . 

The Issuing Regulations provide that for the purpose of making or amending any regulations, the IBBI shall upload the following, with the approval of the Governing Board, on its website seeking comments from the public- 


	draft of proposed regulations; 
	the specific provision of the Code under which the Board proposes regulations; 
	a statement of the problem that the proposed regulation seeks to address; 
	an economic analysis of the proposed regulations;
	a statement carrying norms advocated by international standard setting agencies and the international best practices, if any, relevant to the proposed regulation; 
	the manner of implementation of the proposed regulations; and 
	the manner, process and timelines for receiving comments from the public.


 The IBBI shall allow at least twenty-one days for public to submit their comments. It shall consider the public comments received and upload the same on its website along with a general statement of its response on the comments, not later than the date of notification of regulations. If the Governing Board decides to approve regulations in a form substantially different from the proposed regulations, it shall repeat the process under the Issuing Regulations. The regulations shall be notified promptly after it is approved by the Governing Board and the date of their enforcement shall ordinarily be after thirty days from the date of notification unless a different date is specified therein. 

However, where the IBBI is of the opinion that certain regulations are required to be made or existing regulations are required to be amended urgently, it may make regulations or amend the existing regulations, as the case may be, with the approval of the Governing Board, without following the above process of consultation.

The Issuing Regulations are effective from 22nd October, 2018. These are available at www.mca.gov.in and www.ibbi.gov.in.

                            The Insolvency Law Committee (ILC) constituted by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to recommend amendments to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of India, 2016,  has submitted its 2nd Report to the Government, which deals with cross border insolvency.  The  Report  was  handed  over today to Shri Arun Jaitley, Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs by  Corporate Affairs Secretary, Shri Injeti Srinivas.

The ILC has recommended the adoption of  the UNCITRAL Model Law of Cross Border Insolvency, 1997, as it provides for  a comprehensive framework to deal with cross  border insolvency issues.  The Committee has also recommended a few carve outs to ensure that there is no inconsistency between the domestic insolvency framework and the proposed Cross Border Insolvency Framework.

The UNCITRAL Model Law has been adopted in as many as 44 countries and, therefore, forms part of international best practices in dealing with cross border insolvency issues.  The advantages of the model law are the precedence given to domestic proceedings and protection of public interest. The other advantages include greater confidence generation among foreign investors, adequate flexibility for seamless integration with the domestic Insolvency Law and a robust mechanism for international cooperation.

The model law deals with four major  principles of cross-border insolvency, namely  direct access to foreign insolvency professionals and foreign creditors to participate in or commence domestic insolvency proceedings against a defaulting debtor; recognition of foreign proceedings & provision of remedies; cooperation between domestic and foreign courts & domestic and foreign insolvency practioners; and coordination between two or more concurrent insolvency proceedings in different countries.  The main proceeding is determined by the concept of centre of main interest (“COMI”).

The necessity of having Cross Border Insolvency Framework  under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code arises from the fact that many Indian companies have a global footprint and many foreign companies have presence in multiple  countries including India.  Although the proposed Framework for Cross Border Insolvency will enable us to deal with Indian companies having foreign assets and vice versa, it still does not provide for  a framework for dealing with enterprise groups, which is still work in progress with UNCITRAL and other international bodies.  The inclusion of the Cross Border Insolvency Chapter in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of India, 2016, will be a major step forward and will bring Indian Insolvency Law  on a par with that of matured jurisdictions.

                To commemorate its establishment on 1st October, 2016, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has instituted an Annual Day Lecture by a distinguished leader having substantial contribution in the field of law and economics, including insolvency and bankruptcy. Hon’ble Mr. Justice Sudhansu Jyoti Mukhopadhaya, Chairperson, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal delivered the IBBI Inaugural Annual Day Lecture today on “Emerging Trends in Law and Governance” at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library Auditorium, New Delhi. The lecture witnessed presence of Judicial and Technical Members of the NCLAT, President, NCLT, Chairmen and Members of Regulatory Bodies, Senior Officers of the Government, Chairmen and CEOs of Service Providers, namely, Insolvency Professional Agencies, Information Utility and Registered Valuer Organisations, Business Leaders, Advocates, Academics, and Insolvency Professional and Registered Valuers. 

 



 

Dr. M. S. Sahoo, Chairperson, IBBI in his welcome address briefly shared the fast, but passionate journey of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code) and progress in its implementation. He stated that the Code envisages market-led solutions to address honest failures. It provides for orderly resolution of failing, but viable firms and closure of failing and unviable ones with the least cost and disruption and thereby provides the ultimate economic freedom, the freedom to exit. The scheme of incentives and disincentives under the Code would bring in behavioural changes on the part of every stakeholder, minimising the incidence of failure, default and under-performance and therefore, in the long run, the best use of the Code would be not using it at all.

In his Annual Day Address, the Hon’ble Justice Mr. M. M. Kumar, President, NCLT stated the track record of disposal of matters by the NCLT under the Code, both in terms of quantity and quality, has been unparalleled in judicial history. He also stated that not more than 10% orders of the NCLT are appealed against. Further, he stated that the old regimes such as SARFAESI, or SICA had given the powers in the hands of debtors whereas the Code has strengthened rights of creditors and entrusted the ultimate control of the defaulting firm to a Committee of Creditor to either resolve or liquidate the debtor’s business. While acknowledging quality services by insolvency professionals, he suggested that they may be given additional training in the area of general principles of law and the Contract Act. He lauded the IBBI for its prompt response to emerging needs. 

The Hon’ble Justice Mr. Sudhansu Jyoti Mukhopadhaya extensively dwelt on dynamic law and governance framework in fast growing economies in the world, which is founded on economic freedom. He stated that a firm needs freedom broadly at three stages of its life - to start a business (free entry), to continue the business (free competition) and to discontinue the business (free exit). This enables new firms to emerge continuously. They do business when they are efficient and vacate the space when they are no longer efficient. This ensures the most efficient use of resources and consequently optimum economic wellbeing. The Competition Act endeavours to provide freedom to continue business, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 endeavours to provide freedom to discontinue business, and the Companies Act regulates the conduct of companies engaged in business. These legislations are of recent origin and define the contours of economic freedom and consequently economic wellbeing. 

The Hon’ble Justice Mr. Mukhopadhyay complimented the IBBI for setting high standards of competence and dedication and achieving significant milestones by upholding the principles and objectives of the Code with utmost sincerity. While emphasising the need for more powers to the IBBI, he suggested that there should be regulations to regulate the conduct of the Committee of Creditors and its members.

On this occasion, a publication titled ‘Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 and Distressed Assets Opportunities’ prepared by the three Insolvency Professional Agencies, namely, the Indian Institute of Insolvency Professionals of ICAI, the ICSI Institute of Insolvency Professionals, and the Insolvency Professional Agency of the Institute of Cost Accountants of India, in partnership with the Society of Insolvency Practitioners of India was released. 

Mr. Saji Kumar, Executive Director, IBBI extended vote of thanks at the end of the event.

                Today, one can start business by incorporating a company through an on-line process without visiting any Government office. This was achieved in January, 2016 by establishing Central Registry Centre (CRC) for on-line incorporation of the company and reserving its unique name. Two on-line forms that were introduced for the purpose, are Simplified Proforma for Incorporating Company Electronically (SPICe) and Reserve Unique Name (RUN). Today, as part of online process for company incorporation, PAN and TAN are issued on near real time basis by integrating online process with the department of Income Tax. Through process re-engineering, DIN is also allotted to the individuals at the time of their appointment as Director in the Company. Every week, 2700 number of companies are incorporated through online company incorporation system. 

          Ministry of Corporate Affairs has thus contributed significantly towards ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in the country as today, a company can be incorporated in less than two days along with allotment of PAN, TAN, DIN and Unique Name through the online process. Our endeavors is that very soon, this entire process doesn’t take more than one day.

          Today, Ministry of Corporate Affairs has launched another process re-engineering by making incorporation of Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) through a complete online system. From today onwards through a web service titled “RUN-LLP (Reserve Unique Name – Limited Liability Partnership)”. Name can also be allotted to LLP through an e-form titled “FiLiP (Form for incorporation of Limited Liability Partnership). 

The Limited Liability Partnership Rules have been amended on 18th September 2018 which would come into effect from 02nd October 2018. The said amendment rules contain changes as detailed below:

(i)      Introduction of a Web Service titled ‘RUN-LLP (Reserve Unique Name – Limited Liability Partnership)’ replacing the erstwhile Form 1 (Application for reservation or change of name).

(ii)     Introduction of a new integrated Form christened FiLLiP (Form for incorporation of Limited Liability Partnership) replacing the erstwhile Form 2 (Incorporation document and subscriber’s statement) combining therein 3 services i.e.,

a)       Name reservation.

b)      Allotment of Designated Partner Identification Number (DPIN/DIN).

c)       Incorporation of the LLP.

Bajpai, former Chairman, SEBI, Shri G.C.

                The Tagore Award for Cultural Harmony for the years 2014, 2015 & 2016 is being conferred   on the doyen of Manipuri dance Sh. Rajkumar Singhajit Singh; Chhayanaut (a cultural organization of Bangladesh) and on one of India’s greatest sculptors, Sh. Ram Vanji Sutar, respectively.

 

The Jury under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister, Sh Narendra Modi and comprising of the Chief Justice of India, Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Shri N. Gopalaswami & Dr. Vinay Sahasrabuddhe after detailed discussions on 24th October, 2018 unanimously decided to select Sh. Rajkumar Singhajit Singh, Chhayanaut and Sh. Ram Vanji Sutar to be the recipients of the Tagore Award for the years 2014, 2015 & 2016 respectively, in recognition of their outstanding contribution to cultural harmony.

 

Shri Rajkumar Singhajit Singh, a doyen of Manipuri dance, has distinguished himself both as an outstanding teacher, performer and choreographer.  His work over the years bears witness to his creativity within the framework of traditional Manipuri dance. His choreography has been enriched by elements incorporated from various forms of performing arts of Manipur such as Thang-ta, Nata-Sankirtana, Lai-haraoba and Rasleela. The award recognizes his contribution in keeping the tradition of Manipuri dance alive and vibrant, promoting harmony through dance and also pays tribute to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, who, deeply influenced by Manipuri dance, made it an integral part of the education curriculum at Visva Bharati.

 

Chhayanaut, established in 1961, has played a leading role in promoting Tagore’s works and Bengali culture, music and literature not only within Bangladesh, but all across the world. It has built a close bridge of understanding and cultural exchange between Bangladesh and India, especially West Bengal. Chhayanaut was part of the movement for an independent Bangladesh and provided a platform for cultural expression and assertion of Bengali identity. When Rabindra Sangeet was banned in East Pakistan, Chhayanaut continued to promote liberal expression through secret renditions of Tagore songs and discussions on Tagore. The jury's decision recognizes the contribution of the organization in upholding the liberal progressive tradition of universal humanism of Gurudev and in promoting the spirit of cultural harmony.

 

Sh. Ram Vanji Sutar is one of the greatest living sculptors of India. He has created more than fifty monumental sculptures in the last forty years of his career. At the beginning of his career, he was involved in restoring several ancient sculptures found in the caves of Ellora and Ajanta. His first notable work was the 45 feet Chambal monument at the Gandhi Sagar Dam, in Madhya Pradesh. This gigantic masterpiece carved out of a single block depicts mother Chambal with her two children- Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan symbolizing the brotherhood of the two states. His iconic bust of Mahatma Gandhi is one of the most celebrated representations of the Mahatma, as is his bronze bust of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. The jury's decision recognizes his outstanding contribution to the preservation of Indian culture and its artistic tradition.

 

The annual award was instituted by the Government of India during the commemoration of 150th Birth Anniversary of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. 

 

The first Tagore Award was conferred on Pt. Ravi Shankar, the Indian Sitar Maestro in 2012 and second was conferred on Shri Zubin Mehta in 2013. The award carries an amount of Rs. 1 crore, a citation in a scroll, a plaque as well as an exquisite traditional handicraft/ handloom item. The award is open to all persons regardless of nationality, race, language, caste, creed or sex.

                Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, hoisted the National Flag at Red Fort and unveiled the plaque to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of formation of Azad Hind Government, formed by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. The commemoration of this significant historical event was also attended by Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State for Culture(I/c), Shri Chandra Kumar Bose, nephew of Netaji, Shri Lalti Ram, INA Veteran and Brig. R.S. Chikkara.



 

Prime Minister congratulated the nation on the proud occasion of 75thanniversary of formation of Azad Hind Government. Speaking on the occasion, he said that Azad Hind government represented the vision laid down by Subhas Chandra Bose, of a strong undivided India. He added that Azad Hind government was actively involved in nation building and had even started its own bank, currency and stamps. 

Recalling the contributions of Netaji, Prime Minister said that Subhas Chandra Bose was a visionary, who united Indians to fight against the powerful colonial British rule. He added that Bose showed patriotism right from a young age, as was visible from the letters he wrote to his mother. 

 

Shri Narendra Modi said that Netaji was not just an inspiration for Indians, but for all those who were fighting for self-determination and freedom in countries all over the world. In this context he mentioned how South African leader Nelson Mandela was inspired by Netaji.

Reminding the nation that there is a long way to go before building a new India as envisioned by Subhas Chandra Bose, Prime Minister urged the citizens to get inspired by Netaji and work towards the development of the nation. He added that India achieved independence after lots of sacrifices and it is the duty of citizens to preserve that independence.

Shri Narendra Modi recalled that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose laid down the foundation for equal opportunity for women in armed forces, through the formation of Rani Jhansi Regiment. Prime Minister said that the government is carrying forward this legacy in true means and reiterated that women will be given equal opportunity for permanent commission in armed forces.

The Prime Minister also reiterated that he had earlier announced an award in the name of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, to honour those involved in disaster response operations. The award would be given every year, recognizing the bravery and courage displayed in saving lives of people, in the wake of a disaster, he added.

Earlier delivering the Welcome address Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State for Culture (I/c) said that the nation salutes Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose whose supreme sacrifice and leadership continues to guide our young generation. He thanked the able leadership of the Prime Minister for making this Event a success.

The Azad Hind Government, founded on 21st October, 1943 was inspired by Neta ji Subhash Chandra Bose who was the leader of Azad Hind Government and also the Head of State of this Provisional Indian Government-in-exile. It was a part of the freedom movement, originating in 1940s outside India with a purpose of allying with Axis powers to free India from British rule. The existence of the Azad Hind Government gave a greater legitimacy to the independence struggle against the British. Pertinently, the role of Azad Hind Fauj or the Indian National Army (INA) had been crucial in bequeathing a much needed impetus to India’s struggle for Independence.

The Artist’s  collaborative spirit and creative processes pays tribute to both Gandhi and the country.

                The second edition of the Navy Commanders’ Conference of 2018 that kicked off today, would see top Commanders of the Indian Navy deliberate on the themes of ‘Optimisation’ and ‘Emerging Technologies’. 

India is a maritime nation and its growth is inexpricably linked to the seas. Under the overall vision of the Hon’ble PM of ‘Security and Growth for All in the Region’ (SAGAR), the Indian Navy has been at the forefront of providing an environment of stability and peace in the IOR. As the premier Navy in the region, the Indian Navy aspires to remain the ‘Net Security Provider’ in the Indian Ocean through collaboration and cooperation with like-minded and friendly nations. 

The Indian Navy has witnessed an unprecedented growth in its operational tasking over the past decade in consonance with India’s rising maritime interests. The Navy has adopted the ‘Mission-based Deployment’ philosophy and the ‘Maintenance-to-Operations’ transition cycle over the past year to address the need to be present and to respond to emerging situations in the IOR.  



The conference would among other issues, deliberate upon combat readiness of units and optimisation of resources including manpower to meet the growing list of missions and tasks that the Navy is expected to perform. The conference would have dedicated ‘Brain-storming’ sessions to discuss and conceptualise new ideas and concepts, as well as critically examine organisational structures and processes to meet developing challenges and threats to maritime security. Commanders would also look at utilising emerging technologies such as Big-Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness.

The Hon’ble RM would also address the Navy Commanders, outlining the maritime vision of the Government and expectations of the nation and its citizens from the Navy. The conference would conclude on Friday after three days of intense and focussed deliberations.

General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Army Staff, along with senior officers, laid wreaths in a solemn ceremony. Sepoy Boota Singh, a recipient of Vir Chakra in 1971 War represented the veterans. 

          Infantry celebrates 27 October each year as Infantry Day to commemorate the first Infantry action post independence. In response to the threat posed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our Nation, on this day in 1947, the leading elements of the Indian Army from 1st Battalion of the SIKH Regiment air landed at Srinagar and gallantly fought the raiders aided by Pakistan Army. This bold action by the Indian Army and indomitable courage displayed by the Infantrymen reversed the tide of events and thwarted the adversary's nefarious designs.

                All India Sainik School (AISS) Principals’ Conference began today at Sainik School Kunjpura premises in Karnal district of Haryana. Inaugurating the 48th edition of the conference, Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre applauded the principals for their leadership roles in their respective schools and also sending a good number of cadets to the prestigious National Defence Academy. 

 

Dr Bhamre said, “It is a testimony to the fact that the Sainik Schools are meeting their three-pronged agenda of – opening the access of quality public school education to the children of common men; serving as feeder-institutions to the National Defence Academy and removing regional imbalance in the officer cadre of the Armed Forces. It is satisfying to learn of the performance of the schools on all these three counts.” The conference would focus on review of policy matters and functioning of Sainik Schools in the country. 

 

He said, there is a surge in the demand of Sainik schools in the country and the Government is planning to establish new schools. He also informed the establishment of two new Sainik Schools at Jhunjhunu (Rajasthan) and East Siang (Arunachal Pradesh) in the current financial year. He emphasised on the need of providing the cadets modern education and keep abreast with the changes in the education world. 

 

Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre touched the issue of girls taking admission in Sainik Schools. He informed, the government has taken revolutionary decision to induct the girls in the Sainik Schools and open the doors of quality training; a historic step towards the empowerment of girls. Dr Bhamre emphasised that it would be his earnest endeavour to get this policy implemented at the earliest by developing required infrastructure in all the Sainik Schools. 

 

Pointing out a number of important initiatives taken during the recently concluded Board of Governors’ (BoG) Meeting, Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr Bhamre told the august gathering, “I have directed the Sainik Schools Society to ensure that BoG meets every year and all important matter pertaining to the schools and their functioning are discussed threadbare by all the stakeholders – in particular the State Governments; a step that will enable greater synergy and closer co-operation between the state and the schools.”

 

Raksha Rajya Mantri assured the gathering that Government is actively considering the implementation of recommendations of 7thCentral Pay Commission for the personnel of Sainik Schools.

 

The Minister presented the prestigious Raksha Mantri Trophy to the Principal of Sainik School Sujanpura Tira in Himachal Pradesh for sending maximum number of cadets to NDA in 2017 and 2018. It may be noted that Sainik Schools have sent 105 cadets to the 140th course of NDA this year. Sainik School Korukonda and Sainik School Nalanda lifted the Academic Trophies for producing best result in class XII and Class X examination respectively. Principals of all Sainik Schools are taking part in the two-day conference.

                 The Bilateral Defence Minister’s Dialogue between India and Indonesia was successfully concluded in Jakarta, today. 

This meeting between Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman and her Indonesian counterpart Gen (Retd) Ryamizard Rycudu comes after both the countries have upgraded their bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and have recently concluded a new Defence Cooperation Agreement in May 2018. 

Smt Nirmala Sitharaman reiterated the sustained and mutually beneficial interactions between India and Indonesia as maritime neighbours with a tradition of close political dialogue, economic and trade linkages as well as cultural and people to people interactions between the two nations. 

Conveying satisfaction on the military to military interactions, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman noted that the commencement of bilateral Naval and Air Force exercises as well as the regular conduct of Staff Talks between the three Services sets a strong foundation for bilateral defence cooperation between the Armed Forces of the two countries. In line with the elevation of relationship between the two countries to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the two sides discussed areas of enhancing cooperation, including strengthening maritime and coastal security, through improved information sharing and conduct of specialised training courses. India welcomed Indonesia’s support for the proposal to partner in the Malacca Straits Patrol. 

Potential areas of cooperation in the field of defence industries and defence R&D were also identified between the two countries. Both the Ministers agreed to set up Working Groups to progress the mutually agreed areas of bilateral defence engagements and desired that these Working Groups meet at the earliest opportunity in India. 

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman met Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Gen (Retd) Luhut Panjaitan and Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs Gen (Retd) Wiranto. During these meetings, issues of strategic interest and potential areas of bilateral defence cooperation were discussed and agreed to. 

As part of her programme, Raksha Mantri Smt Sitharaman also laid a wreath at the Memorial in Jakarta for the Indian soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice in Indonesia during World War II.

                Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman attended the 5thADMM Plus meet in Singapore today, which is a forum for Defence Ministers from ten ASEAN and eight ASEAN Plus countries. The theme of this year’s dialogue was ‘Strengthening Cooperation, Building Resilience’.The dialogue adopted two resolutions on ‘Countering the Threat of Terrorism’ and ‘Practical Confidence Building Measures’.

Speaking on the occasion, Raksha Mantri Smt Sitharaman emphasised India’s concern on the grave challenges to international peace and stability due to the threat of terrorism. Condemning the use of terror as an instrument to further state policies, Raksha Mantri conveyed that the interplay between states and non-state actors used as proxies to foment violence had worsened this menace

She also highlighted that the continued presence of terrorist infrastructure and support to terrorists in the immediate neighbourhood constantly tested India’s patience. As a responsible power, great restraint was being exercised by India in dealing with this menace. However, India had exhibited measures to disrupt and deter the activities of terrorists groups and their patrons and would not hesitate to do so again if required in future. 

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman reiterated India’s view on Indo-Pacific, as outlined by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, as an open, balanced region, connected by open and secure seas, integrated by balanced trade and shaped by a rules based order, anchored in ASEAN centrality and conveyed India’s commitment to maintain a sustained focus of its ‘Act East’ policy in terms of economic, cultural and developmental engagement of the region. 

Complimenting the ADMM Plus for emerging as a credible and effective platform forging practical cooperation among the members of the armed forces, Raksha Mantri informed the partners of India’s active participation in all the ADMM Plus mechanism contributing effectively to their success. India and Myanmar are the co-chairs for the Expert Working Group for Military Medicine for this cycle and a standalone Field Training Exercise on Military Medicine will be held in Lucknow in March 2019 along with the release of ASEAN Military Medicine Handbook. 

Raksha Mantri Smt Sitharaman emphasised India’s commitment to a rules based international order that was inclusive and democratic. She reiterated India’s desire to work both bilaterally with ASEAN member states as well as institutionally and welcomed Thailand’s taking over the chairmanship of the ADMM Plus. 

On the side-lines of the ADMM Plus meeting, Raksha Mantri also held constructive bilateral discussions with the Defence Minister of the USA. Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines. She also held meeting the Defence Ministers of Russia, China, Thailand, Lao PDR, and Myanmar.

                The Western Naval Command has successfully concluded the maiden trials of the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) which has ushered in a niche capability into the Indian Navy. The DSRV, which is operated by a crew of three, can rescue 14 personnel from a disabled submarine at one time.

On 15 Oct 2018, the DSRV carried out under water mating with a bottomed submarine, at over 300 feet depth. On successful mating the DSRV opened its hatches and the submarine hatches and carried out transfer of personnel from the submarine to the DSRV. These sea trials have proven the newly inducted DSRV’s ability to undertake rescue operations from disabled submarines at sea and has provided the Indian Navy with a critical capability.

During the trials the DSRV also dived successfully up to 666 m. This is a record for deepest submergence by a ‘manned vessel’ in Indian waters. The DSRV crew has also carried out ROV operations at over 750 metres and Side Scan Sonar operations at over 650 metres, which are all ‘firsts’ for the Indian Navy.

The ongoing trials will also include air transportation of the system by the IAF’s heavy-lift transport aircraft. Completion of the trials will put the Indian Navy into a small league of world navies that have integral submarine rescue capability.

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman graced the occasion as the Chief Guest which also had the presence of Raksha Rajya Mantri, Dr Subhash Ramrao Bhamre, and Prof K Vijay Raghavan Principal Scientific Advisor (PSA) to the Government of India, along with other dignitaries.

Speaking on the occasion Smt. Sitharaman shared her experience of meeting with Dr Kalam. She said, he was not only a good scientist but also an excellent administrator who could spot and nurture talent among his team members. That among others made this ‘missile man’ a great team leader. 

Addressing the gathering, Raksha Rajya Mantri said, Dr Kalam believed in a strong nation – one that is scientifically superior and always used to inspire people for putting their total commitment towards the mission in hand. This can be gauged in his words, “If you want to shine like sun, first burn like sun.”

Raksha Mantri Smt Sitharaman also launched a DRDO website dedicated to the theme ‘The Kalam Vision – Dare to Dream’ for engaging young minds in emerging technologies namely Artificial intelligence, Cyber security, Robotics, Automonous Systems, etc. The website will facilitate open competition for students and Startups. It is available at the address: https://drdo.gov.in/drdo/kalam/kalam.html. 

Hindi version of the book “Incredible Kalam” was released by RRM Dr Bhamre in today’s function so that message of Dr Kalam can reach to the masses of the country. The book is the compilation of personal experiences of some distinguished scientists about their association with Kalam. 

The function was attended by Students of three Delhi based schools. These schools have set up Atal Tinkering Lab in their schools under Atal innovation mission of Government of India. Students and researchers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi also attended the function. The aim of inviting young minds was to motivate them with diverse and great qualities of Dr A P J Abdul Kalam, who had special affinity for students and youth of the country. Young scientists from DRDO laboratories delivered presentations at the function regarding the innovative projects they have undertaken.

The students were taken to visit the Kalam Gallery at DRDO Bhawan to get a glimpse of defence systems and technologies displayed. Students took keen interest in the life and work of Dr Kalam depicted in the gallery.

                Territorial Army Symphony Band enthrals spectators and tourists at India Gate with melodious and scintillating tunes on 13 and 14 October 2018.

Military bands have always been synonymous with exemplary discipline, impeccable attires and exquisite music. The Territorial Army Symphony was raised in 2009, with band members selected from various Territorial Army units from all regions of India and collectively given training in various musical instruments. At present, the symphony band consists of more than 40 musicians playing Brass, Strings and Indian classical instruments. This symphony band is a representation of 'Unity in Diversity' which is the essence of 'Territorial Army' also popularly known as the 'Citizens' Army'.

As part of the Territorial Army 69th Raising Day which is celebrated on October 09, 2018, the Territorial Army symphony band played at the iconic India Gate on October 13 and 14, 2018. The event was organised showcasing the rich  tradition of the Territorial Army, through variety of melodious tunes from contemporary to traditional music. The fusion of Indian traditional with western music enthralled the crowd which congregated in large numbers drawn by the scintillating performance of the band.

The harmonious music at the backdrop of the monumental India Gate watched by thousands of enthralled music lovers added a patriotic fervour to the entire event and was a fitting tribute to the memories of all the gallant soldiers who sacrificed with their lives to safeguard this great Nation.

                          An ‘Ex-servicemen Rally’ was organised by the Army at Siddheshwara Trust Karyalaya Hall and adjoining sports ground of Hutatma Rajguru Mahavidayalay at Khed.  The rally received an overwhelming response and was attended by approximately 250 Veterans and Veer Naris hailing from Tehsil Khed (Rajgurunagar) of Pune District.  The rally was addressed by Brigadier OP Vaishnav, VSM, Station Commander of Dehu Road Cantonment, who re-assured the Veterans and Veer Naris that they would always remain an inseparable part of the Armed Forces fraternity and their welfare would always be accorded importance and priority.

The rally was held in close coordination with the State Administration and Zila Sainik Board.  The main focus of the rally was to update records of Ex-servicemen held with Veteran Node of Dakshin Maharashtra Sub Area along with addressing problem issues like anomalies in disbursement of pension, land and legal cases being confronted by the Veterans and Veer Naris.  A number of stalls from various welfare agencies and organisations of the Army and Civil administration were set up at the venue to facilitate and educate the Veterans on various new welfare schemes and initiatives.  A Medical Camp with doctors from MH Kirkee as well as local Public Health Centres were also organised on the occasion, with complete medical staff and disbursement of medicines to the attendees.  The event was hailed as an excellent initiative by the Veterans and Veer Naris, who were extremely appreciative of the efforts by the Army in reaching out to them.

The rally was a major step forward in ameliorating the day to day problems faced by the Veterans and Veer Naris.  It also provided a platform to the Veer Naris and Veterans to express their concerns directly to the concerned officials.

                Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman is on maiden official visit to France on the invitation of French Defence Minister Ms Florence Parly from October 10 - 13, 2018.  Smt Sitharaman addressed ‘India-France Defence Engagement in a Multipolar World’ at the Institute of Strategic Research (IRSEM) in Paris, today. In her speech, she said that her visit is a reaffirmation of India’s commitment to the strategic partnership with France, especially in the critical areas of defence cooperation.

Raksha Mantri Smt Sitharaman said, “Under the new framework for defence industry in India, we are hoping to meet our defence requirements within a framework of joint manufacturing and technology driven partnerships”. She highlighted a strong India-France strategic partnership, of which the defence ties are a key component, and an active engagement with other like-minded friends and partners, can contribute to furthering peace and security in these testing times. India presents a major opportunity for the French defence industry. Indian Government’s ‘Make-in-India’ initiative opens doors to not only a huge market but is also an attractive investment destination for defence production and development, including for third country exports. Several of our international partners have already displayed a willingness to expand their presence in the Indian defence manufacturing space.

Raksha Mantri said the current international security environment can be characterized as one of rapid change and uncertainty, with swathes of sustained instability and violence posing a grave challenge. The persisting threat of terrorism, or what we in India as well as increasingly in Afghanistan too, more accurately refer to as cross-border terrorism, is a primary security threat. She also said that the interplay between states and non-state actors that are often used as proxies to foment violence has worsened this menace.  Areas of continued violence and instability in the Af-Pak region, as well as parts of West Asia and Africa, have functioned as incubators of virulent manifestations of terrorism. This, combined with the issue of foreign terrorist fighters and uncontrolled migration now pose a clear threat to the stability of wider Asia and Europe.

Smt Sitharaman made special mentioned about the continued presence of terrorist infrastructure and state support to terrorists in the immediate neighbourhood constantly testing India’s patience. As a responsible power, India has exercised great restraint in dealing with this menace. India and France have long been victims of terrorism. Disrupting the recruitment, mobilisation and movements of Foreign Terrorist fighters, stopping sources of terrorist financing in dismantling terrorist infrastructure and preventing supply of arms to terrorists all require a concerted effort. She mentioned that in this direction, France is playing a unique role. 

She underlined in that context, growing India-France maritime cooperation, especially in the Indian Ocean region, will be crucial in order to preserving the strategic interests, in maintaining the safety of international sea lanes for unimpeded commerce and communications in accordance with the international law, for countering maritime terrorism and piracy, for capacity building and for greater coordination in regional/international fora. Such cooperation is for the common benefit of all.

Smt Sitharaman said at a broader level, high political exchanges have been a hallmark of our ties. Most recently, the very successful State visit by President Mr. Emmanuel Macron to India in March this year, and the visit of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to Paris in June last year, have elevated Indo-French relationship to a new trajectory. 

India has been constantly supportive of recent efforts to bring about peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and diplomacy. Developments in the Middle East and West Asia are of great significance for India. India has key stakes in this region, which accounts for 66% of our energy requirements and is home to over eight million Indians. Conflict in this region threatens to expand beyond the internal situation in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya. 

India and France are bound by a very deep-rooted thread of military history. She referred to the supreme sacrifice of 9,300 Indian soldiers who laid down their lives on the French soil, fighting in the World Wars. A total of 1,40,000 Indian soldiers fought in various theatres of the First World War in France and Belgium, thousands of miles away from their homeland, for the cause of freedom.

Raksha Mantri stated that India’s partnership with other countries aims to contribute a more secure, stable and peaceful environment for all and spur greater prosperity. She further stated that France is an important stakeholder in this effort and both the countries will remain committed to working together towards these objectives.

                The second Bi-annual IAF Commanders’ Conference of 2018 was inaugurated today by Hon’ble Raksha Rajya Mantri at Air HQ (Vayu Bhawan). Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa PVSM AVSM YSM VM ADC, welcomed Hon’ble Raksha Rajya Mantri, Dr Subhash Bhamre and introduced the IAF Commanders to him. 

            Raksha Rajya Mantri addressed the Air Force Commanders on the inaugural day of the conference and stressed upon the vital role being played by the IAF for enabling India to be the Net Security Provider in the IOR in furtherance of the Prime Minister’s SAGAR (Security And Growth for All in the Region) Doctrine. He reiterated the fact that the IAF is the most technologically intensive and quickest military response available to the Government for furthering India’s leverage. During his address the Raksha Rajya Mantri said “I commend the IAF leadership in promoting indigenisation in multiple ways. IAF’s resolve to wholeheartedly support the indigenous LCA programme by committing to procure 18 squadrons of LCA and its variants endorsing its capability is notable and praiseworthy. IAF leading the thrust to promote India’s indigenous bio-jet fuel program would surely go a long way in reducing India’s crude oil import bill by more than 10% and augment farmers’ incomes substantially. The Mehar Baba Swarm Drone Competition is a highly exciting development and I wish it all success in identifying innovative technology in Unmanned Aerial Systems. IAF is perhaps the first service to kickstart an Artificial Intelligence Project with the participation of the private industry and the progress of this project is extremely heartening”  

            The CAS while addressing the Commanders emphasized on the need for robust training of IAF personnel in order to maintain IAF’s operational competence and reiterated the need for holding an operational edge over our adversaries through focused operational training, keeping it in line with our concept of operations.  He stressed upon the need for joint training with Indian Army and Indian Navy in order to enhance the synergy between the services for ensuring national security.

            The Commanders’ conference is planned for two days, wherein discussions will take place on maintaining combat worthiness and the cutting edge of IAF by suitably refining the training pattern. Training for future inductions like Rafale and Tejas fighter Jets, Chinook and Apache helicopters, SPYDER & Medium Range Surface to Air Missile would also be discussed. 
            The Commanders will also interact with a team of senior officials from HAL and discuss issues pertaining to production, upgradation, indigenization, design & development of various equipment and aircraft.

                Indian Naval Ship Kulish, a Kora class missile corvette, commanded by Commander Deepak Bali and an Indian Dornier (naval maritime time patrol aircraft) from Andaman and Nicobar command entered Belawan harbour, Indonesia for the opening ceremony of the 32nd edition of India – Indonesia coordinated patrol     (IND-INDO CORPAT), to be held from 11 – 27 Oct 2018. The delegation is led by Commodore Ashutosh Ridhorkar, Naval Component Commander, Andaman and Nicobar Command.

The ships and aircraft from both the countries would undertake patrolling on the respective sides of 236 nautical miles long International Maritime Boundary Line. The patrolling would be conducted in three phases from 14 – 24 Oct 2018 followed by a closing ceremony at Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Island, scheduled from 25 – 26 Oct 2018.

The visit seeks to emphasize India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain, consolidate interoperability and strengthen existing bonds of friendship between the two countries.

During their stay in Belawan, various activities are planned   such as official calls, formal reception onboard, ship open to visitors and professional interactions.

In the recent past Indian Naval assets have been increasingly deployed to address maritime concerns of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

In addition, as part of the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the IOR with EEZ Surveillance, Search and Rescue, other capacity -building and capability-enhancement activities. The current deployment will contribute towards the Indian Navy’s effort to forge strong bonds of friendship across the seas and consolidate inter-operability.

                Towards fostering friendly relations with our maritime neighbours, the Indian Navy, through the Naval War College, Goa is hosting the ‘Goa Maritime Symposium – 2018’ on 16th October2018. The event, which is a follow-on to the maiden Goa Maritime Conclave held in 2017, is likely to be attended by senior naval officers and representatives from 16 Indian Ocean littoral countries, which include Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand from South East Asia; Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka from India’s immediate neighbourhood: the island nations of Seychelles, Mauritius and Maldives; Oman in West Asia; and South Africa, Madagascar, Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique from Africa.

Aimed at establishing academic excellence and sharing of ideas amongst India’s maritime neighbours, the symposium will facilitate interaction between senior representatives of navies and maritime agencies in the Indian Ocean Region on common issues of maritime interest. With the Indian Ocean becoming the locus of the 21st century strategic landscape, the symposium will play a constructive role in bringing together stakeholders that have a role in evolving strategies, policies and implementation mechanisms in the maritime domain.

Nestled in the lush environs of North Goa, the venue for the Conclave, INS Mandovi, and the adjoining, imposing Aguada Fort, are a fitting tribute to the rich maritime history, culture and traditions of Goa, which date all the way back to the second century BC. With its ties to the past and vista into the future, the venue will add a unique flavour to the planned deliberations.

The theme for the one day symposium is “Building Stronger Maritime Partnerships in IOR.” The focus of the symposium is on capacity building among IOR Navies to tackle emerging maritime threats, as well as discussing cooperative strategies for enhancing interoperability among partner maritime agencies. The event will witness eminent speakers articulating their views on these important issues, which will be followed by theme based discussions. Informal meetings and social engagements are also planned to build synergy and address common concerns with greater engagement, transparency and, more importantly, friendship.

The symposium will be inaugurated by Admiral Sunil Lanba, PVSM, AVSM, ADC, Chief of the Naval Staff.

                Wing Commander (Retd) JP Baduni is a veteran officer of the IAF. His wife, late Mrs Vidhu Baduni was a teacher in the Air Force Golden Jubilee Institute for a period of 21 Years from 1986. She expired on 06 Feb this year due to a cardiac arrest. In her memory her husband Wg Cdr (Retd) JP Baduni donated a sum of
Rs 17 Lakh to the school she had served as a devoted PRT.

 

“Part of the donation, Rs 10 Lakh, would be used for awarding scholarships and prizes to students of classes V to XI, achieving meritious excellence in the field of academics every year. The other part would go towards the infrastructure development of the primary wing of the school” said the principal Mrs Poonam S Rampal.

 

Earlier, during the sombre function at the school premises where the cheque was handed over, Wg Cdr (Retd) Baduni expressed that he would like to donate the sum of money to the institution where his beloved wife served and held very close to her heart. The money was exclusively from the savings of his late wife which she had accumulated over the years from the service rendered at the school. He also hoped that this would be a befitting homage to his late wife and would help the deserving students in their pursuance of excellence.

                Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force (JMSDF) Ships Kaga, an Izumo Class Helicopter Destroyer and Inazuma – a Guided Missile Destroyer arrived at Visakhapatnam on 07 October 2018. The JMSDF Ships under the command of Rear Admiral Tatsuya Fukada, Commander, Escort Flotilla-4 (CCF-4), would be participating in the third edition of Japan-India Maritime Exercise (JIMEX) with the ships of Eastern Fleet of the Indian Navy (IN) from 07 to 15 October 18. JIMEX-18 is aimed to enhance interoperability, improve understanding and imbibe the best practices of each other.

The IN will be represented by three indigenously designed and built warships and a Fleet Tanker. The ships participating are INS Satpura, multipurpose stealth frigate, INS Kadmatt, Anti-Submarine Warfare Corvette, Missile Corvette and INS Shakti, the Fleet Tanker. In addition, one submarine, P8I Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft and a number of integral helicopters would also be participating in the exercise. The Indian ships participating would be under the command of Rear Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, Flag Officer Commanding, Eastern Fleet.

JIMEX 18, spread over eight days, will comprise a Harbour Phase and a Sea Phase of four days each. The Harbour Phase of the exercise scheduled from 07 to 10 October 18 will include professional and social interactions between ship’s crews, sports fixtures and operational planning for the Sea Phase. The Sea Phase would include Anti-Submarine Warfare Exercises, VBSS (Visit, Board, Search and Seizure) Drills, Gun Firings, Cross Deck Helo Operations and coordinated operations in Anti-Submarine/ Anti-Air threat scenarios.

The last edition of JIMEX was conducted in Dec 2013 off Chennai. The conduct of JIMEX-18 after five years is indicative of an upswing in the Indo-Japanese defence relations and the continued efforts of both Governments to work closely to enhance safety and security of the global commons in keeping with ‘rule based order’. It is pertinent to highlight that JMSDF is a regular participant in the Malabar series of exercises between Indian and US Navies. In addition, the ships of the two navies have been working in close coordination in Anti-Piracy Operations in the Gulf of Aden (GoA) for the past few years.

JMSDF Ships also participated in the recently concluded MALABAR 18 off Guam (along with Indian and US Navy units) in the Pacific Ocean in Jun and biennial multilateral exercise  RIMPAC-18 off Hawaii, USA.

                            Commander Abhilash Tomy who was under medical observation at Ile Amsterdam was brought to Visakhapatnam safely onboard INS Satpura on 06 October 18.  Vice Adm Karambir Singh FOC-in-C ENC briefly interacted with Cdr Tomy and enquired about his health condition and the rescue operation.  Cdr Tomy has now been shifted to INHS Kalyani, the naval hospital of ENC for observation and medical assistance as required. The Commander-in-Chief also interacted with Capt Alok Ananda, the Commanding Officer of INS Satpura who lost his father while the ship was on operational deployment and diverted for the Search and Rescue operation. 

            Cdr Tomy was participating in the Golden Globe Race 2018(GGR) representing India in the historic around the world race without modern navigation aids.  On 21 Sep 18 his sailing vessel ‘Thuriya’ was dismasted when the boat was caught in a violent storm in the South Indian Ocean, approximately 1900 nautical miles West of Perth, Australia.  Cdr Abhilash Tomy suffered a severe back injury and dropped out of the race. The Australian Rescue Coordination Centre at Canberra coordinated the rescue mission in conjunction with many agencies including the Australian Defence Department and the Indian Navy.  Indian Navy launched ‘Operation Raksham’  to rescue the injured officer by immediately deploying the Long Range Maritime Reconnaissance Aircraft P8I in the area staging through Mauritius for providing close support and monitoring the rescue operations and diverted IN Ships Satpura and Jyoti to undertake Search and Rescue Operations.   On   24 Sep 18, French Fishing Vessel (FV) Osiris reached in vicinity of ‘Thuriya’  and carried out a successful rescue operation and later shifted Cdr Tomy to Ile Amsterdam for shelter.  


            INS Satpura after fuelling from INS Jyoti arrived off the Ile Amsterdam and safely evacuated Cdr Tomy using the ship’s helicopter on 28 Sep 18.  He was thereafter provided the requisite medical treatment onboard during the passage to Visakhapatnam.  The ship successfully executed ‘Operation Raksham’ and brought Cdr Tomy safely to Visakhapatnam displaying Indian Navy’s reach, mobility and versatility to responding to the challenges of ‘Search and Rescue’ mission.  The event is another testimony of the Indian Navy being a credible ‘Net Security Provider’ in the Indian Ocean Region.

                Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman was on a three-day visit to Astana, Kazakhstan from October 02, 2018 at the invitation of Minister of Defence of the Republic of Kazakhstan Mr. Nurlan Yermekbayev. During the visit, she met her Kazakh counterpart and Minister of Defence and Aerospace Industry Mr. Beibut Atamkulov.  They discussed a wide range of issues relating to defence and military technical cooperation and took stock of the progress that this bilateral relationship has made since the renewal of the MoU on defence cooperation in January 2017. She inspected a Tri-Services Guard of Honour at the Ministry of Defence and also visited the National Defence University where she was shown the Indian Military Art Room (IMAR), which has been established with Indian assistance. 

India and Kazakhstan Defence Cooperation includes military-technical cooperation, military education and training, joint military exercises, bilateral exchange of visits and cadet youth exchange programs.  Over 200 Kazakh Defence Forces Personnel have undergone military training in India till date.  Both countries successfully conducted a company level joint military exercise ‘KAZIND-2018’ in South Kazakhstan, last month. India and Kazakhstan are bound by historical and cultural ties and this has laid a strong foundation for the multifaceted cooperation.  Both countries are Strategic Partners since 2009.

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman and Minister of Defence Mr. Nurlan Yermekbayev presided over the flag off ceremony of the Kazakhstan contingent that will join the Indian contingent at United Nations International Peacekeeping Force in Lebanon. India’s partnership with Kazakhstan in UN Peacekeeping reflects its desire to support Kazakhstan in its contribution to global peace.  The contingents of both countries worked together over the past one year to prepare for this joint deployment.  The Kazakh contingent will join the Indian Contingent at Lebanon by the end of this month.

Smt Nirmala Sitharaman also discussed issues relating to defence production with the Minister for Defence and Aerospace Industry. In this connection, the possibilities of joint production and/or co-production were discussed based upon the relative strengths and experience of both sides. She also discussed regional developments with the Kazakhstan Foreign Minister Mr. Kairat Abdrakhmanov. The Kazakhstan FM appreciated India’s position and experience as a major force in UN Peace Keeping and contributor peace building in various parts of the world under the UN mandate. 

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman invited the Minister of Defence, Mr. Nurlan Yermekbayev and Minister of Defence and Aerospace Industry, Mr Beibut Atamkulov to visit India and to attend Aero India 2019 to be held in Bengaluru in February 2019.  The invitations were well received.

                A series of flight trials of Astra Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile (BVR-AAM) was conducted by Indian Air Force during September 26 to October 03, 2018 at Integrated Test Range (ITR), Balasore as part of final development trials of the missile. 

The trials were a combination of complex tests for engagement of pilotless target in different modes of manoeuvring, off-boresight, medium and long ranges. The missiles were telemetered for evaluation of online performance of all sub-systems especially the datalink, RF seeker and proximity fuse for end-game performance. Astra has been tested six times under different launch conditions and ranges as part of the final development trial. The missile has engaged targets and all the mission objectives have been met.

With IAF's active participation, DRDO has developed the missile and integrated the weapon on Su-30 and other air platforms. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Nasik has been instrumental in the modification of a number of Su-30 aircrafts for Astra weapon integration and support during trials. More than 50 private and public sector industries are involved in the development and production of different sub-systems of the missile. The missile is expected to be inducted into IAF in 2019.

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman congratulated DRDO, IAF, HAL and associated industries for successful trials.

                Indian Coast Guard (ICG) is launching a campaign for voluntary discarding of the use of plastic in Coast Guard premises from tomorrow.

In order to lead by example and in support of the government policy 'Swachhata Hi Seva Movement', Coast Guard Headquarters, New Delhi has issued direction to all Coast Guard units in the country for encouraging ICG personnel for voluntarily discarding of plastic. The campaign will be launched from October 02, 2018 to coincide with Gandhi Jayanti. 

During the campaign, ICG will conduct seminar/lectures, make available environment friendly bags and spread awareness amongst the masses through posters/banners/placards. 

Coast Guard Wives Welfare Association, a volunteer organization of ICG, shoulders the responsibility in taking the lead for spreading the campaign amongst ladies and children of the society through frequent interactions.

ICG will carry this campaign to the Coastal populace through various platforms such as community interaction programme, meetings with fisheries associations/community heads, etc.

The Coast Guard Act, 1978 mandates Indian Coast Guard to preserve and protect marine environment and prevent and control marine pollution. Further, Coast Guard has been nominated as Competent National Authority by Government of India in March 2018 for co-operation on the Response to Oil and Chemical Pollution in the South Asian Seas Region.

                In another landmark initiative for the Northeast, the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh laid the foundation stone of new Science Centre, the ""Technology Facility Centre"" (TFC) in the premises of the CSIR-North East Institute of Science & Technology (NEIST) in Jorhat, Assam, yesterday.

The Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) will bear the cost of setting up of this new Science Centre and has, to begin with, allocated Rs.40 crore for its construction. Present on this historic occasion were, among others, Member of Lok Sabha from Jorhat, Shri Kamkhya Prasad Tasa, Director CSIR-NEIST Dr S. Chattopadhyaya, Chairman Research Council Dr G.N. Qazi, Secretary NEC (North-Eastern Council) Shri Ram Muivah, Vice-Chancellor and National University, Dr Pardeshi Lal.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that Northeast has vast scientific reserves waiting to be explored and he was happy that the Ministry of DoNER had come forward to help the Department of Science & Technology (S&T) and CSIR to institutionalise the technical applications for promoting research as well as job creation. He hoped that the new TFC will prove to be a boon for young aspiring youth and will emerge as a Center of Excellence for all the eight States of Northeast as well as the rest of India.

Dr Jitendra Singh referred to “North-Eastern Region Community Resource Management Project” (NERCORMP) and “North East Rural Livelihood Project” (NERLP), the two programmes run by the Ministry of DoNER and NEC, which were devoted to the cause of improving livelihood opportunities for unemployed youth, farmers, women and artisans. He expressed the hope that the new Center will serve as a technical and interventional catalyst for fast-track growth, which could eventually enable the North Eastern States to equal the success rate of some of the western States of India.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that Northeast tourism has reached new heights in the last four years and this has been possible because of special  thrust and impetus given by the Union government, with the direct indulgence of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

Interacting with the members of a young Start-Up group here today, after launching the Northeast Tourism app developed by them, Dr Jitendra Singh said, fast-track progress in providing connectivity to distant areas in the region has inspired tourists from far and wide to look forward to Northeast as a favourite holiday destination. In addition, he said, the Ministry of DoNER undertook a campaign showcasing Northeast across the country, which has also generated unusual interest  among potential tourists.

Dr Jitendra Singh pointed out that some of the Northeast destinations like Gangtok, Sikkim and Shillong, Meghalaya have started attracting such heavy rush of tourists that during the last two years, there have been occasions when tourists were advised by the tour-operators to postpone their trip by a few days till the rush weaned away. Not only this, he said, ""Home Tourism” has picked up in a big way, resulting in new avenues of livelihood for the local populace, including the youth.

The Majuli island in Assam, Dr Jitendra Singh informed, is being developed as a World Heritage tourist resort and several scenic spots in Arunachal Pradesh have suddenly come into focus because now there is a rail link with Arunachal Pradesh and soon an Airport will also come up at Itanagar.

The most impartial and objective evidence testifying the upsurge in tourist inflow, Dr Jitendra Singh said, can be obtained from the fact that private tour-operators from far flung States of South India are also now planning Vacation itineraries for Northeast.

Dr Jitendra Singh said the Northeast outreach by the Ministry of DoNER has touched chord with the youth across the country.

                The  Meghalaya  Minister for Power, Mr James P.K. Sangma called on Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today to  discuss about the various development projects and the current scenario in the State.

 Dr Jitendra Singh appreciated the manner in which the new government under Chief Minister Mr Conrad Sangma had put the things on fast track and shown a visible effort to bring about transformation. He also appreciated the discretion and wisdom with which the government tackled the local protests which had arisen out of a social dispute, soon after the government had taken over.

Referring to the high priority that Prime Minister Sh Narendra Modi accorded to the Northeast and Meghalaya, Dr Jitendra Singh noted that Sh Narendra Modi was the first Prime Minister after nearly 40 years, who had travelled to Shillong to participate in the Plenary meeting of North Eastern Council (NEC). During his two-day stay, he recalled, Sh Narendra Modi  met a series of delegations from all walks of the life and all sections of the society.

Dr Jitendra Singh also referred to the Railway track work undertaken in the State which had, for so many years, never seen a train. He insisted upon the Minister to discuss with the Chief Minister and find an appropriate way of enabling the expansion of air-strip / airport at Shillong.

 Mr James Sangma appreciated Dr Jitendra Singh's gesture of having recently visited the ""Behdienkhlam"" Mela at Jowai, Meghalaya, which had sent a very positive message, because the place had been rarely visited by a Union Minister in the past.

Mr Sangma also thanked the DoNER Minister for his regular visits and keen interest in the development of the State. He also appreciated the big boost given to the Power Sector by the Modi Government in the last four years.

                The Southern Regional Review Meeting on Sustainability of the outcomes of Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) was organized in Chennai today. The States/UTs of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Puducherry, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu participated in the review.

In his inaugural address, the Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, said that with the achievement of an ODF India would lead to the beginning of the next chapter of Swachh Bharat – sustaining the momentum through continued toilet usage and focus on solid and liquid resource management. He underscored the need to focus on various aspects of sustainability such as continued communication campaigns, engagement of Swachhagrahis, capacity building of personnel, and periodic verification on the ground. 

During their presentation, the team from Tamil Nadu shared best practices like the “Toilet Report Card” which households, schools and agnanwadis are encouraged to maintain to encourage toilet usage in a sustained manner. Ms R Sathy, National Award winning school teacher from the State highlighted the Kutti Commandos, a band of primary school children who undertake awareness rallies to encourage good sanitation practices.

The team from Karnataka shared that they are aiming to declare the State ODF on World Toilet Day this year, i.e. November 19 2018. They spoke about a communication campaign called Swachha meva Jayate under which they are already working towards sustaining the ODF outcomes.

State officials from Andhra Pradesh highlighted a unique instance where the casualties in a recent cyclone in Srikakulam district of the State were limited due to sustained use of toilets by households in the ODF State rather than going out to the open. 

Other senior officials taking part in the review were Shri Akshay Rout, Director General (Special Projects), Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Hans Raj Verma, ACS (RD AND PR), Government of Tamil Nadu and Mission Directors of all participating States/UTs.

                The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MDWS) organized a seminar in Wardha district of Maharashtra. The seminar, titled “Gandhian Thoughts and Sanitation”, was centered on the Gandhian ideology on sanitation and the implementation of the same through the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). 

 

The seminar on Gandhian Thoughts and Sanitation included addresses on topics such as appropriate technologies in rural sanitation, organic waste management, and preventive sanitation linked with Nai Talim and industrialization: Gandhi’s concept of Swachh evam Swawalambhi Sankul. During his opening remarks at the seminar, Shri Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, also shared with the participants an international medley version of “Vaishnava Jana Toh”, Gandhiji’s favourite bhajan, which was developed by the Ministry of External Affairs and includes contribution by 124 countries. The seminar ended with a visit to Sevagram, to experience and learn from Gandhiji’s time there.

Mahatma Gandhi has been one of the biggest proponents of sanitation and hygiene in modern times. He acknowledged not only the indignity of defecating in the open and living in insanitary conditions, but also the effect insanitary practices made on the environment. Picking up from the Gandhian ideology on safe sanitation practices, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, put sanitation at the top of the nation’s development agenda and launched the Swachh Bharat Mission in 2014. The SBM today is a massive jan andolan (people’s movement), which has shown significant progress with the rural sanitation coverage having increased from 39%, at the launch of the SBM in 2014, to over 95% today. With 8.7 crore toilets constructed, 5.15 lakh villages, 530 districts and 25 States and Union Territories have been declared ODF.

Mr. Akshay Rout, Director General (Special Projects), Mr. Shyamlal Goyal, Addl. Chief Secretary, Government of Maharashtra, and prominent Gandhian scholars - Mr. Soham Pandya, Dr. T. Karunakaran, Ms. Priti Joshi, and Mr. Kanakbhai Gandhi were also present at the seminar in Wardha.

                Certain media reports have come to the notice of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, quoting a survey report titled TAG (Teen Age Girls) Report 2018. These reports are completely misleading with respect to their claims in relation to the Swachh Bharat Mission. The reported survey claims that around 40 per cent of teenage girls in the country still have to practice open defecation.

The media reports, however, do not mention the most important fact, i.e. the field survey was conducted in 2016-17. This leads to the factually incorrect and misleading conclusion that the survey was conducted recently and its findings reflect the current sanitation situation on the ground. By using data from 2016-17 to question the success of the SBM today, the reports undermine the efforts and achievements of the people of India.

This error takes a serious dimension in the context of rural sanitation which has shown an unprecedented rise under the Swachh Bharat Mission. The fact that a basic detail like the period during which the field survey was carried out has not been distinctly mentioned in the report makes it misleading with respect to reporting on the progress of sanitation in today’s context.

The rural sanitation coverage under SBM has catapulted from 39% in October 2014 to over 95% today. The rapid pace of progress under the SBM means that performance data as measured by studies and surveys may become outdated within months. At the mid-point of the field survey period, i.e. January 2017, the sanitation coverage in rural India was below 60%, which is broadly consistent with the findings of the survey for that period – a fact that is not highlighted in the report itself.

The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, therefore, underlines that the SBM is an extremely dynamic programme with rapidly accelerating progress. Researchers and authors are advised to exercise abundant caution before passing judgements on the success of the programme based on outdated data. They are also advised to clearly mention the period of the field survey and the statistical significance of any study that they quote so that their readers are not mislead. In case of any doubts, they may contact this Ministry for the latest facts and progress figures pertaining to the Mission. Various media are also similarly advised.

Rural India has built over 8.7 crore toilets in their homes and over 5 lakh villages, 530 districts and 25 States/Union Territories have declared themselves free from the malaise of open defecation, as of October 2018.

                Prime Minister of Japan Mr. Shinzo Abe has offered his Government’s support to the Swachh Bharat Mission. In a written message, Mr Abe said that Japan will cooperate with India, which promotes the Clean India initiative under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership.

He further underscored Japan’s commitment to realize healthy societies in Asia and congratulated India on the success of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention. “Securing clean water and improving sanitary conditions is a common challenge in the world. We hope for the further progress of each country’s efforts to address the challenge through active discussions at this convention (MGISC)”, Prime Minister Abe said in his message. 

The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC) was a four-day international conference that brought together Sanitation Ministers and other leaders in WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) from around the world. A host of national and international dignitaries attended the event, which was inaugurated by the President and addressed by the Vice President of India. The Convention culminated on 2nd October 2018, Gandhi Jayanti, which was also celebrated as the Swachh Bharat Diwas. The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, and the United Nations Secretary General, Mr António Guterres, addressed the concluding function.

                The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) recently launched the 150th birth year celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi, as the Mission enters its fifth and final year of implementation. The SBM has transformed into a massive jan andolan created on the ground using Information, Education, and Communication, making it a behaviour change campaign. 

Sanitation programs themselves are not a new occurrence for India, with programs being run since 1981. However, in contrast to the construction or supply led programs of the past, SBM has a demand centric model. The program focuses on behaviour change to generate demand for sanitation services by the rural population which is then followed by supply. 

However, some recent reports have sought to undermine the progress made by the SBM on the ground, with incorrect claims. In this regard, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation presents the following clarifications.

Progress

The SBM has shown tremendous progress these last 4 years, under the personal leadership of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi leading to massive behaviour change campaign and people’s movement underway on the ground. 

Since the inception of the program, the rural sanitation coverage of India has increased significantly, from 39% in October 2014 to 95% today. Nearly 8.7 crore household toilets have been constructed under the Mission. As a result, 25 States/Union Territories, 529 districts, and 5,09,067 villages have declared themselves as free from open defecation. 

Earlier this year, the National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) conducted under the World Bank support project found that 93.4% of the households in rural India who have access to a toilet use it, confirming that behaviour change is happening on the ground. The survey covered 92040 households in 6136 villages across States and UTs in India.

The Swachh Bharat Mission is the world’s largest public funded sanitation program. Between the Centre and State, over Rs. 1 lakh crore would have been allocated for the Mission in 2019. In addition to the budget allocation of ₹15,000 crore this year (FY 2018-2019), ₹15,000 crore has been further allocated through Extra Budgetary Resources.

Communication strategy 

Behaviour Change Communication is undertaken under the SBM at the ground level and is complemented with mass media at the national level as well. For example, mass media campaigns such as Darwaza Band, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Bhumi Pednekar and Anushka Sharma, communicates the messages of women empowerment, promotion of twin pit toilets and usage of toilets, while the SBM foot soldiers, Swachhagrahis, participate in the triggering of communities for behaviour change and sustaining improved behaviours through Inter-Personal Communication. There are currently over 5 lakh Swachhagrahis across the country undertaking behaviour change interventions at the grassroots.

Water for ODF

A policy decision has been taken under the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) to prioritize the provision of piped water supply (PWS) for villages that become ODF. Of the 5 lakh plus ODF villages, translating to 14.13 lakh habitations, 6.16 habitations have PWS through public stand posts. The remaining are being covered on priority. At a technical level, the SBM promotes the use of the rural pan, a steep slope pan, which requires no more than 1-1.5 liters of water for every use of the toilet, addressing challenges related to scarcity of water.

ODF-Quality

A strong parallel focus is being maintained on the quality of the work on the ground and sustaining progress much after the program reaches its goal in 2019. Verification of all ODF declared villages is very unique to Swachh Bharat Mission. Multiple rounds of verification are carried out for the village by the districts and States. Within 90 days of declaration, verification is done for each household in the village. Another round of sustainability verification is done 180 days after the first round.

Impact of SBM

A recent WHO study reports that Swachh Bharat would have led to saving of 300,000 lives by 2019 and around 150,000 lives would be saved annually thereafter. In a report titled ‘The Financial and Economic Impact of SBM in India (2017)’ UNICEF estimated that a household in an ODF village in rural India saves Rs. 50,000 every year. BMGF has released a study that shows significant improvements in diarrhoea prevalence and stunting among children in ODF villages, compared to nearby non-ODF villages.

The Swachh Bharat model of sanitation has led India into a sanitation revolution, and the country is on track for an ODF India by October 2019.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi gave awards to top Ranked State, District and State with maximum citizen participation based on the National Swachh SurvekshanGrameen 2018 commissioned by Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. The awards by Prime Minister were given at the concluding session of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention at RahtrapatiBhawan Cultural Centre. Haryana was ranked as the best State while Satara District of Maharashtra was ranked as the best district as per the ranking undertaken by Swachh SurvekshanGrameen 2018. Uttar Pradesh was rewarded for maximum citizens’ participation.Later, Ms Uma Bharti, Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation gave awards at PravasiBhartiya Kendra, New Delhi to top three States and Districts from all the zones of the country. 

The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation had commissioned “Swachh Survekshan Grameen-2018” (SSG 2018) through an independent survey agency to develop ranking of all districts of India on the basis of quantitative and qualitative sanitation (Swachhata) parameters. This ranking was done based on a comprehensive set of parameters including surveys of public places like schools, Anganwadis, PHCs, Haat/ Bazaars, Panchayat and citizen’s perception of Swachhata and their recommendations for improvement of the program and data from the SBM-G IMIS.  

As part of Swachh SurvekshanGrameen, 6786 villages in 685 Districts across India were covered. 27,963 public places namely schools, anganwadis, public health centres, haat/ bazaars/religious places in these 6786 villages were visited by an independent agency for survey. Around 182,531 citizens were interviewed for their feedback in villages on SBM-G related issues. Also, citizens were mobilised to provide feedback on sanitation relation related issues online using an application developed for the purpose. The collection of data from Direct Observation were based on physical observation of the sanitation status in public places by the survey agency. The survey agency used maps and simple handheld device/recording formats to record their observations and findings along with Photographs/videos, wherever necessary. 

Feedback from people were obtained using Community wide open meetings,Personal Interviews and Focussed Group Discussions. FGDs were conducted in each village. More than 1.5 crore people participated in the SSG 2018 and provided their feedback. 

The SSG 2018 turned out to be massive mass mobilisation exercise with communities in each village undertaking special drives to improve the general cleanliness in their villages. Gram Panchayats invested funds from their local area development fund to augment the sanitation situation in public places. 

The top ranked States and Districts which received awards are as below:

Overall Ranking:


	Top 3 States-1) Haryana, 2) Gujarat 3) Maharashtra

                The Swachh Bharat Mission is vital for India as well as the World, said Vice-President, Shri Venkaiah Naidu, during the Closing Technical Plenary of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation which saw participation of Minister of Sanitation from over fifty countries. The Minister of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Sushree Uma Bharti, and Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Yogi Adityanath, also addressed the plenary along with other national and international experts today. Tomorrow, Prime Minister, Shri NarendraModi, will preside over the launch of Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth year celebrations, also marking the beginning of the final year of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). 

Mr. Naidu’s remarks at the end of the day put the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) squarely in focus: ""The mission is very important in the history of the country, and for the history of the globe"". He praised the behavior change focus of SBM and the special role of Swachhagrahis – local sanitation champions – in keeping sanitation at the forefront in communities throughout the country. The focus has enabled more than 400 million people to shun open defecation in the last four years. 

The day began with a focus on the link between the Swachh Bharat Mission and the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ms. Uma Bharati, Minister, Drinking Water and Sanitation, India, presided over an opening session on the topic, joined by Mr. DevendraFadnavis, Chief Minister, Maharashtra and Ms. Henrietta Fore, Executive Director, UNICEF. Mr. Fadnavis spoke on the focus given to behavior change in the implementation of SBM in Maharashtra State. He attributed the success of SBM in Maharashtra to Prime Minister’s leadership and investment made on sanitation. ""When everyone saw our own Prime Minister taking a broom in his hand, it became a cleanliness revolution,” he said. Ms. Fore praised the massive progress made under Swachh Bharat Mission and complimented India for ensuring sanitation for 86 million households in rural areas.

During the Ministerial Dialogues, participants exchanged views on building political will for sanitation, ensuring adequate financing and taking steps required to work at scale and reach universal access. They exchanged views on topics including the value of South-South collaboration; sanitation as a driver of peace and economic growth; engaging diverse stakeholders, from parliamentarians to civil society; ensuring clear ministerial or departmental leadership for sanitation; long-term planning; valuing human waste as a resource (fertilizer, biogas); and the importance of public-private partnerships around sanitation. 

Reflecting on the Ministerial dialogues organized as part of the convention, one Minister said, “I will link sanitation to pride, as India has done with SBM’s positive ‘Clean India’”. Another said, “I will walk away from this convention with a better understanding of how to talk about sanitation”. Finally, one said, “Disease is our enemy; I will put ending open defecation alongside a national [disease] prevention drive”.

In the plenary on financing for sanitation, the speakers focused on the case for public spending on sanitation through budgetary allocations, as well as other financing strategies, ways of raising additional financing from domestic resource mobilization, sanitation credit, and other innovative strategies. Mr. Suleiman H. Adamu,Minister of Water Resources, Nigeria, said that rural financial institutions for households and small businesses, community savings and credit groups, and national and state revolving funds, are all promising approaches. Mr. Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, said “India has made massive. Public investment on sanitation to ensure that people realize sustainable sanitation and hygiene benefits”. Mr. Richard Damania, Lead Economist, Water Global Practice, World Bank, lauded India as a successful example of combining public investments and behavior change efforts in sanitation. He cited the well-known statistic that $1 invested in sanitation generates $5 in return.

In the closing technical plenary today, Mr. Yogi Adityanath, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, India, noted that “sanitation is important for dignity of women”. ""The story doesn't end with open defecation,” said Minister Bharti. “We look forward to sustaining this cleanliness with ‘ODF Plus’.” Mr. ParameswaranIyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, India, said the MGISC was a strong testament to India’s collective commitment to achieving the SDGs. “I believe this international convention will serve as a platform for collaboration in the future”, he said. Echoing Mr. Damania’s earlier remarks, Mr. Hartwig Schafer, Vice President, South Asia Region, World Bank praised the Prime Minister, Shri NarendraModi, for making available the needed funds to ensure sanitation for all. He said “Investing in sanitation is one of the best investments we can make in the field of development” while Ms. Jean Gough, Regional Director, UNICEF, recognized India’s momentum: “We have seen the greatest increase in the use of toilets in the last one decade because India broke the silence and made cleanliness a political priority"". Ms. Pamela Tshwete, Deputy Minister of Water and Sanitation, South Africa, said she drew inspiration from India’s accomplishments.

                The Union Minister for Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar released the new CBSE Affiliation Bye-laws in New Delhi today. While interacting with media at Press conference the Minister informed that the affiliation byelaws of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) have been completely revamped to ensure speed, transparency, hassle-free procedures and ease of doing business with the CBSE. 

 

The HRD Minister had earlier this year, directed the Board to completely revisit its affiliation bye laws to make the system more robust and quality driven. While highlighting the main changes, Shri Prakash Javadekar said that the new byelaws denote a major shift from the highly complex procedures followed earlier, to a simplified system based on preventing duplication of processes. 

 

CBSE is a national level Board conducting examinations for Classes X and XII. It affiliates schools across India and abroad upon fulfilment of various conditions as prescribed in its Affiliation Bye Laws. At present 20783 schools are affiliated with the Board. The Affiliation Byelaws in position were first made in the year 1988 and were last modified in the year 2012. 

 

Shri Javadekar informed that one of the salient features of the revised bye laws rests on the fact that there is duplication of processes at CBSE and state government level. For issuing recognition under RTE Act and NOC, the state education administration verifies various certificates to be obtained from local bodies, revenue department, cooperatives department, etc. The CBSE re-verifies them after applications are received. This is very long drawn process. Therefore, to prevent this duplication, schools will now be required to submit only two documents at the time of applying for affiliation, instead of 12-14 documents being submitted earlier: one would be a document vetted by the head of district education administration validating all aspects such as building safety, sanitation, land ownership, etc, and another would be a self-affidavit where the school would certify its adherence to fee norms, infrastructure norms, etc. 

 

As a result of this major change the Board shall not revisit any of the aspects vetted by the state during inspection and the delay due to scrutiny and non-compliance of deficiencies in these documents shall be drastically curtailed.  

 

Inspection of schools will now be outcome-based and more academic and quality oriented, rather than focussing only on school infrastructure. The inspection will focus on academic excellence and progress of students over time, innovations and quality of pedagogy, capacity of teachers and teacher training, inclusive practises in school, quality of co-scholastic activities, whether curricular load is as per norms, whether there is adequate focus on sports and games, etc. This will not only help the Board and the school to track students’ progress over time, but will also identify areas that would need further efforts.  

 

The entire process from application, to inspection, to grant of affiliation was made paperless by the Board in March 2018. For the new byelaws too, the entire process will be online. Applications shall henceforth be disposed off in the same year. 

 

In the new byelaws, the school inspection will be done as soon as applications are received. On satisfactory inspection report, the Board will issue a Letter of Intent to the school, indicating its intention to affiliate the school. The school will then be expected to fulfil all the conditions laid down under the Post-Affiliationprocess, such as recruitment of qualified teachers, special educator, wellness counsellor, salaries through digital payment, etc. On complying with all these conditions, the school will submit an online commencement certificate latest by 31st March of the given year, based on which, the Board shall confirm affiliation of the school. Only then the schools shall be able to start new academic session under CBSE.

 

The new affiliation bye laws also lay thrust on achieving academic excellence through mandatory teacher training. Even the Principals and Vice Principals of every school are expected to undergo two days mandatory training on an annual basis. A special category of innovative schools has been added to include specialized schools, not covered elsewhere in these byelaws, who are implementing innovative ideas in the fields of skill development, sports, arts, sciences, etc. Regarding fee, the provisions include full fee disclosure to be made and no hidden charges to be levied by schools in the garb of fees. The byelaws clearly state that fee is to be charged as per the regulation of the appropriate government and fee revision shall be subject to laws, regulations and directions of the appropriate government. Also, for the first time, the byelaws encourage schools to promote environmental conservation through harnessing solar energy, rain water harvesting, greening of campus, recycling and segregation of waste, Swachhata on campus, etc.

 

It may be mentioned here that CBSE has 20783 schools affiliated to it in India and 25 other countries, with over 1.9 crore students in these schools, and more than 10 lakh teachers. The revised bye laws will positively impact the existing and future schools by easing procedures and redirecting their focus towards improving the quality of education.

Salient features of Swachhata Ranking Awards–

1. The Swachhata Rankings exercise has been initiated by Department of Higher Education to generate healthy peer pressure among higher educational institutions for keeping and maintaining hygienic campuses so that the environment for student learning becomes clean and leads to higher thinking.

2.   Department has recognised that educational institutions should play the lead role in not only their in-campus hygiene but also by adopting villages around their area for promoting hygiene through awareness creation and other assistance. 

3.    This year’s rankings have received more than double the response from educational institutions compared to last year. More than 6000 institutions have participated. The parameters have been made more scientific to include aspects like rain water harvesting, solar power, quality of hostel kitchen apparatus, water supply system quality, maintenance method sophistication etc.    

4. This year’s Rankings have brought out some very significant and interesting features of our higher educational institutions in the area of Swachhataand the way they are managing their campus environment. For the 6029 institutions that applied , some of the highlights are: 

(i)        2430 institutions have solar power in their campus and 940 more are under progress. This is nearly 56% solar coverage

(ii)       3577 institutions have rainwater harvesting facility – this is nearly 60% coverage

(iii)     5607 institutions out of 6000 have 24 hours running water. This is a 93% coverage

(iv)      3915 campuses have more than 30% green cover and this is 65% of the institutions. Some leading institutions have also upto 60% green cover. 

(v)       2557 institutions have full composting facility in their campuses and this is 42% of them. 

5.   Higher Educational Institutions have to also spread the message of Swachhata in villages and other neighbourhoods since they are knowledge institutions and knowledge is meant to be shared. Village activity has been made  a parameter with 10% weightage.  Any institution that wants to be considered for rankings has to necessarily adopt a village or some villages and carry out hygiene & health related activities in it. 

6.  From the data submitted, it has been observed that after the activities & interventions of our institutions this year, 2110 nos. of villages have been made Open Defecation Free (ODF). In another 2100 institutions, ODF work is in progress. Further, in 2016 villages, systems for sustainable waste management have been installed. The list of villages and institutions working on them has been printed.  Swachhata in our Department and institutions is not a symbolic event  but a year long, continuous process of engagement and improvement of both campuses and villages. Educational institutions are playing an internal & social role in hygiene that is tangible and can be seen. 

7.   From this year onwards, HRD Ministry would be developing careers in Waste & Environment Management by introducing anelective course in the subject and also a PG Diploma in Waste Management that includes internship. These two courses will be introduced from the January semester onwards. So a complete job oriented approach to Swachhata is on the anvil. 

8.  MHRD is committed to take this Mission Swachhata to encompass every educational institution and encourage them to undertake not only campus cleanliness but also village cleanliness and contribute to a clean & pure thinking India.

                Rani Jhansi Grade separator, the ambitious flyover project in north Delhi was thrown open to public by Union Environment Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan. The six-lane, 1.8-km grade separator will provide connectivity to St Stephen’s Hospital near the Tiz Hazari Courts complex with Filmstan Cinema and also it will provide a link with the intersections for Baraf Khana, DCM Chowk, Azad Market and Subzi Mandi areas of Delhi. 

 

Speaking at the inauguration Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that despite missing multiple deadlines since laying of its foundation stone nearly a decade ago, the Union government ensured that funding should not come in the way of completion of this much needed flyover.“Nearly 43 percent of the construction work was done in the last one year and though we faced lot of challenges in construction of this separator, we kept working on the project and finally it is ready for citizens. Not only it will benefit nearly 5 lakh commuters daily but a free flow of traffic would help in reducing pollution and save fuel as well”, added Dr. Vardhan

 

Union Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs Shri. Hardeep Singh Puri who was also present at the inauguration said that when finances became a bottleneck in completion of this project the ministry decided that 80 percent of the fund will be through Urban Development Fund(UDF) and 20% of the fund will be borne by Delhi Development Authority (DDA).”The Union Government is aggressively spearheading a series of pending projects in Delhi and all such projects will be completed by March 2019”, added Shri. Puri.

                Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi was launched in Delhi today by the Union Minister for Earth Sciences and Environment, Dr. Harsh Vardhan .The System is designed to predict extreme air pollution events and give alerts to take necessary steps as per Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of the Government of India. The air pollution system has been developed jointly by the scientists at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, India Meteorological Department and National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF).

Speaking at the launch, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the early warning system will help in proactively forewarning, 3-4 days in advance, any large scale air pollution events which may occur over the Delhi region. Outlining a series of efforts that the central government has taken the Union Minister said that the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has constituted a 41 member team  which will continuously monitor the air pollution levels in Delhi and NCR region and will report to the board. “Badarpur thermal power plant is being closed today, western peripheral expressway is likely to become operational in the first week of November, the Central govt. has released nearly 600 crores to concerned states for in-situ management of crop-residue and a slew of mitigation measures  have been taken by the government”, the Minister added.

A new website developed for archiving all the observational and prediction products was also launched at the event. The website will be accessed by the officials of Environmental Pollution Authority (EPA) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for taking necessary steps depending upon the requirements. Ministry of Earth Sciences will be making further attempts to assimilate more data of other pollutants and also to improve accuracy of predictions with the technical support from the NCAR, USA and Finnish Meteorological Institute. 

The air pollution system has been developed jointly by the scientists at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, India Meteorological Department and National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF). The warning system consists of a) real time observations of air quality over Delhi region and details about natural aerosols like dust (from dust storms) and particulate matter using different satellite data sets b) Predictions of air pollutants from two different air quality prediction systems based on state-of-the-art atmospheric chemistry transport models and c) Warning Messages and Alerts and Bulletins.  

The prediction systems were developed by scientists of MoES institutions with the technical support from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR),USA and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). The prediction part of the system consists of two modelling framework, one is based on NCAR atmospheric chemistry transport model and the second one is based on Finnish Meteorological Institute model. The modelling framework typically consists of a high resolution weather prediction model with an atmospheric chemistry transport model.  Both the models have data assimilation facility, which can assimilate data from satellites on dust aerosols, particulate matter from stubble burning and other air pollutants like SO2 and NO2.  The models will take into account the background aerosols and pollutants, long range transport of dust from dust storms and particulate matter from stubble burning. The predictions are now available up to 72 hours lead time. 

Union Minister also released a mega emission inventory of Delhi which was made by scientists at IITM Pune who carried out a mega emission inventory campaign involving around 140students mapping all possible local sources of air pollution with around 37,500 hours of work. The final product with 400 m x 400m high-resolution emission inventory of Delhi and fringe area of all eight important air pollutants (like PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO, SO2, BC,  OC and VOCs) was released. Ground level activity data about emissions from as many as 23 different sources of pollution were also collected. The emission inventory suggests that there is a substantial increase of emissions from transport and industrial sector, while the contributions from residences have shown a substantial decline.

This decision was taken in a meeting held here today under the Chairmanship of Shri C.K. Mishra, Secretary, EF&CC to discuss the urgent steps for air pollution mitigation and regulating fire crackers in the light of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s Order. In the meeting, it was emphasized that all necessary steps should be taken to ensure that air quality levels are not allowed to go into the severe category in the next one week. 

Teams for Clean Air Week compriseof the local SDM as the team leader, senior official from MoEFCC and representatives from CPCB, MCD and DPCC. Delhi will have 44 teams and the cities in NCR region namely Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad shall have two teams each. Field Teams will be supported by the local police to ensure compliance and safety. All the DMs and MCD commissioners shall be involved in the campaign and ensure that quick action is taken on the cases of violations reported by the field teams. In case of repeat violations, criminal proceedings against defaulters will be initiated.

On the issue of firecrackers, it was decided thatthe directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the Order dated 23.10.2018 shall be followed strictly in Delhi and NCR.Timings and locations as envisaged in the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s Order for bursting of firecrackers would be strictly adhered to. Further only eco friendly fire crackers would be sold after proper authorization has been obtained from PESO. Any other kind of firecrackers would not be permitted to be sold in the NCR region as per the order of the Supreme Court. Delhi Police and the DMs of Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad were requested to ensure that these measures were strictly implemented by them in their respective areas.

Secretary conveyed his serious concern over the fact that there is no significant improvement in the air quality in spite of the concerted efforts being made by the Ministry and all the stakeholders. He emphasized the need for taking action which can lead to local containment of pollution and which is visible to the people. 

In addition to the above it was also directed that Government of Delhi shall immediately deploy 400 water sprinklers/ tankers as already committed. Construction sites will be closed temporarily for a few days to improve air quality. No distinction be made between Governmental or private agencies for this purpose. Further all agencies should ensure no local biomass and industrial waste burning.

                Air pollution is a serious health issue in the country especially in the northern parts during winter seasons. The air pollution in the northern region is attributed to dust, burning of crops in certain states, burning of garbage construction and prevailing climatic conditions. This air pollution has serious impacts on the health of children aged people and people suffering from respiratory ailments. Diwali which is a festival of lights falls during the same period. As a matter of practice people have been celebrating Diwali by bursting crackers.  Crackers contains combustible chemicals that include potassium chlorate powdered aluminum, magnesium, salts of barium, copper, sodium, lithium, strontium etc. and emits smoke on combustion of these chemicals along with sound.  This smoke and sound has health impacts on children, aged people and also animal and birds. Apart from these compounds large amount of waste is also generated after bursting of crackers. Keeping in view the above detrimental effects and also the importance of the festival, Ministry has initiated a “Harit–Diwali” campaign.

This campaign was initiated in 2017-18 wherein large number of school children especially from eco-clubs participated and took pledge to minimize bursting of crackers and also discouraged the neighborhood and their friends from bursting of crackers. During this intensive campaign, the children were advised to celebrate Diwali in an environment-friendly manner by gifting plant sapling to their relatives and friends along with sweets, undertake cleaning of houses, neighbourhoods, schools, collect old books and unused notebooks gift to needy children, donate old warm clothing, blankets to night-shelters and other homeless people. The children were encouraged to light up their houses and their schools with candles and diyas. The above campaign was extremely successful and the air quality had not deteriorated post Diwali in 2017 unlike what was experienced in 2016.

On the above lines, the Ministry has initiated the similar campaign, but this year the campaign has been extended Pan-India. The “Harit Diwali-Swasth Diwali” campaign is now merged with “Green Good Deed” movement that has been initiated as a social mobilization for conservation and protection of environment. The Ministry encourages all schools and colleges to be part of this campaign.

                Two Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) were signed, here today, by Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), Dehradun, with Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) and Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS). ICFRE is an autonomous Council under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.  

The MoUs have been signed to launch the programme “PRAKRITI” with the objective to promote awareness about forests and environment, to stimulate interest among the students of NVS and KVS in maintaining a balanced environment and for acquiring skills that reflect care and protection towards forests, environment and society.  Another objective is to provide a platform to school children to learn practical skills towards judicious use of our resources and to mobilize a cadre of youth for raising a peoples’ movement committed to conservation of forest and environment.

Through this collaboration, knowledge will be imparted to students/teachers of NVS and KVS on environment, forest, environmental services and contemporary areas of forestry research by way of lectures and interactive sessions by scientists of ICFRE institutes. Visits of students/teachers of NVS and KVS schools will also be arranged to the laboratories and field/experiments of ICFRE institutes for hands-on experiences.

The MoUs, signed for a period of 10 years are expected to make the youth of the country sensitive about national and global issues of environment and forests and help them to become responsible citizens.

ICFRE, through its nine Institutes and five Centres located across the country, is guiding, promoting and coordinating forestry research, extension and education at the national level. Currently ICFRE is focusing on contemporary issues of national and international importance particularly in the areas of climate change, forest productivity, biodiversity conservation and skill development.

Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti was established with the primary objective to provide modern quality education to talented children, predominantly from the rural areas, without regard to their family’s socio-economic condition. At present, it has 660 functional residential schools. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan was established in 1963 to provide uninterrupted education to wards of the transferable Central Government employees. KVS established Kendriya Vidyalayas all over the country to impart quality education, promotion of national integration, adventure activities, physical education etc. 

The MoU was signed in the presence of Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Shri C.K. Mishra, Director General Forests and Special Secretary, MoEF&CC, Shri Siddhanta Das and other senior officers. The MoUs were signed by Director General, ICFRE, Dehradun, Dr. S. C. Gairola, Commissioner, NVS Shri B.K. Singh and Commissioner, KVS Shri Santosh Kumar Mall.

Secretary, MoEF&CC also stated that Punjab has distributed 7062 (91%) out of 8309 farm implements to individual farmers and has established 4795 (92 %) CHCs out of 5321 CHCs.  Shri Mishra added that Haryana has distributed 2814(51%) out of 5563 farm implements to individual farmers and has established 857 (70%) CHCs out of 1230 Custom Hiring Centres and the remaining work is likely to be completed this week.  He underlined that Eastern Peripheral Expressway has been operational since last week of May 2018 and steps are being taken for 100% divergence of non-destined trucks entering Delhi.

 

Shri Mishra also said that Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has added 906 new coaches. Out of this, 704 coaches have already been commissioned and remaining 206 are under commissioning stage. 427 AC buses (198 Electric + 229 CNG) are being added by DMRC as last mile connectivity by November 30, 2018.  He also pointed out that out of 1131 industrial units in Delhi, about 950 units have switched over to PNG and the remaining have been issued closure directions.

Some of the other steps taken by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change include  -  722 brick kilns in Delhi and NCR have switched over to Zig- Zag technology; brick kilns that have not converted to Zig-Zag technology will not be allowed to operate in Delhi NCR; for effective control of dust during winters, 400 water sprinklers will be deployed by municipal corporations in Delhi; Adherence to SoPs at construction sites and mandatory implementation of dust mitigation measures by all construction agencies has been mandated. Failure to comply will result in stoppage of work by DPCC/CPCB; three pilot projects for abatement of air pollution are being initiated: WAYUs at  7 traffic intersections in Delhi; air filters on 30 buses of Manav Rachna University and dust suppressant chemicals at some construction sites; CCTV cameras have been installed at sanitary landfill sites; fencing has been done and guards have been deployed to ensure that no fire takes place at these sites.

                Strongly emphasizing that more and more people will have to be involved to make managing of forest fires into a mass movement, Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that forest fire management is part of our long-term vision for Sustainable Forest Management. Speaking at the release of a report titled “Strengthening Forest Fire Management in India”, here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan affirmed that the recommendations suggested in the report must be implemented effectively.  He added that once the recommendations are implemented, there should be a significant reduction in the incidence of forest fires.  The Minister also suggested that the Ministry of Science & Technology also be involved on the issue of fighting forest fires.  

 

Dr. Harsh Vardhan also pointed out that various recommendations in the study report will be worth, only if they are followed up by a proactive and aggressive strategy.  The Minister stressed that forest fire is one of the causes of emission of carbon dioxide that leads to global warming.  “Hence, the report is a timely action guided by the vision of the Prime Minister, Mr.Narendra Modi to meet India’s climate goals defined under the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs) set under the Paris Agreement”, the Minister said.  He advocated the institution of recognition or awards to infuse a healthy competition among state forest departments.  ‘It is for the first time in the history of the country that such a step has been taken under the visionary leadership of the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said.

Speaking on the occasion, Country Director for India (World Bank) Dr. Junaid Kamal Ahmad said that forest fires are a challenge across many countries and lead to the loss of lives and livelihoods for people directly dependent on forest produce. 

A presentation made during the meeting emphasised that forest fires have distinct regional patterns, with 20 districts (not the same ones) account for 47% of fire distribution.  The presentation also pointed out that forest fires are caused by a combination of natural and social factors.  The report discusses policies on forest fire prevention and management and underscores the need to put more emphasis on better fire prevention practices and a well-equipped and trained workforce to fight fires.   The report adds that there is an urgent need to fill vacancies for field staff, particularly in fire-prone areas, and to make adequate and reliable funding available, the report adds.  The report has been prepared jointly by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and World Bank.

 

Some of the recommendations include – developing a National Forest Fire Prevention Management Plan as an open, consultative and a time-bound process, institute standard management practices, adapt technology to local conditions, as well as scale up the best practices and increase engagement with local communities to ensure that big fire is used in a responsible way and at the same time, give communities a greater say in decision-making process.  

The Report suggests that the National FFPM Action Plan should delineate the roles and responsibilities of the MoEFCC, state forest departments, communities and disaster agencies.   Lastly, there is a need to support forest fire management through improved data, and research to fill critical knowledge gaps. A national forest fire information database, bringing together satellite-based remote sensing data, and field-reported data, will be instrumental for assessing longer-term trends across states and regions and for planning fire prevention and response.  In addition, defining a national research agenda for fire management and provision of funding opportunities for scientific research would help to establish formal cooperation between members of the research community and the forest department.  

 

An international workshop was also organized in November, 2017 with an aim to learn the experience in other countries that could be applied to improve policies and practices for effective management of forest fires in India.

                Reiterating that the fight against climate change has to become a social movement, Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that States are important partners in implementing the climate change vision of the country.  Addressing the inaugural session of the national workshop on “Taking forward the climate agenda” here today, the Minister urged the State Governments to increasingly play a proactive role in the implementation of climate policies.  Dr. Vardhan pointed out that States must create their own initiatives for climate action beyond implementing central policies. He added that the issues of transfer of technology and finance continue to be major issues in dealing with climate change.  

The Minister averred that several pioneering initiatives and innovative approaches for addressing climate change, beyond national level initiatives, are being championed by the state governments.  Citing the Green Good Deeds movement in this context, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that adopting one Green Good every day, Green Good Behaviour, Green Social Responsibility and adopting Green Practices will help in fighting climate change. The Minister urged the States to undertake ambitious climate action on both, mitigation as well as adaptation, beyond the schemes of Government of India.

Dr. Vardhan underlined that both the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) had been conceptualized almost a decade ago.  “Thus, the ministry is taking steps for revision for the national missions of NAPCC as well as the SAPCCs to reflect the current climate change realities”, the Minister said.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan stressed that climate change issue will be successfully handled only by the people of this world. He requested the State governments to take measures to strengthen the climate change nodal departments by providing adequate resources to the departments, so that they can function optimally.  He also appreciated the pivotal role played by the State climate change nodal departments in driving climate action at the state level by serving as a critical link between Central government and state government on climate change issues.  

India has been addressing climate change as one of the key national priorities. The scheme has been designed to facilitate the implementation of the SAPCCs, which provides an over-arching framework for guiding climate action at the state level. A presentation made during the inaugural session of the workshop informed the gathering that 11 States have submitted second proposals under NAPCC and 27 adaptation projects, including a multi-state regional project, are being implemented. 

The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) guide climate actions in the country. India also submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) on October 2, 2015 for the period of 2021-2030 and ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016. State governments are key stakeholders in driving climate change action at the sub national level and would play an even more significant role in combating climate change in the post-2020 period.

The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change organized today’s meeting in an effort to further strengthen the engagement with States on climate change issues.   Joint Secretary, MoEF&CC, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad, Scientist ‘G’, MoEF&CC, Dr. J.R Bhatt and Executive Managing Director, NABARD, Mr. H.R. Dave also addressed the gathering.

                Urging children to play a leading role in the protection of wildlife and environment, Minister of State of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, has said that our relationship with environment must be based on cooperation.  Addressing a gathering of school children on the occasion of the conclusion of the national programme of Wildlife Week at the National Zoological Park here today, Dr. Sharma stated that the persistence of children can really be utilized to further the objective of wildlife conservation. He added that the number of each animal species is dictated by nature and pointed out that it is the human beings who have invaded the forests that are home to wildlife.  Dr. Sharma told the children that it is only in our country that rivers, forests and animals are worshipped.  

Speaking on the occasion, Director General, Forests, Dr. Siddhant Das said that no programme can succeed without peoples’ participation.  He emphasized that though India has only 2.5 per cent of land of the world, it is home to about 18% of wildlife population and added that tiger, lion, rhinoceros and crocodile are surviving and thriving in the country.  Dr. Das also underlined the difference between in-situ conservation, wherein species are conserved wherever they originate and ex-situ conservation, where animal species are shifted out of the national park to a zoological park for their conservation.

Earlier, Dr. Mahesh Sharma inaugurated a bio-methanation plant under an MoU between BARC and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The capacity of the bio-methanation plant will be 3 Metric Tonnes (MT) per day.  The Minister also planted a sapling in the premises of National Zoological Park and also carried out a cleanliness drive under Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan along with the children.  

Wildlife Week is celebrated every year from October 2.  The celebration of Wildlife Week started in the year 1952.  

Additional Director General (Forest), Mr. M.S Negi, Additional Director General (Forest), Mr. Saibal Dasgputa, Inspector General (Wildlife), MoEF&CC, Mr. Soumitra Dasgputa and Director, National Zoological Park, New Delhi, Ms. Renu Singh, as well as senior officers and officials from National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) were among those present on the occasion.

                The Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi, was today conferred the Champions of the Earth Award 2018 for Policy Leadership by UN Secretary General, Mr. Antonio Guterres at a ceremony at Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra, here today. Executive Director, UN Environment, Mr Erik Solheim, Union Minister for External Affairs, Ms. Sushma Swaraj and Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, were present on the occasion.

 

In his address, the Prime Minister said that the award is for all those unknown faces, who work in far-flung settlements, mountainous regions, tribal areas for years.  He emphasized that the award is an honour for the India’s continual, new, eternal and ancient tradition and is the reflection of our commitment for sustainable energy. He also congratulated the other laureates of the award in other categories. Mr. Modi underlined that climate and calamity have a direct relationship with culture and till the concerns over climate become a part of culture, it will be difficult to escape calamities. Stating that India’s sensitivity towards environment is today being acknowledged the world over, Mr. Modi underlined that in India, nature has been considered a living entity as well as a being that co-exists. He referred to the Clean Air campaign to sensitise ground-level functionaries and general public to enforce the habit of environmental protection. 

 



The Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi receiving “Champions of The Earth” award

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary General, United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres said “today we recognise a statesman, who embodies the true meaning of leadership.” Mr. Guterres praised the sensitivity towards nature and environment being a part of Indian tradition. “I must confess that the impact of Prime Minister Modi’s decisions has already reached the executive office of United Nations. Prime Minister Modi decided that India should restrict the use of single use plastic in less than five years. In the office of United Nations, I have decided that there is no single use of plastic”, the UN Secretary General said. He said that climate action is the right approach from the point of view of environment, economy and development.

 

In his remarks, Executive Director, UN Environment, Mr Erik Solheim stressed that the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi, has been providing political leadership, vision and dedication that is lacking in the world. Mr. Solheim praised India’s efforts for increase in the number of tigers, increase in forest area and in the field of solar energy.  “It is ambitious leaders like him that will propel us forward in the fight to keep our natural environment healthy, accessible and sustainable for all. For this, I am immensely inspired and grateful”, Mr. Solheim said.  “Prime Minister Modi has shown the kind of leadership and ambition our planet needs right now. There is the bold pledge to end single-use plastic in five years’ time, something that could well be the start of a global wave of action that saves our oceans. India is leading the world into a solar-powered future, proving that a clean, low-carbon economy is also great for business. Our planet needs more champions like him”, he added.  

 

In her address, Union Minister of External Affairs, Ms. Sushma Swaraj, emphasized that in our country, Earth is not seen as a planet, but revered as Mother Earth.  She stated that the Government’s goal is to strive for environmental protection along with development.  Quoting Sanskrit ‘suktas’, Ms. Swaraj extolled the virtues of ancient Indian philosophy and thought towards the protection of nature and environment.  She underlined that in the West, when buildings are constructed a ground-breaking ceremony is conducted, whereas in India, ‘Bhoomi Pujan’ (worship of the earth) is performed.  

 

Addressing the gathering, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, said that the Government has introduced several policies and programmes under the visionary leadership of the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi. “Today, our villages are becoming cleaner and deaths due to diarrhoea are history. That speaks volumes for Modi ji’s vision in nurturing environmental health”, he added.  The Minister pointed out that the Prime Minister, in keeping with the Indian tradition of renunciation, has already announced that he is dedicating the award to the Indian value system.   “Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.  Decades ago, Bapu dreamt of a Swachh  Bharat.  Today, his dream is being brought to reality by a man as humble, as committed and as brave as him.  Our beloved Prime Minister Modi ji is inspiring 130 crore Indians to achieve the goal of Swachh Bharat and making remarkable strides in cleanliness and sanitation, in environmental protection and upliftment of the poor and downtrodden”, Dr. Vardhan said.  

 

Outlining some of the programmes undertaken under the visionary leadership of the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi ji, Dr. Harsh Vardhan stated that rightly the UN has recognized our Prime Minister as a statesman with exemplary devotion and commitment to uplift the poor, strengthen public health and protect the environment through numerous initiatives launched in the last four years.



Dr. Harsh Vardhan addressing the gathering 

 

Referring to the ""Green Good Deeds"" - a societal movement to protect environment and promote good living in the country and bringing focus on involvement of citizens through small actions like saving energy, conserving water, planting trees, the Environment Minister urged the people to undertake one Green Good Deed every day. ""The youth has also taken inspiration from Modi ji and are leading the change, making responsible choices to ensure that they do all that they can to reverse climate change"", Dr. Vardhan stated.

 

The Minister also highlighted Swachh Bharat Mission as one of the world's biggest people's movement and said that Prime Minister Modi ji has been inspiring 130 crore Indians to achieve the goal of Swachh Bharat and making remarkable strides in cleanliness and sanitation, in environmental protection and upliftment of the poor and downtrodden.  “As many as 25 States have become Open Defecation Free (ODF) and so have 5 lakh villages. 

 

Dr. Vardhan said that the Government has pledged to eliminate single use plastic by 2022. He stressed the decision to leapfrog from BS-IV to BS-VI emission norms by April 2020, which was to be earlier adopted by 2024 and push for e-vehicles, stringent fuel emission norms, expansion of mass rapid transit systems and green ports.

 

The Minister stated that internationally, the Prime Minister, Mr. Modi led the launch of International Solar Alliance jointly with France, to make solar energy efficient, affordable and bringing energy security in member countries. ""68 nations are now members of ISA, which is now a treaty-based international government organisation.

 

Several Cabinet Ministers, ambassadors, representatives of diplomatic missions and senior officers as well as officials of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and other Union Ministries were among those present in the gathering.

                In an effort to supplement the efforts of State Governments in pollution abatement in identified stretches of various rivers through National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for implementation of projects on cost-sharing basis between the Centre and State Governments, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has sanctioned a project for ‘Pollution abatement of rivers Devika and Tawi in Udhampur, Jammu & Kashmir.  The project is scheduled for completion by March 2021.   

Upon completion, the project will have a significant and direct beneficial impact in terms of reduction of pollution load in the two rivers and improvement in their water quality.  As full sewerage system will be laid in the town and its entire sewage will be treated, the project will improve the aesthetics and sanitation conditions in Udhampur and support the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan towards ensuring cleanliness in the town.

The total sanctioned cost of the project is Rs. 186.74 crore, will be shared between the Government of India and Government of J&K on 90:10 cost-sharing basis respectively.  The share of Central Government in the project will be Rs. 166.86 crore and the share of the State Government will be Rs. 18.08 crore.  The Urban Engineering and Environment Department (UEED) is the implementing agency of the project.

The major components under the project include laying of 129.27 kms of sewer lines (which will ensure full sewerage system in Udhampur town), setting up of 3 Sewage Pumping stations and construction of 3 Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) of 13.60 million litres per day (mld) capacity.  The project will also cover non-sewerage works relating to river front development in a length of around 340 metres at 3 bathing ghats, including Mela Ghat (where there is mass gathering during religious festivals/events), construction of 2 improved wood crematoria to minimise wood consumption and ash disposal, as well as public awareness activities.  

The main reason for the pollution of Devika and Tawi rivers in Udhampur is discharge of untreated sewage from the town.  Presently, no sewerage system and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) exist in Udhampur.     The project for ‘Pollution abatement of rivers Devika and Tawi rivers in Udhampur under NRCP has been sanctioned by the Ministry on September 28, 2018.

                The rank in Trading Across Borders has taken a quantum leap from 146 to 80 in the Doing Business report released by World Bank today. Among the 11 parameters based on which the rankings are determined and which include indices like Starting a Business, Getting Electricity and Resolving Insolvency, the improvement in India’s overall ranking this year can be mainly attributed to an exceptional performance in Trading across Borders where India’s rank improved from 146 to 80 since last year. This positive jump is due to a series of reforms undertaken by Customs in conjunction with Ministry of Shipping and all stakeholders such as importers, exporters, Customs Brokers, CFS operators, Shipping lines and Terminal Operators.

 

Trading Across Borders constitutes one of three most important components of the ten parameters which the World Bank measures. This parameter assesses the efficiency of time taken in clearing the imported and export goods and the cost involved in these processes. The rankings are a solid testimony of our commitment to improving the business environment in the country. Improvement in ranking is a clear endorsement and recognition of reforms carried out by Customs in last years.

 

Customs has undertaken several initiatives which included enhanced coordination with other ministries and stakeholders, extensive use of digitization and new technologies and business process re-engineering to facilitate trade. Customs has come out with a National Trade Facilitation Action Plan which provides a road map for fulfilment of India's commitments under the Trade Facilitation Agreement. These initiatives by the government have also earned praise by the World Customs Organization (WCO). By introducing SWIFT, a Customs Single Window, Customs has unified the entire clearance process on a single digital platform. It has given a fillip to trusted trader program by completely revamping AEO (Authorised Economic Operator) scheme. For trusted traders, facility of deferred payment of duty has been made available. Risk rules for interdicting consignments have been fine-tuned, which enabled higher facilitation levels. With the roll or of flagship reform eSANCHIT, Customs de-materialised the clearance ecosystem by dispensing with submission of hard copy of the documents thereby making the entire process of consignment clearance faceless and paperless. Customs also introduced game changer initiative Direct Port Delivery (DPD). Almost 47% of the containers at India's biggest port Nhava Sheva can be cleared directly from the port to the importers premises within 60 hours. Containers now move seamlessly from port to importers warehouse without having to be parked in CFSs thereby cutting dwell time and cost. Self-sealing using RFID e-seals had been introduced on the export side. Now exporters can plan the movement of containers as per their scheduling without having to wait for departmental officers to seal the containers. A major push was given to allow more and more containers under direct port entry scheme so that routing through intermediary CFSs could be avoided. Customs has done a major software and hardware upgradation of ICEGATE. Time release studies (TRS) have been carried out at Nhava Sheva which clearly reflected the actual time of clearance in case of import as well as export was much lesser than the reflected in previous years ratings. Even the results of TRS have been vindicated in the DMICDC supervised Logistics Databank project which records the actual timestamps of export and import containers plying on the western sector. Ministry of Shipping has also ensured upgradation of infrastructure in the ports and introduced strict monitoring of time taken in port operations.  The measures like Advance filing by Importers, Self-sealing using RFID seals by Exporters, supporting paperless clearance by Customs Brokers, issue of e-delivery orders by Shipping lines, supporting DPD and DPE initiatives by CFS operators and faster evacuation time by Terminal operators have directly contributed to time and cost savings. 

 

Customs department acknowledges the invaluable role by field officers and remarkable cooperation by all coordinating Ministries, especially Shipping, Commerce, DIPP, etc and all other stakeholders in achieving the improved rank. This improvement is the fruit of team effort. While substantive improvement in ranking has been achieved in Trading Across Borders, there is still room for further reforms which would be continued by CBIC in future.

                The autonomy for the Central Bank, within the framework of the RBI Act, is an essential and accepted governance requirement. Governments in India have nurtured and respected this. Both the Government and the Central Bank, in their functioning, have to be guided by public interest and the requirements of the Indian economy. For the purpose, extensive consultations on several issues take place between the Government and the RBI from time to time. This is equally true of all other regulators. Government of India has never made public the subject matter of those consultations. Only the final decisions taken are communicated. The Government, through these consultations, places its assessment on issues and suggests possible solutions. The Government will continue to do so.

                The Prime Ministers of India and Japan, building on great friendship between the two countries and to further strengthen and widen the depth and diversity of economic cooperation, agreed during Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi’s visit to Japan, to conclude a Bilateral Currency Swap Agreement for an amount of USD Seventy Five billion. This Swap arrangement particularly reflects the depth of mutual trust and understanding, personal relationship and warmth between the two leaders built over many years.

This arrangement between Japan and India has been the high point of economic and financial agreements between the two countries, during the visit of the Prime Minister of India. This represents an increase of fifty percent over last currency swap arrangement between the two countries. It is indicative of close bonds between the two countries nurtured by the two leaders. As reported, Prime Minister of Japan Mr. Shinzo Abehas said that he is friend of India forever.

The swap arrangement should aid in bringing greater stability to foreign exchange and capital markets in India. With this arrangement in place, prospects of India would further improve in tapping foreign capital for country’s developmental needs. This facility will enable the agreed amount of foreign capital being available to India for use as and when the need  arises.

To encourage investment in infrastructure, RBI will address the resolution on hedging requirement.

Policy interest rate in the USA has seen gradual increase in the recent months. This is one of the causes of strengthening of dollar viz-a-viz other currencies of the world. Strengthening of dollar is also resulting in flight of capital from emerging markets to get better assured returns. Recent months have seen Governments and Central Banks around the world, especially those of emerging economies, taking various policy measures to address the international situation of dollar appreciation and to improve the availability of foreign capital.

To address the issues of outward flow of foreign capital, India has also taken various steps towards containing the Current Account Deficit (CAD) and rupee volatility. It has taken various measures to attract foreign capital which include relaxations in the policy for external borrowings and issuance of offshore rupee bonds (Masala Bonds), review of certain restrictions on FPI investment in debt, hike in customs duty for curtailing imports of non-essential items, promoting exports, financing standing working capital of Oil Marketing Companies by long term external borrowings etc.

Today’s decision of entering into currency swap agreement is another important measure towards improving confidence in the Indian market. This facility will not only enable the agreed amount of Capital being available to India on tap for use, it would also help in bringing down the cost of capital for Indian entities while accessing foreign capital market.

The arrangement is another milestone in mutual cooperation between Japan and India

Currently, for grant of approval under sub-clauses (iv) and (v) of clause (23C) of Section 10 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act), for exemption of income received by any person on behalf of any other fund or institution, any trust or institution, rule 2C of the Income-tax Rules, 1962 (the Rules) provide for filing of application manually in Form No 56.

Similarly, for grant of approval under sub-clauses (vi) and (via) of clause (23C) of section 10 of the Act, for exemption of income received by any person on behalf of any university or other educational institution and any hospital or other institution, rule 2CA of the Rules provide for filing of application manually in Form No 56D.

Further, rule 11AA of the Rules provide for filing of application manually in Form No 10G for grant of approval under clause (vi) of sub-section (5) of section 80G for deduction in respect of donations to any other fund or any institution to which section 80G applies.

Keeping in view the focus of the Government on digital initiatives, as also the fact that the Department is continuously automating its processes, it is imperative that manual filing of these applications should be done away with so as to ensure not only faster processing of the same but also to reduce the interface between the Department and the applicant.

 Further, there is also a need to rationalize the rules and forms to align with the requirements of the present times.

 In view of the above, these rules and forms are proposed to be amended by way of substituting:-

 (a)           Rules 2C and 2CA with a New Rule 2C and Rule 11AA with new rule 11AA; and

(b)          Form No 56 and 56D with a new Form No 56 and Form No 10G with a new Form 10G. 

The draft notification proposing the above amendments has been formulated and uploaded on the website of the Income-tax Department (www.incometaxindia.gov.in) for inputs from stakeholders and general public. The inputs on the draft rules may be sent electronically at the email address, ustpl1[at]nic[dot]in, latest by November 12, 2018.

                Continuing the practice of placing key statistics relating to direct tax collections and administration in public domain, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has further released time-series data as updated up to FY 2017-18 and income-distribution data for AY 2016-17 and AY 2017-18. The key highlights of these statistics are as under:


	There is a constant growth in direct tax-GDP ratio over last three years and the ratio of 5.98% in FY 2017-18 is the best DT-GDP ratio in last 10 years.
	There is a growth of more than 80% in the number of returns filed in the last four financial years from 3.79 crore in FY 2013-14 (base year) to 6.85 crore in FY 2017-18.
	The number of persons filing return of income has also increased by about 65% during this period from 3.31 crore in FY 2013-14 to 5.44 crore in FY 2017-18.


There has been continuous increase in the amount of income declared in the returns filed by all categories of taxpayers over the last three Assessment Years (AYs). For AY 2014-15, corresponding to FY 2013-14 (base year), the return filers had declared gross total income of Rs.26.92 lakh crore, which has increased by 67% to Rs.44.88 lakh crore for AY 2017-18, showing higher level of compliance resulting from various legislative and administrative measures taken by the Government, including effective enforcement measures against tax evasion.

The total number of taxpayers (including corporates, firms, HUFs, etc.) showing income of above Rs. 1 crore has also registered sharp increase over the three-year horizon. While 88,649 taxpayers disclosed income above Rs. 1 crore in AY 2014-15, the figure was 1,40,139 for AY 2017-18 (growth of about 60%). Similarly, the number of individual taxpayers disclosing income above Rs. 1 crore increased during the period under reference from 48,416 to 81,344, which translates into a growth of 68%.

The average tax paid by corporate taxpayers has increased from Rs.32.28 lakh in AY 2014-15 to Rs.49.95 lakh in AY 2017-18 (growth of 55%). There is also an increase of 26% in the average tax paid by individual taxpayers from Rs.46,377/- in AY 2014-15 to Rs.58,576/- in AY 2017-18.

During the three-year period under reference, the number of salaried taxpayers has increased from 1.70 crore for AY 2014-15 to 2.33 crore for AY 2017-18 (up by 37%). The average income declared by the salaried taxpayers has gone up by 19% from Rs.5.76 lakh to Rs.6.84 lakh.

During the same period, there has also been a growth of 19% in the number of non-salaried individual taxpayers from 1.95 crore to 2.33 crore and the average non-salary income declared has increased by 27% from Rs. 4.11 lakh in AY 2014-15 to Rs. 5.23 lakh in AY 2017-18.

The availability of the time-series data and the income-distribution data of fairly long periods in the public domain will be found to be useful by the academicians, scholars, researchers, economists and the public at large in studying long-term trends of various indices of the effectiveness and efficiency of direct tax administration in India.

                It has been brought to notice that there have been apprehensions by trade and industry relating to the last date for availment of ITC for the period July, 2017 to March, 2018. In order to remove doubts, it was clarified that as per the law, the last date for availing ITC in relation to the period from July, 2017 to March, 2018 is the last date for the filing of return in the FORM GSTR-3B for the month of September, 2018.

 

In view of the said apprehensions and with a view to give some more time to the trade and industry, the last date for furnishing return in the FORM GSTR-3B for the month of September, 2018 is being extended up to 25th October, 2018. Relevant notification will follow shortly.

It may also be noted that the Government has extended the last date for furnishing of return in FORM GSTR-3B for the month of September, 2018 for certain taxpayers who have been recently migrated from erstwhile tax regime to GST regime vide notification No. 47/2018- Central Tax dated 10th September, 2018. For such taxpayers, the extended date i.e. 31st December, 2018 or the date of filing of annual return whichever is earlier will be the last date for availing ITC in relation to the said invoices issued by the corresponding suppliers during the period from July, 2017 to March, 2018.

There appears to be misgiving about the last date for taking Input Tax Credit (ITC) in relation to invoices or debit notes relating to such invoices pertaining to period from July, 2017 to March, 2018. Such uncertainty seems to stem from the Government’s decision to extend the last date for furnishing of details of outward supplies in FORM GSTR-1 from time to time.

 

            According to Section 16 (4) of the CGST Act, 2017, a registered person shall not be entitled to take ITC in respect of any invoice or debit note for supply of goods or services or both after the due date of furnishing of the return under Section 39 for the month of September following the end of financial year to which such invoice or invoice relating to such Debit Note pertains (hereinafter referred to as “the said invoices”) or furnishing of the relevant Annual Return, whichever is earlier.

 

            With taxpayers self-assessing and availing ITC through return in FORM GSTR-3B, the last date for availing ITC in relation to the said invoices issued by the corresponding supplier(s) during the period from July, 2017 to March, 2018 is the last date for the filing of such return for the month of September, 2018 i.e. 20th October, 2018.

 

            It is clarified that the furnishing of outward details in FORM GSTR-1 by the corresponding supplier(s) and the facility to view the same in FORM GSTR-2A by the recipient is in the nature of taxpayer facilitation and does not impact the ability of the taxpayer to avail ITC on self-assessment basis in consonance with the provisions of Section 16 of the Act. The apprehension that ITC can be availed only on the basis of reconciliation between FORM GSTR-2A and FORM GSTR-3B conducted before the due date for filing of return in FORM GSTR-3B for the month of September, 2018 is unfounded as the same exercise can be done thereafter also.

 

            It may, however, be noted that the Government has extended the last date for furnishing of return in FORM GSTR-3B for the month of September, 2018 for certain taxpayers who have been recently migrated from erstwhile tax regime to GST  regime vide Notification No. 47/2018- Central Tax dated 10th September, 2018. For such taxpayers, the extended date i.e. 31st December, 2018 or the date of filing of Annual Return whichever is earlier will be the last date for availing ITC in relation to the said invoices issued by the corresponding suppliers during the period from July, 2017 to March, 2018.

 

            All the taxpayers are encouraged to take note of the legal requirements and be compliance savvy.

                In a first, Finance Commission today held a detailed meeting with the representatives of Tourism industry in Nainital considering the fact that tourism is one of the major pillars of the economy of Uttarakhand. Chairman Shri N.K. Singh said that Uttarakhand has a comparative advantage in tourism sector which many states do not have. It has highest rate of return on investment and multiplier effects for growth and employment. It would be a task for State govt to fine-tune it's resources towards this.

Yesterday, addressing a press conference in Dehradun, the Chairman said that Uttarakhand has immense economic potential and boundless opportunities despite environmental and geographical constrainsts. The state can become a hub for tourism, ecological services and a conservation model for the nation. Challenges faced by Uttarakhand are real and its needs legitimate. The Finance Commission is committed to support the state within the Constitutional framework to realise its huge untapped potential.

Referrring to the wide ranging discussions held with the state govt, he said that Commission will positively look into the request for revenue deficit grants to the state which it could not get during the previous commission. He appreciated the high GSDP growth rate and Per Capita Income of the state as compared to the national averages. However, issues like intra state disparity and need for improvement in some social indictors needs to be tackled innovatively through suitable policy measures. Chairman also noted that Uttarakhand is facing the challenge of low realisation of GST revenues. However, he said that final equilibrium point of GST is yet to arrive. The Commission has to assess the revenues and expenditures of both the centre and the states which is a challenging task.

Chief Minister Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat along with Finance Minister Shri Prakash Pant and other cabinet colleagues welcomed the Commission and underlined the fact that geography of Uttarakhand has a direct impact on creation and maintenance of infrastructure, provisioning of essential services, cost disabilities associated with the terrain and low revenue generation due to the scattered nature of habitation and low level of economic development.

He apprised the Commission that Uttarakhand has a robust secondary sector (49%) but weak primary and services sectors. The growth in secondary sector was primarily due to the special industrial package given to the state which ended in 2010, therefore, the industrialization will be low in the future. Thus the state is actively promoting horticulture and food processing in the primary sector and hydropower, tourism, wellness services in the service sector.

He highlighted two issues related to the high GSDP growth rate – narrow financial base and environmental constraints; which led to intrastate disparity. He mentioned that due to regulatory restrictions and ecosystem obligations, many hydro power projects could not be completed and infrastructure development is difficult. He stated that the state incurred a loss of about RS. 2500 crores in 2015-16 due to discontinuance of central grants of the erstwhile Planning Commission. Other issues which were discussed during the presentation are :

1. Plea for ‘Green Bonus’ fund owing to the ecosystem services provided by the state.

2. CD Ratio should also be considered for devolution in addition to Per Capita Income.

3. Grant of Rs. 25655 crore for special problems and up-gradation of infrastructure.

4. Certain share of devolution should be earmarked for hilly states.

5. Out migration from remote and hilly areas due to difficulty in providing the quality public services.

6. Pilgrimage tourism and pressure of floating population

7. Limited availability of land creates difficulty in expanding the agriculture base.

Overwhelming consensus among states for devolution of funds to all the three levels of PRIs

15th Finance Commission which is on a 4 day visit to Himachal Pradesh also sought views of the representatives from various political parties, local bodies and trade and industry and tourism. In the meeting with representatives of Local Bodies some policy related issues like the modalities of fund transfer to the local bodies were the main focus area. Municipalities urged the commission to consider the flux of tourists and tough climatic conditions for grants and devolution of funds. Representatives also focused on the need for the funds to be given to the Zila Parishads and Panchayat Samitis which was given to Gram Panchayats only in 14th FC. Chairman observed that there is an overwhelming consensus among the states visited till now about the need of funds devolution to all the three levels of the third tier of government.

                It has been brought to notice that doubts regarding the manner of filing the quarterly return by Composition Dealers in FORM GSTR-4 in the absence of auto-population of the details of inward supplies (other than supplies attracting reverse charge) received from registered suppliers exist amongst taxpayers.

 

In this regard, it is to clarify that the taxpayers who have opted to pay tax under the composition levy shall not furnish the data in serial number 4A of Table 4 of FORM GSTR-4. The required changes in the CGST Rules, 2017 would be notified shortly.

                In his intervention during the IMFC Plenary Session in Bali yesterday,  Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance stated that technological expansion including FinTech is inevitable and has reached all parts of the globe. However, what is not inevitable is protectionism, trade tensions and tightening of financial conditions. In the context of these challenges, he said that the time for building buffer and policy action by the Emerging Market Economies (EMDs) is not there. Shri Garg said that a suitable approach could be the association of the IMF, being at the centre of the GFSN, at an earlier stage rather than when crisis has already occurred. Hence, the strengthening of this Multilateral Institution is crucial, he added. On the 15th General Review of Quotas, Shri Garg mentioned that this Agenda of the IMF is urgent as there is a deadline fixed for its conclusion next year. Both enhancement in the Quantum of Quota Resources and Realignment of Voting Shares should take place so that Quota Shares of EMDCs increase in line with its growing relative economic position in the world. Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance attended the IMFC Restricted Breakfast and IMFC Plenary Sessions yesterday in the ongoing Annual Meetings 2018 of the IMF and World Bank being held in Bali, Indonesia this year.

Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, DEA later participated in the 98th Meeting of the Development Committee Plenary. The items on the Agenda included the Human Capital Project: A Project for the World; Disruptive Technologies and the World Bank Group – Creating Opportunities - Mitigating Risks; The Bali Fintech Agenda; and Debt Vulnerabilities in Emerging and Low-Income Economies.In his intervention at this Session, Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) mentioned that India had supported the capital increase of the World Bank Group with the expectation that it will deliver on its core development responsibilities articulated in the Forward Look, and expects that the additional capital would be put to work expeditiously and leveraged to enhance IBRD lending volumes and IFC investments. He mentioned that digital technologies are transforming the very system of production of goods and services and their distribution. These technologies are in the process of changing the nature of the work and nature of ‘jobs’ as one knows. Shri Garg welcomed the emphasis placed by the World Bank on building human capital but said that he is not so certain about the Human Capital Index, in its current form. He stated that it has severe flaws and therefore will not succeed in focusing the attention of the world on building the right kind of human capital which new technologies will need. Shri Garg mentioned that India has welcomed the Bali FinTech Agenda and that India has extensively used digital technologies to build FinTech, most prominently in the payment space. He said that the Aadhaar system is global scale and is serving India very well in advancing the FinTech agenda. In the context of debt build-up in Low Income Countries, which Shri Garg mentioned as worrisome, harnessing FinTech could also be one way to build fiscal efficiencies, better debt reporting and debt management, Shri Garg added. 

Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance during the day also addressed investors from many countries in a Session titled, “India: Responding to External Shocks”,organized by JP Morgan. He also took time-out to have Bilateral Meetings, one with Executive Managing Director of JBIC, Mr. Kazuhiko Amakawa, and another with Mr. Matthew Rycroft, who is the Permanent Secretary for DFID, UK. 

Shri Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) is currently on an official tour to Bali, Indonesia to participate in the Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank and other associated Sidelines Meetings. He is accompanied by the senior officials of the Ministry of Finance among others.

                It has been noticed that unverified reports of pending GST refunds on account of exports are published in the print media by trade bodies. These figures being put out in the public domain are exaggerated and thus inaccurate. It is a fact that a large number of exporters have been granted refunds so far while a few claims are still pending owing to deficiencies found in the claims. 

In this regard, it is clarified that about 92.68% (Rs 38,824 crore) of the total IGST refund claims (Rs. 41,889 crore) transmitted to Customs from GSTN as on date have already been disposed. The remaining claims amounting to Rs. 3065 crores are held up on account of various deficiencies which have been communicated to exporters for remedial action.

In the case of RFD-01A (ITC Refund) claims with Centre and States, the pendency as on date is only Rs 2,077 Crore. Out of the refund claims of Rs. 39,372 Crore received, provisional/final order has been issued in case of refunds amounting to Rs. 32,345 Crore. In claims amounting to Rs. 4,951 Crore, deficiency memos have been issued. Thus, actual pendency is far less than is being put out for the knowledge of the public. The overall disposal of GST refunds is Rs 71,169 Crore till date. Refund claims without any deficiency are being cleared expeditiously. 

Efforts are being made continuously to clear all the dues on account of pending refund claims. Co-operation of the exporter community is solicited to ensure that they exercise due diligence while filing GSTR 1 and GSTR 3B returns as well as Shipping Bills. 

Extensive outreach programmes have been conducted along with issuance of guidance circulars, advisories, FAQs, advertisements etc and also an alternative procedure involving manual interface has been provided where the errors could not be corrected online. The efforts are beginning to show positive results. The exporting community is assured that all their eligible refund claims will be sanctioned without any delay. Further, the export bodies are also requested to put out only verified figures in their press communication as unsubstantiated reports cause needless alarm amongst the exporters.

                The Final G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting under the 2018 Argentine Presidency and the final BRICS Deputies Meeting under the 2018 South African Chairmanship were held on 11th -12th October 2018 in Bali, Indonesia on the sidelines of the IMF/Fund Bank Annual Meetings. 

G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) Meeting 

The deliberations in the G-20 FMCBG meeting centered on key risks facing the global economy, enhancing a resilient international financial architecture, financing infrastructure development, progress on compact with Africa as well as streamlining of the GPFI process. 

Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, Government of India, Shri Subhash Chandra Garg in his interventions indicated that the risks related to trade tensions, financial vulnerabilities and oil prices have materialized and are having major impact on the Emerging Market Economies. Secretary (EA) emphasized on the need for G-20 nations to take co-ordinated action so as to ensure that the negative spillover effects of global risks on EMDEs are minimized. Secretary (EA) also appreciated the progress of work under the Argentine Presidency on developing infrastructure as an asset class. He indicated the importance of developing global standards and protocols for attracting private funds to the infrastructure space and hoped that the infrastructure agenda of G-20 can contribute in this direction. Secretary (EA) also highlighted the efforts undertaken by India to attract private players in infra financing space such as creating Real Estate Investment Trust Fund, Infrastructure Debt Fund as well as undertaking efforts for monetizing brownfield assets. On Compact with Africa, Secretary (EA) indicated the importance that Government of India (GoI) has placed on undertaking investments in Africa and highlighted the USD10 billion soft loan facility announced for Africa by the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi. He further highlighted the investment facilitating schemes that GoI has in place to encourage private players to invest in Africa and elsewhere such as National Export Insurance Fund, Concessional Financing Facility etc. 

 BRICS Finance Deputies 

The meeting focused on reviewing the progress achieved by the BRICS Forum in 2018 as well as deliberating on the way forward under the upcoming 2019 BRICS Chairmanship of Brazil. On the Finance Ministry track, the main issues that came-up for discussion were the membership expansion of New Development Bank (NDB), the staggering of schedule of payment of paid-in capital of NDB, the work of BRICS PPP Task Force and examining the possibility of developing a consensus on BRICS Rating Agency. On the Central Bank track, the discussions centered on the test run of the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement undertaken by the Central Banks in 2018, the Fintech stocktaking exercise and the progress of work happening in the BRICS Bond Fund Working Group. 

Secretary (EA) in his interventions indicated India’s unequivocal support for NDB’s membership expansion. Further, he called upon the BRICS Deputies to endorse the membership expansion plan of NDB following which the NDB Board along with the Management can continue with their work on finalizing the processes for membership expansion. Secretary (EA) also emphasized that the role of BRICS is to provide broad guidance to NDB and the decisions on managing the micro details should be left to NDB Board of Directors and Board of Governors. On the BRICS Rating Agency, Secretary (EA) indicated that the Report of the Expert Group set-up to study the feasibility of BRICS Rating Agency has envisaged the setting-up of a BRICS Rating Agency which is completely independent and private sector led. Secretary (EA) emphasized on the need felt by the emerging markets and developing economies for a rating methodology that takes into account the country circumstances of these economies. In this context, there was a need for BRICS to take lead and work together on the setting-up of a BRICS Rating Agency. 

Other Meetings 

Other than the G20 and BRICS Meeting, Secretary (EA) also participated in the G24 Ministerial Meeting which was its 100th Meeting. Further, Secretary (EA) also had bilateral meetings with the G-20 Italian Finance Deputy, Mr. Alessandro Riviera, the Under Secretary of US Treasury, Mr. David Melpass as well as Mr. Marco Buti, Director-General of European Commission among others.

                Grant of ‘Special Category Status’ to states is out of purview of the Ṭerms of Reference of Finance Commission, said Chairman of Finance Commission Shri N.K.Singh at a press conference in Amaravati today after concluding a meeting with the state govt. led by Chief Minister Shri N. Chandra Babu Naidu and his cabinet colleagues. Responding to the questions from the media, he stated that the issue was forcefully raised by the Chief Minister but it would be a transgression of the Presidential Notification by the Commission if it considers the issue of Special Category as it does not figure in its Terms of Reference. Philosophy of Special Category Status never emanated from any Finance Commission but from the resolution of erstwhile National Development Council. 

Fifteenth Finance Commission will take a sympathetic and positive view to the needs of Andhra Pradesh to achieve its targets, he said. The Commission believes that current initiatives of the state govt are credible, timely and speedy and for a prosperous India, prosperous Andhra Pradesh is must. He lauded the contribution of Andhra Pradesh to the national GDP and said that it will do everything possible in constitutional framework to realise the state’s potential. He also appreciated the efforts in harnessing the potential of water resources by interlinking the rivers which is of enormous help for agriculture development.  

On the question of populist schemes, he said that Commission will have to delve deeper into it. There are many schemes which have become popular with significant outcomes, and at the same time, there are many which result in sub-optimal outcomes. On the question of using population census 2011, he said that it has been mentioned in the TOR and Commission will look into the ways of incentivising the states who have done well in controlling their population.

Commission appreciated the high growth rate including agricultural growth achieved by the state. It exhorted the state govt to adopt smart agriculture and expand the food processing sector for value addition. Commission understood the huge potential in the state due to its geographical positioning like long coast line, ports and fertile land.

Andhra Pradesh needs handholding to contain the legacy issues of bifurcation: CM

Earlier, highlighting the impact of bifurcation on the newly created state of Andhra Pradesh, both Chief Minister and Finance Minister said that residuary state of Andhra Pradesh comprising 58.32% of the population inherited only 46% of the revenues of the combined state. This structural disability may continue for more than a decade. Loss of Hyderabad’s ecosystem has led to the loss of urbanisation, service sector and revenue generation capacity. This has resulted in a change in the structure of economy from service to agriculture which in turn has led to slow increase in PCI as compared to other southern states and the gap with respect to southern states is increasing. He therefore said, the special assistance including industrial incentives, infrastructure support and investment in services is required to move on the path of ‘Knowledge plus’ economy.

All these factors imply that there is a need of handholding for Andhra Pradesh to sustain the double digit economic growth and achieve the Vision 2029 of reaching 1 trillion dollar economy, he urged. He listed his govt’s efforts towards enhancing the Ease of doing Business and Ease of Living through real time digital governance.

Chief Minister pleaded for granting Special Category Status to the state which after the bifurcation has turned into a revenue deficit state from a surplus state, mainly due to loss of the growth pole - Hyderabad. He also appealed the Commission to continue the post-devolution revenue deficit grants to break the vicious cycle of huge debt. 

Officials in their presentation highlighted the efforts made to incur the necessary capital expenditure inspite of fiscal hardships. Around 73% of the revenue expenditure is development expenditure. During the meeting, state govt officials put forward following important points:


	Lesser tax buoyancy due to agriculture led growth.
	Post devolution revenue deficit grant of Rs. 4.79 lakh crore which is significantly high as compared to the Rs. 22113 crore RDG given by 14th FC.
	Grants-in-Aid on account of bifurcation - Around Rs. 70000 crore for new capital City, port connectivity and development of backward districts.
	Increasing the limit of vertical devolution to 50% of divisible pool and inclusion of cess and surcharge.
	Issue of drought prone Rayalseema region and disaster prone coastal Andhra.
	Grants to Local bodies may be Rs.1000 per capita per annum as against  
	Equal apportionment of unsettled IGST between Centre and States.


15th Finance Commission which concludes its 4 day visit to Andhra Pradesh on Friday, also sought views of the representatives from various political parties. Meeting with representatives of local bodies and trade and industry will be held tomorrow.

                The World Bank released today a Human Capital Index (HCI) as part of the World Development Report 2019. 

Broader theme of the World Development Report (WDR) this year is “The Changing Nature of Work”. As part of this report, the World Bank has launched a Human Capital Project (HCP). The HCP programme is claimed to be a program of advocacy, measurement, and analytical work to raise awareness and increase demand for interventions to build human capital. There are three components of HCP- a cross-country human capital measurement metric called the Human Capital Index (HCI), a programme of measurement and research to inform policy action, and a programme of support for country strategies to accelerate investment in human capital. 

The HCI has been constructed for 157 countries. It claims to seek to measure the amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by age 18. The HCI index values are contended to convey the productivity of the next generation of workers, compared to a benchmark of complete standard education and full health. 

The HCI has three components:

 

(i)            Survival, as measured by under-5 mortality rates;

(ii)          Expected years of Quality-Adjusted School which combines information on the quantity and quality of education (quality is measured by harmonizing test scores from major international student achievement testing programs and quantity from number of years of school that a child can expect to obtain by age 18 given the prevailing pattern of enrolment rates across grades in respective countries); and

(iii)         Health environment using two proxies of (a) adult survival rates and (b) the rate of stunting for children under age 5. 

UNDP constructs Human Development Index (HDI) for several years. The HCI uses survival rates and stunting rate instead of life expectancy as measure of health, and quality-adjusted learning instead of merely years of schooling as measure of education. HCI also excludes per capita income whereas the HDI uses it. Two significant changes from HDI are exclusion of income component and introduction of quality adjustment in learning. Exclusion of income element and introduction of quality adjustment makes HCI far less representative of Human Capital Development than the Index claims it to be. 

The first HCI published today at the Annual Meetings of the Fund Bank comes with a conclusion that for 56% of the world’s population the HCI is at or below 0.50; and for 92% it is at or below 0.75. Hence only 8% of the population can expect to be 75% as productive as they could be.  

The HCI measures the Index outcomes for each country as a fraction of maximum value of 1. As expected the advanced economies such as North America and Europe mostly have HCI value of above 0.75, while South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa have the lowest HCI among the regions. The HCI for India has been estimated at 0.44. The quality adjusted learning has been measured in case of India by using the data as old as 2009. 

The key observations regarding HCI for India in the Report are as under:

 

·         Human Capital Index: A child born in India today will be only 44 per cent as productive when she grows up as she could be if she enjoyed complete education and full health.

·         The HCI in India for females is marginally better than that for males.

·         Further, there has been marked improvement in the HCI components  in India  over the last five years.

·         Probability of Survival to Age 5: 96 out of 100 children born in India survive to age 5.

·         Expected Years of School: In India, a child who starts school at age 4 can expect to complete 10.2 years of school by her 18th birthday.

·         Harmonized Test Scores: Students in India score 355 on a scale where 625 represents advanced attainment and 300 represents minimum attainment.

·         Learning-adjusted Years of School: Factoring in what children actually learn, expected years of school is only 5.8 years.

·         Adult Survival Rate: Across India, 83 per cent of 15-year olds will survive until age 60.

·         Healthy Growth (Not Stunted Rate): 62 out of 100 children are not stunted. 38 out of 100 children are stunted, and so at risk of cognitive and physical limitations that can last a lifetime.

·         Gender Differences: In India, HCI for girls is marginally higher than for boys. 

There are serious reservations about the advisability and utility of this exercise of constructing HCI. There are major methodological weaknesses, besides substantial data gaps. For instance, for the schooling parameter, though quantity is assessed using enrolment rates reported by UNESCO, quality is gauged using harmonized test scores from major international student achievement testing programs. Due to lack of availability of an authoritative and uniform test score, about 9 different test scores and systems using varying methodology have been claimed to have been harmonized by the World Bank. None of the 9 systems cover more than 100 countries, with some have very limited regional coverage. This makes the methodology quite complex and non-uniform. For some countries, average national scores in a particular year and in some cases in selected cities or states have been used as predictors of education potential and future economic growth. As most nations have country-wide assessments of elementary education, which could have been used, this is not a reasonable approach. For India, the data for quality of education pertains to 2009 assessment by PISA, which was conducted for only two states, namely Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The methodology for harmonization is hugely suspect, the data quite dated and consequently the results quite non comparable. 

The use of PISA and TIMSS scores raises questions of possible conflict of interest as the methodology for testing is largely controlled by non UN agencies and is not globalized unlike the methodology of UNICEF and WHO that are used for health and survival indicators.  

The purpose of the Index has been stated to be to create political incentive for increased spending on health and education. Unfortunately, the indicators used for measured the Index are so slow moving that none can really be excited about setting out the programme of Index improvement.  Adult survival rates, stunting, and under 5 mortality are outcome indicators will change at a relatively slow rate as compared to process indicators used in computing  for example the Ease of Doing Business. 

Several key factors, on the other hand, seem to have been neglected. As against the variability of outcomes for similar levels on investment, it would be more useful to developing countries if the Index focused on enabling them to measure and improve the cost-effectiveness of their spending on health and education. Also, the differences in development outcomes arising from governance issues, political systems, socio-cultural context, and legacy issues have been totally ignored. The metric of HCI is too simplistic at one level and too ignorant of development realities at another. 

Analysed in the context of India, the HCI score for India does not reflect the key initiatives that are being taken for developing human capital in the country. The Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan has been launched to focus on access and quality of education for the benefit of 197 million school children. Through the Ayushman Bharat Programme, India has now launched the world’s largest Health Insurance initiative providing 500 million citizens with adequate health coverage, and transforming 150,000 Health Centres into Wellness Centres to provide comprehensive primary healthcare services. Sanitation coverage has expanded from 38% in 2014 to 83% in 2018 under the Swachh Bharat Mission. This has been made possible through the construction of over 72 million toilets and simultaneous societal reforms driven through strong political will. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana has reduced drudgery and improved the health of about 38 million women by providing them with LPG connection to replace firewood and coke based cooking stoves. In pursuing with the agenda of financial inclusion, the Pradhan Mantri Jandhan Yojana has provided access to formal banking services to over 328 million persons.  The share of account ownership among rural adults has more than doubled from 33% in 2011 to 79% in 2017, significantly bridging the rural-urban gap. Financial inclusion and the Aadhaar identification system has enabled India to make direct cash transfer of about US$ 64 billion to citizens, thus improving governance and social protection. 

These initiatives are transforming human capital in India at rapid pace and very comprehensively touching upon the lives of millions of people living in rural and tribal areas. The qualitative aspects of improved governance that have a strong correlation with human capital development cannot be and have not been captured by the way the HCI has been constructed. The gap in data and methodology overlook the initiatives taken by a country and, in turn, portray an incomplete and pre-determined picture. This infact makes the case for an adoption of the Index by more countries somewhat remote. The hasty introduction of the HCI by the World Bank may deny the larger Human Capital Project its due despite the lofty objectives of the latter. With the emphasis on country scores and rankings, the HCI could trivialize the importance of the Human Capital Project, which may in turn overshadow the critical issues discussed in the World Development Report on the changing nature of work. 

The Government of India, therefore, has decided to ignore the HCI and will continue to undertake its path breaking programme for human capital development aiming to rapidly transforming quality and ease of life for all its children.

                The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in its fourth bi-monthly statement, issued on 05.10.2018, on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, decided to keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.5 per cent. 

The GDP growth projection for 2018-19 is retained at 7.4 per cent as in the August resolution. The projections of inflation for 2018-19 and Q1:2019-20 have been revised downwards from the August resolution. 

The decision of the MPC is in consonance with the Government’s assessment of inflation and growth going forward and for achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent., while supporting growth.

The Government welcomes the MPC’s assessment and notes its decision to maintain the Policy Rate.

                Government of India and Asian Development Bank (ADB) today signed a $110 million loan to finance the upgrade of 2,800 kilometers all-weather rural roads in the State of Madhya Pradesh under the Prime Minister's Rural Roads Program (PMGSY).

 

Tranche 2 loan is part of the $500 million Second Rural Connectivity investment Program for India approved by the ADB Board in December 2017. The overall program is aimed at improving rural connectivity, facilitating safer and more efficient access to livelihood and socio-economic opportunities for rural communities through improvements to about 12,000 kilometers rural roads across the states of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. Tranche 1 loan of $250 million is currently under implementation in the 5 project states, upgrading over 6,000 km of rural roads.

 

The signatories to the Second Rural Connectivity lnvestment Programme were Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, who signed on behalf of the Government of India; and Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director of ADB's India Resident Mission, who signed for ADB.

 

""The tranche 2 of the project will provide continued assistance to the PMGSY by upgrading rural roads in Madhya Pradesh that will support the Government's long term goal to achieve inclusive economic growth in rural India. lt will give a big boost to the country’s rural connectivity initiative,"" said Mr. Khare after signing the loan agreement.

 

""The loan will improve mobility for self-employment and livelihood opportunities in rural areas by improving access to district centers,"" said Mr. Yokoyama. ""The project will continue to support the Government's drive for innovative approaches to reduce costs, conserve non-renewable natural resources, and promote the use of waste materials in rural road construction.""

 

ln view of increased rainfall and storm surges in Madhya Pradesh, the road designs take into account these climate risks with measures such as greater elevation of road embankments and slope protection. Women were extensively consulted during the project design and will gain some key benefits, including improved access to healthcare, livelihoods and schooling.

 

ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members---48 from the region. in 2017, ADB operations totalled $32.2 billion' including $11.9 billion in co-financing.

                The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of India signed a $100 Million Loan Agreement in New Delhi today to continue to expand sewerage and drainage coverage, provide sewage treatment and strengthen capacity of Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) for resilient urban services. 

The Third and Final Tranche Loan under the $400 Million Multi Tranche facility, Kolkata Environmental Improvement Investment Program, will target expansion of sewerage and drainage services in selected peripheral areas of KMC to at least 3,000 additional households and provide sewage treatment for at least 100,000 households. 

The signatories to the tranche 3 loan agreement were Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, who signed for Government of India; and Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director of ADB’s India Resident Mission, who signed for ADB.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr Khare said that the New Project will supplement the efforts made in the previous phases that aim to provide affordable access to water supply, sewerage and drainage services in Kolkata, and enhance quality and sustainability of urban service delivery through institutional reforms and capacity building.

Mr. Yokoyama said that the financing under Tranche 3 will be used to construct 43 km of additional sewer drain pipes, four pumping stations, 13 km of pumping mains, and three sewage treatment plants to improve sanitation service quality and climate resilience in selected areas of KMC.

The overall goal of the Kolkata Environmental Improvement Investment Program, approved in 2014, is to restore water production capacity to 1,478 million liters per day and ensure leaks on 700 kilometers of water pipes are repaired by 2023. It aims to install 170 kilometers of sewer-drain pipes and provide new sewerage connections to 27,000 homes, at least 15% of which will be vulnerable households or households headed by women. Installation of 40,000 water meters in pilot areas should help improve and sustain water management. Sub-projects under the previous two tranches are already helping achieve some of these outputs.

                Government of India and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) today signed $240 million loan for providing safe and sustainable drinking water to about 1.65 million people in three districts of the state of West Bengal affected by arsenic, fluoride, and salinity.

The signatories to the West Bengal Drinking Water Sector Improvement Project were Mr. Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary (Fund Bank and ADB), Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, who signed for the Government of India; and Mr. Kenichi Yokoyama, Country Director of ADB’s India Resident Mission, who signed for ADB.

Heavy reliance on groundwater puts most of the rural population in West Bengal at risk from arsenic and fluoride contamination that can lead to health problems including cancer and bone diseases. The project aims to mitigate these risks through provision of continuous potable water through metered connections to about 390,000 individual households in three districts – Bankura, North 24 Parganas, and Purba Medinipur.

“The project addresses the concerns relating to excessive use of groundwater to sustainable surface water based piped schemes,” said Mr. Khare. “This will help mitigate the health risks from using groundwater with elevated levels of arsenic and fluoride.”

Mr. Yokoyama said, “Besides reducing the burden of diseases from contaminated groundwater, the project will promote higher service levels compared with rural schemes in India with individual household connections and district metering area based metered continuous water supply, and use of advanced technology for smart water management.”

The project is supported by a grant of $3 million from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, financed by the Government of Japan, and a $2 million grant from ADB’s Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund. This will support the state government in strengthening its smart water management system, improve flood-related early warning and response, and provide training on operation and maintenance as well as climate change and disaster resilience.

ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members—48 from the region. In 2017, ADB operations totaled $32.2 billion, including $11.9 billion in cofinancing.

SIDBI will join to contribute to “the transformation mission” unleashed for these districts.  The campaign would be running parallelly from 3rd October to 8thOctober, 2018 across India. The campaign would create and strengthen cadre of more than 800 trainers to provide entrepreneurship training to the aspiring youths across these districts thus encouraging them to enter the admired segment of entrepreneurs. 

SIDBI has partnered with CSC e-Governance Services India Limited, a Special Purpose Vehicle, (CSC SPV) set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT, Govt. of India for implementing the campaign through their CSCs. The  objectives of the missionary campaign includes :- (i) to inspire rural youth in aspirational districts to be entrepreneurs by assisting them to set up their own enterprise, (ii) to imparttrainings through digital medium across the country, (iii) to create business opportunities forCSC VLEs,(iv)to focus on women aspirants in these aspirational districts to encourage women entrepreneurship and (v)to assist participants to become bankable and avail credit facility from banks to set up their own enterprise.

SIDBI is also taking-up with stakeholders including Banks, NABARD, NBFCs, SFBs, District Industries Centres, State Govt. etc. to be a part of this campaign and ensure mutlifold impact. Further, CSC Village Level entrepreneurs (VLEs) would play role of catalyst for these aspiring entrepreneurs. Apart from training, VLEs would also provide handholding support to the aspirants to establish new units by assisting them in availing loans for their enterprise and making them aware about various initiatives of Government of India like Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, SUI etc. and educate the youths in these districts on business literacy.  

Speaking about the campaign, Shri Mohammad Mustafa, IAS, CMD, SIDBI said “As the task of transforming ‘Aspirational Districts’ is challenging, SIDBI has taken a bold step by entering into these aspirational districts and working on ground level activities in these areas, to create livelihood and promote sustainable development. This is part of our programmatic approach to induce entrepreneurship as dream choice by turning job seekers as job creators. We are connecting different dots through policy advocacy initiatives of MSE Pulse & Crisidex, entrepreneurship series & campaigns, revamping digital aggregator portal, free access to project profiles and so on. Idea is to remove information asymmetry and make the youths in these ‘resource challenged’ districts to be ‘access rich’.”

                IL&FS, incorporated in 1987, is a large Systemically Important Non-Deposit Accepting Core Investment Company (CIC-ND-SI). It has numerous infrastructure assets and has played a major role in infrastructure development and financing in the country. It has 169 group companies, as in 2017-2018, including subsidiaries, joint venture companies and associate entities. A series of defaults by IL&FS Group companies in August and September, 2018 on term-deposits, short-term deposits, inter-corporate deposits, commercial paper and non-convertible debentures and the rating downgrades in some and default on some other financial instruments has resulted into massive effect in the financial markets causing redemption pressure on the mutual funds, which held such financial instruments and has also adversely impacted the sentiments on the stock markets, money markets and debt markets. The redemption pressure on mutual funds has created a large systemic risk leading to quality papers being sold at steep discounts to meet the redemption demand. The debt market shocks got transferred to the equity market sparking sell off particularly in NBFC stocks and sectors linked with NBFC financing. 

 

IL&FS Group, as per their latest Balance Sheet has infrastructure and financial assets exceeding Rs 115000 crore is presently facing tremendous debt pressure and struggling to service around Rs. 91000 crore in debt which is the outcome of its mismanaged borrowings in the past. The financial mismanagement of the IL&FS is apparent from its rapid debt built up and misrepresentation of true state of financial fragility, which is being reflected in unprecedented rating downgrade from highly rated to a default category.  Considering the capital base of the Group, the leverage is very high. The IL&FS Group is involved in many infrastructure projects including through equity and debt financing. Any impairment in its ability to finance and support the infrastructure projects would be quite damaging to the overall infrastructure sector, financial markets and the economy, considering its systemically important nature. The Government stands fully committed to ensure that needed liquidity is arranged for the IL& FS from the financial system so that no more defaults take place and the infrastructure projects are implemented smoothly. 

 

The IL&FS Group, especially its subsidiary companies, IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company Limited (IL&FS Engineering) and IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd. had got into major problems beginning 2012. This led to massive delays in execution of projects and a number of projects had become stalled infrastructure projects even before 2014. This affected their financial performance and significantly increased the leveraging as delayed projects were kept afloat by more and more debt financing. IL&FS Engineering had a series of losses beginning 2011-12 and minimal profit started after 2015-16. IL&FS Transportation Network Ltd. witnessed significant erosion of profit starting from 2012-13 and the net debt also increased more than two times from Rs. 13939 crore to Rs. 29961 crore in 2017-18. Deterioration in the financial performance and substantial leveraging of the IL&FS Group started many years ago on account of stalled projects in infrastructure sector largely owing to wrong decisions and policy paralysis before 2014.   

The restoration of confidence of the money, debt and capital markets, the banks and financial institutions in the credibility and financial solvency of the IL&FS Group is of utmost importance for the financial stability of capital and financial markets. There is an emergent need to immediately stop further financial defaults and also take measures to resolve defaulted dues to the claimants. This would require a combination of measures of asset sales, restructuring of some liabilities and fresh infusion of funds by the investors and lenders. The confidence of the financial market in the credibility of the IL& FS management and the company needs to be restored. There appears to be significant liquidity gap in the Company as estimated liabilities might not have any corresponding revenues / capital flows presently. In the circumstances, replacement of the existing management by the new management appeared to be most necessary and immediately required to be done for restoring that confidence and to avoid any suboptimal liquidation of assets.        

The Government, after analysing the emerging situation of the IL&FS Group come to the conclusion that the governance and management change in IL&FS Group is very necessary for saving the Group from financial collapse, which required an immediate change in the existing Board and management and appointment of a new management. Continuance of the present Board had become prejudicial to the interests of the company and its members and this management was affecting public interest because of its adverse impact on financial stability and making capital markets so adversely affected. Therefore, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) was approached today by the Government under section 241 read with 242 of the Companies Act, 2013 to order supersession of the present Board of Directors of the IL&FS and its substitution by the new Board of Directors. 

 

The Government was compelled to take this extraordinary step under section 241(2) of the Companies Act, 2013 to apply to the Tribunal for an order to prevent further mismanagement in order to protect public interest. The decision to supersede the existing board was taken after careful consideration of a report received from the Regional Director, Mumbai under the Ministry of Corporate, Affairs which clearly brought out serious corporate related deficiencies in the IL&FS holding company and its subsidiaries. It was noted that the consolidated financial statement of IL&FS holding company and its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures projected a picture through highly exaggerated depiction of non-current assets in the form of intangible assets amounting to over Rs. 20,000 crores. Besides, bulk of revenue was in the form of receivables, around 50%, which was locked up in litigation and arbitration. Added to this, there has been a sharp increase in bank deposits held in lien, which rose by Rs. 1,681.59 crores in FY 2017-18. Overall, the company has negative cash flows from operations. Further the net outflow was Rs. 7,020 crores in 2017-18. From August 2018 the company has been making repeated defaults. It has been noted that there is deep-rooted mismatch in the debt-equity ratio because of excessive leveraging, which has put a question mark in its ability to continue as a going concern if allowed to continue in the hands of the present management. The high debt stress was clearly visible in the company and its main subsidiaries for the last so many years, but was camouflaged by misrepresentation of facts. Besides, the fact that the company continued to pay dividends and huge managerial pay-outs regardless of looming liquidity crisis shows that the management had lost total credibility. There have also been serious complaints on some of the companies for which an SFIO investigation has been ordered into the affairs of IL&FS and its subsidiaries. 

 

The supersession of the existing Board and its replacement by a new Board of IL&FS is the necessary first step towards restoring the confidence of the financial market in the IL&FS Group. The Government is aware of the need to supplement this with several other measures which are required to be taken. Restoration of confidence of the financial market and to ensure solvency and orderly sale of the assets of the IL&FS Group would, inter alia, require time-bound sale of assets and realisation of receivables, fresh capital infusion, restructuring of business and ensuring continued access of the IL&FS Group to the financial market to meet its present and future financing needs. The Government is committed to ensuring the financial solvency of the IL&FS Group with a view to maintaining the financial stability in the country. Towards this end, the Government is committed to ensure that ILFS Group receive much needed temporary liquidity support.  It is hoped that financial institutions would be supportive for providing urgent liquidity. The Government would also take all necessary steps to ensure that the infrastructure and other productive sectors of the economy continue to get financial resources to maintain the growth momentum of the Indian Economy, the fastest growing economies in the world.

                “Multi sectoral action is a key to addressing social and environmental determinants and we have developed operational strategies to build a shared goal and vision between sectors such as Nutrition, Drinking Water and Sanitation, education, rural and urban development departments.” This was stated by Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare during his addresses at the ‘Second Plenary Session of ‘2nd International Conference on Primary Health Care (PHC) towards UHC & SDGs’, at Astana, Kazakhstan today. The Health Minister spoke on the theme: The Future of Primary Health Care. He further said that our progress in making improvements in maternal, child health and communicable diseases is largely due to our sustained focus on and investing in strengthening health systems for these services.”

Reiterating the commitment of the government, the Union Health Minister said that India has focused on improved and outreach and primary health care services and established referral linkages including transport and strengthened secondary care services, that has largely focused on maternal, new-born, nutrition, child health and communicable disease. Shri Nadda further said that this focus has yielded results, not just in terms of positive health indicators, particularly for those that are primary health care sensitive, but in a robust health systems platform that now gives us the confidence to move from selective to comprehensive primary health care services.

Shri Nadda stated that the government has recently launched the Ayushman Bharat- an initiative that is ambitious in scale and scope. Ayushman Bharat has two components: establishing about 1,50,000 Health and Wellness centres for the delivery of Comprehensive Primary Health care and the Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana which will address the needs of secondary and tertiary health care for nearly 40% of our population, he said.

Appreciating the front line functionaries, Shri Nadda said that Community Health workers and ASHAs continue to be vital to the success of Primary Health Care.  With re-articulated and re-clarified roles, empowered by skills and adequate payments, they are strengthening their embeddedness in the community, he added.

Speaking on new information and bio-technologies, Shri Nadda said that the role of biotechnology in public health has been used to good effect, particularly in primary health care. “The use of point of care diagnostics, which are gradually being made available at the Health and Wellness Centres, will enable providers to resolve more and refer less, thus improving continuum of care, reducing patient hardship, and consequent Out of Pocket Expenditure,”Shri Nadda added. He further elaborated that the Health Ministry currently have three common applications in use across the country at Health and Wellness Centers a remarkable feat, considering the size and diversity- an app for Reproductive Child Health (RCH), one for Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) and one for TB. Over time we will progress towards an interoperable Comprehensive Primary Health care application, he mentioned.

The Union Health Minister said that other digital Health IT initiatives include an Inter-operable Electronic Health Records (EHR) System, Patient Feedback System (MeraAspatal), Personal Health Record Management System (PHRMS), National Identification Number (NIN) for both public and private health facilities (it is an unique identification number for health facilities). Hospital Information System (HIS) is also being implemented for computerized registration and capturing EHR/ EMR of patients in Public Health facilities up to PHC level. Online Registration System (ORS) is a framework to link various hospitals for online registration and appointments, online diagnostic reports and enquiring availability of blood online, he added. “We are aiming at establishing an electronic database in all its districts by the year 2020, to reduce the burden of paper-based data collection, recording, and storage,” Shri Nadda stated.

                Smt Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare inaugurated a seminar on “Women’s Health Challenges, Access and Prevention” organised by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), here today. Speaking at the function, SmtAnupriya Patel stated that women are strong pillars of any vibrant society and sustained development of the country can be achieved only if we take holistic care of the women and children. Smt Anupriya Patel also released a report on Breast Cancer Landscape in Indiain the presence of Dr. Vinod Paul, Member, NITIAyog and Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health).

 

Speaking at the occasion, Smt Anupriya Patel stated that India has made considerable progress in the area of women's health. “Maternal mortality Ratio (MMR) is one such indicator which reflects this progress. India’s MMR in the last few years has declined at an accelerated pace to reach 130 per one lakh live births in 2014-16. This means we save more than 30 mothers every day,” she said.SmtAnupriya Patel further stated that under the National Health Mission a “continuum of care” approach is employed to ensure the best possible health outcomes for women throughout their reproductive life-cycle. “As a result of these interventions, institutional deliveries have risen to 78.9% and more importantly, institutional births in public facilities have increased from 18% to 52% under NHM. In the rural areas, the out of pocket expenditure for childbirth in public health facilities has also decreased,” she elaborated.

 

Reiterating the Government’s commitment to provide quality healthcare services, Smt Anupriya Patel saidthat quality of care is an area that requires greater attention. Recognizing this the Ministry of Health has launched 'LaQshya - Labour room Quality improvement Initiative' in 2017. LaQshya program is a focused and targeted approach to strengthen key processes related to the labour rooms and maternity operation theatres which aims at improving quality of care around birth and ensuring Respectful Maternity Care, she added.The Minister further said that with the launch of Ayushman Bharat, interventions to address issues of women's health will be further strengthened and made women-centric. 

 

Dr Vinod Paul, Member, NITI Aayog said that efforts to reduce MMR have to be doubled and initiatives such as Ayushman Bharat will help towards this. He emphasized on the need for research linked to screening, referral services and further treatment and said that models of healthcare ought to lead to better outcomes.

Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (Health) said that women’s health has received attention in a ‘continuum of care’ framework along with interventions such as ‘BetiBachao, BetiPadhao’. She added that empowerment of women and their health are very closely related and the rise in institutional deliveries through Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) and Janani SurakshaYojana (JSY) are providing healthcare services to encourage this. She further elaborated on the comprehensive primary healthcare services being provided under Ayushman Bharat which provide screening for many ailments, and women are now being screened for common cancers such as breast, cervical and oral cancers.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the increase in supervisory visit charges for ASHA Facilitators from Rs. 250/-per visit to Rs. 300/- per visit for 2018-2019 to 2019- 2020 w.e.f from October 2018 (to be paid in November, 2018). ASHA Facilitator will undertake about 20 supervisory visits per month. With the proposed increase, ASHA Facilitators would receive about Rs 6000 per month against Rs 5000 per month that is an increase of Rs 1000/- per month.

Details:


	Enrolment of ASHA facilitators under Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana as part of ASHA Benefit package.
	To motivate ASHA facilitators to perform better, the supervisory visit charges for ASHA Facilitators has been increased from Rs. 250/-per visit to Rs. 300/- per visit w.e.f from October 2018 (to be paid in November, 2018). 
	With the approved increase, ASHA Facilitators would receive about Rs 6000 per month against Rs 5000 per month, that is an increase of Rs 1000/- per month.


The existing institutional mechanisms for the National Health Mission (NHM) would be utilised to implement the decision.

The proposal entails an estimated additional expenditure of Rs.46.95 crore comprising of Rs 15.65 crore during 2018-19 (for six months) and Rs.31.30 crore during 2019-20 as central share.

Benefits:


	41,405  ASHA facilitators 
	This is in addition to the following benefits extended by earlier Cabinet Decision on 19.9.2018:



	Coverage of 10, 63, 670 ASHAs and ASHA Facilitators  under Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana.
	Increase in routine and recurring incentives from Rs 1000/- per month to Rs 2000/- per month to benefit 10, 22,265 ASHAs.
	Increase in honorarium for nearly 27,00,000 Anganwadi Workers/ Anganwadi Helpers


 

This will be implemented as part of ASHA Benefit Package approved in September, 2018.

Background:


	As part of support mechanism, an ASHA facilitator is in place for between 10 to 25 ASHAs, to provide handholding and mentoring support, and monitor performance. She is a critical link of the support structure network. Substantial progress has been made by states in setting up support structures during the last three years, as states have increasingly become cognizant of the correlation between strong support structures and an effective ASHA programme. The ASHA facilitators are generally selected from amongst the ASHAs themselves. This position also serves as a career opportunity for ASHAs with the requisite qualifications, experience and aptitude. 
	All states except Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala, Nagaland, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, West Bengal, Rajasthan and UTs have selected ASHA Facilitators.  In these states, on-the- job mentoring support to ASHAs is provided by ANMs or, as in the case of West Bengal, by the Supervisor appointed by the Gram Panchayat or PHC supervisors at PHC level, as in the case of Rajasthan.  Over half of the states (11 out of 19) that have ASHA Facilitators, have selected them from amongst a cluster of ASHAs, provided they meet all the selection criteria. These include states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Karnataka, Punjab and Sikkim. In other states, preference is given to ASHAs in selection of ASHA facilitators.Maharashtra, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and Gujarat. Goa does not have ASHAs.
	ASHA Facilitator undertakes about 20 supervisory visits per month.
	The role of ASHA Facilitators is broadly summarized as under:



	Conduct village visits (comprising of accompanying ASHA on household visits, conducting community/VHSNC meetings, attending Village Health and Nutrition Days). 
	Conduct cluster meetings of all ASHAs in the area once a month. 
	Enable ASHAs in reaching the most marginalized households.
	Support ASHA training at the block level.
	Facilitate selection of new ASHAs. 
	Facilitate grievance redressal. 



	Subsequent to the Cabinet approval, representations were received from ASHA Facilitators seeking increase in the supervisory visit charges. While the benefit of Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana was also provided to ASHA facilitators, ASHA Facilitators have been representing that their supervisory visit charges may also be enhanced which will motivate them to perform better.

                The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,in collaboration with Ministry of Women and Child Development, organized a one-day National Workshop for Orientation of District Officials of Aspirational Districts on Health and Nutrition, here today. The workshop was inaugurated by ShriAshwini Kumar Choubey and SmtAnupriya Patel, Ministers of State for Health and Family Welfare. At the function, the State Health Ministers unveiled the Operational Guidelines on Aspirational Districts for Health and Nutrition and launchedthe e-MitraMobile Application.Speaking at the event,ShriChoubeystated that most of the developmental gains for the country will come from aspirational districts. Therefore, to achieve equity and accelerated improvements in human development indicators, the Government has focused its energy on these districts, he said.

Dr. Vinod Paul, Member, NITI Ayog, ShriRakeshSrivastava, Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ms. Preeti Sudan, Secretary (HFW) were also present at the inaugural function.

In his address, ShriChoubeyfurther stated that this is a first of its kind initiative by identifying 117 districts under the ‘Aspirational Districts’ Programmewith an aim to quickly and effectively transform them. He added that India has made great progress in the context of health indicators and have practically achieved MDG targets. “The decline in Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) has been the highest since the last several decades which has declined by 37 points from 167/ lakh live births in 2011-13 to 130/ lakh live births in 2014-16 within a span of just three years. This accounts for an impressive 22% reduction in MMR since 2013,” he said.

Addressing the participants, SmtAnupriya Patel said that the Government is committed to achieving the goals of the National Health Policy 2017, and of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, “We have achieved impressive results in terms of accessibility and quality of services which resulted in reduced deaths of mothers, newborns and children, and improved health outcomes overall,” she said. 

SmtAnupriya Patel further said that in order to address the disparities, which are largely located in pockets within states, the Government has identified 117 Aspirational Districts. “It is expected that sustained and intensive efforts in programme implementation, monitoring and support will improve health and nutrition indicators and ensure that all people have equal access to high quality health care,” she elaborated.The Hon’ble Prime Minister of India has coined the nomenclature of Aspirational Districts, thereby affirming a commitment to improvement in key indicators of these districts, so as to achieve the vision of a New India by 2022, she said.

Dr V K Paul, Member, NITI Ayog, said that there is a profound responsibility as Aspirational Districtsrepresent 20% of the geographical area and 20% of the population of the country. He stressed on the need for making more interventions in these districts and said that we require people’s movement so that we can reach out to the people and deliver required services at the ground.MsPreeti Sudan highlighted the importance of convergence at all the levels. She laid stress on sanitation and said that it is non-negotiable for achieving the health outcomes.  

117 districts have been identified for rapid transformation and inclusive growth. The Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A) program is an important pillar which will be strengthened under Aspirational Districts Programme.

The operational guidelines on Aspirational Districts will provide a framework for implementing action to be undertaken for various health initiatives to guide the state, district, block programme officers and other stakeholders in organizing various activities expected to meet the vision for health by leveraging health and nutrition initiatives to bring transformation in the lives of people and meet their aspirations to be healthy.

The e-Mitra (Mobile Integrated Toolkit RMNCH+A ) app has been designed to complement the Aspirational District Programme and offers one stop solution to access RMNCH+A related statistics from different sources through a combination of approaches. 

The workshop is attended by the senior officers from the Ministry of Health, MoWCD and NHSRC along with the representatives from 28 States, 117 Aspirational District Official and development partners like WHO, UNICEF, USAID, BMGF, TATA Trust and UNFPA etc., and civil society organizations.

                Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare released an Analytical Report of the National Health Profile-2018 prepared by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI), under the aegis of the Directorate General of Health Services at Patna, today. The National Health Profile covers demographic, socio-economic, health status and health finance indicators, along with comprehensive information on health infrastructure and human resources in health. CBHI has been publishing National Health Profile every year since 2005. This is the 12th edition.

In his address, Shri Choubey said that the e-book of NHP-2015 is a step towards realizing Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of Digital India where digital documents give us an opportunity for wider dissemination of information.

Shri Choubey further stated the inevitable need of evidence based planning on the launch of the National Health Resource Repository (NHRR) - country’s first ever national healthcare facility registry of authentic, standardized and updated geo-spatial data of all public & private healthcare establishments.  

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Sanjeeva Kumar Addl. Secretary (Health) stated that data is not only important for understanding the health indicators of the country, but it also provides an opportunity to monitor the situation. He said that the Analytical Report of National Health Profile – 2018 indicates that significant progress has been made in the country for various health outcomes, which is an encouraging sign.

The vision of the NHRR project is to strengthen evidence-based decision making and develop a platform for citizen and provider-centric services by creating a robust, standardized and secured IT-enabled repository of India’s healthcare resources. Shri Ashvini Kumar Choubey, congratulated and appreciated the CBHI team for their initiatives regarding use of geo-mapping

NHRR will be the ultimate platform for comprehensive information of both, Private and Public healthcare establishments including Railways, ESIC, Defense and Petroleum healthcare establishments. 

Under the Collection of Statistics Act 2008, over 20 lakh healthcare establishments like hospitals, doctors, clinics, diagnostic labs, pharmacies and nursing homes would be enumerated under this census capturing data on over 1400 variables. 

The Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI) has actively engaged with key stakeholders including leading Associations, Allied Ministries, and several private healthcare service providers. This resource repository shall enable advanced research towards ongoing & forthcoming healthcare challenges arising from other determinants of health like - disease, environment, etc. 

Approximately 4,000 trained professionals are religiously working to approach every healthcare establishment for information collection. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the project technology partner adhering to paramount Data Security.

NHRR will cohesively work with Ayushman Bharat - National Health Protection Mission (AB-NHPM) and Central TB Division (CTD) on an integrated plan for the larger benefit of ensuing Hospital empanelment and private sector engagement.

This web based database of healthcare resources with visualization will immensely support the healthcare policy makers to enable evidence based decision making to strengthen the Indian health system.

The NHRR project involves conducting a national census for all public and private healthcare facilities including hospitals, doctors, clinics, blood banks, pharmacies, diagnostic labs etc. The aim of the project is to develop a comprehensive platform for over 25 lakh healthcare establishments. The platform will be very useful for all key stakeholders – government, private health establishments and the public.

Each healthcare establishment shall be visited by field operational teams from IQVIA Consulting & Information Services India Pvt Ltd (formerly IMS Health) – the implementation partner for nationwide data collection, management & implementation of the NHRR project. All healthcare establishments are requested to extend full co-operation and furnish accurate information to the field enumerators. The information collected in the national census will be kept confidential and shall be used for statistical purposes only. 

The key expected outcomes of the NHRR project are to provide comprehensive data on all health resources including private doctors, health facilities, chemists, and diagnostics labs, establish a National Health Resource Repository for evidence based decision making – aligned with Digital India mission. It shall also enhance the coordination between central and state government for optimization of health resources, making ‘live’ and realistic state PIPs and improving accessibility of data at all levels, including State HODs, thus, decentralize the decision making at district and state level.

Some key benefits of the NHRR project are to create a reliable, unified registry of country’s healthcare resources showing the distribution pattern of health facilities and services between cities and rural areas. Additionally, it shall generate real-world intelligence to identify gaps in health and service ratios, and ensure judicious health resource allocation and management. It shall identify key areas of improvement by upgrading existing health facilities or establishing new health facilities keeping in view the population density, geographic nature, health condition, distance, etc. The result shall be enhanced center and state government coordination to ensure intelligent use of health resources to ensure superior health access, service delivery and improve transparency & accountability for effective centre-to-state funding. The project shall improve the visibility of Private providers to enable Public-Private Partnerships. It shall also provide access to information on health service providers to the citizen of India for improved health outcomes and enable mass outreach with all stakeholders such as hospitals, laboratories, private & public doctors, blood banks, pharmacies, etc.

The progress of the Data Collection of NHRR Census for the State of Bihar were also reviewed before the Hon’ble State Minister where it was stated that data collection in 13 District have completed and remaining 25 districts supposed to be completed by end of November, 2018.

                Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare today reviewed the preparednessfor the up-coming rounds ofMission Indradhanush (MI) with the Health Ministers and Principal Secretaries of 17 States/UTs through video conferencing. During the review interaction, ShriNaddaissued clear directions and assured all support to the States for achieving targets of full immunization under Mission Indradhanush. He exhorted them to leave no stone unturned to ensure that the left out and missed out children and pregnant women of the routine immunization program in the country are provided full protection under this initiative. “We are fully confident to achieve the ambitious target of 90% full immunization coverage in the country as set by Hon’ble Prime Minister, ShriNarendraModiJi”, he said.

Three rounds of immunization drives, of seven working days each (excluding Routine Immunization Days, Sundays and Holidays) are planned in the 75 districts. The 1st round will be from 22nd October 2018, the 2nd round will be from 22nd November 2018 and the 3rd round will be from 22nd December 2018 onward.

ShriNadda stated that special focus should be given on identification of unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children and pregnant women in high-risk, hard-to-reach areas like hamlets, brick kilns, tribal areas, forest areas, construction sites, migrant settlements, vacant sub-centres, urban slums etc. He further said that head-count survey by ASHAs and Anganwadi workers should be undertaken to cover all such areas and a sample verification of survey should be done by ANMs/Supervisors.

Stressing on the need for need-based plans, the Union Health Minister said that microplans should be prepared on the basis of estimated number of beneficiaries (through head-count survey) and distances from cold chain points. “Mobile teams to be used wherever required and mobility support to be provided to ANMs deployed to cover vacant sub-centres,” he added. He also laid emphasis on awareness generation activities and said that the focus of IEC activities should be on increasing awareness on benefits of immunization and alleviating apprehensions of ‘Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)’. Emphasis should be on mid-media and inter-personal communication (IPC) activities like mothers’ meeting, rallies, street-plays, wall paintings etc., he said.

He also emphasised on the need for regular review of planning and implementation of all three rounds of MI should be done in State and District Task Force Meetings to identify gaps in implementation and their resolution in a de-centralized manner.

Mission Indradhanush (MI) is one of the flagship schemes of Government of India that aims at achieving full immunization coverage (FIC) of 90% by December’18 through focus on unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children and pregnant women in pockets of low immunization coverage, high-risk and hard-to-reach areas.

A total of five phases of Mission Indradhanush have been completed between April 2015 and February 2018 covering 537 districts. It has also been included as one of the schemes under Gram SwarajAbhiyan (GSA) and Extended GSA during April 2018 to September 2018 covering 16,850 and 48,929 villages (in 117 aspirational districts) respectively.Till 5th October 2018, a total of 334.48 lakh children and 86.04 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated through these drives.A survey conducted in 190 districts/urban areas covered in Intensified Mission Indradhanush (5th phase of MI) have shown an average increase of 18.5% points in Full Immunisation Coverage as compared to NFHS-4.

                Recently there are rumors being spread stating not to give polio drops to children upto 5 years as some virus has been found in them.

This rumour was spread in response to some reports in sections of media that bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine supplied by a particular company were found “not of standard quality”. 

Use of bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine manufactured by this particular manufacturer has been stopped in the programme. All the stocks of the said manufacturer have been withdrawn. 

There are other bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine manufacturers who have also been providing the polio vaccine. The polio vaccines supplied by these other manufacturers have been tested and conform to all the recommended standards. In order to ensure that children receive safe and effective vaccines, the vaccines from these manufacturers are being used under the programme. 

Polio vaccines are absolutely safe and have saved millions of children from disabling effects of polio. All parents must get their children vaccinated against polio to provide protection against polio.  Government of India in consultation with WHO has taken all measures to ensure that all vaccines used under the programme are totally safe and effective.    

India continues to be polio-free since for past more than 7 years. However, since polio cases are still occurring in a few neighboring countries, India needs to maintain population immunity against polio to mitigate risk of importation. Government of India is providing Inactivated Polio Vaccine in addition to the bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine under its Universal Immunization Programme to provide double protection against polio.

                There have been reports in a section of the print media mentioning that bivalent oral polio vaccine supplied by a particular manufacturer had some quality issues. 

India was certified polio-free in March 2014 and continues to be so. India continues to remain vigilant against all three types of polioviruses. The last polio case due to wild poliovirus in the country was detected on 13 January 2011. 

India has continued WHO engagement to support India maintain international quality surveillance for poliovirus detection in the country. As part of intensive surveillance, sewage samples are collected from 45 sites and tested for poliovirus in eight accredited polio laboratories in the country. This is in addition to stool samples collected from all individuals that report sudden onset of paralysis or other polio like symptoms. Every year nearly 80000 stool samples are collected and tested in polio laboratories in India.

It may be remembered that the decision to switch to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (bOPV) from trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (tOPV) in all polio campaigns and routine immunization in India and elsewhere from April 2016 was taken following certification of global eradication of type 2 wild poliovirus. In India, the last Type 2 wild polio virus case was detected in the year 1999. The tOPV that was used till April 2016 contained three types of poliovirus vaccines (P1, P2 and P3) and protected against all three types of wild polioviruses – type 1, type 2 and type 3, while bOPV contains two types of poliovirus vaccines (P1 and P3) and protects against type 1 and type 3 wild polioviruses. Type 2 component from oral polio vaccine was removed as a part of global polio end game strategy. 

As a part of efforts to maintain high immunity against all polioviruses, India provides inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and bOPV to all infants across the country under routine immunization. To ensure vaccination of all children, effective campaigns have been undertaken. Further, as per the advice of the India Expert Advisory Group, India continues to conduct mass vaccination campaigns against polio, using bOPV to maintain high immunity against polio. Two nationwide and one sub-national pulse polio campaign have already been conducted in 2018. 

Recently, type 2 polio vaccine virus was found in some sewage and stool samples. The detection of type 2 vaccine virus indicates that a very robust polio surveillance jointly managed by MoHFW and WHO is still maintained even after 7 years have elapsed since last wild poliovirus case in the country was reported. This detection indicated the use of a type 2 poliovirus containing vaccine, despite the fact that tOPV that contained type 2 poliovirus vaccine had been phased out globally, and in India, in April 2016, as a part of the Polio End Game strategy. 

On investigation, it was found that in a few vials of bOPV supplied by one manufacturer, there were traces of P2 vaccine. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare taking WHO on board took immediate and comprehensive action. Following the report, the use of all the vaccine supplied by this manufacturer was immediately stopped in the country till investigation was completed. Additional legal samples of bOPV were immediately sent for testing to the Central Drug Laboratory in Kasauli, which confirmed the previous report of presence of traces of P2 polio vaccine virus. The Drugs Controller General of India immediately filed an FIR and issued notice to the company asking it to stop manufacturing and supplying till further orders. The MD of the company was immediately arrested. 

Type 2 polio vaccine virus traces which have been found in bOPV vials is the attenuated (weakened) poliovirus and does not cause paralysis and was also earlier used in tOPV till April 2016. The recipients of such vaccine will usually shed the vaccine virus through fecal route for about 4-6 weeks after which it will die down.   In small areas where such vials were used, polio surveillance in environment and through stool collection has been significantly enhanced by MoHFW, with support from WHO and partners to keep constant vigil on the shedding of the polio vaccine virus. To enhance immunity against type 2 poliovirus further, special mop up rounds for administering IPV are being conducted in the specified areas to reach out to such children who may have missed IPV. This would provide immunity to all the children against all the three types of polio virus including Type 2.  

In view of high routine immunization coverage being achieved in India and administration of tOPV till 2016, our population level immunity against all three types of virus is very high. This fact was acknowledged and appreciated in recently conducted India Expert Advisory Group on Polio which comprises of international and national experts. India has also made remarkable progress under Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan

In light of all the above facts and measures taken, the risk of any child getting vaccine derived polio disease is practically nil.  

Sufficient polio vaccine from alternate sources is available in the programme to implement Routine Immunization (RI) and Pulse Polio Immunization (PPI) and maintain the immunity against polio-viruses. 

No sample has tested positive for wild poliovirus in sewage or AFP cases since 2011. The country remains polio-free and this status has been maintained for more than seven years since the last wild poliovirus case in the country was reported in January 2011. No child has been infected with wild poliovirus as reported in some sections of the media.

A team of MoHFW, DCGI, ICMR and WHO is continuously monitoring the situation. Government of India is committed as always to ensure that all vaccines used in the programme are safe and effective.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is conducting a basic training programme at the Swami Vivekanand Airport in Raipur today. The five-day training programme, aimed at enhancing the preparedness of Airport Emergency Handlers (AEHs) to respond to CBRN emergencies at the airports.

CBRN emergencies pertain to threats emanating due to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear material. The training programme is being conducted in collaboration with the Airport Authority of India (AAI), Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

Handling CBRN emergencies need specialised skills and efforts. In fact, even a small CBRN related event can cause panic among people at the airports. This training programme will improve the CBRN safety at our airports by enabling the AEHs to handle any CBRN emergency.

The programme consists of lectures as well as field training, including live demonstrations of detection and decontamination including use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Besides equipping the AEHs to handle CBRN emergencies, the training programme will also enable them to provide medical first aid and initial psycho-social support. 

Experts from stakeholder departments such as Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), INMAS, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and Haryana Institute of Public Administration (HIPA) will train the participants. A team of third BN NDRF from Mundali, Odhisa, especially trained on CBRN Emergency Management, is camping at Raipur during the training period.

A total of 45 participants representing various agencies responsible for operation and maintenance of the airport will be trained on various aspects of CBRN emergencies. Another 150 working level staff will be sensitized on the subject in a half day module.

This is the ninth in a series of such programmes being conducted at airports across the country to enable AEHs to respond suitably till the arrival of specialised response teams. Eight batches have already been trained - one each in Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Varanasi, Patna, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Chandigarh.

                The Government today constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) to examine the existing legal and institutional frameworks for dealing with matters of sexual harassment of women at the workplace.  The GoM will recommend action required for effective implementation of the existing provisions, as well as for strengthening the existing legal and institutional frameworks for addressing issues related to sexual harassment at workplace.

The Group of Ministers has been constituted in view of the felt need for broader consultation on this issue, from the point of view of developing appropriate recommendations and laying down a comprehensive plan of action and for ensuring its time bound implementation.

The Group of Ministers will be chaired by the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh.  Its Members are:

 


	Shri Nitin Gadkari, Minister, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, and Ministry of Shipping.
	Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister, Ministry of Defence.
	Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Minister, Ministry of Women & Child Development


 

The Government is committed to ensure the safety and dignity of women in the workforce. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act is the key legislation for preventing and protecting women against sexual harassment in the workplace and to ensure effective redressal of complaints of sexual harassment. 

 

The Ministry of Women & Child Development has also launched an Electronic Complaints Box that enables women, irrespective of their work status, to raise their voice against sexual harassment at workplace. Once a complaint is submitted to the ‘SHe-Box’, it is directly sent to the concerned authority having jurisdiction to take action into the matter.  A mechanism will be put in place to regularly monitor the action taken on the complaints.           

The Group of Ministers will, within 3 months of its constitution, examine the existing provisions for the safety of women, including those mentioned above, and recommend further measures required to strengthen and make them more effective.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh visited Jammu and Kashmir today to review the security situation and takes stock of  the important developmental initiatives in the state. He addressed a press conference at Srinagar, later on. Addressing the media at Nehru Guest House, Shri Singh congratulated the State government for successfully conducting the Urban Local Body elections in a free and fair manner without any untoward incidents of violence during polls across the state. He informed the media about the discussions that were held during the day about the upcoming Panchayat elections in the state.

Earlier during the day, the Union Home Minister chaired the security review meeting on the security situation in the state and also met the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri Satyapal Malik. He also met a number of delegations across the political spectrum and appealed them to ensure maximum participation in the upcoming Panchayat elections to strengthen the grassroot democratic setup and to ensure accountability. Local bodies are also being vested with significantly enhanced devolution of powers in line with best practices in the country. This will enable them to address most of the local issues in their jurisdictions, he added.

Appealing the masses to come forward, he said that the democratic way is the only solution by which we can mitigate big problems and resolve serious issues. Highlighting a major shift that has been observed in the last 4 months in view of the security scenario of the state, Shri Singh said that there has been a decrease in the number of Stone pelting incidents. Also, there is a decline in the rate of militant recruitment in the State. He talked about the special employment initiatives that are being worked upon by the central government through which 2.5 lakh youth will get employment.   

Union Home Minister said that presently India is recognized as world’s fastest growing economy and anti-national powers are attempting to create hurdles in order to destabilize the country. Jammu and Kashmir is yet to catch the development bandwagon. The Central and State governments are working hard towards development of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh regions. It is our aim to make Jammu & Kashmir a developed state, he further said.

To curb the problem of rampant corruption in the state, a major initiative will be announced shortly.  

Terming the deaths of civilians that took place in an explosion after encounter in Kulgam, Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh expressed his regret over the loss of lives and extended his condolences towards the families of the deceased and announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the families. He appealed the civilians not to visit encounter sites shortly after the operations.

Shri Singh also informed that road connectivity will be taken up for Kargil, Dras, Gurez and Keran. DPRs has been sought for the same.

                The National Police Memorial (NPM) will be dedicated to the nation by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi tomorrow in recognition of the supreme sacrifice made by police personnel since independence.

October 21 is observed as the Police Commemoration Day every year in memory of the policemen killed at Hot Springs in Ladakh by Chinese troops on this date in 1959.

The memorial has been erected on 6.12 acres of land in Chanakyapuri, at the northern end of Shanti Path.

This Police Memorial represents all State/UT Police Forces and Central Police Organizations of the country.

Since 1947, 34,844 police personnel have been martyred, with 424 losing their lives this year. Many of these brave lives were lost in the fight against terrorism (referred to as militancy and insurgency in some theatres) in various geographical regions such as Kashmir, Punjab, Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and LWE-affected regions of the country.

Further, a large number of police lives were lost in prevention of crime and in maintenance of law and order.

The central sculpture of the NPM is a 30 feet monolith made of a single piece of granite, weighing 238 tonnes. Its weight and colour symbolise the gravitas and solemnity of the supreme sacrifice. A 60 foot long river at the base of the sculpture reflects the continuous self-service of the policeman and woman, to maintain peace and public order.

The Wall of Valour has the names of all 34,844 martyrs engraved on granite.

A Police Museum will also be dedicated to the nation. It contains artefacts and points of time that shaped the history of the Indian police.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has called upon the security forces to be on the alert as terrorists are adopting new tactics. Addressing the 34th Raising Day event of National Security Guard (NSG) at Manesar, Gurugram today, he said terrorists are using social media for publicity and vehicles to run over people in crowded public places. Keeping up with the challenges, the NSG is upgrading its skills and techniques, he added.

The Union Home Minister said our government has strengthened security. He added, “In the last four and half years there was no big terrorist attack in the hinterland of the country largely due to the alertness of our security forces. Barring Jammu and Kashmir, our security forces have succeeded in preventing terrorist attacks in the rest of the country”.

Shri Rajnath Singh said, “we have seen best coordination among security forces in Jammu & Kashmir resulting in successful security operations. We have decided to deploy one unit of NSG in Jammu & Kashmir”. 

In order to reduce response time, Shri Rajnath Singh said that regional hubs of NSG are being set up. Recently one such hub was inaugurated in Hyderabad. However, first respondent in any terrorist attack should be the State Police, he added.

Shri Rajnath Singh said the government is fully supporting the security forces and has taken several measures for their welfare such as in recruitment and promotion of Constables. We are also concerned about families of martyrs and have taken measures to ensure adequate monetary support, he said. 

Terming the NSG as our “Sudarshan Chakra” against terrorists, the Union Home Minister said it is comparable to any international force of its kind. “It's not only better than rest but better than the best. In 34 years since its inception, NSG secured a solid place for itself in the security grid of the nation. NSG has become a specialized force with multi-dimensional roles- in counter terrorism, anti-hijacking and close protection operations. NSG has fulfilled all tasks entrusted to it with full dedication. People of our country have developed enormous trust in NSG while the enemies are scared of its capabilities,” he said.

The Union Home Minister later launched the newly created website and Twitter handle of NSG. He also presented awards and commendations to the Security Forces personnel and their families.

On the occasion, NSG commandos gave a display of their prowess by conducting demonstrations in counter-terrorist operations using drones, amphibious assaults, canine units and air-dropping of Special Units. Directors General of CAPFs, former DGs of NSG and senior officers of MHA and CAPFs were present.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi addressed the Silver Jubilee Foundation Day function of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) here today.

He said that in the last two and a half decades, NHRC has contributed to nation building, by becoming the voice of the deprived and the oppressed. He said that the protection of human rights has been an important part of our culture. He said that after independence, elements such as an independent and impartial judiciary, an active media, an active civil society and organizations such as NHRC are in place to protect human rights.

The Prime Minister said that human rights should not be merely a slogan, but also a part of our ethos. He said that in the last four years or so, a lot of serious efforts have been made to improve the quality of life of the poor. He said that the Government’s focus has been to ensure that all Indians have access to the basic needs of human beings. He said that the construction of more than 9 crore toilets, has ensured sanitation and a life of dignity for crores of poor people. He also mentioned the recently launched health assurance initiative – PMJAY – under Ayushman Bharat. He also spoke of the financial inclusion initiatives of the Union Government. He said that the law which provides relief to Muslim women from triple talaq, is also part of this series of steps taken to ensure basic rights for people.

The Prime Minister mentioned steps taken to improve ease of access to justice, such as increasing the number of e-courts, and strengthening of the National Judicial Data Grid. He described Aadhaar as a technology-based empowerment initiative.

In his address, the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh said the NHRC since its inception 25 years ago has achieved many milestones and secured a place for itself in the institutional framework of the country. 

He asserted that human rights have been ingrained in the traditional ethos of India. “In our country, we pray for the welfare of all, wish good for all and desire no harm for anyone. India is the first country in the world to have considered not only human rights but also took care of animal rights. Requirement for a Human Rights Charter was not felt because it is in the basic character of India.”

Shri Rajnath Singh said, “I believe there is no place for inhuman actions in the name of strict action. But it is also my firm belief that actions taken in the national and societal interest should not be seen from the viewpoint of human rights violation.”

“On many occasions, some people express concern over the human rights of criminals/terrorists. I want to ask when such a criminal/terrorist not only violates the human rights of others but also takes away their right to live, in such a situation how we can raise the issue of human rights of such a criminal/terrorist,” he added.

The Union Home Minister said human rights should be seen in proper perspective. “Human rights means everyone has a right to dignified life. In this direction, our government has implemented many significant schemes for the benefit of crores of people and provided them food, housing, health and education for girl children,” he said.

Shri Rajnath Singh said action against illegal immigrants into India should not be seen from the point of view of human rights. “There was no inhuman behaviour towards them. I am happy to note that the Supreme Court’s recent decision was in favour of deportation of seven Rohingyas,” he said. 

Union Home Minister said India is a secular state and human rights are not based on religion. He also emphasized on the importance of women’s safety.

In his welcome address, the NHRC Chairperson, Shri HL Dattu said the phenomenal increase in the number of complaints received by the NHRC each year reflects the extent of its reach across the country. The NHRC Secretary General Shri Ambuj Sharma also spoke on the occasion.

On the occasion a commemorative postal stamp and cover marking silver jubilee of the NHRC was released by the Prime Minister. He also launched the new version of the NHRC website.

The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Communications, Shri Manoj Sinha was among the dignitaries present during the function. NHRC Members Shri Justice PC Ghose and Smt. Jyotika Kalra and former Chairpersons and Members besides senior officers of NHRC attended the function.

                The National Human Rights Commission, NHRC, India is completing 25 years of its existence with its 26th Foundation Day tomorrow, October 12, 2018. The Commission was set up on the 12th October, 1993 under the Protection of Human Rights Act, passed by Parliament.

                Cabinet Secretary Shri PK Sinha chaired a meeting of the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) here today to take stock of preparatory measures in the wake of impending landfall of the cyclonic storm “TITLI” along the coast between Orissa and north Andhra Pradesh by Thursday Morning.

Indian Meteorological Department classified ‘TITLI’ as a very severe cyclonic storm with very high wind speeds and it is forecast to hit the coast between Gopalpur and Kalingapatnam in Orissa between 6AM-9AM on October 11, 2018. The wind speed at the time of landfall is predicted in the range of 145-165 km per hour.

The meeting was attended by the senior officer from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Defence, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Integrated Defence Staff (IDS). The States of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal participated over video conference represented by the respective Chief Secretaries/ Additional Chief Secretaries. 

The States informed about measures taken for evacuation of people from the vulnerable areas to safer places, issue of warnings to the fishermen not to venture out into the sea and stocking of adequate food, essential items and fuel supplies, as also preventive measures such as closure of schools and colleges. District and local officials have been alerted.

NDRF has deployed 14 teams in Orissa, 4 teams in Andhra and 3 teams in West Bengal along with necessary rescue equipments. Additional teams have been put on standby in the respective areas likely to be affected. In addition, the three states have deployed their own rescue teams along with power boats. Army, Navy and coastguard have also been put on standby so that they can be deployed at short notice as per requirement.

Cabinet Secretary underlined the need for storage of adequate food, fuel as well as maintaining power supply and telecommunication lines and suggested that the States take advance action in this regard. He assured Centre’s full support to the three states.

After the landfall, the cyclonic storm is expected to re-curve north-eastwards and move long Odisha coast towards Gangetic West Bengal and will cause heavy to very heavy rainfall.

                Ministry of Home Affairs has issued a clarification to the Government of  Assam on the citizenship status of members of the Gorkha Community living in the State as per the Foreigners Act, 1946. This followed a representation from the All Assam Gorkha Students’ Union to the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh recently as some cases of members of Gorkha community living in Assam were referred to the Foreigners Tribunals.

In a communication to the Government of Assam, MHA has listed various provisions to obviate the difficulties faced by Gorkhas in the matter of Indian citizenship. The letter dated 24th September, 2018 stated that the members of the Gorkha community who were Indian citizens at the time of commencement of the Constitution, or those who are Indian citizens by birth, or those who have acquired Indian citizenship by registration or naturalization in accordance with the provisions of The Citizenship Act, 1955 are not  “foreigners” in terms of section 2 (a) of The Foreigners Act,1946 as well as The Registration of Foreigners Act,1939, therefore, such cases will not be referred to the Foreigners Tribunals.

It further emphasized that any member of the Gorkha community holding Nepalese nationality and who has arrived in India by land or air over the Nepal border even without a passport or visa and staying in India for any length of time shall not be treated as an illegal migrant if he/she is in possession of any of the identity documents namely the Nepalese Passport, Nepalese Citizenship Certificate, voter Identification card issued by the Election Commission of Nepal, limited validity photo-identity certificate issued by Nepalese Mission in India when deemed necessary and for children between age group of 10-18 years, photo ID issued by the principal of the school, if accompanied by parents having valid travel documents. No such document is required for children below the age group of 10 years, the communication added citing provisions of India-Nepal Treaty signed in 1950. 

It added that the cases of members of Gorkha community falling within the parameters mentioned earlier should not be referred to the Foreigner Tribunals for opinion as to whether the person is a “foreigner” within the meaning of The Foreigners Act, 1946.

The communication clarified that only those individuals, who have come from specified territories i.e. territories included in Bangladesh immediately before commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1985, to the State of Assam, and are not Indian citizens, can be referred to the Foreigners tribunals.

                  The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has called for specialization in policing to provide world class services to the people. Addressing the Indian Police Service (IPS) probationers of 2017 batch here today, he said that law enforcement agencies should stress upon the need to give special training to police officers as per their area of interest to enhance professional skills and capabilities.

He said that constant flow of information between public and government officials is the key to understand and solve the problems of public.

     Later, interacting with the IPS Probationers, Home Minister suggested ways how to bust stress while doing duty. He said practicing yoga is the best way to reduce stress. He also said that good health is good for out-of-the-box thinking as new ideas from young officers are of great help for good policing.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has called for cooperation among all stakeholders to ensure foolproof aviation security. “I advise all stakeholders in the aviation sector especially the BCAS and the CISF to infuse new technology for aviation security and ensure a judicious blend of trained human resources and modern security infrastructure”, said Shri Rajnath Singh in his inaugural address at the International Aviation Security Seminar here today.

The two day seminar, organised by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) in its Golden Jubilee Year, has the theme, “Global cooperation: Secure Aviation.”

Underlining the terrorist threats to the aviation sector, Shri Rajnath Singh said, “Civil Aviation security continues to be an extremely challenging task as the sector remains an important target for terror outfits. The terrorists always look for opportunities where they can draw the maximum attention and media coverage.”

“Use of innovative methods to launch attacks on aviation sector are already in plenty. The case of Shoe Bomber in 2001, use of liquid explosives in London (2006) and the case of Underwear Bomber in Amsterdam 2009 clearly indicate that the terrorists are pushing the limits and even their underpants to hit the aviation sector,” he added.

Advocating global best practices in aviation security, Shri Rajnath Singh said, “We should adhere to stricter implementation of internationally agreed guidelines and norms. Introduction of updated, advanced technology in all airport processes would enhance our security capabilities. The Governments and aviation agencies have to increasingly think about newer methods to tackle conventional and unconventional threats.”

Underlining that there is not the slightest space for relaxation in aviation security, the Union Home Minister said the strength of any chain is determined by the strength of its smallest unit. Therefore, the security of these smaller airports should never be ignored.  

“The security of these smaller airports should never be ignored.  The Brussels and Istanbul airport attacks have shown the vulnerability of airports especially from the city side and it highlights new threats to aviation facilities,” he said.

Stating that India has witnessed massive expansion in the aviation sector, Shri Rajnath Singh said we have been constantly upgrading our security strategies and ensured its alignment with the changing threat perception.

“Keeping the threat of aircraft hijacking by terrorists, India has reviewed its legislation and preparedness towards such exigencies. The new Anti-Hijacking Act, 2016 gives effect to The Hague Convention of 1971 and the Beijing Protocol of 2010,” said Shri Rajnath Singh. “The new Anti-Hijacking Act is a testimony to our government’s concern for expedient measures to be taken during hostile acts of seizure or exercise of control of aircraft which jeopardize the safety of persons and property,” he said.

Shri Rajnath Singh said the government is serious in terms of strengthening aviation security and regulatory oversight. 

“As a matter of policy, unlike TSA (Transportation Security Administration) in the US which is also into physical security, our government has taken a conscious decision to separate the functions of security regulator from those being performed by regulated entities in the aviation ecosystem. This insulation addresses the fundamental problem of conflict of interest encountered in the regulatory framework,” he said.

The Union Home Minister said the overarching goal is to enhance global security by implementing uniform security measures around the world, a goal that cannot be achieved without an unwavering commitment from all quarters. 

MoS (Home) Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, Director General, CISF, Shri Rajesh Ranjan and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

                The Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh addressed the valedictory session of the Investors Summit in Dehradun, Uttrakhand  today. It was the concluding ceremony of the two-day event which has attracted 1,20,150 crore worth of pledges for investment in the hill state so far.

The Union Home Minister congratulated the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand for successfully organising the first ever such summit. He said that economic history of the state will recall this summit as an important first step. He pointed out that a strong economy is the backbone of any society and with this fact in mind the state of Uttarakhand was created to give fillip to the development in the backward regions of the state. He said that the presence of a stable government in the centre and in Uttarakhand has led to increased possibilities of development. 

Shri Rajnath Singh further stated that security is a precondition for development and from this point of view Uttarakhand is an ideal destination for investment. He said that the scope of tourism, health & wellness industry was immense in the state. He praised the people of Uttarakhand for being large hearted and exhorted the investors to take benefit of the skilled labour force the state has to offer. 

The Home Minister mentioned that the Home Ministry has worked out modalities to grant security clearance to set up business within 60 days. The length of this period has been just 53 days this year which is a major break from the past. He added that India is now one of the fastest growing economies in the world despite challenging global environment. This along with a credible government and structural reforms has led to preparation of groundwork for the New India of 2022. Given these factors,he appealed to the investors to fully participate in the growth story of Uttarakhand.

Speaking earlier the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat informed the gathering that the pledges for investment had exceeded expectations and in more than 600 MoUs signed so far, an amount of 1,20,150 crores had been pledged.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh today approved the proposal for one-time extension of the stipulated cut-off date from 8/11/2016 to 4/8/2017 for disbursement of Rs. 2.08 Cr. by the Punjab Govt. to the migrant families in the State of Punjab following anti-Sikh riots in 1984.

One of the recommendations of the Justice G.P. Mathur Committee, which was constituted to look into the grievances related to 1984 riots, was to provide Rehabilitation package to the migrant families in the State of Punjab. The Committee report stated that there were 1,020 cases (72 cases verified and recommended for payment while 948 cases were still pending for verification) in which Rehabilitation Grant could not be paid as the scheme has been closed.

The Committee recommended that the scheme for payment of Rs. 2 lakh as grant under the 2006 Rehabilitation package would be reopened for a certain period and the State Govt. of Punjab may be asked to complete the process of verification within a fixed period.

Accordingly, with the approval of competent Authority, vide MHA's letter dated 9/5/2016, the State Govt. of Punjab was requested to verify the pending cases within the 3 months from the date of issue of the letter and make disbursement of the amount from their own budget within stipulated time period but not later than 8/11/2016 and seek the reimbursement from MHA.

After a long follow up, the Govt. of Punjab, vide their letter dated 31/7/2018 provided the complete details of 104 beneficiaries, along with date of disbursement, in respect of whom total disbursement of Rs. 2.08 Cr. was made (104 x Rs. 2.00 lakh).

However with the approval of one time exemption of the cut-off date by the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh, the amount of Rs. 2.08 Cr will now be reimbursed to Govt. of Punjab.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India has been unequivocal in its commitment to the preservation and protection of human rights globally as well as within the country. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the National Human Rights Conclave being organized as a part of the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of the National Human Rights Commission, here today. 

The Vice President reaffirmed that human rights were the most natural rights, inherent to all human beings without discrimination. He also asked the state with the primary responsibility of upholding, respecting, protecting and fulfilling these inalienable rights and he applauded India’s robust human rights protection framework comprising of a fiercely independent and fair judiciary, media, civil society and a number of proactive and independent human right bodies, such as the National Human Rights Commission. India is also a signatory to several of the core UN Human Rights and International Labour Organization’s conventions, he added.

The Vice President appreciated the good work done by NHRC as a diligent watchdog of human rights protection and said that the massive rise in the number of complaints received by the NHRC from 496 in 1993 to 79,612 cases in 2018 were a testament to the faith that the people of India placed on the NHRC. He lauded the efforts of NHRC towards eradication of the abhorrent practices of bonded labor child labor and manual scavenging.

The Vice President insisted that special focus should be placed on protecting the rights of the vulnerable sections of the society, especially women and children. He reserved a few proud words to speak of India’s strong track record of affirmative action, especially women’s reservation in Local Self governing bodies. He said that the contribution of women, who are‘Shaktiswarupinis’, was indispensable to nation building and added that the principle of gender equality was enshrined in the constitution. He placed the onus on parents and teachers to inculcate the principles of gender equality in children. He declared that no civilized society would tolerate or accept any form of violence or discrimination against women and children.

The Vice President highlighted several challenges that lay in the path towards securing human rights. He warned that Indian democracy allows space for everyone to express their opinions. He welcomed ‘dissent’ but warned that ‘disintegration’ would not be tolerated.

The Vice President argued that human rights did not confer unfettered liberty on anyone to speak against the state or nation and added that human rights are best upheld if they are in harmony with the interests of the nation and fellow citizens. He lamented that the misuse of provisions of the human rights emerged as recent phenomenon. He observed that Human Rights are for everyone, in equal measure and therefore the rights of one person could not transgress the rights of another. In this context, he condemned acts of terrorism and said that India had lost several of its luminary leaders including Shri Rajiv Gandhi, Smt. Indira Gandhi and a number of MLAs and MPs to mindless acts of terror.

He extended a warm welcome to delegates from all over the world and told them that their presence in the Conclave reflected the deep concerns they had for the protection of human rights in their countries. He expressed hope that the conclave would act as a platform for dwelling upon diverse challenges to protection of human rights. He hoped that we would soon be able to ensure that the dignity and rights of all people, without exception are protected and a respect for human life and natural environment is fostered.

In his address, Justice Shri H.L. Dattu, Chairperson, NHRC deliberated upon creating widespread awareness, sensitisation of the public and strengthening constitutional and legal provisions which thereby provide extensive system of checks and balances. By monitoring human rights situations through camp sittings, open hearings, setting up of a bonded labour cell, appointment of special rapporteurs, constituting core and expert groups, NHRC is acting as a focal point for human right defenders. Justice Dattu identified poverty, gender inequalities, bonded labour, trafficking, displacement of refugees as some of the challenges to human rights protection. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba cautioned that certain groups wedded to terrorism take advantage of our commitments to uphold Human Rights. Stating that we should not lose sight of stark realities and appreciate the constraints under which the Security Forces operate, Shri Gauba said we must also protect the legal rights of the Security Forces. 

Shri Gauba said on its part the Ministry of Home Affairs has taken several steps to safeguard Human Rights. A new Division dealing with the Safety of Women and Children has been set up and the National Database on Sexual Offenders (NDSO) created. The MHA has also been reviewing the terrorism and insurgency situation in affected states and has either withdrawn the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from the entire state or lifted in certain parts of the state. 

He said that the NHRC is a central figure in the institutional architecture of the country. India has always worked towards protection of socio economic rights of the backward persons of the society through a robust legal regulatory framework establishing rule of law and protecting civil political and fundamental rights of the people. The NHRC along with National Commissions for Women, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Minorities, is helping the Government to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, he added.

The International Conclave is aimed at providing the platform to the national human rights institutions of various countries, global networks of NHRIs, government and non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders to share their views and to deliberate on the road ahead on important human rights concerns.

They are mandated to discuss and make recommendations on any matter of common interest in the field of economic and social planning, border disputes, linguistic minorities or inter-state transport etc. They are regional fora of cooperative endeavor for States linked with each other economically, politically and culturally.

                The 17.86 km long Shiv Vihar–TrilokpuriSanjay Lake section of the 59 km long Majlis Park - Shiv Vihar corridor (Line 7) of Phase 3, also known as the Pink Line is now ready for passenger operations. It was inaugurated here today by Minister of State (I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri and Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, Shri Manish Sisodia. Transport Minister of Delhi Shri Kailash Gahlot, Member of Parliament Shri Manoj Tiwari, Secretary MoHUA Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, MD of DMRC Shri Mangu Singh andsenior officials were present also on the occasion. 

This stretch will be a major boon for the eastern and northern fringes of the national capital. Three interchange facilities at Welcome (With Red Line), Karkarduma and Anand Vihar ISBT (with Blue Line) will tremendously boost the connectivity of areas such as Shiv Vihar, Gokul Puri, Maujpur, Jaffrabad etc. In the future, this stretch will get connected with the presently operational Majlis Park – Lajpat Nagar section of Pink Line. The residents of the neighbouring Ghaziabad areas of Uttar Pradesh will also get immensely benefitted. The Majlis Park – Shiv Vihar Corridor is crossing the existing Vaishali- Dwarka elevated line 21 metres above the ground and is 10 metres above the existing Metro line.

With the opening of this section, the Delhi Metro network has now become 314 kilometres long with 229 Metro stations. All the major corridors under Delhi Metro’s Phase 3 are expected to be opened for passengers by the end of the year. 

Addressing the gathering, Shri Hardeep Puri said that with this expansion, the Delhi Metro has become member of an elite club of large metros which have such a mammoth network of over 300 km long route and added that in coming months it will also breach the 350 kilometre mark and more and more people of the entire National Capital Region will be benefitted. He said, Delhi Metro is indeed scripting history as it has added 80 kilometres of new sections in the year 2018. The Minister appreciated Delhi government’s assurance for clearing the hurdles for commencement of Delhi Metro Phase-IV project of 103.93 km length. He said, clean and green public transport system is essential to combat air-pollution, decongest the city and providing a dependable mobility platform to people. He said, in the coming months also, a lot of expansion is going to happen in the NCR cities as new sections will open in NOIDA, Greater NOIDA, Ghaziabad and Ballabhgarh.  

 

Other Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) projects being planned include the 82.15 km. Delhi to Meerut corridor; Delhi- Panipat (111 km) and Delhi- Alwar (180 km).

                Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs has stated that more than 664 kms of Metro Rail projects in 15 cities are presently under various stages of implementation, while more than 515 kms of Metro Line are already operational in India. Interacting with the Members of the Consultative Committee attached to the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs here today, the Minister informed them on various initiatives taken by his Ministry on Urban Transport in the country in the recent past besides apprising them about status of Sustainable Urban Transport Projects. Members of Parliament Shri Bhartruhari Mahtab, Shri DD Devegowda, Shri Gokraju Gangaraju, Shri Rajan Baburao Vichare, Shri Rattan Lal Kataria, Shri Santokh Singh Chaudhary and Dr. Shrikant Eknath Shinde, attended the meeting. Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA and senior officers of the Ministry and its entities also attended the meeting.

Providing details of the Metro Rail projects presently under operation/implementation, Shri Puri informed that several new cities are now aspiring to have Metro Rail Systems. The State Governments/Union Territories have been advised to prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR) in line with the provisions in the Metro Rail Policy 2017 and submit. He also said that Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) projects comprising 373 kms between Delhi-Meerut, Delhi-Panipat and Delhi-Alwar are under planning. Informing the Members present, Secretary said that all new metro projects are approved subject to provision of last mile connectivity for the passengers. Provision of last mile connectivity for the Delhi Metro by a newly created entity is at an advanced stage and is likely to be completed soon, he said. 

The Minister said that the MoHUA has released funds to various Metro Rail Projects to the tune of Rs. 9,286.09 crore in 2015-16, Rs. 15,298.61 crore in 2016-17, Rs. 13,956.23 crore in 2017-18 and Rs. 7,481.28 crore in 2018-19 (upto September 30, 2018).

Shri Puri said, in order to create an ecosystem for metro rail, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has notified the Metro Rail Policy, 2017. “The policy bridges the gap for ascertaining and enhancing the feasibility of metro rail projects from economic, social and environmental perspective. This aims to focus on systematic planning and implementation of metro rail systems and act as a guide to state governments for preparing comprehensive proposals for metro rail projects”, he emphasised. The policy also enables greater private participation and innovative financing through Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and Value Capture Finance (VCF), he added. He informed the Meeting that the Govt provides financial support for metro rail projects in the form of Grant to the States up to 10% of project cost or in the form 50:50 equity sharing with State Governments or viability gap funding to the extent of 20% of the capital cost of public transport projects under PPP model.

Shri Puri said that the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has also notified the National Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Policy in May 2017, with the objective of encouraging compact mixed use development which reduces the need for travel and improve the access to public transport. He pointed out that the policy aims to promote inclusive habitat by ensuring that the people dependent on public transport can live in the liveable communities within the walkable distance of transit stations. City specific strategies and mechanism may be framed for implementation of TOD, he said. The Ministry has also formulated and issued standards for all components for Metro Rail Systems viz rolling stock, signalling systems, electrical and electromechanical components and civil engineering structures to promote “Make in India” and reduction in cost.

The 11th Urban Mobility India (UMI) Conference is planned from 2 to 4 November, 2018 at Nagpur, with the theme “Green Mobility” to disseminate up-to-date and best urban transport practices information to the cities and to bring together the technology and service providers, policy makers, practitioners, officials in urban transport from India and abroad, he added.

                Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs(I/C) has appreciated the Engineers involved in the construction project of 120 General Pool Residential Type-VII Flats for overcoming the engineering complexities and the plan to use Eco friendly Green and energy Efficient features in this project. The project is to be executed by Central Public Works Department at Pocket-I, DDU Marg, New Delhi. While addressing those present after he laid the foundation stone of the project here today, Shri Puri said he was happy to note that 15,000 sq. meters of area developed is green with provision for rain harvesting. Care has been taken to provide enough parking spaces, public amenities like community toilets, etc. Noting that all the projects put on a fast track by the Ministry have achieved substantial progress, he said, “we are determined to complete other projects as well.” Smt. Meenakshi Lekhi, MP presided over the function. 

The Proposed 120 Type-VII multi storeyed flats shall be constructed in a plot area of 26,500 sqm. There shall be four ‘State of the Art’ Towers - two towers shall be 13 storeyed and remaining two towers 17 storeyed with basements and stilt for parking. The project costing Rs. 197 crores shall be completed within a period of 21 months by June 2020. On site solar power units shall be installed on roof top with capacity of 300 KW. The campus would have provisions of sewage treatment plant for recycling waste water, rain water harvesting, and de-composter for handling of waste material. These flats shall be a magnificent blend of Architecture and Engineering.

Another project of Grade Separator at Rani Jhansi Road to improve mobility for the citizens of Delhi was opened for public use in the presence of the Minister earlier in the day. The project will ensure easier movement of traffic and reduction in the commuting time. The Minister had inaugurated the Sky Walk and Foot Over Bridge at ITO yesterday as one more initiative for ease of living for Delhi citizens. 

Mentioning the initiatives of the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry in making life easier and reducing various bottlenecks, he outlined several projects funded by his ministry which have either been completed or are at an advanced stage of completion. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs had issued sanction for funding of following six projects worth Rs. 1,826.40 crore under the Urban Development Fund, which aimed at reducing traffic congestion, pollution and accidents, and improve traffic flow in Delhi. 

i) Construction of skywalk and FOB at the Junction of Sikandra Road, Mathura Road, Tilak Marg and Bahadur Shah Marg at ‘W’ Point near Hans Bhawan.

ii) Construction of Grade Separator at Rani Jhansi Road.

iii) Construction of flyover passes between Northern Mahipalpur by pass road and Airport road near Hanuman Mandir, New Delhi.

iv) Construction of Flyover-cum-ROB on UER-I at Narela.

v) Construction of Integrated Transit Corridor Development Plan along Mathura Road, Bhairon Marg, Mahatma Gandhi Marg and connecting Mathura Road to Mahatma Gandhi Marg via Underground Tunnel below Pragati Maidan.

vi) Road corridor improvement of Ring Road from ISBT Kashmiri Gate to Shalimar Bypass including construction of up-ramp for U-turn to join with existing elevated loop at ISBT Kashmiri Gate, widening of road by shifting entry/exit subway near Nigam Bodh Ghat.

Shri Hardeep Puri said that in view of slow progress in these projects, it was decided in October 2017 by the Ministry inter-alia, that the projects where balance funding of the project cost was not forthcoming from Delhi government, the same may be funded by the DDA/ITPO i.e., 100% funding by the Central Government and implementing agencies be changed to CPWD except in Skywalk project where PWD had called for tender. Accordingly, for four projects relating to (i) Construction of Skywalk (ii) Construction of flyover at Mahipalpur (iii) Road Corridor improvement at ISBT and (iv) Integrated Transit Corridor Development at Pragati Maidan, it was decided to meet the entire cost through UDF/DDA/ITPO. 

He pointed out that project of Road Corridor improvement at ISBT, for which Delhi government had decided to do as its own has still not been started. “Apart from this two other projects on Ring Road i.e., Construction of flyovers at Metcalfe House and Majnu Ka Tila at the cost of Rs 320 crore for all three are still not yet sanctioned by Delhi Government”, he added

The construction of flyover passes between Northern Mahipalpur by pass road and Airport road near Hanuman Mandir, New Delhi at a cost of Rs 188 crore, will be completed by February, 2019. Similarly, construction of Flyover-cum-ROB on UER-I at Narela at a cost of Rs 437.21 crore, will be completed by March, 2019. As far as construction of Integrated Transit Corridor Development Plan along Mathura Road, Bhairon Marg, Mahatma Gandhi Marg and connecting Mathura Road to Mahatma Gandhi Marg via Underground Tunnel below Pragati Maidan at a cost of Rs 928.17 crore, is concerned, the Project will be completed co-terminus with completion of new world class ITPO facilities in October, 2019.

                Shri Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State (I/C), Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, today inaugurated and dedicated to people of Delhi a skywalk and FOB at the junction of Sikandra Road, Mathura Road, Tilak Marg and Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg at ‘W’ point near Hans Bhavan. Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Shri Anil Baijal, Member of Parliament Smt. Meenakshi Lekhi, Secretary MoHUA Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Chairman, NDMC Shri Naresh Kumar, Vice-Chairman, DDA, Shri Tarun Kapur and other officials were present on the occasion.

 

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs had, as part of the decongestion plan of Delhi roads, sanctioned an amount of Rs. 54.84 Cr. under UDF to decongest ‘W’ Point and provide easy and safe passage to pedestrian by way of providing a Skywalk at this junction.

 

The ITO Crossing and ‘W’ Point Junction are the two busiest crossings as far as pedestrian traffic is concerned. There are over 25 major offices and other institutions located in this area. Approximately 30,000 pedestrian cross various roads around ITO Crossing and ‘W’ Point.

 

A large network of public utilities has been constructed to connect all the sides of various roads (Tilak Marg, Sikandra Road, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg & Mathura Road) with Pragati Maidan Metro Station. The Foot Over Bridge (FOB) at Hans Bhawan has also been constructed to provide easy and safe movement to the pedestrians. The Skywalk with a length of 400m has a width of 5m and length of Loop and Ramp is 130m having width of 3m. The length of FOB at Hans Bhawan is 54m having width of 5m.

 

The Skywalk and FOB has been constructed in Steel Structure. The Granite Flooring and Stainless Steel Railing has been provided. The structure has Tensile Fabric roofing. The Skywalk shall have 6 passenger lift of 20 persons capacity and one lift of 16 person capacity. Solar PV modules, Wi-Fi, CCTV has been provided in Skywalk and FOB. The LED fittings for functional and architectural lighting have also been provided. The entire Skywalk has been covered under CCTV surveillance. A police booth has also been constructed under the Skywalk for constant surveillance in the area. Public convenience has been provided at Mathura Road and near Hans Bhawan. Seven Glass lifts have been provided for pedestrian to ascend and descend, besides stair cases. There is enough space at ground floor at various locations which can be used for commercial purposes. Matching design has been adopted for the Foot Over Bridge constructed near Hans Bhawan. 

 

Apart from the sky walk, the Central Government has taken several landmark decisions to make the lives of Delhiites more comfortable. One of the areas in which Delhiites suffer is the tremendous traffic congestion affecting efficient mobility. 

 

In the year 2016, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs had issued sanction for funding of six projects worth Rs. 1826.40 crore under the Urban Development Fund of Rs 1382.77 crore which aim at reducing traffic congestion and improve traffic flow in Delhi. On a review undertaken in October 2017 in the Ministry in view of the slow progress in these projects, it was decided that the projects where balance funding of 20% of the project cost was not forthcoming from Delhi government, the same may be funded by the DDA/ITPO i.e., 100% funding by the Central Government.

 

All the above projects then were put on a fast track and have achieved substantial progress during the last one year.

                Some of the Press Reports in the newspapers of 14th Oct, 2018 are misleading about inauguration of mobility projects in Delhi and the funds allocated thereon. It has been conveyed that Delhi specific projects have been funded by AAP-led Delhi Govt. However, the fact of the matter is that Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs approved five major mobility projects worth Rs. 1826.40 crores for the benefit of Delhi citizens. The projects being implemented using Urban Development Fund (UDF) have been administered by the Ministry of HUA. These projects aim at decongestion of Delhi to ease traffic movement, reduce traffic congestion, segregate vehicular and pedestrian traffic by providing FOB’s/ subways etc. 

The Ministry of HUA sanctioned six projects in 2016 in which the Delhi government had to contribute 20%. However, because there was no cooperation forthcoming from the Delhi government, it was decided in October 2017 that one of the projects related to ISBT flyover on Ring Road will be done fully by Delhi government and the other five will be funded by the Ministry and DDA. Delhi government on its own had taken over projects related to Majnu Ka Tila flyover apart from ISBT flyover: projects costing Rs. 320 crores. It is surprising that even foundation stones for these projects have not been laid and no financial sanction taken by Delhi government.

On the other hand, MoS (IC) Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri has pushed five projects vigorously for implementation for the comfort of Citizens of Delhi and providing them ease of living.

First among them, the skywalk at ITO for which Shri Puri laid the foundation stone on November 09, 2017, is going to be inaugurated by him and Lt Gov of Delhi on October 15, 2018. Even though the project is being executed by PWD, this Rs 54 crore project has been funded by the Ministry of HUA. The project will provide world class, safe, nature friendly connectivity at a very busy traffic intersection point at ITO.

Another project costing Rs. 200 crore which has Grade Seperator at Rani Jhansi Road and was held up for so many years, will be inaugurated by the MoS (IC) MoHUA on October 16, 2018. This has been made

possible through UDF funding. It will immensely ease traffic flow on the Rani Jhansi Road which is one of the main arterial roads of Delhi and will de-congest the highly dense areas near Sadar Bazar, Filmistan, Idgah, etc. besides improving connectivity between North and Central Delhi.

The third project—a flyover-cum-underpass—at Mahipalpur is going on in full swing. This Rs.188 crore project is likely to be inaugurated before March 2019. This will improve access to the Airport from South Delhi, Mehrauli, Vasant Kunj, Faridabad and South Gurgoan etc., and will ease traffic around the area.

The fourth project, Construction of Flyover-cum-ROB on UER-I at Narela, for which foundation stone was laid by MoS (IC) Housing and Urban Affairs and the LG, Delhi is also likely to be completed by March 2019. The project is being implemented by DDA.

The fifth project, Construction of Integrated Transit Corridor Development Plan along Mathura Road, Bhairon Marg, Mahatma Gandhi Marg and connecting Mathura Road to Mahatma Gandhi Marg via Underground Tunnel below Pragati Maidan, costing around Rs. 980 crore, for which foundation stone was laid by the Vice-President in December 2017, is also going on in full swing. The project aims at decongestion of the road networks for the Project influence area and would simultaneously be providing direct access to underground tunnel for internationally acclaimed ITPO with world class convention Centre, ITPO hotel area and to the Under Ground Parking. Traffic decongestion intervention includes unhindered access to the basement parking at Pragat Maidan. It will connect Mathura road to Ring Road through a Tunnel cutting across Pragati Maidan, Making Mathura Road signal free, smooth movement of traffic on intersections of Mathura Road and Bhairon Marg and that of Bhairon Marg and Ring Road. The project will further ease traffic on Purana Quila Road, Shershah Road and Subramaniam Bharti Marg.

It may be noted that Delhi government, despite repeated reminders, has still not committed financial expenditure for Phase IV of Delhi Metro which will be a major gain for Delhi citizens in many ways. The project is imperative on account of increased pollution and degradation of air quality in the city for which personalised road transport is a major contributor. There is an urgency to address the issue with introduction of public transport infrastructure and reduction in the local air pollution from transport mode utilising more fossil fuels per passenger trip. This can be facilitated through modal shift from personalised vehicles using fossil fuel to a much more cleaner mode of urban rail.

The government of India agreed to prioritise three projects--- costing Rs. 34,580 crores: (i) Aerocity to Tughlakabad (20.20 km.), (ii) Janakpuri West to R.K. Ashram (28.92 km.) and (iii) Mukundpur to Maujpur (12.54 km.). But Delhi government has still not c its intent for early 3 phase of Delhi Metro or what is prevalent in other states at 50:50 model.

Estimated for Rs 320 Crores for construction of flyovers at Metcalfe House and Majnu ka Tilla T junctions and additional loop at ISBT flyover on Ring road still pending with Finance department of Delhi government.

Another major mobility initiative project relates to Delhi to Meerut RRTS corridor of 82.15 k.m. length and its total estimated completion cost is Rs. 31,902 crores. The proposal for Rapid Rail Transit System (RRTS) between Meerut and Delhi was submitted to Government of Uttar Pradesh (GOUP) and Government of National Capital Territory, Delhi (GNCTD) by NCRTC for approval on 09.12.2016. GoUP has approved the DPR on 19.07.2017. GNCTD on 30.07.2018 has conveyed their readiness to grant ‘in-principle’ approval for the implementation of Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor. GNCTD has also conveyed that they do not have adequate finances to meet the cost and share of Delhi in the project cost may be borne by the Central Government. 

In short, a false narrative is being created in Media. MoHUA will be happy to help Delhi government in mobility projects which primarily is Delhi government’s responsibility.

                The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs vide Notification S.O. 5220(E) dated 11.10.2018, has notified the modified land policy.  The policy would be applicable in the urbanizable areas of urban extensions in 95 villages of Delhi. The policy replaces the earlier policy notified in the year 2013.  It  aims at developing smart and sustainable neighborhoods, sectors and zones, planned and executed as per the availability of water, power and other infrastructure. 

The core of the policy is active role of private sector and farmers also involved in assembling land and developing physical and social infrastructure. Owners or group of owners can pool land parcels for development as per prescribed norms.  Land Parcels of any size can participate under the policy. However, the minimum land to be pooled is 2 hectares to ensure adequate return of land for development and form a Developer Entity.   DDA will now play the role of a facilitator and the process of planning, pooling and development will be taken up by Developer Entities/ Consortiums. 

For smooth planning and development of infrastructure, integrated Sector-based planning approach shall be followed.  A minimum of 70% contiguous land of the developable area within a sector, free of encumbrances is required to be pooled to make the sectors eligible for development under the Policy. 

Considering the availability of resources and services an FAR of 200 is allowed for group housing/residential use under the policy.  DDA has estimated that it is expected to generate about  17 Lakh Dwelling units out of which around 5 lakh Dwelling units will be available under EWS category, to house about 76 lakh persons.  

Differential land return in two categories as per the earlier policy has been replaced with uniform division of land on 60:40 basis in the modified Policy. The Consortium will retain 60% of pooled land and hold the remaining 40% on behalf of DDA.  Consortium can utilize 60% of pooled land for development of residential, commercial, public and semi-public facilities as per the policy and MPD-2021 provisions.  The remaining 40% of the pooled land is to be surrendered, free of encumbrances, as and when required to DDA/service providing agencies to undertake developmental work.  To keep pace with new forms of development, provision for achieving a vertical mix of uses (residential, commercial, public and semi-public) at building level is introduced.  Additional Development Controls have been introduced to regulate building and infrastructure aspects of developments.

External Development Charges (EDC) shall be payable on entire area of pooled land in installments to cover the cost of providing city level infrastructure. 

In order to promote affordable and inclusive housing, FAR of 15% over and above maximum permissible residential FAR has also been allowed for EWS/ affordable housing. 

A Single Window System is being created for implementation of policy in DDA. All processes of receiving applications, verifications, grant of approvals and licenses, etc. shall be online and will be completed in a time bound manner. A two-stage Grievance Redressal Mechanism within DDA has been introduced for clear operationalization and implementation of the policy.

                The Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri has called for putting ‘systems in place’ to enhance our emergency response infrastructure to meet large number of ‘inter-related challenges’ stemming from ‘urban flooding’. He was addressing the media after conclusion of a workshop on “Urban Flooding Resilience” here today. He said, he will hold talks with experts to look at the causation, to put together facts on the recent floods and later look at disaster management in all kinds of urban areas. He said, the idea is to chalk out ways of prevention and mitigation of floods in Indian towns and cities and set into motion the national guidelines on management of urban flooding. Shri Puri said while it is not easy to make the guidelines enforceable, flood mitigation and management could be made a reform condition in various flagship missions of the ministry.

 

Shri Puri said that at some level, flooding can be an indictment of municipal management, as in lack of dredging and drain cleaning, it can also be caused by the urban heat island effect. He said that the area between natural disaster and man-made blunders is becoming very difficult to define, as much of what appears to be natural is often man-made due to climate change.  “We have to deal with disaster management in the context of robust urbanisation. There are measures that cities can undertake, such as changing the nature of buildings and materials used, ensuring water conservation or planting more trees, and overall design an eco-system that helps prevent and mitigates the impact of floods” he said.

 

The Minister noted that flooding in urban centres is due to inadequate storm-water drains and large-scale encroachments along natural waterways, and stressed the need for improved forecasting and urban planning strategies.  He also called for mapping of emergency services and disaster management response centres, strengthening of communication services, solid waste management, rejuvenating water bodies and involving the civil society and NGOs, generating awareness among people to making the systems urban flooding resilient.

 

The workshop noted that climate change and increasing urbanization pose huge challenges in managing urban planning for a sustainable future. Intense urbanization resulting in the so-called mega cites aggravates floods by increasing the amount of impermeable surfaces and modifying flow routes. Statistics show that flood disasters are one of the most significant in terms of damages and losses. Urbanization rates are increasing rapidly and it is important to learn how to live with floods by alleviating their consequences, in the present and future. The Workshop noted that this concept can be used to measure and visualize the changes in flood resilience attained by different flood control measures, as well as in future scenarios of population growth, uncontrolled urbanization or climate change. It said, this capacity can be realized by timely implementation of effective measures that allow for the response to and recovery from floods: presence of flood awareness, flood mitigation measures, insurance systems, forecasting and warning systems, and crisis management.

He was speaking at a function organised on “World Habitat Day – 2018 Celebration” with the theme ‘Municipal Solid Waste Management’ (MSWM) here today.  Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary in the Ministry and officers from the department and its entities were also present on the occasion. The function was also attended by representatives of the United Nations and UN-Habitat.

Addressing the gathering, Shri Puri said that the Government has considered solid waste management as top priority area of urban development and added that the launch of ‘Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) - Clean India Mission’ envisages 100 per cent of the urban population to be covered under Solid Waste Management (SWM) services. Acknowledging the importance given by UN-Habitat as well as Government of India’s priority for appropriate and scientific management of municipal solid waste, he said it is one of the basic requirements to maintain quality of living in urban areas.

Shri Puri said that “the theme also reminds us of our collective responsibility to implement the adopted Sustainable Development Goals particularly SDG Goal No. 11, ‘to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’ along with basic services. Other SDGs linked with the theme of Municipal Solid Waste Management are Goal No. 3 ‘ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages’, Goal No. 12 ‘ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns’, Goal No. 13 ‘ to take urgent action to combat climate change and impacts’.” He said that environmentally sound waste management practices have a strong entry point to achieve a range of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Solid waste management includes all activities that seek to minimize health, environmental, and aesthetic impacts of solid waste, he said.

The Minister pointed out that through the adoption of New Urban Agenda in 2016, the member nations of the UN committed themselves to promote environmentally sound waste management and to substantially reduce waste generation by reducing, reusing and recycling waste, minimizing landfills and converting waste to energy when waste cannot be recycled or when this choice delivers the best environmental outcome.

Stating that one of the off-shoots of the growing urbanisation is the increase in generation of solid waste in cities and towns, Shri Puri pointed out that a Planning Commission Report (2014) projected that by 2031, the Indian urban centres will generate 165 million tons of waste annually. “This alarming state highlights the needed importance of scientific waste management from the perspective of both public health and environmental concerns”, he added.

Shri Puri said that in India, almost 88.4 megawatts (MW) of energy is generated from waste-to-energy (WTE) projects and the waste-to-compost production stands at 15.69 Lakhs metric tonnes (17 September 2018). He urged the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to concentrate on managing the solid waste by skilled municipal staff, adequate training and capacity building, and called upon national training institutions such as HUDCO’s HSMI, NIUA and other multi and bilateral organisations to intensify their efforts towards effective planning and management of urban services, especially management of municipal solid waste. He said, “a significant outlay has been allocated for Solid Waste Management (SWM) projects in the country over the years. Behavioural change and citizen/community participation in SWM is the key to sustain a project related to management of municipal solid waste, the Minister said and added that if municipal solid waste management is done through proper planning and management, it would lead to a business case of income generation and provide financial support to ULBs by generating revenue.    

Shri Durga Shankar Mishra in his address stated that environmentally sustainable waste management involves reuse and recycling of all types of waste ranging from domestic waste, industrial waste, medical waste to e-waste. Improvement of urban services including Solid Waste Management requires a holistic approach with integrated focus on planning, technology, policy, administrative and legal actions, he said and added that “Waste avoidance, segregation at source, and disposal all need to be given importance in the process of reducing and managing solid waste. As land is a scarce resource, there is a need to maximise resource recovery from waste recycling and to reduce the need for landfill sites”, he added.

Shri Mishra said that in order to bring attitudinal and mind-set changes towards safe sanitary habits/practices, cities administrations are involved in various awareness generation activities on regular basis in partnership with the local NGOs and swachhagrahis. He pointed out that recently, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has released the guidelines on ‘Empowering Marginalised Groups- Convergence between SBM and DAY-NULM, 2018’ with the vision to create livelihoods opportunities in the areas of solid and liquid waste management.

On the occasion several publications were released by Shri Hardeep Puri who also gave away awards to winners of painting competitions for school children.

First Monday of October of every year has been designated by the United Nations as World Habitat Day. The purpose of World Habitat Day is to reflect on the state of our towns and cities, and on the basic right of all to have adequate shelter.  It is also intended to remind the world that we all have the power and the responsibility to shape the future of our cities and towns.

                Swachhata Hi Sewa Pakhwada, has been conducted by the CPWD in a successful and grand manner across the country. During Swachhata Hi Sewa Pakhwada from 15.9.2018 to 2.10.2018, CPWD undertook massive cleanliness drive of all assets maintained by it across the country. CPWD officers and staff actively participated in the shramdans during the fortnight. Entire Drive was undertaken with close coordination, cooperation and support of all RWAs / Residents / Coordination Committees.  CPWD also invited RWAs of Delhi at its  Head Quarter and interacted with them. CPWD held ""Swachh Office"" competition among all Government buildings across the country maintained by it.   

Painting competition amongst the children was held on the theme ‘Swachhata hi Sewa’ at Sunder Nursery in the august presence of  MoS (I/C) Shri Hardeep Singh Puri and Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Durga Shankar Mishra which gave a boost in creating awareness and encouragement among the public on the cleanliness.  The Department undertook plogging in drive led by its Director General, Shri Prabhakar Singh, at Sunder Nursery and Nirman Bhawan. It held a skit play on Swachhata which was well received by the audience. 

Addressing a function on the occasion here today, Shri Prabhakar Singh  said that waste convertor composting machine has been installed by CPWD in Nirman Bhawan which  was inaugurated by the Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. He said, Compost produced by this machine shall be used in the horticulture works, which shall complete the ecological loop fulfilling the environment requirement of three R’s – Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. CPWD is installing similar composting machines at other GPRAs and GPOAs.  Shri Singh told the gathering that CPWD has also initiated waste segregation at source at different locations in Delhi with the help of startups with no cost to CPWD. To conserve precious water resource, CPWD has decided to install STPs to recycle the waste water for use of horticulture and other purposes in all our GPRAs, he added. 

On the occasion, Shri Prabhakar Singh also released a film on the activities carried out by CPWD across the country during Swachhata Hi Sewa Pakhwada.  The film was also screened at the function.  Video CDs of the film were distributed for viewing in all CPWD units and in other Government Departments for spreading cleanliness awareness among the people in the country.

CPWD also successfully undertook plantation and maintenance drives in last two months. Shri Prabhakar Singh also highlighted that under plantation drive, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs gave a target of plantation of 50,000 tress to CPWD by 30th September 2018, which the CPWD successfully achieved by planting 51,851 trees much before by 31st August 2018.  He also enumerated several other initiatives by CPWD for clean, green and sustainable development projects.

He said that children and youth are main driving force for the success of this mission. He said, this mission has also helped in achieving ODF society.

Shri Puri told the participants that today is also the World Habitat Day which his Ministry will officially observe on 5th October 2018. He said that the theme for this year is “Municipal Solid Waste Management” which is closely connected with Swachhata hi Sewa drive. He said, World Habitat Day reminds us that keeping our villages, towns and cities clean is our prime responsibility. 

Hindustan Prefab Limited also organised a painting and essay writing competition on the occasion. Shri Hardeep Puri later distributed prizes to the winners and appreciated their creativity.

                As the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC)  moves towards a ‘Deemed to be University ‘status  it is imperative that it ensures an adequate faculty strength.  This means that existing faculty are given proper avenues of  Career Advancement.  Positions which then continue to remain  vacant  should be filled through recruitment. This was stated by Shri Amit Khare, Secretary Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) while chairing the 139th Meeting of the  Executive Council of the IIMC, Delhi . He underlined the requirement of IIMC seeking approval for creating the entire range of posts that  UGC mandates for such institutions, which can then be filled as an when the need arises. He also directed that  a proposal of filling up of vacancies of the non teaching staff  also put up to the Ministry at the earliest. The EC meeting approved new faculty positions for the IIMC Campuses at Dhenkanal, Aizawl, Amravati, Jammu and Kottayam. 

Shri Khare emphasised that IIMC must look at international partnership as a means of spreading Indian soft power. He concurred with suggestions of Executive Committee members that IIMC  look at fruitful working relationships in ASEAN countries and also with the  Central Asian region. He said that the  need of hour is to develop a strategy for International relations for the Institute.

Members raised their concern about the need for greater education on fake news and ability to discern appropriate news among the clutter. DG, IIMC pointed out the Institute is engaged in organizing workshops on this subject and developing a pedagogy for the same. The Chairman, Shri Khare pointed out that while building relationships with social media players, due diligence must be followed.

Chairman stated that the IIMC has a special responsibility to develop a connect between media institutions.  He also underlined that the EC  meet every 3 months,  in order to ensure  the EC has continued engagement with the affairs of the Institute.

The IIMC EC agreed to name the main road within the IIMC after late Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of India.  Shri Khare giving his view subsequent to suggestions , stated that an annual lecture be also instituted in the memory of, and named after the former Prime Minister. It could be slotted around his birth anniversary, he added. 

A large number of suggestion were made by members to further establish IIMC as the premier institution not only is India, but also in South Asia. The meeting  was also attended by  Prof. Makhhan Lal,  of the Delhi Institute of Heritage Research and Management, by Prof. Vijay Dharukar VC, Tripura Central University, Shri Rakesh Khar, Editor( Special Projects), Network 18,  Shri Hitesh  Shankar Editor Panchjanya, Ms. Smita Prakash, Director News, ANI,  DG,IIMC besides representative of Ministry of I&B and Faculty of IIMC.

Due to those commitments, Shri Kher has informed that he will not be present in the country for nearly nine months between 2018-19. He feels that it will not be possible for him to discharge his responsibilities as Chairperson, FTII due to his commitments.

Acknowledging Shri Kher’s pre-occupations and requirement of time that the post demands, the Ministry has accepted his resignation. Information & Broadcasting Minister, Col Rajyavardhan Rathore thanked Shri Anupam Kher for steering FTII with such acumen and empathy. His stature, erudition and goodwill among the film fraternity contributed to the standing of the Institute.

The Minister wished Shri Anupam Kher the best in all his future endeavours and expressed delight about him representing India as a Cultural Ambassador in the international domain. The Ministry will continue to rely on his experience and advice Shri Rathore added.

                The grave allegations of corruption by senior functionaries of CBI one against another, which has been widely reported in media, has vitiated the official eco-system of the organization. The environment of faction feud has reached its peak in the CBI leading to a potential loss of credibility and reputation of the Premier Investigating Agency of the Government It also vitiated the working environment of the organization which has deep and visible impact on the overall governance.

2.      The CVC, on receipt of a complaint on 24th August, 2018 containing various allegations against the senior functionaries of the CBI has served three separate notices (under section 11 of CVC Act, 2003) on 11th September, 2018 upon the Director, CBI to produce files and documents before the Commission on 14""' September, 2018. Various opportunities have been given to produce such records and after several adjournments, though CBI assured the Commission on 24th September, 2018 to furnish the records within three weeks. Despite repeated assurances and reminders, the Director, CBI failed to furnish the records / files before the Commission. The CVC has observed that Director, CBI has not been cooperating in making available records / files sought by the Commission relating to serious allegations.

3.      The CVC has also observed that the Director, CBI has been non-cooperative with the Commission, non-compliant with the requirements / directions of the Commission and has created willful obstructions in the functioning of the Commission which is a Constitutional body.

4.      Considering the extra-ordinary and unprecedented circumstanceswhich has emerged, the Central Vigilance Commission in exercise of its powers (section 8 of CVC Act, 2003) of superintendence over the functioning of DPSE (CBI), in so far as it relates to the investigation of offences alleged to have been committed under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. has passed orders divesting Shri Alok Kumar Verma, Director, CBI and Shri Rakesh Asthana, Spl. Director, CBI of the functions, power, duty and supervisory role in respect of cases already registered and/or required to be registered and/or being inquired/enquired/investigated under the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, until further orders.

5.      The Government of India having carefully examined and evaluated the material made available to it, and being satisfied that an extra-ordinary and unprecedented situation has arisen which demands that Government of India shall exercise its powers under Section 4(2) of the DPSE Act. The Government of India has evaluated the material before it and in the interest of equality, fair play and principles of natural justice, decided to divest Shri Alok Kumar Verma, Director, CBI and Shri Rakesh Asthana, Spl Director, CBI of their functions, power, duty and supervisory role in any manner as Director, CBI and Spl. Director, CBI respectively.

6.      This has been done as an interim measure and will subsist ""till the CVC concludes its inquiry into all issues which have given rise to the present extra-ordinary and unprecedented situation and till the CVC and/or Government of India takes an appropriate decision in accordance with the law as regards to the measures to be adopted as a consequence thereof”.

7.      In view of the above background, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has approved that during the period of such interim measure, Shri M. Nageshwar Rao, IPS, presently working as Joint Director, CBI shall look after the duties and functions of Director, CBI with immediate effect.

                 Dr. Tapan Kumar Chand, CMD, NALCO has been conferred with the prestigious ‘NIPM Ratna Award’ in the 37th NIPM’ Annual National Conference NATCON-2018, held at Pune. Dr. Chand was given the award in recognition to his significant contribution to People Management & Strategic Leadership. 

Dr. Chand dedicated the award to HR professionals in the country and the Team NALCO. 

Sharing his thoughts, Dr. Chand said, “We are now in the threshold of 4th industrial revolution. The 1st Industrial revolution marked the shift from muscle power to steam power while 2nd revolution occurred with application of electricity and mass production. With 3rd revolution it gave further wings to human efforts with implementation of IT & Automation.  Now with the emerging 4th industrial revolution, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Robotics, Augmented Reality etc would be the trend setters. 

Dr Chand further said that the new technology: Industry 4.0, will bring in substantial reduction in capital investments and Indian Industries needs to leverage it to remain globally competitive. “The need for the Industry is to prepare for the 4th Industrial revolution and Industry 4.0 Technology” he said.

“However, the challenges are far more daunting in a populous country like India with 1.3 billion populations and more so when the country is emerging as the youngest nation in the world with 64% of its population in the working age group. As the employment opportunity shrink in large and medium industry, focus of HR need to be on MSMEs and the new HR model should enable mother plant to remain globally competitive while promoting employment eco system through MSMEs and employability eco system to bridge the skill gap in the country” added Dr Chand.

It may be mentioned that National Institute of Personnel Management (NIPM), the highest body of HR professionals in the country organized two day National Conference, NATCON-2018 at Pune, wherein large number of professional from across India & abroad are participating. Professionals from various walks of life have congratulated Dr. Chand for the award and his new model of People Management.

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has said that it is for the first time after Independence that preparation for next year’s Haj has been started immediately after completion of the current year’s Haj process in India.

 

Shri Naqvi has reviewed the Haj 2019 preparation meeting here today. Senior officials from the Ministry of Minority Affairs, Ministries of External Affairs, Civil Aviation and Health along with the representatives of Haj Committee of India, Indian Embassy and Consulate in Saudi Arabia have attended the meeting.

 

It was observed in the meeting that Haj 2018 was pro-pilgrims, even after removal of Haj subsidy. Elimination of middlemen and 100 percent online and transparent system ensured that even after removal of Haj subsidy, there was no unnecessary financial burden on pilgrims.

 

For example, actual Haj air fare from Mumbai was Rs 63,750 in 2014 while in 2018, it was Rs 59,424. From Aurangabad, was Rs 83,450 in 2014 and Rs 81,929 in 2018; from Srinagar, it was Rs 1,63,350 in 2014 and it was Rs 101,358 in 2018. From Nagpur, it was Rs 81,950 in 2014, it was Rs 69,201 in 2018. From Gaya, it was Rs 111,500 in 2014 while it was Rs 97,473 in 2018, from Hyderabad it was Rs 66,600 in 2014 and Rs 65,832 in 2018.

 

In 2017, a total of Rs 1030 crore was paid to airlines for air fare for 1,24,852 Haj pilgrims. Whereas, in 2018, a total of Rs 973 crore were paid to airlines for 1,28,702 Haj pilgrims, going through Haj Committee of India. It means, Rs 57 crore less was paid to airlines this year even after ending the Haj subsidy.

 

Shri Naqvi said that Haj 2018 was successful. For the first time after the Independence, a record number of 1,75,025 Muslims from India performed Haj this year and that too without any subsidy.

 

The Minister said that last year, the Ministry of Minority Affairs, in cooperation with Saudi Arabia Haj Consulate, Haj Committee of India and other concerned agencies, had completed preparations for Haj 2018 about 2 months before schedule to ensure smooth Haj pilgrimage. This time, preparations for Haj 2019 are started 3 months before schedule. 

 

Shri Naqvi thanked the Saudi Arabia Government and other concerned agencies in India for successful and smooth Haj 2018.

 

He said that safety and better facilities, medical facilities for the pilgrims is the priority of the Government and there will be no lackadaisical approach on the matter.

 

In the meeting, several issues were discussed regarding Haj 2019 such as Haj application process, accommodation, transport and medical facilities for pilgrims etc.

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said that despite of being victim of political intolerance, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has taken the country forward on the path of “Inclusive Growth”. 

While laying foundation stone of first world class educational institute being established with the assistance of the Ministry 0f Minority Affairs, at Kohrapipli village in Kishangarh Bas of Alwar district in Rajasthan, Shri Naqvi said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has worked with commitment to “Inclusive Growth” without any discrimination and he did not allow “vote bank politics” to dominate the government’s “Determination for Development”. Shri Naqvi also inaugurated various other development works there. 

The Minister said that it was a tough challenge to kill the “termites of corruption” and remove the “stains of failures”, received as “legacy” from the earlier regime at the Centre. But Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been successful in fulfilling his commitment for the development of all sections of the society. He said that the Central Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has worked on war-footing to ensure affordable, accessible and quality education to all the needy, poor students, including Minorities. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s efforts are crystal clear on the ground level. 

Shri Naqvi said that the first world class educational institute in Alwar district will start functioning in 2020. The Rajasthan Government has given 15 acres of land in Kohrapipli village in Kishangarh Bas tehsil of Alwar district for this institute. World class skill development centre, educational facilities for primary and higher studies, Ayurveda and Unani science and sports facilities will be established here. The Ministry has proposed 40 per cent reservation for girls in this institution. A three-member committee of the Ministry’s officials and members of Maulana Azad Education Foundation has been constituted to chalk out the entire process of this institute. Soon, the detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared regarding construction and other process for the institute. The institute will be established through Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. 

Shri Naqvi said that during the last about 4 years, the Government’s “Empowerment without Appeasement” policy has ensured a record, about 3 crore students belonging to poor and weaker sections of Minorities have been benefitted from various scholarship programmes. The beneficiaries include about 1 crore 63 lakh girls. He said that school dropout rate among Muslim girls, which was earlier more than 70 per cent, has now been reduced to about 35-40 per cent due to awareness and educational empowerment programmes of the Central Government. The goal is to bring it down to zero per cent. Transparent and hassle-free scholarship system has played a key role in this regard. This year, ""National Scholarship Portal Mobile App"" (NSP Mobile App) has been launched which will ensure a smooth, accessible and hassle-free scholarship system for students from poor and weaker sections.

Shri Naqvi said that Ministry of Minority Affairs has worked with commitment to “3E- Education, Employment & Empowerment”. In the last about one year, thousands of educational institutions of  Minority communities including Madarsas, have been included in the mainstream education system by connecting them with ""3T-Teacher, Tiffin, Toilet"". More than 5 lakh 43 thousand youths have been provided employment and employment opportunities through job-oriented skill development schemes such as Seekho aur Kamao, Usttad, Garib Nawaz Kaushal Vikas Yojana, Nai Manzil etc. During the last one year, more than 1 lakh 18 thousand artisans have been provided employment and employment opportunities at national as well as international markets through “Hunar Haat”. 

Shri Naqvi said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi-led Government has expanded development programmes for Minorities in 308 districts of the country from just 100 districts earlier. For the first time after the Independence, a campaign has been started on war-footing to provide basic amenities to ensure educational empowerment of girls belonging to Minority communities in 308 districts across the country. 

Keeping in mind the educational empowerment and employment oriented skill development of Minorities especially girls, the Government, is providing school, college, polytechnic, girls hostel, ITI, skill development centre etc under “Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karykram” (PMJVK) in those “backward and ignored” areas which had been deprived of these facilities since the Independence.

Reiterating the discussions of the ministerial sessions held on day one of RE-Invest 2018, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Renewable Energy, Government of India, Mr. G K Gupta, said “Like the telecom revolution, where prices were brought down from Rs. 16 per minute to a few paisas per minute, now is the time for a similar revolution for the Renewable Energy sector.”

Opining his views at the technical session: storage solution in Renewable, Chief Executive Officer, Emergent Ventures, Mr. Vinod Kala, who was the moderator of the session underlined the need for creating a conducive policy and regulatory framework that gives impetus to domestic manufacturing, demand creation and allows integrated e-mobility requirement seamlessly. Stating the demand portfolio for renewable energy batteries he said, “Ancillary services market should also be kept in mind.”

Lauding the Kusum Yojana at the special session: India’s Energy Basket 2030, Chairman Elect, Global Solar Council (GSC) Mr. Pranav. R Mehta, said, “With Kusum, instead of asking for electricity, our farmers will be supplying electricity.”

Laying impetus on private sector’s contribution to the renewable energy sector at the Technical Session: ‘Next Gen Renewables’, Head of Department Energy System Analysis, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems Dr. Thomas Schlegl, offered technological collaboration with Indian institutes at the  Fraunhofer Institute, Germany. Fellow, Brookings India, Dr. Rahul Tongia, who was the moderator at the session, stated that the technological disruption should be analyzed for the renewable energy sector and should be factored in for application.

Stating the policy requirements for installation of solar rooftops, panelist at a session named ‘The Sun Overhead: India’s Rooftop Solar Programme’s panelists said “Awareness among customers about rooftop technology is critical. Rather than focusing on subsidization of rooftop panels for households, the industry needs to work together for faster installation capacity, in order to reach the target of 40GW of solar rooftops.”

                Leading bankers and renewable energy financing experts from multi-lateral agencies discussed solutions to issues pertaining to financing of renewable energy projects, and how access to financing can be improved to expand clean energy projects across the world, at a Plenary Session titled ‘Bankers’ Perspective on Renewables’, of the 2nd Global RE-Invest India-ISA Partnership Renewable Energy Investors’ Meet & Expo (RE-Invest 2018) at Greater Noida today.

The panel discussion had representation from World Bank, International Energy Agency, Germany’s KfW, Citigroup, and leading Indian companies Power Finance Corporation (PFC), Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), Yes Bank and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA).

In the session, Director (Projects), Power Finance Corporation Shri Chinmoy Gangopadhyay said, “We are trying to look at solar energy projects from the angle of their long term viability. As there are very little entry barriers in the solar business, so everyone has entered and promoters try to move out in a few years. This sometimes creates difficulty in assessing the viability of projects.”

“There are also issues with regard to the quality of solar panels. There is no benchmark to assess the quality of solar panels. Suppliers who are tier one today, fall out of that position later and there is difficulty in ascertaining quality,” Gangopadhyay added.

Solar energy projects have been discovering tariffs much lower than grid prices. Experts in the panel discussion said they feel these low prices would affect the long term viability of solar energy projects. Michael Eckhart, MD and Global Head of Environmental Finance and Sustainability, Citigroup, offered a solution to this problem. “To ensure the long term viability of solar energy projects, in Argentina, in Mexico, and everywhere else, including in India, I am recommending that there be two parameters for procurement of solar energy – the lowest cost, and a debt service ratio, a measure of how financially viable is a project, at that price (of solar energy). What I fear is that with all these low price bid procurements of solar energy, five to ten years from now we will have a wave of project refinances,” Mr. Eckhart said.

Eckhart congratulated India on the policy initiatives that the country has taken, and the nimbleness of policy shown here, to ensure the holistic development of the solar energy sector. “India’s UDAY program for refinancing energy utilities is the perfect model for the world to follow. I really think India is becoming a model for the world in renewable energy. I have recommended to the ISA to prepare a case study on what India has done in renewable energy and educate the world,” Mr. Eckart said.

                A session titled ‘A Leap Into Offshore’ was held at the 2nd Global RE-INVEST India-ISA Partnership Renewable Energy Investors Meet & Expo at Greater Noida on 3rd October, 2018. Moderated by Mr Steve Sawyer, Secretary General, Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), the session saw top global experts lauding India’s 30 GW offshore wind industry target by 2030. 

Mr Morten Dyrholm, Global Senior Vice President, Marketing, Public Affairs and Communication, Vestas said: “We should indeed applaud the Indian government to set the bar high. We are very optimistic but India needs a fresh approach because we cannot copy-paste the European example here.”  Mr Morten Bæk, Vice Minister, Ministry of Energy, Utilities and Climate, Denmarktoo called India’s 30GW offshore target “an ambitious and impressive one.”

The National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) has called for ‘Expression of Interest’ for the first offshore wind energy project of India, a 1000 MW offshore wind energy project in Gulf of Khambat, off the coast of Gujarat.MNRE plans to install at least 5 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2022.

Mr Raj Gopal, Principal Secretary-Energy and Petrochemical Department, Government of Gujarat, urged everyone to look at the OFTO model. “The on-shore wind sites are getting saturated and the advantages of off-shore energy are evident. Developers need to collaborate and bring synergy. We also need to think of storage.”

Mr Rajnish Sharma, Technology Director, Wind & Low Carbon Solutions, Equinorshared “there is a lot of drive in corporate India combined with passion and yes-we-can-do mentality. However, it is also important to have a realistic timeline.”  

Mr Bhanu Pratap Yadav, Joint Secretary, MNRE remarked that India is moving cautiously, but firmly in the direction towards offshore winds. 

Mr UlrikStridbæk, VP, Head of Regulatory Affairs, ØrstedWind Poweragreed saying: “The Indian government and policy makers are on the right path as they have set clear targets. The scenario is very promising. The clarity and transparency is helpful for us developers. Off shore wind power is the shooting star in the renewable energy sector and it is competing with conventional technologies and driving cost reduction.”

                The Chief Minsters’ Plenary Session at the 2nd Global RE-INVEST India-ISA Partnership Renewable Energy Investors Meet & Expo saw representatives of Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Uttar Pradesh sharing the renewable energy policy initiatives implemented by these states and their vision for capacity expansion.

The session was moderated on October, 3, 2018 by Shri Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, Confederation of Indian Industries. 

Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, Shri Jai Ram Thakur shared that Himachal Pradesh is planning to allot a solar power project of 1000 MW in Lahaul Spiti, and has taken several steps to attract investments in renewable energy. “Himachal Pradesh is offering land at Re 1 per square meter for renewable energy projects. The state has deferred royalty payments from renewable energy projects. Additionally, Himachal Pradesh has also taken another step to encourage the investors by declaring that for renewable energy projects of up to 25MW, state electricity board will buy power directly.” 

Chief Minister of Puducherry, Shri V Narayanasamy said, “The government must support innovation in renewable energy to achieve India’s ambitious targets. The government should protect domestic investors from foreign investors. It must provide subsidy, tax holiday for domestic players to set up solar panel manufacturing facilities in India.” He added, “Puducherry is a Union Territory and needs the government’s support to develop its renewable energy sector. The government’s renewable energy policy should be implementable, feasible and acceptable.”  

Briefing about the renewable energy initiatives of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lt Governor of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Admiral (Retd) Devendra Kumar Joshi said, “Andaman & Nicobar is witnessing the development of world class infrastructure and tourism projects. There will therefore be increased demand for energy and an opportunity to invest in the renewable energy sector. Projects of 45 MW of solar energy in and around Port Blair alone are planned to be set up. All new buildings in cities will mandatorily have provision for roof-top solar and this policy will be extended to rural areas.”  

Minister of Additional Energy Sources in the Government of Uttar Pradesh Shri BrajeshPathak, said, “The UP government has provided for single window online clearance of rooftop solar. We have also provided 100% stamp duty exemption on land bought for setting up solar energy plants. Additionally, UP is providing 50% concession on charges on solar electricity sold within the state and 100% concession on solar electricity sold outside the state.”

Shri Pathak called for a solar revolution akin to the country’s telecom revolution. “Every house should install a 5KW roof top panel and reap the returns.We shall extend all our support to institutional investors as well as to individual households to adopt solar energy. Lucknow alone has 700 km of rooftops, which can be used for solar energy generation”, he added.

                The Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the first Assembly of the International Solar Alliance at Vigyan Bhawan. The same event also marked the inauguration of the second IORA Renewable Energy Ministerial Meeting, and the 2nd Global RE-Invest (Renewable Energy Investors’ Meet and Expo). The Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, was present on the occasion.

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that in the last 150 to 200 years, mankind has depended on fossil fuels for energy needs. He said nature is now indicating that options such as solar, wind and water, offer more sustainable energy solutions. In this context, he expressed confidence that in future, when people talk of organisations for the welfare of mankind established in the 21st century, the International Solar Alliance will be at the top of the list. He said this is a great forum to work towards ensuring climate justice. He said the International Solar Alliance could replace OPEC as the key global energy supplier in the future.

The Prime Minister said that the effect of increased use of renewable energy is now visible in India. He added that India is working towards the goals of the Paris Agreement through an action plan. He said that the target is to generate 40 percent of India's total energy requirements in 2030, by non fossil fuel based sources. He said India is developing with a new self-confidence of ""Poverty to Power.""

The Prime Minister said that besides solar and wind power, India is working on biomass, biofuel and bio-energy. He said efforts are being made to make India's transport system clean fuel based. He said that by converting bio-waste to biofuel, India is converting a challenge into an opportunity.  He emphasized that if the dream of “One World, One Sun and One Grid” is followed, uninterrupted power supply can be ensured.  

Mr. Modi announced plans to launch a National Energy Storage Mission that will look at manufacturing, deployment, technology development and policy framework.  

Addressing the gathering, Secretary General of United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres said that climate change is an existential threat for all.  He emphasized that the International Solar Alliance represents the future of energy scenario the world over.  Pointing out that the world is witnessing a global renewable energy revolution, the UN Secretary General hoped that the age of fossil fuels will end with a replacement for them.  Mr. Guterres said that he would convene a Climate Summit next December to bring climate action to the top of international agenda.  

Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister of External Affairs, Ms. Sushma Swaraj said that the International Solar Alliance is an endearing reality.  She pointed out that the goal of the three events inaugurated today is to promote sustainable development for a better world.  

            A short film on the ‘Journey of Renewable Energy in India” was screened.   Another film on Student Initiative on Solar Lamp was also shown on the occasion.  100 students from various schools lit the Solar Study Lamp at the inaugural function.  

            Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Renewable Energy and Power, Mr. R.K Singh presented saplings to the dignitaries on the occasion.  Mr. R.K Singh also delivered the vote of thanks.

The Business and Technical Sessions of ISA Assembly, IORA Meet and RE-INVEST 2018 Expo will be held at India Expo Mart, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh from October 3-5, 2018.

 

INTERNATIONAL SOLAR ALLIANCE

 

International Solar Alliance (ISA), an alliance of 121 solar resource rich countries lying fully or partially between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.  ISA was jointly launched by the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi, and the then President of France, Mr. François Hollande, on  November 30, 2015 in Paris, France on the side-lines of the 21st Conference of Parties (CoP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The ISA Framework Agreement was opened for signature on 15 November 2016 in Marrakech, Morocco, on the side-lines of CoP-22.

The vision and mission of the International Solar Alliance is to provide a dedicated platform for cooperation among solar resource rich countries that lie completely or partial between the Tropics of Capricorn & Cancer, the global stakeholders, including bilateral and multilateral organizations, corporates, and industry to make a positive contribution to assist and help achieve the common goals of increasing the use of solar energy in meeting energy needs of prospective ISA member countries in a safe, convenient, affordable, equitable and sustainable manner.

In conformity with the ISA Framework Agreement, 30 days after ratification by the 15th country, on December 6, 2017, ISA became the first full-fledged treaty based international intergovernmental organization headquartered in India. Through this initiative, the countries, inter alia, share the collective ambition: (i) to address obstacles that stand in the way of rapid and massive scale-up of solar energy; (ii) to undertake innovative and concerted efforts for reducing the cost of finance and cost of technology for immediate deployment of competitive solar generation; and (iii) to mobilise more than 1000 Billion US Dollars of investments by 2030. The Government of India has committed Rs.175 crore for setting up of ISA and till date released a sum of Rs 145 crore for creating a corpus fund, building infrastructure and meeting day to day recurring expenditure.

On March 11, 2018, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and the President of France, Mr. Emmanuel Macron co-hosted the founding conference of the International Solar Alliance (ISA). 48 countries, including 25 Heads of States participated in this conference. In addition, there were representations from the United Nations, multilateral development banks, energy-related think tanks, corporate sector and civil society.

The Delhi Solar Agenda, adopted in the Founding Conference of the ISA, states that the ISA member States inter-alia have agreed to pursue an increased share of solar energy in the final energy consumption in respective national energy mix, as a means of tackling global challenges of climate change and as a cost-effective solution by supporting and implementing policy initiatives and participation of all relevant stakeholders, as applicable, in respective States.

Till date, out of 121 prospective member countries that lie either fully or partially between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, 70 countries have signed the Framework Agreement of the ISA. 44 of these countries have ratified the ISA treaty.

The first Assembly, in a way, will lay the foundation for global Solar Agenda. The Assembly, as supreme decision making body of the ISA, will steer the process to significantly harness solar energy for achieving universal energy access at affordable rates. The Assembly will adjudicate upon various administrative, financial and programme related issues. Hon’ble Ministers from ISA countries have been invited for the Assembly. The countries that have ratified the ISA Treaty Framework will attend the Assembly as Members. Countries that have signed but are yet to ratify the ISA Treaty Framework will attend the Assembly as Observers. Till date, 75 country delegations have confirmed participation. This includes 36 member countries, 24 observer countries, 12 prospective member countries and 3 partner country. Ministerial level participation has been confirmed from 22 member countries, 10 observer countries and 3 prospective member countries.

Panchayats have a significant role to play in effective and efficient implementation of flagship schemes for transformation of rural India. The GDPD will be an intensive and structured exercise for planning at Gram Sabha level through convergence between Panchayati Raj institutions and concerned departments of the State. As part of this Campaign, it is also proposed to complete the exercise of Mission Antodaya (MA) data collection in respect of all Gram Panchayats. This is currently available for about 44,111 GPs and is required to be collected for the balance number of GPs out of a total about 2.49 lakh GPs.

In view of the large scale of the campaign, a special social media campaign has been launched for this period to ensure outreach to the community. This will consist of information about the Panchayats and about the Gram Panchayat Development Plan. It will also have snippets about the type of activities that can be taken up and showcasing of best practices from various Panchayats, so that these can be replicated. In order to enthuse members of the Gram Sabhas, bytes from opinion makers at different levels will also be shared.

                Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Statistics & Programme Implementation, Shri Vijay Goel, inaugurated the Online Assurances Monitoring System(OAMS), developed by the Union Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. This system has made the information regarding assurances given on the floor of the Houses of Parliament paper less and available in digital format.

Different Ministers, while giving replies to questions or making statements in Parliament, give assurances on the floor of the House. The Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs culls out such assurances from the proceedings of the House, based on the guidelines for this purpose, and sends the extract of those assurances to the concerned Ministries for their fulfilment.

With the inauguration of the OAMS, all assurances being culled out by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs through e-Office would be reflected on this system and various Ministries/Departments, Lok Sabha Secretariat and Rajya Sabha Secretariat would communicate for all purposes through this system. This would encompass various actions related to Parliamentary Assurances including sending implementation reports, request for dropping, request for extension and decision thereon. Here after, physical communication would not be accepted.

A number of problems arise in the process of fulfilment of assurances due to human factors and non-compliance of guidelines, making the process less transparent. Three different modules in Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs were respectively running, leading to mismatch of data. Hence, the need arose for an online assurances monitoring system to track the exact status of pending assurances and expedite their fulfilment.

Based on suggestions received from the officers of different Ministries/Departments and officers of Rajya Sabha Secretariat and Lok Sabha Secretariat, above software has been developed by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs keeping in view the existing guidelines and prevailing practices.The Ministry also undertook a capacity building exercise by imparting training on operation of this software to 84 nodal officers of various Ministries/Departments on 24.4.2018 and 01.05.2018. IDs and passwords were provided to these nodal officers during training.

Since 2007, a total of 26,830 assurances given by the Ministers on the floor of the Houses were culled out by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, out of which 21,439 assurances have been fulfilled and 1,903 have been dropped, leaving a total of 3,488 assurances still pending for compliance. Information regarding OAMS, including data and figures, is available on the web portal oams.nic.in.

During the inauguration of OAMS, Shri S.N. Tripathi, Secretary (Parliamentary Affairs), along with other officers of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, officers from Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Lok Sabha Secretariat and different Ministries/Departments the Government of India were present.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the Vigilance Awareness Week 2018 function organised by the Central Vigilance Commission in New Delhi today (October 31, 2018). The theme of this year’s Vigilance Awareness Week is ‘Eradicate Corruption – Build a New India’.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said eradicating corruption is the foremost condition for creating a new India. He emphasised that the confidence of our people that decisions and actions are being undertaken with transparency, accountability and fairness must continuously be enhanced. Technology and the Internet can be of great use in this regard. He noted that the GEM online platform has been introduced to improve transparency and prevent corruption in the public procurement process. From extending banking facilities to previously unbanked sections of our people to implementing the GST regime, various endeavours have been made to boost the formal economy. And adoption of digital systems has also helped contain corruption. In this manner, loopholes for misuse of public money are being addressed.

The President said that there is a serious effort to curb and punish economic offences, and to give habitual offenders a sense of fear of the law. Legislative measures have been taken – for instance the Amendment to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the enforcement of the Benami Property Act as well as the promulgation of the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) & Imposition of Tax Act 2015. The Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill has also been introduced in Parliament. Such initiatives give confidence to honest citizens and tax payers.

In his address, MoS (PP) Dr Jitendra Singh highlighted the Government’s policy of zero tolerance towards corruption and enumerated various legislative measures including the amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act brought about by the Government to fight corruption. While the bribe giver was also made part of prosecution process, safeguards have been provided to protect honest officials, he added. The Minister said that the Disciplinary rules have been amended and interviews to lower levels posts have been done away with. He lauded the CVC’s efforts towards preventive vigilance and particularly mentioned its report on 100 top bank frauds, which has provided valuable insights.

The Central Vigilance Commissioner Shri KV Chowdary, in his welcome address, said that rooting out corruption would be possible only with the participation of citizens. Listing the negative effects of corruption he said it increases business costs, negatively affects financial investments and impacts the poor the most as they pay a high percentage of their income as bribes. He said as part of increasing vigilance awareness, several outreach activities have been undertaken by banks, PSUs and other organisations through screening of short films and holding essay and debate competitions among students. Online reporting of corruption complaints has been made possible through internet by several organisations, he said.

On the occasion, the President presented the ‘Vigilance Excellence Awards’ to acknowledge and appreciate efforts made by the organizations in their fight against corruption. The awards instituted in 2017 are intended to bring forth new ideas related to anti-corruption, and to give recognition to organizations for making a positive contribution to their efficiency and effectiveness. 

The Commission has instituted awards for Central Public Sector Enterprises, Public Sector Banks, Ministries/ Departments/Organizations in the following categories:

The awards are graded as ‘Outstanding’ and ‘Excellent’ for their contribution by the organization, based on the work done by the CVOs/Vigilance wings as well as by Management in the above mentioned categories.

The delegation submitted a memorandum pointing out that based on certain inputs which, according to them, were incorrect, from the Ministry of Defence and DG (Pers.) of E-in-C, the issue of creation of one post of Joint Director General (Resource) has got complicated. Later, the DoPT also raised certain queries and the matter has got delayed. They also noted that it was after 70 years of independence that under the present government, on 15th December 2017, the first-ever cadre review of Barrack & Store Cadre of MES had got approved

The members of the delegation requested the Minister to take a considerate view and issue directions to the concerned officials to revisit their promotion file so that the queries raised by the DoPT could be resolved.

Dr Jitendra Singh gave a patient hearing to the delegation and  issued directions to the concerned officials to study the case in depth and suggest what best could be done under the circumstances.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the 13th Annual Convention of the Central Information Commission (CIC) here today.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that free flow of information is the essence of democracy. And for the people of a free and free-spirited country, information is power. They have a right to know how they are being governed, how public money is being spent, how public and national resources are being deployed, how public services are being delivered, and how public works and welfare programmes are being carried out. In a democracy, there is no such thing as too much information. Information overload is always preferable to information deficit.

The President said that RTI is not a standalone. It is part of the larger narrative of strengthening Indian democracy, of ensuring transparency across systems of governance, and of building capacities of the common citizen to enable him or her to take informed decisions and make informed choices. Above all, it is about nurturing the social contract of trust between the citizen and the state – where both must have faith in each other. A related and parallel implication is to ensure rational use of public resources to check instances of corruption or waste.

Speaking on the occasion, the Union Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said the Government is committed to strengthening the RTI Act and Institutions. He said the number of Public Authorities brought under the RTI Act have increased from 1,600 to 2,092 during the last four years. The disposal rate of RTI applications has also increased from 20,147 in March, 2014 to 29,005 this year. As regards Pendency, there are more than 40,000 cases at present as compared to 24,351 in August, 2010. The increasing number of RTI cases is a result of the transparency in Governance process ushered in by the Government under the leadership of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, he added.

Stating that the CIC at present has six Information Commissioners besides the Chief Information Commissioner, Dr. Jitendra Singh said the Government has already initiated the process of selection of CIC and ICs as vacancies are scheduled to arise soon. “We will neither hold back nor delay appointment (of CIC/ICs),” he added.

In his welcome speech, the CIC Shri RK Mathur reiterated the Commission is constantly working towards improving delivery of information under the RTI Act. Status of RTI appeals has been made entirely online and can be tracked in realtime, he added.

Information Commissioners, CIC, Shri Yashovardhan Azad and Prof. M.S Acharyulu were among the dignitaries present.

The two day Regional Conference on ‘Good Governance Initiatives,’ got underway at Kohima today. The Conference, held under the theme “Capacity Building / Technology / Best Practices by Aspirational Districts”, is being organized by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) in collaboration with the Nagaland Government.

 

Addressing the inaugural function as the Chief Guest, Shri Neiphiu Rio, Chief Minister of Nagaland said Good Governance is not an option of the Government, but a basic right for all citizens and the government is duty bound to provide it. He said clean and accountable government is a basic necessity. Pointing out that expectations and aspirations of the citizens have risen over the years and today citizens demand the best services, he said we need to learn from each other, adopt the best practices and ensure that successful models are replicated. Shri Rio reminded the need to focus more on initiatives that are sustainable and can be scaled up.

 

Maintaining that technology is  a tool to improve service delivery, Shri Rio said IDs like Aadhaar have helped us to ensure that benefits are better targeted. He also said the spread of banking and mobile telephony has enabled Direct Cash Transfers and JAM- Jandhan- Aadhaar-Mobile trilogy has helped better implementation of schemes. Highlighting the challenges faced by northeast in the adoption of digital payments and DBT, Shri Rio said that the northeast faces poor connectivity and limited outreach of banks while several blocks have no banking facility. In order to truly benefit from the mobile and banking revolution, he stressed the need to focus on improving connectivity and bank network in northeast.  He also said that most of the 14 aspirational districts of northeast are facing challenges of physical connectivity and infrastructure. Shri Rio said such physical distance also leads to a developmental gap.

 

While stating that participation of delegates from all northeastern states will give an opportunity to learn from each other and evolve strategies to improve governance, Shri Rio expressed the hope that the conference will come up with an action plan and a roadmap which will not only help northeastern states but will also provide solutions and answers that can be replicated across the country.

 

Shri K.V. Eapen, Secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG), Government of India also addressed the inaugural function. He stated that the states could avail funds for replication of Good Governance Initiatives under State Collaboration Initiative of the Government of India in DARPG. He also briefed about the Priority Programmes for PM Awards to be given away on next Civil Services Day. He expressed the hope that sharing of the outstanding and awarded initiatives would help in accelerating their replication.

 

Smt. Vasudha Mishra, Additional Secretary, DARPG presented the Vote of Thanks. Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog addressed the participants through Video Conference.

 

The two day event is the 30th in the series of such Regional Conferences held across the country and is being organized to create a common platform to share experiences in the formulation and implementation of best practices in citizen centric governance, improved public service delivery through e-governance, transparent, accountable and citizen-friendly effective administration.

 

In today’s technical session, 11 presentations followed by panel discussions were made in five sessions covering the topics of Technology for Good Governance, Transforming Aspirational Districts, Citizen Centric Services, PM Awarded Initiatives and Capacity Building. The two-day Regional Conference on Good Governance Initiatives will conclude tomorrow.

Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

 


	
	
		Crude oil production by ONGC during September, 2018 was 1711.27 TMT which is 7.71%lower than the monthly target and7.21%lower when compared with September, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-September, 2018 was 10676.15 TMT which is 4.83%lower than target for the period andlowerby 5.54% thanproduction during corresponding period of last year. Reason for shortfall are as under:
	
	


 


	ESP problem in wells of NBP field.
	Less than planned production from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUsSagarSamrat and SagarLaxmi.
	Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of Mumbai High &NeelamHeera Asset, resulting in flow restrictions.


 


	
	
		Crude oil production by OIL during September, 2018 was274.28 TMT which is 10.29%lower than monthly target and 0.91% lower when compared with September, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-September, 2018 was 1685.69 TMT which is 6.00% lower than target for the period andmarginally lower by 0.49% than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is less than planned contribution from work over wells and drilling wells. 
	
	


 


	
	
		Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during September, 2018 was 812.30 TMT which is 2.75% lower than the monthly target but 1.65% higher than September, 2017.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-September, 2018 was 5047.61 TMT which is 1.67% lower than target for the period but marginally higher by0.37% than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is closing of wells due to high water cut; require WOJ and liquid handling constraint at MPT plant.

Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production

 

 


	
	
		Natural gas production by ONGC during September, 2018 was 2005.99 MMSCM which is 5.56% lower than the monthly targetbut 3.53% higher when compared with September, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC duringApril-September, 2018 was 12017.82MMSCM which is 5.99% lower than the cumulative target but2.93% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year.The reasons for shortfall are as under:
	
	


 


	
	
		
		
			Gas Production from Eastern Offshore restricted. The new 24” Pipeline being laid by M/s GAIL is expected to be completed by end Oct’2018.
			Less than planned gas production from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUs SagarSamrat and SagarLaxmi.
		
		
	
	


 


	
	
		Natural gas production by OIL during September, 2018 was 228.37 MMSCM which is 12.98% lower than the monthly targetand7.18% lower than September, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-September, 2018 was 1365.78 MMSCM which is 14.10% lower than the cumulative target and7.80% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year.The reason for shortfall is due to lower gas production potential on account of loss of production from few high production wells in Deohal area.
	
	


 


	
	
		Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during September, 2018 was 449.84 MMSCM which is 13.00% lower than the monthly target and16.63% lower when compared with September, 2017.

		CPSE Refineries’ production during September, 2018 was 12302.80TMT which is 1.45%higher than the target for the month and 8.96%higher when compared with September, 2017.Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-September, 2018 was 74795.12 TMT which is 2.17% higher than the target for the period and 6.59% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:
	
	


 


	IOCL, Barauni: Throughput is lower due toGas Oil ullage constraint due to HSD containment and DHDT interruption.
	IOCL, Gujarat: Throughput is lower due to low North Gujarat Crude.
	IOCL, Paradip: Throughputis lower due to CCRU interruption and HSD containment due to HSD tanker berthing delay.


 

3.2    Production in JV refineries during September, 2018 was 1012.94TMT which is 14.59% higher than the target for the month but 37.50% lowerwhen compared with September, 2017.Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-September, 2018 was 8718.97 TMT which is 7.44% higher than the target for the period and34.44%higherthan the production during corresponding period of last year.Reason for shortfall in throughput is due to shutdown in BORL on account of its planned turnaround which commenced on 17.08.2018.

                Government of India’s one of the key initiative towards energy security of the country - the strategic petroleum reserves program, envisions creation of additional crude oil reserves facilities in Private Public  Partnership (PPP)  mode and the road show for the same was launched here today by Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas ( MoP&NG) and Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (SDE).



Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pradhan said that on world energy landscape, India is the 3rd largest consumer of energy and also the 3rd largest importer of crude oil in the world. With Indian economy growing rapidly, energy demand is forecasted to grow more than any other country in the world in the next two decades. India has a very large requirement of petroleum fuels. Demand for petroleum products has been increasing at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2013 to 2017. He said that our domestic production will be unable to meet our ever increasing domestic demand of petroleum fuels and petrochemicals and India will continue to depend on imports for foreseeable future. 



The Minister said that in last one year, we have also faced severe headwinds by way of rising oil prices. Since October 2017, crude prices have gone up 50% in US Dollar terms and 70% in Indian Rupee terms. Much of it is to do with geo-political events imposed on the World. We have to mitigate the impact and use the challenge as an opportunity. One of the mitigation measure is to create enough strategic reserve within the country to store adequate crude physically within the country. This will not only help in avoiding disruption in case of supply side disruptions, it will also help in reducing price volatility. 

Shri Pradhan said that with the objective to meet the energy security, Government of India formed Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited (ISPRL), a SPV under Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. To further improve strategic reserve, the union cabinet granted approval for establishing additional 6.5 MMT of strategic petroleum reserve which will be able to provide extra 12 days of supply. After a detailed study considering technical and commercial factors, two locations - Chandikhol in Odisha and Padur in Karnataka have been selected as the optimum location for these SPRs. These two SPRs will add strategic petroleum reserves of 12 days in addition to 10 days of reserves achieved in Phase I. Indian refiners maintain 65 days of crude storage, and when added to the storage planned and achieved by ISPRL, takes the Indian crude storage tally to 87 days. This is very close to the storage of 90 days mandated by IEA for member countries. On the issue of Phase-II, he said that these are large investments requiring more than 1.5 billion US dollars of capital, and the Government plans to develop this under PPP framework.

The Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dr M.M.kutty and senior officers of the Ministry, Oil companies, ISPRL, stakeholders were present on the occasion.

Background

Government of India has decided to keep the nation ahead  in the quest for  securing its vital crude oil buffer inventory by  seeking to  almost double the capacity of its underground storage caverns through the ambitious Phase-II programme which seeks Public Private Partnership in  India’s emerging Hydrocarbon Sector.

Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd. (ISPRL), a SPV created for the purpose of building the SPRs has successfully completed and commissioned the Phase I SPRs program.  

The Union Cabinet has now accorded in principle approval for the Phase-II SPR program which entails creation of additional storage facilities of  6.5 MMT of crude oil to be stored in underground rock caverns  at Chandikhol in Odisha and  Padur in Karnataka with an envisaged investment outlay of Rs.11,000 Crores(US$ 1.6 Billion). The Investment model seeks partnership through DBFOT (Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer) and offers prospective concessionaire the  rights on the crude oil inventory as per an agreed term where  the  Government of India will have the first right of refusal on the inventory in  times of exigencies. As a key takeaway the Concessionaire will have access to the large Indian refining market and multiple other revenue streams.

Underground storage of crude oil is more secure, safe, economical and environmental friendly than conventional above ground storage tanks. Many other developed countries have created crude oil reserves in different types of underground storage facilities. Conceived during early 2000s, the Indian Strategic Petroleum  Reserves Ltd. (ISPRL)  was  created  by  Government of India  as a Special Purpose Vehicle  under MoP&NG in 2004 to give wings to its vision of  building  the first of its kind strategic crude oil storages in India and to insulate the country from a volatile  crude oil supply market,  supply disruptions and  future oil shocks. The crude oil storages are constructed in underground rock caverns and are located on the east and west coast of India namely Visakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur. Crude oil from these storage installations are envisaged to cater to the Indian refineries either through pipelines or a combination of pipelines and coastal shipment. 

With a total investment of USD 600 Million towards the construction of   Phase I SPRs, the facilities at Visakhapatnam with a storage capacity of 1.33 MMT witnessed a successful part commercialisation of 0.3 MMT storage capacity. HPCL has taken over the 0.3 MMT storage capacity as part of its refinery stock holding and operation, thereby unlocking the land parcel for the ongoing refinery expansion program; the facilities at Mangalore with a storage capacity of 1.5 MMT recently witnessed a successful G2G collaboration where in ADNOC is storing 5.86 MM bbl at Mangalore SPR facility. The facilities at Padur with a storage capacity of 2.5 MMT has also been commissioned and is ready to take in crude oil inventory including through PPP mode for filling and operation of the inventory. 



The Phase-II SPR program has been planned to create additional storage capacity to cater to the wider refining and consuming hubs in the unforeseen event of a longer period of supply disruption. The envisaged PPP model promises valuable  incentives to  an array  of stakeholders looking to profit from this business alliance ranging from supply side assurance of downstream refiners;  logistics and location advantage; availability of low cost underground storage facility as an economical storage alternative; reduced captive above ground storage with flexibility of multiple grade crude oil and multiple revenue streams; suitable land parcel and geological setting for creation of SPR, promising opportunity for financing, to a foreseen certainty of cash flows due to sustained Oil & Gas demand  market .

ISPRL, the strategic arm of the Ministry of Petroleum and natural Gas, Govt of India is soliciting commercial partnerships for the Phase II SPR program and expects a keen interest from large energy stake holders both from India and abroad. To elicit expressions of interest from a wider spectrum of energy industry, investors and financing partners ISPRL is organising road shows at New Delhi, Singapore and London.

                Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas and Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan will launch the Road Show for Phase II of Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves on 17th Oct’2018, in New Delhi.

In line with the integrated energy policy of Government of India, Union Cabinet accorded “in principle” approval for Phase-II SPR program which involves creation of additional 6.5 MMT of storage in underground rock caverns and associated facilities at Chandikhol, Odisha (4.0 MMT) and Padur-II, Karnataka (2.5 MMT). (May please see http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=180215)

In order to explore feasibility of commercialisation of the Phase I SPR at Padur (2.5 MMT) and the proposed Phase II SPRs at Chandikhol, Odisha (4.0 MMT) and Padur II, Karnataka (2.5 MMT), it is planned to solicit investment partners and pursue the initiatives of Phase II SPRs through PPP mode of implementation for construction, filling, and operation respectively and also filling and operation of the existing Phase I SPR at Padur. 

To elicit interest and seek feedback from prospective investors, it is planned to conduct roadshows. Based on the evinced interests, a suitable model for on-boarding of investors/PPP partners will be prepared for an international competitive bidding for wider participation. 


The roadshow will outline the Phase I and Phase II SPR programs along with technical details, plausible financial models and the implementation modalities.

                Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has said that Energy is a global industry and oil is truly a global commodity, and hence our engagement with the global energy community has to be continuous. Speaking at CERA Week conference here today, he said that India cannot work in isolation, as from a global perspective, global market shifts, technological disruptions, financial markets & paper trading, and possible disruption in the form of energy transition  are shaping the future of energy security. He said that any action on energy must take into account the global consensus achieved by the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the “Paris Agreement” of 2015 and decisions of the G20 Leaders’ meeting in Hamburg in 2017 that regard energy security as one of the guiding principles for energy transition. He appreciated the efforts of IHS team for bringing the flagship event out of Houston and making India its home away from home for the second time.

 

Shri Pradhan said that India has taken a lead in International Solar Alliance (ISA) with 60 solar-rich countries. Two weeks back as part of the International Solar Alliance gathering in New Delhi, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi mentioned that ISA can potentially replace OPEC as the key block of supplier of energy in the world. With the falling prices of solar, we can easily achieve his idea of “One World, One Sun, One Grid”. He said that We are trying to accomplish Hon’ble PM’s vision of the energy sector – of ensuring energy access, energy security, energy affordability and energy sustainability. As the third largest consumer of energy and one of the fastest growing – in a volatile global environment, we cannot just rely on one source of energy. As Hon’ble Prime Minister had mentioned last year, like horses in Sun God’s chariot, India will harness all sources of available energy -solar, wind, hydro, coal, oil, gas, nuclear, bio-fuels etc. 

 

Mentioning about the recent progress made on the reforms and implementation of initiatives, Shri Pradhan said that in our efforts towards providing universal access of clean cooking fuel to residences, we have the Prime Minister Ujjwala Scheme, under which we had kept a target of reaching 50 million households in 3 years’ time. We achieved that milestone ahead of schedule and increased the target to 80 million. He said that besides moving to a cleaner fuel, Ujjwala has had a major impact on the health of rural women and children. It has empowered poor women also by addressing the issue of “time poverty” and encouraged them to invest in their human capital. Through innovative delivery models, use of technology, and a policy of directed subsidy – we have been able to expand the consumer market for energy.

 

The Minister said that the upstream licensing round under Discovered Small Field and the Open Acreage Licensing Policy has been successfully completed. OLAP under HELP is now a continuous process backed by a transparent data repository. Cabinet has also approved the policy to incentivize enhanced oil recovery which will further help boost upstream activity in India. He said that in a big boost to the City Gas Distribution (CGD) network expansion, in the 9th round of bidding, 86 licenses have been offered and bid out.  50% of country’s population will soon have access to local gas network, which will boost our efforts toward providing clean air in our cities and towns. India has leapfrogged from the use of BS IV to the launch of BS VI grade fuel. Even though the original target for BS VI roll-out was 2024, we advanced that to 2020 and have now rolled it out in the NCT in 2018 itself. 

 

Shri Pradhan said that we also have been giving a big push towards harnessing bio fuel with the launch of National Bio Fuel Policy of 2018. This will also contribute to PM’s commitment of doubling the farmer’s income by 2022. He mentioned about the test flight being flown from Dehradun to New Delhi with a blend of 25% bio jet fuel & 75% ATF in August this year. A scheme to promote compressed bio-gas in a big way has been launched. Expansion of the gas grid continues in the East, North-East and Southern parts of the country and several LNG regasification terminals are coming up. In the last 2 years, national oil companies have made significant acquisitions in some of the world-class producing blocks in Russia, the UAE and Oman. He said furthering the agenda for energy security, our cabinet has recently approved the second phase of building strategic oil reserves in Odisha and Karnataka. This will be done in a public-private partnership mode. 

 


Shri Pradhan said that in past one year, severe head winds have been faced by way of rising oil prices. Since the last CERA week in New Delhi, crude prices have gone up 50% in US Dollar terms and 70% in Indian Rupee terms. Much of it is to do with geo-political events imposed on the world. He solicited the suggestions towards further improving the investment climate in the oil and gas sector. He said our industry and research institutes need to come together to develop technology for CO2 Capture, Hydrogen Fuel cells, Gas Hydrates, Hydrogen-Injected CNG, Coal to gas etc.  He expressed the hope that the conference on “India’s Energy Transition: Evolution or Revolution?”  to have stimulating and productive deliberations, which will help India drawing from the rich international expertise and experience.

The foundation stone for Second Generation (2G) Ethanol Bio-refinery of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited being set up at Baulasingha village, Bhatli Tehsil, Bargarh ditrict, Odisha was laid by Governor of Odisha Professor Ganeshi Lal today. Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, along with several dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Bio-refinery, the first of its kind to be set up, will have a capacity to produce three crore litres of fuel grade Ethanol annually using Rice straw as the feedstock. Ethanol produced from this plant will be blended with Petrol. The cost of the project is around Rs 100 Crore.



Biofuels have assumed importance recently due to the growing energy security needs and environmental concerns. Several countries have put forth different mechanism and incentives to encourage production and use of biofuels to suit their domestic requirements. Indi has surplus biomass availability of about 120-160 MMT annually which if converted, has the potential to yield 3000 crore litres of ethanol. The National Biofuel Policy of India 2018 targets 20% Ethanol blending to Petrol by year 2030. However, due to non-availability of Ethanol, the current Ethanol blending in Petrol is about 3 to 4%. Setting up of 2G Ethanol plants will help achieve the target of Ethanol blending in Petrol. The Bargarh Bio-Refinery will utilize about two lakh tonnes of Rice straw annually as feedstock which will be sourced from nearby locations like Bhati, Ambabhona, Sohela, Burla, Lakhanpur, etc.


The Bio-Refineries will contribute to cleaner environment due to usage of waste Rice straw for Ethanol production thereby reducing waste straw burning in fields. Blending of Ethanol in Petrol will reduce Green House Gas emissions as compared to fossil fuels. The plant is based on Zero-liquid discharge plant technology where all water will be recycled back into the plant. In addition to cleaner environment, the project will also help improve the socio-economic conditions of the farmers due to additional income from sale of Rice straw to the bio-refinery. Also, this will generate employment for appx 1200 persons (both direct and indirect) during construction, operation of plant and supply chain management of biomass. This will boost the infrastructural development in the area and overall improvement in livelihood of people. Further, blending of ethanol enhances self-sufficiency of the Nation by reducing oil imports, thereby saving foreign exchange.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for closure of the Biecco Lawrie Limited (BLL) including giving Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS)/ Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) to the employees of the Company.

The idling assets of BLL will be subsequently put into productive use after meeting all the liabilities in accordance with the extant guidelines of the Government.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has taken various steps for revival of the Company from time to time. However, the Company could not be revived and further, there appeared no possibility of revival of the Company considering the competitive business environment as well as huge capital requirement. Continued loss has made further operations of the company not only unviable but also resulted in substantial distress to officials and staff due to uncertain future.

Background:

BLL is a Schedule ‘C’ Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) with 67.33% and 32.33% equity share held by Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB) and Government of India respectively. The remaining 0.44% shares are held by others.

The Company, having its registered Office and Headquarters at Kolkata, West Bengal operates in four business segments: Switchgear Manufacturing, Electrical Repair, Projects Division and Lube blending & filling facility.

The Company has consistently been under financial stress and has had performance-related issues. It has been making losses for the last several years. BLL’s accumulated losses had become more than the equity and the net worth had become negative. The Net worth of the Company stood  ₹ (-) 78.88 crore at the end of the FY 2017-18 and accumulated loss as on 31.03.2018 was  ₹ (-) 153.95 crore.

                Government of India today signed the contracts of the blocks awarded under the Open Acreage Licensing Programme (OALP) Bid Round-Iwith the awardees at New Delhi. The event was presided by Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, along with Dr. M. M. Kutty, Secretary (P&NG), Dr. V. P. Joy, Director General- Directorate General of Hydrocarbons and other senior officials of the Ministry. 

Initially, 110 e-bids were received for 55 blocks on offer with participation from 9 companies, singly or in consortium. Finally, contracts have been signed for all 55 blocks with 6 companies.The details of the contract areas signed is placed at Annexure 1.This will add a huge accretion of 59,282 sq.km to the exploration area. This is about 65% of the area presently under exploration in the country. This will lead to significant increase in E&P activities in India and in long run discoveries from these field maysignificantly boost domestic production.

The bid round-I of OALP was launched in January 2018 under the liberalized Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP). It is for the first time that bidding in the E&P sector in India was for blocks that had been selected by bidders themselves with government playing a facilitator role. The OALP bid round-I has received overwhelming enthusiasm from various stakeholders of E&P industry, with all 55 blocks on offer receiving bids and being awarded. 

Shri Dharmendra Pradhan congratulated the awardees and assured them of complete support and assistance from the Government. He reiterated the relentless efforts of the government to enhance domestic hydrocarbon production by putting forth new policy initiatives and new offers so that the true potential of Indian sedimentary basins is realized. The Minister said that the Companies have committed investment of about Rs 6000 Crore for exploring under this round. He said there is huge potential in these reserves and their exploration will positively impact the Indian economy. He said that the Government is working in a transparent manner, and policies are being made, after extensive consultation with all stakeholders. Shri Pradhan said that Minimum Government-Maximum Governance is not only a slogan for us, but a guiding principle. He said that India has already become third largest energy consumer in the world and the Government is committed to provide affordable energy to its citizens, and for this purpose, several initiatives have been taken to enhance the production of hydrocarbons.

                Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship today launched an innovative initiative here, with PSU Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) inviting Expression of Interest (EoI) from potential entrepreneurs to set up Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) production plants and make available CBG in the market for use in automotive fuels. The EoI are available on the websites of the OMCs and can be filled from 1st October, 2018 to 31st March, 2019.

 

Speaking on the occasion, the Petroleum Minister said that the Swachhta fortnight is being observed throughout the country, and this is a significant move in this direction. He said that the Gas is clean and cheaper mode of fuel and the Government has taken several steps to promote its production and usage. Sh Pradhan said that the Government is keen to set up 5000 CBG plants in next 5 years, and for this purpose, production offtake guarantee is being given for such plants. There will be no restriction on the technology choice and Government is incurring Rs 75,000 Crore capital expenditure for setting up infrastructure for City Gas distribution network. Besides the potential to boost availability of more affordable transport fuels, better use of agricultural residue, cattle dung and municipal solid waste, the CBG plants will provide an additional revenue source to farmers, and 75,000 direct job opportunities and lakhs of indirect jobs. He said that not only OMCs, but also other Gas distribution companies and other concerned departments should also take part in it. The Minister said that currently 42 lakh households are getting PNG supply, and there is a commitment to cover 2 crore households in 300 districts by the suppliers after the implementation of 9th round of CGD bids.

 

Titled SATAT, the initiative is aimed at providing a Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation as a developmental effort that would benefit both vehicle-users as well as farmers and entrepreneurs. This initiative holds great promise for efficient municipal solid waste management and in tackling the problem of polluted urban air due to farm stubble-burning and carbon emissions. Use of CBG will also help bring down dependency on crude oil imports and in realising the Prime Minister’s vision of enhancing farmers’ income, rural employment and entrepreneurship.

 

Background

Bio-gas is produced naturally through a process of anaerobic decomposition from waste / bio-mass sources like agriculture residue, cattle dung, sugarcane press mud, municipal solid waste, sewage treatment plant waste, etc. After purification, it is compressed and called CBG, which has pure methane content of over 95%. Compressed Bio-Gas is exactly similar to the commercially available natural gas in its composition and energy potential. With calorific value (~52,000 KJ/kg) and other properties similar to CNG, Compressed Bio-Gas can be used as an alternative, renewable automotive fuel. Given the abundance of biomass in the country, Compressed Bio-Gas has the potential to replace CNG in automotive, industrial and commercial uses in the coming years.

 

There are multiple benefits from converting agricultural residue, cattle dung and municipal solid waste into CBG on a commercial scale:

 


	Responsible waste management, reduction in carbon emissions and pollution  
	Additional revenue source for farmers
	Boost to entrepreneurship, rural economy and employment
	Support to national commitments in achieving climate change goals
	Reduction in import of natural gas and crude oil 
	Buffer against crude oil/gas price fluctuations


 

The potential for Compressed Bio-Gas production from various sources in India is estimated at about 62 million tonnes per annum. 

Compressed Bio-Gas plants are proposed to be set up mainly through independent entrepreneurs. CBG produced at these plants will be transported through cascades of cylinders to the fuel station networks of OMCs for marketing as a green transport fuel alternative. The 1,500-strong CNG stations network in the country currently serves about 32 lakh gas-based vehicles. The Working Group on Biofuels, set up under the National Policy on Biofuels 2018, is in the process of finalising a pan-India pricing model for Compressed Bio-Gas. 

 

The entrepreneurs would be able to separately market the other by-products from these plants, including bio-manure, carbon-dioxide, etc., to enhance returns on investment. 

The National Policy on Biofuels 2018 emphasises active promotion of advanced bio-fuels, including CBG. The Government of India had launched the GOBAR-DHAN (Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources) scheme earlier this year to convert cattle dung and solid waste in farms to CBG and compost. The scheme proposes to cover 700 projects across the country in 2018-19. The programme will be funded under Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) component of Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin (SBM-G) to benefit households in identified villages through Gram Panchayats. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has notified Central Financial Assistance (CFA) of Rs. 4 crore per 4,800 kg of CBG per day generated from 12,000 cubic metres of biogas per day, with a maximum of Rs.10 crore per project. 

Compressed Bio-Gas can be produced from various bio-mass/waste sources, including agricultural residue, municipal solid waste, sugarcane press mud, distillery spent wash, cattle dung and sewage treatment plant waste. The other waste streams, i.e, rotten potatoes from cold storages, rotten vegetables, dairy plants, chicken/poultry litter, food waste, horticulture waste, forestry residues and treated organic waste from industrial effluent treatment plants (ETPs) can be used to generate biogas. 

 


Going forward, Compressed Bio-Gas networks can be integrated with city gas distribution (CGD) networks to boost supplies to domestic and retail users in existing and upcoming markets. Besides retailing from OMC fuel stations, Compressed Bio-Gas can at a later date be injected into CGD pipelines too for efficient distribution and optimised access of a cleaner and more affordable fuel.

Eight States which have already achieved more than 99 per cent household electrification prior to launch of Saubhagya (Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Goa, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab and Tamil Nadu), are ineligible for participation under the award scheme. All the remaining States and their Discoms are eligible for the award.

Award will be given in three categories, (i) DISCOMs / Power Departments of Special Category States (which includes seven North Eastern States, Sikkim, J&K and Uttarakhand); (ii) DISCOMs / Power Departments of other than Special Category States (which includes Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telengana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal)having more than 5 Lakh un-electrified households and (iii) DISCOMs / Power Departments of other than Special Category States having less than 5 Lakh un-electrified households.

There will be two quantum of award in each of the three categories. Under first quantum of award, the 1stDISCOM / Power Department to achieve 100per cent household electrification by30th November 2018 would be provided cash award of Rs. 50 Lakh. The Principal Secretary (Energy/Power) of the State will devise the mechanism to distribute this cash prize amongst employees of the concerned DISCOM / Power Department. From this amount, Rs. 20 Lakh will be given to the division of DISCOM/Power Department with highest number of households electrified. Certificate of appreciation would also be given to five officials of concerned DISCOM/Power Department of any level from managing Director to Lineman to be nominated by the Principal Secretary (Energy / Power) of the States. The second quantum of awardincludes cash award of Rs. 100 Crore as grant to the concerned DISCOM/Power Department to be spent in distribution infrastructure development in their area of operation. The Principal Secretary (Energy/Power) of the State will decide work to be executed from this amount.

                Indian Railways has rationalised its freight rates to ensure additional revenue generation across the network for improved passenger amenities. 

The rationalisation of freight rates will result in a 8.75% increase in freight rates for major commodities such as coal, iron and steel, iron ore, and raw materials for steel plants. 

Furthermore, the haulage charges of containers has been increased by 5% and the freight rates of other small goods have been increased by 8.75%. 

However, the freight rates of food grains, flours, pulses, fertilisers, salt, and sugar have not been increased, keeping in mind farmers and the common man. Additionally, the freight rates of cement and petroleum (including diesel) have not been increased. 

The decision to rationalise freight rates will result in additional revenue generation for Indian Railways to the tune of Rs. 3,344 Cr. The additional revenue will further help enhance various aspects of Railways including safety, service, punctuality, etc.

                Flexi Fare Scheme was launched with effect from 9th September, 2016. The scheme generated high revenue however initially there was a drop of passengers which picked up later on. Further, to rationalise the fares an 8 member committee was formed to review the scheme and make it more passenger friendly. The review of the scheme has been done based on the recommendation of the committee, Comptroller and Auditor General’s report, and representations from passengers. The Railways has reviewed Flexi Fare Scheme and introduced following changes: 

 


	Discontinuation of Flexi-fare in trains with average monthly occupancy less than 50% throughout the previous year. (List of 15 Trains given in Annexure A)
	Discontinuation of Flexi-fare, in lean period of 3 months, in trains with average monthly occupancy between 50-75% throughout the previous year. (List of 32 Trains given in Annexure B)
	Maximum current cap of 1.5 times to be reduced to 1.4 times in all classes
	To increase the occupancy of less patronised classes (2A, 3A, CC etc.), Graded discount of 20% on last fare on all trains with Flexi Fare and Humsafar Trains where occupancy of a particular class is less than 60% (4 days prior to scheduled departure of the train). Further, 10% discount will be offered as per the table given below: 


Upto -70% occupancy     :       20% on last fare 

70-80%   occupancy        :       10% on last fare 

Above 80%   occupancy  :       Nil


	Changes shall be implemented from Advance Reservation Period (ARP) i.e. 4 months after making necessary changes in Passenger Reservation System, on an experimental basis for six months to be further extended after assessing its outcome

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved new Railway Line between Bahraich and Khalilabad via Bhinga, Shravasti, Balrampur, Utraula, Domariyaganj, Mehdawal, Bansi.   The total length of the new Broad Gauge line will be 240.26 kilometers. 

 

The total estimated cost of the project is Rs. 4939.78 crore. The project will be completed by 2024-25 and will lie in North Eastern Railway. This project will generate direct employment during construction for about 57.67 lakh man-days.

 

The new line will provide basic infrastructure support for industrial development having large socio-economic ramification. It will provide a direct broad gauge route to the project area which may boost the economic development of the region. This will also provide an alternative route of Bahraich-Khalilabad and connect border districts to each other. 

 

The approved line is passing through the district Shravasti (Bhinga) which is an important tourist place and closely associated with the life of Gautam Buddha.  Shravasti is also an important tourist centre for Jains as the Sobhanath temple is believed to be the birthplace of the Tirthankara Sambhavanath. The Devi Patan temple in Tulsipur which is close to Balrampur town, is one of the famous 51 Shakti Peethas of Maa Durga. The line will promote tourism in the region.

 

The project will provide rail facility to the people of the area falling under the project line and will help to grow small scale industries in the area. Four districts falling in this project length i.e. Bahraich, Balrampur, Shravasti and Siddharth Nagar are among the 115 aspirational districts identified by NITI Aayog. Hence, this project is needed for better socio economic development of the hinterland of this area with the help of rail network.

Recognising the pathbreaking transformations in India’s energy sector under the visionary leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design is awarding its fourth annual Carnot Prize to Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of Railways & Coal and former Minister of Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Government of India.

 

The Carnot Prize is the Kleinman Center’s annual recognition of distinguished contributions to energy policy through scholarship or practice. The most prestigious award in the energy sector, Carnot Prize is named after French physicist Nicolas Sadi Carnot who recognised that the power of the steam engine would “produce a great revolution” in human development. The Carnot Prize is intended to honour those leading revolutions in energy policy to further progress and prosperity.

 

Just like Carnot visualised the progress of mankind, the Carnot Prize recognises pioneering scholarship and path breaking policies in the energy sector. Previous winners include: Dr. Daniel Yergin, Vice chairman of IHS, Dr. Fatih Birol, Director of International Energy Agency, Gina McCarthy is a career public servant in fields of energy and environment.

 

The 2018 Carnot Prize is a recognition of India’s efforts under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, as the nation charts the path towards eliminating energy poverty with sustainable energy solutions.The rural electrification drive gave a significant breakthrough to the mission of ‘24x7 Affordable, Environment Friendly Power for all’,  as India eliminated decades of darkness in more than 19,000 villages on 28th April, 2018. With real-time monitoring, India’s energy starved people in the remotest villages of 19,000 villages saw electricity for the first time. With the Saubhagya Programme, the last-mile connectivity to every household in the villages is being fast tracked, with 51% of the 3.1 crore rural households electrified. Mark Alan Hughes, founding faculty director, Kleinman Center, commended India’s electrification drive - “Providing power to the world’s energy poor turns on the lights—and also empowers education, sanitation, and health care. It closes the gap between the haves and have nots.” 

 

India has taken rapid strides towards translating the country’s ancient ethos of environment conservation in our ambitious renewables and energy efficiency programmes. As Hon’ble Prime Minister has called climate conservation an article of faith for India, the massive thrust to green energy is reflected in India’s 175 GW target by 2022, being the world’s largest renewable expansion programme with 72 GW already achieved. As solar and wind energy market prices achieve parity in India with record low tariffs, renewables are set to become the mainstay of development in the coming years. With India becoming home to the world’s largest solar park, solar plant and single rooftop plant, the Carnot Prize recognises India’s “solid footing to reach a 40% renewable mix by 2030” (Kleinman Center for Energy Policy). As Prime Minister Modi gave the vision of “one world, one sun, one grid” while addressing the member nations of the International Solar Alliance, India is playing its role as a committed solar leader through steady progress on all green energy goals.

 

In the last four years, energy efficiency has become a people’s movement in India, making the Government’s UJALA scheme the world’s largest LED distribution programme, and along with private sector participation, 130 crore LED bulbs have been distributed, making India brighter and cleaner. It is a matter of immense pride that in several newly electrified villages, the first consumers of electricity are using LED bulbs and rooftop solar panels, realising India’s vision of sustainable, universal, and affordable energy access. 

The Carnot Prize is a recognition of India’s climate conscious and development driven energy governance that is fuelling the aspirations of 125 crore people.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the payment of Productivity Linked Bonus (PLB) equivalent to 78 days’ wages for the financial year 2017-18 for all eligible non-gazetted Railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel). The financial implication of payment of 78 days’ PLB to railway employees has been estimated to be Rs.2044.31 crore.  The wage calculation ceiling prescribed for payment of PLB to the eligible non-gazetted railway employees is Rs.7000/- p.m.  The maximum amount payable per eligible railway employee is  Rs.17,951 for 78 days. About 11.91 lakh non-gazetted Railway employees are likely to benefit from the decision.

 

The Productivity Linked Bonus on Railway covers all non-gazetted railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) who are spread over the entire country.  Payment of PLB to eligible railway employees is made each year before the Dusshera/ Puja holidays.  The decision of the Cabinet shall be implemented before the holidays for this year as well.  For the year 2017-18 PLB equivalent to 78 days’ wages will be paid which is expected to motivate the employees for working towards improving the performance of the Railways.

 

Background:

 

Railways were the first departmental undertaking of the Government of India wherein the concept of PLB was introduced in the year 1979-80. The main consideration at that time was the important role of the Railways as an infrastructural support in the performance of the economy as a whole. In the overall context of Railway working, it was considered desirable to introduce the concept of PLB as against the concept of Bonus on the lines of ‘The Payment of Bonus Act - 1965’.

                Dovetailing its steadfast cleanliness campaign with ecological priorities, Indian Railway has undertaken a committed program to increase the green cover in all public utility spaces like railway stations and mass contact offices besides other working premises and railway colonies. Laudatory participation in Shramdaan by Railways officers & employees in connection with recently organized Swacchta Hi Sewa national cleanliness campaign has been one of the strong impactful measures by the Railways and the planting of 13.27 lakh saplings during the fortnight program alongside 1300 km route kilometre of track, near station areas and on vacant land plots has been one of the noteworthy efforts to create green public spaces. 

 

Provision of Toilet as part of Swachh Bharat Mission Program

 

In keeping with its mission mode to improve sanitation on its premises, the Indian Railways has allocated Rs. 300 crore to renovation of existing toilets, construction of new toilets. The Railway has constructed/ improved1800 toilets at 1400 stations including the construction of around 200 Divyang friendly toilets. Apart from this, the railway has undertaken provision of toilets in circulating areas at railway stations for local community and surrounding area inhabitants as well as for general public visiting railway stations under the CSR initiative. 

 

Swachhta Hi Sewa program on the Railways has been a forceful communication platform that the Railways have managed to achieve in recent years. Awareness activities were stepped up to ensure greater level of hygiene and sanitation at stations, at workplaces, at workshops as well as at the railway colonies. Public participation and accountability building are being increasingly acknowledged as intrinsic factors in transforming the cleanliness profile of railway stations. User-friendly and well-designed toilets are part of the broader vision of cleanliness programs on the Railways.

The top management of Railways is open to new ideas & willing to take up new assignments for creating a ‘New Railways’. Shri Goyal talked about the remarkable progress made in elimination of Unmanned Level Crossings across Indian Railways & the convoy system in freight train movement adopted by South Central Railway recently. Forty freight trains in this convoy were able to run at higher speeds due to lack of interference from passenger trains. This concept will increase efficiency and revenues for the railway.

 

Earlier, Shri Keshav Chandra, Chairman, Organizing Committee and former Member Railway Board, welcomed the delegates and elaborated the focus areas of each session of the conference. He asked all those in the business of railways and metro transportation, as well as the larger transportation community, operators, engineers to upgrade their technical skills and knowledge, interact with specialists from various engineering disciplines, hear from the experts from India and abroad on the fine ‘art and science’ of metro building and railway modernization.

 

The second edition of the International Conference on Technological Advancements in Railways & Metro Projects is being organized on 4-5 October 2018 by DIPM Council (India). The aim is to take stock of the consolidation taking place in Railways & Metros world-wide with special focus on India, the inflow of new technologies effecting sweeping changes in manufacturing processes and operations and review of the multiple business opportunities for ‘Make in India’. Experts from various fields of Railway and Metro Operations and Infrastructure from all over the world will be participating in this International Conference being held at New Delhi.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the redevelopment of Railway Stations by Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC) as Nodal Agency and main Project Development Agency, through simplified procedures adapting various business model and for longer lease tenure of upto 99 years. Thus, paving the way for large scale modernisation and ensure world class infrastructure.

Redevelopment of major stations across the country is planned by leveraging commercial development of land and air space in and around the station. This program will help provide state-of-the-art amenities for passengers, generate additional revenues and will be overall at least cost neutral to Ministry of Railways (MoR) over a basket of stations. Furthermore, redevelopment of railway stations across the country will have a multiplier effect in the economy with increased job creation and improved economic growth.

IRSDC being the Nodal agency will prepare the overall strategic plan and business plans for individual or a group of stations ensuring cost neutrality of this program. Upon approval of business plans by MoR, IRSDC or other Project Development Agencies will take up the work of station redevelopment. Railway/RLDA/IRSDC will be planning and development authority for Railway land in consultation with urban local bodies, DDA or other UTs, to transfer land on free hold basis to Railways. This would enable Ministry of Railways to accelerate the redevelopment of major stations across the country on an overall cost neutral basis. These redevelopment efforts will lead to creation of State-of-the-art smart stations that will function as mini smart cities.

Railway passengers and Industry shall be benefited at large. Passengers will now get amenities at par with international railway terminals and a large number of local job creation is expected as a positive external outcome of this program. 

Background:

A Cabinet approval was obtained on 24th June 2015 to redevelop ‘A1’ and ‘A’ category stations by Zonal Railways through Cabinet approved procedures and for a lease period of 45 years.  However, insufficient interest was visible amongst the prospective bidders. During various interactions with developers, investors and other stakeholders, various issues including multiple sub leasing, simplified bid procedures etc. were repeatedly raised. Therefore, an improvised and simpler program design including these issues and under a specialized executing agency (IRSDC), incorporating suitable structural, process and parameters changes, has been adopted to revamp the station redevelopment program.

                The Union Minister for Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari and Kerala Chief Minister Shri Pinarayi Vijayan will lay the foundation for India’s largest Dry Dock at Cochin Shipyard in Kerala tomorrow.  The Dry Dock will give an impetus to “Make in India” initiative under Sagarmala and raise India’s share in global shipbuilding to 2 percent. India currently occupies 0.66 % share in global shipbuilding market.

 The commercial ship building industry in India is worth Rs. 3,200 Croreand focuses primarily on small-medium sized offshore vessels and cargo/bulk carriers. At present, Cochin Shipyard has two dry docks, one predominantly used for ship building of size 255m x 43 x 9m and capacity 1,10,000 DWT and the other one for ship repair of size 270 x 45 x 12m and capacity 1,25,000 DWT. 

The new Dry Dock is being constructed at a cost of Rs 1799 Crore. It will be 310 m long, 75m wide, with a depth of 13 m and drought of 9.5m. The dock will be designed to handle both ship building and repairs, and bear a load up to 600 T/m. It will be equipped with international safety standards. The dock will also have a water treatment plant and Green Belt Development. Equipped with this Dry Dock, Cochin Shipyard will be able to build specialized and technologically advanced large vessels like LNG Carriers, drill ships, jack up rigs, large dredgers, aircraft carriers for Indian Navy and high end research vessels.It will also help make Cochin a one stop maritime hub for all repair needs in South East Asia. 

The project is expected to be completed by May 2021 and generate employment opportunities for about 2000 people.

Two 500 capacity passenger vessels built by CSL for Andaman and Nicobar Islands administration will also be launched on the occasion. These vessels will help enhance intra island connectivity.

 

Shri Gadkari will also lay the foundation stone for three National Highways projects in Kerala, costing Rs 1557 Crore at an event in Eranholi in Thalassery in Kannur district. These would include the construction of the 18.6 km, 4 lane Thalassery – Mahe bypass (NH-66) at a cost of Rs 1181 Crore ; construction of 0.78 km, 4-lane Railway Over Bridge near Neeleshwaram town (NH-66) at a cost of Rs 82 Crore and widening of 46.72 km from Nattukal to ThanavuJn (NH-66) to two lane with paved shoulder at a cost of Rs 294 Crore .

                The Union Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation held a meeting with the Myanmar Minister for Communication and Transport Mr U Thant Sin Maung in New Delhi today to discuss the progress of the ongoing India – Myanmar Transport Connectivity Projects. The two sides discussed the status of the project for upgradation of the Kalewa-Yagyi stretch of the India-Myanmar-Thailand (IMT) Trilateral Highway, starting Imphal-Mandalay bus service and a bilateral Motor Vehicles Agreement between the two countries. 

The upgradation of the Kalewa-Yagyi stretch of IMT is being executed by National Highways Authority of India. NHAI informed that the project is running well within time and they hope to complete it before the scheduled date of completion. 

The two sides also expressed keenness to start the Imphal-Mandalay bus service soon. India and Myanmar had operationalized the Land Border Crossing Agreement earlier this year. The agreement allows nationals from the two countries holding valid passport and visa to cross over without requiring special permission. Now both countries have to select bus operators to run the service. Once the service starts, bus from India will take passengers to Myanmar border where they will transfer to the bus run by Myanmar operator for travelling further into Myanmar. Likewise, India bound Myanmar nationals will transfer into bus run by Indian operator for further travel into India.

                Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya, Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways and Chemical & Fertilizer today launched the Youth Road Safety Learners Licence programme in New Delhi today. The programme is a PPP initiative to be run in collaboration with Diageo India and the Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE), and attempts to bring a formal and structured training program for young, first-time drivers as they apply for learner’s license. 

 

Launching this first-of-its-kind training programme in the country, Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya said, road safety is of prime importance for the Government as recent times have seen an alarming rise in road fatalities especially among the youth. Rash driving, drunken driving, lack of adequate safety measures like not wearing helmets are some of the major factors resulting in high road accidents. He said, the government is committed to making its vision of safer roads and cities a reality. This programme will help the Government achieve its target of reducing road accidents by 50 percent by 2020. 

 

Additional Secretary in the Ministry Ms Leena Nandan said, every individual road user is a brand ambassador for road safety. She informed that India accounts for 12.5 per cent (over 1.45 lakh fatalities a year) of global road accidents, with one road accident occurring every four minutes. Alarmingly, 72 per cent victims involved in such road mishaps are between the age groups of 15-44 years with speeding, reckless and drunk driving being the top reason accounting for 1.5 per cent of road traffic accidents and 4.6 per cent of fatalities. She welcomed the main-streaming of road safety in formal education system.  

 

Shri Abhay Damle, Joint Secretary in the Ministry said, the Youth Road Safety Leaners Licence programme is a step toward addressing this grave issue by improving road safety awareness amongst young adults by inculcating behavioural change and creating awareness about responsible driving habits. The programme is an immersive and interactive module led by senior faculty members of IRTE covering varied aspects of responsible driving including defensive driving, ill effects of driving under the influence of alcohol, speeding and wearing of helmets spread over two days.

 

Dr. Rohit Baluja, President of the Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE), said, the young generation is the most vulnerable on Indian roads. Every effort must be made to ensure their safety. This programme adopts the means of creating awareness amongst youth so that they become defensive road users. In the first year, the programme will cover 20 universities with a total of 400 programme across the country.  

 

IRTE has been successfully running its ‘Road to Safety’ initiative to provide capacity building training to traffic police officials and educate commercial drivers such as truckers and bus drivers and university students on the dangers of drunken driving. The programme has trained over 4624 traffic officials in road safety capacity-building, 6,000 commercial vehicle drivers and over 5,000 university students in more than 64 cities of 17 states. 

 

Ms Abanti Sankaranarayanan, Chief Strategy and Corporate Affairs Officer, Diageo India also spoke on the occasion.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Russia on Bilateral Cooperation in the Road Transport and Road Industry. The MoU will be signed during the upcoming visit of Russian President to India. 

 

In order to develop and establish formal platform for cooperation in the Transport and Highways sector, a Memorandum of Understanding in the field of Road Transport and Road Industry has been jointly negotiated and finalized by both countries.  

 

Both the countries will benefit by mutual cooperation in the field of Road Transport and Road Industry. Increased co-operation, exchange and collaboration with Russiawill contribute to establish a long-term and effective bilateral relationship of communication and cooperation in road transportation and road industry and Intelligent Transport System (ITS). This will also help in planning and administration of road infrastructure and road network management, transport policy, technologies and standards for the construction and operation of highways in the country and will further go a long way in strengthening ties and bilateral relations between India and Russia.

 

Background:

 

India and Russia enjoy long-standing relationship and have maintained strong economic ties at a strategic partnership level. Russia has developed technological solutions for satellite based tolling solutions. Similarly, they have also adopted advanced intelligent traffic management systems including crash reporting/ monitoring systems. Considering Russia's proven experience in adoption of technology in the road transport sector, it would be beneficial to learn from such best practices through close interaction. India is implementing at a rapid pace its highway infrastructure augmentation plans.  To make full use of the road infrastructure it is necessary to embrace technology to enhance transport productivity and safety. This will also help in reducing overall logistic cost.  India's own plans for massive highway and expressway infrastructure development can be attractive opportunity to infrastructure development entitles in the Russia. A partnership between the two countries will provide a platform for interaction at the operational level and supplement initiatives associated with all International groupings and forums where both countries are members.

                In the Financial Year 2018-19, so far 92% wage payments under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has been generated within 15 days.  This percentage was 26.85% in 2014-15, indicating the remarkable improvement towards making timely payments. The allocation of MGNREGA was also increased to a record Rs. 55,000 crore in 2018-19.  So far, the Central Government has released over Rs. 45,070 crore to the States. Including State shares, over Rs. 50,000 crore is available for work so far.  On receipt of audited accounts from the State Governments, additional funds are being released this week to ensure sufficient availability in all the States. The thrust on completion of incomplete works is showing with a record Rs. 1.70 crore assets completed in the last 30 months.  These assets have been for Natural Resource Management (NRM), Water Conservation works, durable assets, and a very large number of Individual Beneficiary Schemes including a 90/95 days’ work availability for poor households in the construction of their own houses under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G).  Independent evaluation studies have indicated the success of Natural Resource Management in improving incomes, acreage, productivity, fodder availability, and water table.  Similarly, independent assessment of Individual Beneficiary Schemes especially for animal resources has acknowledged their contribution in livelihood diversification and poverty reduction.

 

So far, 142 crore persondays of work has been generated in the current Financial Year.  All States and Districts affected by disaster or drought, based on their submissions have been provided additional persondays.  53% of the total persondays generated has been through women workers.  3.57 lakh differently abled persons have also been given work in the current Financial Year.  65:35 (wages to material) ratio at National level is an indicator of effectiveness and possibility of healthy distribution because of enforcing 60:40 at the District level.  High quality assets have been possible on account of this change.  Each and every asset under MGNREGS is geo-tagged and available in the public domain for scrutiny.  All current works are monitored by geo-tagging have before, during, and after completion to ensure full transparency in all works.  Nearly 100% expenditure is now through Electronic Fund Management System (e-FMS) indicating the thrust on quality, transparency, and accountability.

 

MGNREGS is a demand driven and additional resources will be made available as and when required to ensure that no one is denied work on demand.  Adequate steps have been taken to ensure timely payments and mobilization of additional resources when required.  Reforms in the programme over the last 3 years have substantially improved the quality of durable assets and convergence for effective livelihood diversification.

                Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM), Ministry of Rural Development  and Lady Irwin College, have signed  a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) here today for establishing ROSHNI – Centre of Women Collectives led Social Action. ROSHNI is technically and financially supported by UNICEF India serving as a technical support unit at national level for DAY-NRLM and is embedded in the Department of Development Communication and Extension, Lady Irwin College, New Delhi.

DAY-NRLM aims to reach out to 8-10 crore rural poor households (based on SECC 2011) in a time bound manner, and, stay engaged with them till they come out of abject poverty. It envisions breaking the self-perpetuating cycle of malnutrition- illness- out-of-pocket expenditure for treatment-poverty through its savings and enterprise approach and layering of Food, Health, Nutrition and WASH (FHNW) interventions through Self-help groups (SHG) and their federations.

This is also referred to DAY-NRLM’s Dashasutra (10 principles) strategy. Since launch, 5.39 crore women have been mobilised for SHGs and over 47 lakh SHGs created. DAY-NRLM is also MoRD’s nodal agency for implementation of the convergent action plan under the POSHAN Abhiyaan, which in addition to MORD includes the Ministry of Woman and Child Development and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The four areas of convergence are - mobilisation for fixed day health, nutrition and WASH camps (Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Day-VHSND), convergence through behaviour change communication, convergence through common use of infrastructure and promotion of nutri-based livelihoods for women collectives.

The adverse and irreversible impact of poor women’s nutrition for their own well-being and future generations is well established. While India has made significant strides in improving maternal survival many challenges still persist for all women and generations to achieve their development and economic potential- almost one in 10 girls marry too young, every fifth woman of reproductive age group is undernourished and every second woman anemic. 

A model that brings the much needed undiluted focus on women’s nutrition and demonstrates layering of FHNW interventions on DAY-NRLM platforms is Swabhimaan. It makes the last mile delivery of FHNW interventions, which has been considered a voluntary function for field mobilizers for too long, an invested service. Launched in 2016, Swabhimaan is a collaborative initiative of DAY- NRLM and UNICEF India in five poorest DAY-NRLM resource blocks in four districts of three Indian states: Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha.

Roshni aims to work with women collectives for social action on FHNW interventions in alignment with DAY-NRLM Dashasutra strategy and supporting implementation of convergent action plan under POSHAN Abhiyaan. Roshni will learn from Swabhimaan and similar models, and extend support to DAY-NRLM for expanding the scope of FHNW interventions. The Centre will lead knowledge creation, capacity building for scale-up of convergent action plan, learning and re- learning in Swabhimaan sites and provide policy guidance to DAY-NRLM on POSHAN Abhiyaan initiatives.

These crackers have been named as safe water releaser (SWAS), safe minimal aluminium (SAFAL) and safe thermite cracker (STAR).

Highlighting that the Indian Fireworks industry is over 6000-crore worth of annual turnover and provides employment opportunities to over 5 lakh families directly or indirectly, the Minister said that this endeavour of CSIR aims at addressing the pollution concerns at the same time protecting the livelihoods of those involved in this trade.

The Minister mentioned that firecracker manufactures took keen interest with laboratories throughout the processand the new crackers would not require changes in theirmanufacturing facilities.

 

Dr. Harsh Varshan also listed a number of steps to make further improvements in the fire crackers. “First time in India, an Emission testing Facility has been established at CSIR-NEERI and extensive testing is in progress for conventional and green crackers for monitoring the emissions and sound”, he said.This facility uses all sophisticated instruments for measurement and sampling when firecrackers are used.

 

The Minister also informed thata raw material characterization facility is also coming up as it has been found that many times the poor quality raw materials used in fire crackers are the major sources of particulate matter pollution. CSIR would be detailing further strengthening by installation of additional facilities for raw materials testing at Sivakasi. This activity is likely to be initiated for testing in next two months after completion of certain formalities. This facility can come up in collaboration and partnership with Manufacturers’ associationTesting facilities.

Taking a comprehensive view of the firecracker sector, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that in tune with its Scientific Social Responsibility, CSIR has been working on long term and futuristic goals which would lead to clean and safe Diwali.

 

Technical Details:

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The crackers have been namedas safe water releaser (SWAS), safe minimal aluminium (SAFAL) and safe thermite cracker (STAR).

 

It has unique property of releasing water vapour and /or air as dust suppressant and diluent for gaseous emissions and matching performance in sound with conventional crackers.

 

SWAS crackers eliminates usage of (KNO3) Potassium nitrate and Sulphurwith consequent reduction in particulate matter (30-35%) SO2 and NOx. It has matching sound intensity with commercial crackers in the range of 105-110 dBA.

SWAS has been tested for shelf life upto 3 weeks with consistent performance.

STAR eliminates usage of KNO3 and S with consequent reduction in particulate matter (35-40%), SO2 and NOx. It has matching sound intensity with commercial crackers in the range of 105-110 dBA.

 

SAFAL has minimal usage of aluminium (only in flash powder for initiation)with consequent significant reduction in particulate matter(35-40 %) compared to commercial crackers. It has matching sound intensity with commercial crackers in the range of 110-115 dBA.

PESO has been approached to analyse and test SWAS/STAR/SAFAL from point of view of safety, stability and other related issues.

Also functional prototypes of flower pots for substitution of BaNO3(Barium nitrate) by low cost eco-friendly materials have been developed with significant reduction in particulate matter (30-35%).

These functional prototypes have been successfully demonstrated in Sivakasi to leading manufacturers.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

E-crackers- CSIR-CEERI, being an electronics laboratory, is developing safe and pollution free technology of electronic crackers (E-crackers) to meet latent social aspiration of enjoying fireworks. It includes various products like E-Ladi, E-Anar, system for E-cracker show etc. At present CSIR-CEERI is ready with the laboratory level prototype of E-Ladi. 

E-Ladi is based on high-voltage electrostatic discharge to generate light/sound effect. It is triggered by providing heat to the thermal switch which will give the excitement of firing the conventional cracker. The E-Ladi is also programmable to give various light/sound effect. The team from CSIR-CEERI Pilanihas devloped functional prototype of E-Ladi,demonstration is also planned in next two months.

 

 

 

Fig. below shows the lab level implementation of this concept on a decorative piece. High voltage generator is capable of producing very high voltage using the concept of tesla coil. These pods are connected in parallel to achieve desired light/sound pattern. The controller block consists of a pulse generator and a solid state device based circuit to control the switching of these pods. A video showing the operation of this E-Ladi is also attached herewith. The second version of this prototype will include compact form factor and thermal actuation arrangement. 

 

 

Developed prototype of E-Ladi

 

Post combustion control system and devices:CSIR-NEERI has also planned to use area source control through development of new systems called PURE-WAYU as also photochip material for local dust control. The system is being tested currently.

Reduced Emission crackers: CSIR-CECRI, Karaikudi has developed reduced emission crackers through the replacement of commonly used Aluminium with Magnesium and Magnesium based compounds in flash powder. 

 

CSIR-CECRI team, along with Krishna Fireworks, Sivakasi developed modified chemical formulations for flower pots, Jil Jil and atom bomb since these are in high demand in the market and form a major share of the industrial profit. 

Flower pot essentially comprises of alkali nitrates, Aluminium powders of different grain sizes and in some cases the binder to enhance luminescence. Aluminium has been used as a primary heat source and to produce flash. In order to reduce the ignition temperature and subsequently to minimize the particulate matter, Magnesium could be a viable alternative to Aluminium. During the field trails at Sivakasi, many different compositions were tested for developing modified chemical formulations of flower pot. Alternate chemical formulations for flower pots were prepared by replacing Aluminium with Magnesium chips and Magnesium based compounds. Further these modified chemical formulations were tested and their characteristics in terms of colour, smoke, height of the lighting, brightness and ability to burst etc. were noted and analysed. These products showed promising results in terms of reduced emission of particulate matter (PM) level, toxic gases, less smoke and less noise. The team from CSIR-CECRI has developed flower pots by using eco-friendly materials with consequent implications on particulate matter (PM) reduction by 25-30%.

 

  

 

 

CSIR-NEERI is testing the efficacy of Bijli cracker by eliminating the use of ash as desiccants for reduction in particulate matter by 20%.

Potential sound emitting functional prototypes have been developed by team at CSIR NEERI based on the novel concept of exploiting exothermic heat of materials for bursting of crackers with consequent reduction in particulate matter (30-35%), no emission of SO2 and low cost due to avoidance of usage of conventional oxidants. 

 

Network of CSIR laboratories involved:

The networking laboratories of CSIR including: CSIR-Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CEERI), CSIR-CentralElectrochemicalResearchInstitute(CSIR-CECRI), CSIR-CentralMechanical Engineering Research Institute(CSIR-CMERI), CSIR-CentralLeatherResearchInstitute (CSIR-CLRI), CSIR-IndianInstitute of ChemicalTechnology(CSIR-IICT), CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (CSIR-IITR), CSIR-National Botanical ResearchInstitute(CSIR-NBRI), CSIR-NationalChemicalLaboratory (CSIR-NCL), CSIR-National Environmental EngineeringResearch Institute (CSIR-NEERI) have formulated a project with a specific goal to enhance CSIR innovation ability for developing globally competitive, cutting edge technologies for reduced emission fireworks.

                Council of Scientific and Industrial Research ,Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (CSIR-IITR), Lucknow has developed an innovative technology for “Drinking Water Disinfection System” with Trade name “OneerTM” which was transferred to M/s Bluebird Water Purifiers, New Delhi in the presence of Union Minister of Science & Technology and Vice-President, CSIR, Dr. Harsh Vardhan today. It is useful for continuous treatment of water and eliminates all disease causing pathogens such as virus, bacteria, fungi, protozoa and cyst to provide safe drinking water to domestic and communities settings as per National and International standards prescribed for potable water (BIS, WHO etc.). 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that it is well known that infection through drinking water results in an increase in morbidity and mortality particularly amongst children and Oneer developed by CSIR-IITR ,will provide access to safe and clean drinking water at a cost of just 2 Paise / Ltr. Dr. Harsh Vardhan further added that the Community level model is of 450 LPH capacity which can be scaled up to 5000 to 1 lakh L/day; and is also maintenance and membrane free. “The technology will be helpful especially for rural people since it can be solar powered and this development is in line with the ‘Make in India’ Mission”, added the Union Minister.

 

Dr. Shkekar C Mande, Director General, CSIR and Secretary, DSIR lauded the efforts of CSIR-IITR Scientists in developing Oneer-a safe drinking water device especially for rural areas. He said that currently, a large proportion of India's rural community is consuming water that does not meet the WHO drinking water quality standards. According to the World Health Organization, ""access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection”.

CSIR is continuously focusing on translational research through Mission Projects and Fast Track Translational Research Projects to develop technologies and products focussed at unmet needs. One of the components of the programme is to enhance the quality of life of common people and remove drudgery. 

The smaller unit of Oneer is particularly suitable for homes, street food vendors, and small establishments.

                The Union Minister for Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari and Kerala Chief Minister Shri Pinarayi Vijayan will lay the foundation for India’s largest Dry Dock at Cochin Shipyard in Kerala tomorrow.  The Dry Dock will give an impetus to “Make in India” initiative under Sagarmala and raise India’s share in global shipbuilding to 2 percent. India currently occupies 0.66 % share in global shipbuilding market.

 The commercial ship building industry in India is worth Rs. 3,200 Croreand focuses primarily on small-medium sized offshore vessels and cargo/bulk carriers. At present, Cochin Shipyard has two dry docks, one predominantly used for ship building of size 255m x 43 x 9m and capacity 1,10,000 DWT and the other one for ship repair of size 270 x 45 x 12m and capacity 1,25,000 DWT. 

The new Dry Dock is being constructed at a cost of Rs 1799 Crore. It will be 310 m long, 75m wide, with a depth of 13 m and drought of 9.5m. The dock will be designed to handle both ship building and repairs, and bear a load up to 600 T/m. It will be equipped with international safety standards. The dock will also have a water treatment plant and Green Belt Development. Equipped with this Dry Dock, Cochin Shipyard will be able to build specialized and technologically advanced large vessels like LNG Carriers, drill ships, jack up rigs, large dredgers, aircraft carriers for Indian Navy and high end research vessels.It will also help make Cochin a one stop maritime hub for all repair needs in South East Asia. 

The project is expected to be completed by May 2021 and generate employment opportunities for about 2000 people.

Two 500 capacity passenger vessels built by CSL for Andaman and Nicobar Islands administration will also be launched on the occasion. These vessels will help enhance intra island connectivity.

 

Shri Gadkari will also lay the foundation stone for three National Highways projects in Kerala, costing Rs 1557 Crore at an event in Eranholi in Thalassery in Kannur district. These would include the construction of the 18.6 km, 4 lane Thalassery – Mahe bypass (NH-66) at a cost of Rs 1181 Crore ; construction of 0.78 km, 4-lane Railway Over Bridge near Neeleshwaram town (NH-66) at a cost of Rs 82 Crore and widening of 46.72 km from Nattukal to ThanavuJn (NH-66) to two lane with paved shoulder at a cost of Rs 294 Crore .

                Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) will transport container cargo belonging to the food and beverage giant PepsiCo (India) from Kolkata to Varanasi on river Ganga (National Waterway-1) tomorrow. This would be the country’s first container movement on inland vessel post-independence, and a milestone moment in the history of India’s IWT sector. PepsiCo (India) will move 16 containers – equivalent to 16 truckloads- filled with food and snacks in the vessel MV RN Tagore which will reach Varanasi in 9-10 days. MV RN Tagore will make its return journey with fertilizers belonging to IFFCO that will be procured from its Phulpur plant near Allahabad. 

Secretary (Shipping), Govt. of India, Shri Gopal Krishna along with Chairman, IWAI, Shri Pravir Pandey and other senior Government officials will flag off the vessel carrying the consignment in the presence of PepsiCo representatives. The event coincides with another momentous day for IWT in India as IWAI’s first foray into Public Private Partnership (PPP) model will become a reality with the handing over of operation and management of its terminals in Kolkata to M/s Summit Alliance Port East Gateway (India) Pvt Ltd. (SAPEL) on a supply, operate and maintain (SOM) model. 

Container cargo transport comes with several inherent advantages. Even as it reduces the handling cost, allows easier modal shift, reduces pilferages and damage, it also enables cargo owners to reduce their carbon footprints. 

The government is developing NW-1 (River Ganga) under JMVP from Haldia to Varanasi (1390 Km) with the technical and financial assistance of the World Bank at an estimated cost of Rs 5369 crore. The project would enable commercial navigation of vessels with capacity of 1500-2,000 DWT. 

The Union Minister for Shipping Shri Nitin Gadkarihad flagged off a consignment of Maruti cars from Varanasi to Haldia in August, 2016. Since then pilot movements on National Waterways are currently being done on various stretches. More than 15 of them have already been successfully completed, including integrated movements through NW-1 (Ganga), Indo-Bangladesh Protocol Route and NW-2 (Brahmaputra). The PepsiCo cargo will be the first container movement on inland waterways in the country.

                Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) will make its foray into Public Private Partnership (PPP) tomorrowwhen it hands  overthe operation and management of its terminals in Kolkata to M/s Summit Alliance Port East Gateway (India) Pvt Ltd. (SAPEL) on a supply, operate and maintain (SOM) model . The handing over will be done in the presence of  Shipping Secretary Shri Gopal Krishna at an event in Kolkata.  

The terminals GR Jetty-I & BISN and GR Jetty-II of Inland Water Transport (IWT) will be handed over to SAPEL for equipping, operating and managing on a revenue sharing model. The operator will have the right to collect user fees from the users as per the tariff rates notified by IWAI. The contract will be valid for a period of 30 years. M/s SAPEL was awarded the contract in August, 2017 under a revenue sharing arrangement of 61.70% to itself and 38.30 % to IWAI through a global tendering process for this work for  Garden Reach Terminal in Kolkata and Gaighat and Kalughat Terminal in Patna.  Being the first PPP project undertaken by IWAI under SOM model, the event paves the way for private investment in the development of IWT in India.

 

The IWT terminals GR Jetty-I & BISN and GR Jetty-II are spread over 30,409.64 square metre and 14,557 square metre respectively,  and have two permanent RCC jetties and one floating jetty besides a Roll on- Roll off terminal. The transportation of trucks on vessels from BISN jetty to Sankrail on the bank and participation of private sector in operation and management of the facilities will improve the operational efficiency of the jetties. 

 

According to IWAIChairman Shri Pravir Pandey, under the transactional structure worked out by International Finance Corporation (IFC), the operator will undertake the operations and maintenance services at both Kolkata and Patna clusters and invest in cargo handling equipment, container handling equipment and warehousing. The operator will also provide labour, professionals, supervisory, and managerial personnel for performance of operations and maintenance services. The proposed project will facilitate a modal shift of up to 55% of the potential cargo in the catchment area to IWT mode.. Existing potential of anchor cargo is of 56,000 TEUs (to/from catchment area) during the base year and expected to grow to  250,000 TEUs over next 15 years. The current handling capacity of terminal is 1.6 MT which includes bulk and break - bulk cargo. The operator is expected to increase this capacity by three times in next five years.

The development of both Kolkata and Patna terminals is being undertaken with a view to tap the huge potential of Nepal bound containerised cargo on NW-1. While the available cargo upstream (for Nepal) at present is 44,000 TEU, the cargo potential downstream stands at 12,000 TEU.

Barging from Kolkata to Patna will lead to cost saving by approximately 24% and 4 % as compared to road and rail respectively when return cargo is available. Barging from Kolkata to Kathmandu will lead to cost savings by approximately 13% and 26% as compared to road and rail respectively when return cargo is available from around Patna.

A periodic and reliable barge shuttle service between the two terminals will cater to freight movement between Kolkata and Patna. Hinterland catchment area of Bihar and Nepal will also be served through this route. The barge shuttle will act as a cargo feeder/evacuation channel of Kolkata port to the hinterland. Patna (Kalughat) terminal when ready, could act as an extended gate of Kolkata Port. The shuttle service could also act as a feeder or evacuation channel to Dhamra Port in future.

The Kolkata terminals will also facilitate domestic bound and EXIM cargo for North Eastern Region and Bangladesh even as it will prove advantageous for shippers plying on the Indo-Bangladesh Protocol Route. On 25 October, 2018, India and Bangladesh signed milestone agreements to deepen their maritime relationship. Kolaghat (West Bengal, India) and Chilmari (Bangladesh) were declared as new Ports of Call (PoC). Besides this, an agreement for the use of Mongla and Chattogram port (Bangladesh) for transiting goods to and from India and passenger and cruise vessels from Kolkata to Dhaka and Guwahati through the protocol route were also agreed on.

                The Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Chemicals & Fertilizers Shri Mansukh L Mandaviyainan interview said that several significant steps have been taken by thepresent Government to boost and develop coastal shipping as the most efficient mode of transportation of cargo. 

During this interview, Shri Mandaviya said that development of coastal shipping will facilitate movement of cargo through inland water transport to coast and vice-versa, which is cheapest way of transport. This would also result in diversion of cargo from rail/ road to sea route.At present, transportation of cargo through coastal shipping is significantly lower than by road or rail transport.As per study, the cost of per ton cargo movement per KM by road is Rs. 2.50/, by rail is Rs. 1.36/- while by water route, it is Rs. 1.06/- only.As per estimates, diversion of about 5% of cargo to coastal shipping will not only reduce pressure on rail/ road traffic but also save around Rs. 230 billion and result in 6% reduction in harmful chemicals and pollutants.

Shri Mandaviya said that the Directorate General of Shipping has issued an order in August, 2018 that will boost coastal shipping as this facilitates Inland Vessels (IV vessels) of less than 3000 Gross Tonnage to carry cargo except ‘dangerous good’ within 5 Nautical Miles of the base line or up to 2 Meters of significant wave height condition, whichever is less in fair weather season,  to trade along East & West coast of the country which was not allowed earlier.

He said the relaxation in cabotage for coastal movement of EXIM transhipment andempty containers/ agriculture, horticulture, fisheries and animal husbandry commodities/ fertilizers by foreign flag vessels have shown a positive growth in coastal shipping/ trade.This kind of new initiatives will not only boost coastal shipping/ trade but also enhance the country’s FOREX and economy.

                India and Bangladesh signed several milestone agreements today, for enhancing inland and coastal waterways connectivity between the two countries for trade and cruise movements. Briefing media persons in New Delhi this evening, Shipping Secretary Shri Gopal Krishna, and his Bangladesh counterpart Shri Md. AbdusSamadinformed that the two countries have signed an agreement to use Chattogram and Mongla Ports in Bangladesh for movement of goods to and from India. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) has also been signed for movement of passenger and cruise services. In addition to this, an addendum to ‘Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade’ (PIWTT) between India and Bangladesh has been signed for inclusion of Dhubriin India and Pangaonin Bangladesh as new Ports of Call.  These agreements will facilitate easier   movement of goods and passengers between the two countries, giving an impetus to trade and tourism. 

The two sides agreed to consider inclusion of Rupnarayanriver (National Waterway-86) from Geonkhali to Kolaghat in the protocol route and to declare Kolaghatin West Bengal as new Port of Call. Chilmari was agreed to as a port of call in Bangladesh. The new arrangement will facilitate movement of flyash, cement, construction materials etc from India to Bangladesh through IWT on Rupnarayanriver. Further, both sides agreed to declare Badarpur on river Barak (NW 16)    as an Extended Port of Call of Karimganj in Assam and Ghorasal of Ashuganj  in Bangladesh on reciprocal basis.  The Indian side proposed for extension of the protocol routes from Kolkata uptoSilchar in Assam.  Currently 3.5 MMT cargo is transported on protocol routes through inland waterways which is expected to increase substantially after the declaration of additional Ports of Call and extension of protocol routes. The North Eastern states would get connected to directly to the ports of Kolkata and Haldia in India and Mongla in Bangladesh through waterways which would facilitate movement EXIM cargo and would also reduce the logistic costs. 

In another important understanding reached at between the two countries, the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for movement of passengers and cruise vessels on Inland Protocol route and coastal shipping routes have been finalised. These river cruise services are likely to commence between Kolkata – Dhaka - Guwahati – Jorhat and back. 

It was also agreed that a Joint Technical Committee will explore the technical feasibility of operationalisation of Dhulian-Rajshahi protocol route uptoAricha. and the reconstruction and opening up of Jangipur navigational lock on river Bhagirathi subject to the provisions of the Treaty between India and Bangladesh on Sharing of Ganga Waters at Farakka,1996. This move has the potential to reduce the distance to Assam by more than 450 kms on the protocol routes.

It was also decided that a Project Management Consultant for supervision and monitoring of dredging of Ashuganj-Zakiganj and Sirajganj-Daikhowa stretches of Indo-Bangladesh Protocol Route in Bangladesh will be engaged with 80 % financial contribution from India and rest by Bangladesh. A Joint Monitoring Committee has also been constituted for overall monitoring of the dredging works. 

To bring about significant reduction in logistics cost and faster delivery of Bangladesh export cargo, Indian side raised the point regarding permitting ‘Third country’ EXIM Trade under Coastal Shipping Agreementand PIWTT by allowing transhipment through ports on the East Cost of India.   Bangladesh agreed to hold stakeholder consultations and revert on the matter. 

 

Both sides have also agreed for development of Jogighopa as a hub/trans-shipment terminal for movement of cargo to Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Bhutan and notifying Munsiganj River terminal by Bangladesh Customs for routing third party Exim cargo through Kolkata Port.

Discussions were also held to make Nakugaon Land Port in Bangladesh and Dalu ICP (India) operational and to connect Gelephu (Bhutan) as tripartite cross-border route. 

Permission for the transportation of third country cargo on protocol routes and coastal shipping routes were also discussed. Inclusion of Dhamra Port, V.O. Chidambaranar Port (formerly Tuticorin Port) and Kamarajar Port under Coastal Shipping Agreement was also deliberated upon. These will be further discussed in Joint Shipping Committee meeting scheduled in December, 2018.

Prior to the Secretary Shipping level talks held today, the 19th edition of the Standing Committee meeting under ‘Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade’ (PIWTT) between high level delegations of the two countries were held yesterday. The daylong meeting was attended by representatives of Ministries of Shipping, External Affairs, Home, Finance, DONER and Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) and officials from Bangladesh belonging to Ministry of Shipping, Board of Revenue, DG (Shipping) and Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA).

The Prime Minister’s dream project of Gogha- Dahej Ro-Pax Ferry service is all readyto start under the Sagarmala programme of the Ministry of Shipping. In a successful trial run conducted recently, 12 loaded trucks were transported by the Ro- Pax ferry from Dahej to Goghaacross the Gulf of Cambay, via the sea route. The land route between the two places involves a 294 km or 8 hour drive.The Ro-Pax service reduces this distance to just 31 km through the sea route by crossing the Gulf in Cambay in 17 Nautical Miles.  The travel time gets reduced to just 1.5 hours. This is an important development for diamond and textiles traders & workers in Surat to travel via coastal shipping and save the travel time by almost half. 

The fully operational Ro Pax service with carrying capacity of 100 vehicles and 500passengers will be opened on 27 October 2018. 

Speaking after the trail run Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Shipping, Road Transport & Highwaysand Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation said,  “The Sagarmala programme is touching the lives of people. Gogha-DahejRo-Pax Ferry service is all set toconnect Saurashtra and South Gujarat.”

The total cost of the project is estimated to be Rs 615 Crore of which Rs.117 Crore has been funded by Central Government under the Sagarmala programme with the main objective of promoting coastal shipping and reducing logistics costs. 

 The initiative would not only reduce the travel time but also result in savings in fuel, reduction in CO2 emission and reduction in road congestion. 
The project is first of its kinds in India as it is being executed in the area of world’s 2nd highest tidal range. The project would open up new avenues in coastal shipping & tourism and help in socio-economic development of proximate areas.

                Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) will be starting a new Roll on-Roll off (Ro-Ro) facility in collaboration with the Government of Assam to provide the much-needed connectivity for Majuli Island. The Chief Minister of Assam Shri Sarbananda Sonowal will flag off a new Ro-Ro Service on 11th October, 2018. This Ro-Ro facility will cut down the circuitous road route of 423 KMs that trucks take from Neamati to Majuli Island via Tezpur Road Bridge, by limiting the distance to only 12.7 KM with the use of river route. 

IWAI has procured a new vessel MV Bhupen Hazarika at a cost of Rs 9.46 Crore for the new service and is providing the needed terminal infrastructure too. The 46.5-metre-long, 13.3-metre-wide vessel has the carrying capacity of eight trucks and 100 passengers. IWAI is also planning to procure more such Ro-Ro vessels for use on river Brahmaputra.

Majuli is one of the biggest riverine islands in the world located on river Brahmaputra and faces serious challenges of connectivity. It has 144 villages with a population of over 1,50,000. The commencement of Ro-Ro services to Majuli island would be a landmark event towards augmenting connectivity not only in Assam but the entire North Eastern Region. Currently, there are only four road bridges across river Brahmaputra - at Jogighopa, Guwahati, Tezpur and Sadiya for connectivity between southern and northern parts of Assam. People residing on either side of the river need to cross the river using conventional ferry service at various locations for their day to day needs. In absence of adequate number of bridges, cargo and passenger movement takes through longer road routes leading to critical loss of time and money.

Earlier, IWAI had started a similar Ro-Ro service between Dhubri and Hatsingimari which reduced the travel distance by 190 KMs. A permanent Ro-Ro terminal was constructed at Dhubri for the purpose. Floating terminals have also been constructed at 11 locations along the length of the Brahmaputra waterway. These are at Hatsingimari, Dhubri, Jogighopa, Tezpur, Silghat, Biswanathghat, Neamati, Sengajan, Bogibeel, Dibugarh/ Oakland and Oriumghat.

                Union Minister for Shipping, Road Transport & Highways and Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari will lay the foundation stone for the development work of Ghagra river as National Waterway (NW)-40 tomorrow at Basti in Uttar Pradesh, under the Sagarmala Programme of Ministry of Shipping. 

The waterway from Manjhighat at Ganga-Gaghra river confluence to Faizabad/Ayodhya along Gaghra River for a length of 354 km was declared as NW-40 during the year 2016, as part of Government’s renewed push to develop inland waterways sector in the country. Together with NW-1 (on river Ganga), NW-40 will be provide to be a major transport modal choice for cargo and passenger movement. The Detailed Project Report on the development of NW-40 envisages terminal at five locations – Ayodhya, Mahirpur (Tanda/Kalwari), Dohrighat, Tortipar and Manjhighat.  

Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), under Ministry of Shipping has already initiated work in Phase –I with project cost of Rs. 11.6 Cr and has constructed the floating terminal at Tanda/Kalwari to facilitate cargo & passenger movement on River Ghagra & River Ganga. Under Phase 1, the draft of 2 metre and width of 45 metre will be constructed in addition to floating terminals through Pontoon-Gangway at two locations- Tanda/Kalwari and Manjhighat.

The DPR on NW-40 projects movement of various categories of cargo, namely, agricultural products (rice, wheat, pulses, sugar, livestock),  industrials products, coal (for Tanda power plant), coarse sand, bricks, paper products, leather and other general goods etc. through inland vessel capacity up to 1000 tonne. The first phase works are scheduled to be completed by 2019-20. This waterway is being classified as class-III waterway which envisages movement of up to 1000 ton capacity vessels. Besides cargo and passenger movement, NW-40 will provide a connectivity to tourist and pilgrimage places along river Gaghra and Ganga.

Other projects under IWAI in Uttar Pradesh include, Freight Village & Logistics Hub and Multimodal terminal at Varanasi under the Jal Marg Vikas Project. The terminal is being constructed at a cost of ₹169.70 cr with a capacity of 1.26 MTPA. The terminal is likely to be inaugurated in the month of November, 2018. The terminal will boost trade via waterways with reduced logistics costs. Better connectivity to coastal regions and neighbouring countries like Nepal, Bangladesh & North eastern states through Indo-Bangladesh Protocol route will help MSMEs to expand trade & commerce and also provide optimal multi modal mix.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the merger of the existing regulatory institutions in the skills space - National Council for Vocational Training (NCVT) and the National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) into the National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET).

 

Details: 

NCVET will regulate the functioning of entities engaged in vocational education and training, both long-term and short-term and establish minimum standards for the functioning of such entities. The primary functions of NCVET will include -


	recognition and regulation of awarding bodies, assessment bodies and skill related information providers; 
	approval of qualifications developed by awarding bodies and Sector Skill Councils (SSCs); 
	indirect regulation of vocational training institutes through awarding bodies and assessment agencies; 
	research and information dissemination; 
	grievance redressal.


 

The Council would be headed by a Chairperson and will have Executive and Non-Executive Members. Since NCVET is proposed to be set up through merger of two existing bodies, the existing infrastructure and resources will be utilized for the most part. In addition, a few more posts will be created for its smooth functioning. The regulator will follow the best practices of regulatory processes, which will help ensure that it performs its functions professionally and as per the applicable laws.

Benefits:

 

This institutional reform will lead to improvement in quality and market relevance of skill development programs lending credibility to vocational education and training encouraging greater private investment and employer participation in the skills space. This in turn will help achieve the twin objectives of enhancing aspirational value of vocational education and of increasing skilled manpower furthering the Prime Minister's agenda of making India the skill capital of the world.

 

Being a regulator of India's skill ecosystem, NCVET will have a positive impact on each individual who is a part of vocational education and training in the country. The idea of skill-based education will be seen in a more inspirational manner which would further encourage students to apply for skill-based educational courses. This is also expected to facilitate the ease of doing business by providing a steady supply of skilled workforce to the industry and services.

 

Background:

 

In an effort to realize India's demographic dividend, its workforce needs to be equipped with employable skills and knowledge so that they can contribute to economic growth in a substantive manner.  In the past, most of the country's skill training needs were met through courses offered by the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and under the Modular Employable Scheme (MES), regulated by NCVT. Since this infrastructure was not enough to meet the increasing skill requirements of the country as well as the skilling needs of the growing workforce, the Government took a number of initiatives to scale up the skilling efforts. These efforts resulted in a large expansion of training infrastructure much of which is in the private sector. At present, there are 20 Ministries/ Departments implementing skill development programs mostly using private sector training providers.

 

However, in the absence of adequate regulatory oversight, numerous stakeholders have been offering training programs of varying standards with multiplicity in assessment and certification systems which are not comparable, with serious consequences for the vocational training system and thus the employability of the country's youth. An attempt towards some measure of regulation was made with the establishment of the National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) in 2013, to coordinate and harmonize the skill development efforts of the government and the private sector. The primary role of NSDA has been to anchor and operationalize the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) to ensure that quality and standards meet sector specific requirements.

 

However, a need was felt for an overarching regulatory authority which could tend to all aspects of short-term and long-term skill-based training. In view of this, NCVET is envisaged as an institution which will perform the regulatory functions so far vested in NCVT and NSDA. Regulatory functions currently being carried out by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) through the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) will also be housed in the NCVET.

Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment inaugurated the “National Workshop on Physical and Mental Disabilities in the Light of Global Best Practices in Care, Rehabilitation and Research” here today. Smt. Shankuntala D. Gamlin Secretary, DEPwD; Shri Kamlesh Kumar Pandey, Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities; and Smt. Dolly Chakrabarty, Joint Secretary, DEPwD and many other eminent scholars of the disability sector were present. The Workshop was organized by the Department of Empowerment of Person with Disabilities (Divyangjan), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and hosted by National Institute for Empowerment of Persons with Multiple Disabilities (NIEPMD), Chennai.

 

Delivering inaugural address, Shri Gehlot said that this workshop has been organized to promote the best practices from across the globe in the area of care, rehabilitation and research in relation to the 21 disabilities of RPWD Act 2016. In April 2017, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 came into force. It provides for various rights and entitlements for PwDs and casts responsibility on the State/UTs to take various measures to ensure that the PwDs enjoy their rights equally with others.  It also mandates the States/UTs to frame various schemes/programmes, work out mechanism and implement best practices to ensure inclusion and empowerment of PwDs.  Keeping in view the mandate of the new Act, both Central and State/UT Governments must implement global best practices to meet the needs of the Divyangjan through a lifecycle approach. 

 

He hoped that the workshop will help the participants in acquiring increased knowledge and develop a comprehensive plan, with clear objectives, towards local and national capacity building for attaining the agenda of Sustainable Development Goals. To implement the best practices, strong commitment and actions are required from all stakeholders.

 

The Minister said that implementing the best practices requires involving different sectors – health, education, social protection, labour, transport, housing- also different agencies, - government, Civil Society organizations, disabled People organizations, professionals, the private sector, people with disabilities and their families. It is essential that a developing country like India tailor its actions to address the existing challenges of Early Identification, Early Intervention, Education, Skilling, Employment, Home Living and Community Livings as it looked upon as a Model developing state; making it very vital that we establish infrastructure, scientific strategies and protocol of services for all the disabilities covered under RPwD Act.

 

The National Workshop had experts in the field of  disabilities, including: Orthopaedic Disability, Cerebral Palsy, Muscular Dystrophy, Dwarfism, Leprosy-cured person, Acid-Attack victims; Visual Impairment; Hearing impairment; Speech and Language disability; Intellectual disabilities; Specific Learning Disabilities; Autism Spectrum Disorders; Mental Illness; and Disabilities caused due to Chronic neurological conditions like Multiple-Sclerosis, Parkinson’s Disease; Blood disorders like Haemophilia, Thalassemia, Sickle-Cell Disease; and Multiple Disabilities. 

 

The experts were invited from premier rehabilitation institutions, hospitals, universities, and RCI recognized institutions from across the country.   The workshop was attended by over 250 participants from State and Central Government officials, Universities, National Institutions, Eminent Hospitals, Eminent NGOs, Scientists, and Experts of repute from the disability sector. An overwhelming response was received from each leading stakeholder of different states of the country, including Government and Non-Government Organizations.  Principal Secretaries, Secretaries, and Commissioners of Health, Social Welfare, and Disability Department from different states have confirmed their participation of the workshop. The Chief Medical Officers of many important cities and District Social Welfare and Disability Officers participated in the programme. The Heads of leading NGOs from across the country also participated in the workshop.

 

The objective of the workshop was to help our country’s commitment under the UNCRPD, RPWD Act and help establish uniformity in the services for persons with disabilities.  It also supported protocol development in the service delivery; promote replication of global best practices; and encourage adaptation of global best practices to Indian context. The workshop assisted in implementation of best-practices for the 21 disabilities covered under the RPWD Act.  It helped fine tune our practices of disability-specific, discipline-specific, model-specific, approach-specific holistic-services and Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) models.  The reservoir of knowledge generated was disseminated to all stakeholders for improving the standards of service delivery with an aim to improve the quality of life of persons with disabilities and their families.

 

The outcome of this Workshop is to share, implement and bring uniformity in global best practices for empowerment of persons with disabilities (Divyangjans) in India specially in the context of 14 new disabilities of the RPWD Act 2016.  The workshop witnessed the best practitioners from across the nation in each of the 21 disabilities as per the RPWD Act. It also came up with recommendations for Government, Service providers, activist, policy makers, educationalist, and professionals to implement RPWD Act, by adopting the best practices.

However, keeping in view the large number of insanitary latrines replaced in house listing and household data of Census-2011, the States have been asked to revisit their survey by using the wider definition of manual scavenging as given in the MS Act, 2013 to ensure that all the persons who are cleaning un-decomposed septage manually are identified and listed as manual scavengers. 

 

The Minister said that Government is implementing a Self- Employment Scheme for the Rehabilitation of identified manual scavengers under which onetime cash assistance, skill development training and loan subsidy are provided for rehabilitation of identified manual scavengers onetime cash assistance of Rs.40000/- each has been released to 12991 identified manual scavengers till date.  Proposals for skill development training for 13587 manual scavengers and their dependents and self-employment proposals for 944 manual scavengers and their dependents have been sanctioned.    

 

He said that a Task Force was constituted for carrying out a National Survey of manual scavengers in 170 identified Districts of 18 States. National Survey has been completed in 163 of the 170 identified districts. 50,644 persons have registered in the camps up to 01.10.2018, of which claims of 20,596 persons have been accepted after identification and subsequent verification as manual scavengers. Data of the identified manual scavengers is being digitized in National Safai Karamcharis Finance & Development Corporation (NSKFDC) and data of 11,757 manual scavengers has been digitized up to 01.10.2018. Onetime cash assistance has been released to 8438 identified manual scavengers. 

 

NSKFDC has held number of awareness camps to motivate the manual scavengers and their dependents to undertake skill development training so that they are suitably equipped for employment on sustainable basis or start their self-employment ventures.

 

Though hazardous cleaning of septic tanks is prohibited under the MS Act, 2013, a number of septic tanks related deaths have been reported from time to time. Such cases are taken up with the concerned State Government for payment of compensation of Rs.10 lakhs as per Supreme Court orders. The States have been urged to take steps for total mechanization of septic tanks and sewers to prevent such deaths.

 

Ministry of Labour has also advised the State to carry out a special inspection drives to identify and prosecute employers and contractors who are violating the provision of Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 and MS Act, 2013 and forcing workmen to do manual scavenging.             

 

The Committee has recommended simplification of the survey guidelines to fast track identification of manual scavengers.

                Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot inaugurated a “PAN India Workshop on Prevention of Hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks” organized by National Safai Karmcharis Finance & Development Corporation (NSKLFDC) under Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), Delhi today. Secretary, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment Smt. Neelam Sawhney, Mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation Shri Bipin Bihari Singh, Managing Director, NBCFDC Shri K. Narayanan and senior officers of M/o Social Justice and Empowerment and EDMC were present on the occasion.

Addressing on the occasion, Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot said that he is pleased to be a part of this momentous occasion of launch of Workshops on Prevention of Hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks, as a part of yearlong commemoration of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, 2018 to 2nd October, 2019. 

He said that Gandhi ji was deeply concerned about sanitation. He wanted to make sanitation a priority for India more than a century ago. While nation is celebrating one year period starting from today in the memory of Mahatma Gandhi, it is apt that we maximise our interventions for sanitation and for those who do this important work. Therefore, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has planned various activities in this regard, through the NSKFDC, during this period, which include :- Survey of Manual Scavengers and their rehabilitation ; Organising Workshops on ‘Prevention of Hazardous Cleaning of Sewers and Septic Tanks’; and Skill upgradation of sanitation workers and waste pickers through conducting 5 day training programmes.

Shri Gehlot said that recent deaths of sanitation workers in and around Delhi have moved him a lot. His ministry has taken the initiative to organize these workshops all our the country to sensitize the municipal officers, sanitation inspectors, senior sanitation workers and contractors, He said that while we can control the operations of cleaning of sewers by bringing mechanization and taking due precautions, it is suggested that each municipality should take action to regulate the cleaning of septic tanks also as many deaths are taking place while cleaning septic tanks. 

The Minister hoped that through this initiative of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, the sanitation workers, officers of urban local bodies etc. would directly and indirectly gain valuable insight into the hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks and the scenario of accidents and deaths during cleaning sewers and septic tanks would get changed comprehensively.

Addressing on the occasion the Vice President said that the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to observe 1st October, 1999 as the International Year of Older Persons and to promote the theme ""A society for All Ages"". Ever since every year, 1st October is celebrated as International Day of Older Persons. He suggested that the “Old Age Homes” should be renamed as “Elderly Home” and Old Persons should be called Elderly Persons. 

The Vice President said every society teaches its new generations to respect and revere elders. This finer link must be sustained from generation to generation. 

 

He said that we must appreciate that age-related issues are chronic and require prolonged treatment and post – treatment rehabilitation. Geriatric care should be a separate medical, nursing and physiotherapy discipline.  He suggested that our Hospitals should have separate Geriatric Departments and Wards with specialists and paramedical staff trained in geriatric care. The Government is assisting in setting up Old age homes, Day care Homes for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, physiotherapy clinics and Mobile Health Clinics for remote areas and villages. ""Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana"" has been launched since 2017, for free distribution of physical aids and devices to senior citizens belonging to the BPL category. 

 

The Vice President suggested that the quality of services provided under these Government schemes must be ensured and coverage should be expanded. The processes of availing the benefits of such Government schemes should be easy. We cannot expect our elderly citizens to run around the office at that age, to avail the benefits.   Concerned agencies and Hospitals must use digital technology to facilitate people to avail these schemes. Government may hire volunteers, school students to help elderly people avail the benefit of schemes.     

 

Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot said that the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment organizes two important programmes on “International Day of Older Persons” – (a) Walkthan for Senior citizens; and (b) Conferrment of ‘Vayoshreshtha Samman’ on senior citizens and institutions in recognition of their services towards the cause of the elderly persons. India has an age old rich tradition of respecting and caring for elderly. Under Joint Family system, Older persons enjoy a place of reverence and influence, guiding and advising the younger generations. But with the gradual disintegration of the joint family, inter-generational bonding has weakened. International Day of older Persons is an occasion for young generation for their sense of responsibility towards the older persons. Not all persons are privileged to get an opportunity to serve their parents and older persons in their families. Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has initiated many useful programmes and schemes for the welfare of senior citizens. 

He said that in the year 2017, the Ministry has started a new programme “Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana”, which aims at providing physical aids and assistive living devices viz. wheel chairs, hearing aids, spectacles, support sticks etc. to the older persons of below poverty line category. So far, more than 53000 senior citizens have been benefitted under this Yojana. Initially 305 districts have been chosen and out of these, the implementation has started in 55 districts. He called upon all senior citizens and older persons to apprise him of their suggestions for their welfare.

Shri Vijay Sampla in his opening remarks said that the many old acts for the welfare of older persons have been amended and the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is dedicated to the welfare of senior citizens.

Vayoshreshtha Samman is a Scheme of National Awards instituted by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment (D/o Social Justice & Empowerment) initially in 2005 and upgraded to the status of National Awards in 2013, for institutions involved in rendering distinguished service for the cause of elderly persons especially indigent senior citizens and to eminent citizens in recognition of their service/achievements.  These awards are presented as part of the celebration of the International Day of Older Persons (IDOP) on 1st October.

The National Awards are intended to show case the Government's concern for senior citizens and its commitment towards them with the aim of strengthening their legitimate place in the society.  It is also intended to provide an opportunity to the younger generation to understand the contribution of the elderly in building of the society and the nation.  The awards are intended to be conferred on eminent senior citizens and institutions involved in rendering distinguished services for the cause of elderly persons especially indigent senior citizens.  The recipients are drawn from diverse fields.  The Awards are given to institutions/organisations/individuals from any part of the country. Nominations are invited from Governmental and Non-Governmental Agencies.  

As per the Scheme, nominations are invited from Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and their autonomous organisations; State Governments/UT Administrations; past recipients of Padma Award; Vayoshreshtha Samman and other National Awards in both individual and institutional categories; Members of the National Council for Senior Citizens; Renowned Apex Chambers like FICCI, CII, ASSOCHAM, NASSCOM, PHDCCI etc.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the constitution of a High Level Steering Committeefor periodically reviewing and refining the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for monitoring of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with associated targets.

 

The High Level Steering Committee will be chaired by Chief Statistician of India and Secretary, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), with the Secretaries of data source Ministriesand NITI Aayogas members and Secretaries of other related Ministries as special invitees, with function of reviewing of National Indicator Framework including refinement of the indicators from time to time.

 

Targets:

 


	Measures to mainstream SDGs into on-going national policies, programmes and strategic action plans to address the developmental challenges.
	Statistical indicators of NIF will be the backbone of monitoring of SDGs at the national and state level and will scientifically measure the outcomes of the policies to achieve the targets under different SDGs.
	Based on statistical indicator, the MoSPI will bring out national reports on implementation of SDGs. The Report will facilitate assessment of progress, identify challenges and give recommendations for follow up at the national level.
	High Level Steering Committee will review the National Indicator Framework on regular basis for its improvement.
	Data source Ministries / Departments will be responsible for providing regular information to MoSPI on these indicators at required intervals and disaggregation for national and sub-national reporting of SDGs.
	Advanced IT tools will be used for close and effective monitoring.


 

Major impact:

 


	SDGs integrate economic, social and environmental dimensions of development. It intends eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world with basic motto of 'SabkaSaathSabkaVikash'.
	SDGs with 17 Goals and 169 Targets intend for promotion of sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems.
	NIF will help in outcome-based monitoring & reportingon progress on SDGs at National level.


 

There is no direct financial implication on implementation of the National Indicator Framework.  However, the respective Ministries will need to re-align and strengthen their data systemsto facilitate monitoring of the SDG indicators.

 

SDGs are expected to bring change in the lives of people and the monitoring of progress of implementation of SDGs will benefit the entire nation.

 

Background:

 

At the Millennium Summit held in 2000 at the UN Headquarters in New York, eight development goals known as the 'Millennium Development Goals' (MDGs) were adopted, which formed the blueprint for countries to pursue their national development strategies from 2000 to 2015. The MDGscomprised eight Goals and addressed various development issues. The MDGs targets were unevenly achieved across the countries and a need was felt to start fresh discussions to assess the usefulness of the MDGs and to explore possible successor to guide development cooperation in the world beyond 2015.

 

The UN General Assemblyin its 70thSession considered and adopted the Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs) for the next 15 years. The 17 SDGs came into force with effect from 1stJanuary, 2016.Though not legally binding, the SDGs have become de facto international obligations and have potential to reorient domestic spending priorities of the countries during the next fifteen years. Countries are expected to take ownership and establish a national framework for achieving these Goals. Implementation and success will rely on countries' own sustainable development policies, plans and programmes. Countries would be responsible for follow-up and review at the national level, with regard to the progress made in implementing the Goals and targets. Actions at the national level to monitor progress under SDGs will require quality, accessible and timely data.

                Capital Goods(CG) producers from across the globeinked 38 MoUs with Indian steel companies which will reduce imports for the steel sector worthRs 39,400 crore.TheMoUs were signed at a Conclave in Bhubaneswar today which wasorganized by Ministry of Steel, Government of India, in association with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and MECON. 

The National Steel Policy - 2017 envisages creation of 300 million tonnes (MT) of steel capacity in the country by 2030-31 as against existing 130 MT. The estimated import of plant and equipment, for reaching 300 MT capacity, will be around USD 25 billion. Further, for meeting the spares requirement, it is estimated that at 300 MT capacity level, India will have to spend about USD 500 million annually for import of proprietary and other spares. 

In his welcome address, Steel Minister, Chaudhary Birender Singh, said that in order to ensure that the MOUs signed today culminate into manufacturing of capital goods, a purchase preference policy to cover all purchases of steel products, including capital goods is being worked out by the Ministryof Steel.  It will ensure that products and product categories which do not get covered by the Domestically Manufactured Iron &Steel Policy will get covered by the proposed policy on the line which has been prescribed by the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion.

In his keynote address,Chief Minister of Odisha, Naveen Patnaik, said the MoUs inked today has the potential of transforming India into a world-class manufacturing hub. The Chief Minister said thatOdisha has a rich mineral base and produces 14% of the country’s total mineral output. The Chief Minister said that Odisha has the potential to become a major steel hub.

In his address, Minister for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, AnantG Geete, said the Indian manufacturing companies have the capability to manufacture all non-proprietary items and the Government is committed to facilitate technological tie-ups between domestic CG producers and their foreign counterparts for capacity building.AnantGeete suggested setting up of   a machine tools hubin Odishaas had been set-up by the Heavy Industry Ministry in Karnataka.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister for Petroleum & Natural Gas, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Dharmendra Pradhan, said that Odisha has mega steel projects besides small and medium steel mills which also contribute significantly to the state’s overall steel production. He said that Odisha has the potential to produce nearly 100 million tonne (MT),of the total 300 MT output targeted by 2030-31, as the State is home to sizeable mineral resource base. He welcomed the proposal by the Heavy Industries Minister to set up a machine tools park in Odisha.

Secretary, Ministry of Steel, Binoy Kumar, said it is in the interest of stakeholders that the capital goods industry should be strengthened so that competition increases. This will help in reducing the capital cost of projects. Although today, imported plants may come at a lower price but this is usually followed by high priced maintenance contracts and spares. By locally manufacturing, the maintenance of plant and machinery may also becomeeconomical.

Adam Szewczyk,of the World Steel Association, said India’s demand for steelis set to increase in the short and medium term due to favourable macro-economic conditions and ambitious reforms agenda. It will soon be the second biggest market in the world. 

The Conclave was attended by senior officers of Ministry of Steel, Chairmen and MD of SAIL and BHEL and CEOs of other steel companies from India and abroad.

                A review was done by the Steel Ministry for preparation of feasibility report for establishing steel plant in YSR Kadapa District, Andhra Pradesh, as envisaged under Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014. A High Powered Task Force comprising representatives from Central and State Governments, SAIL, RINL, NMDC, MECON and MSTC is working to evolve a plan and prepare a technical report.MECON has already submitted a draft report. Further it has finalised all that is required for the preparation of technical report and is waiting for data relating to availability of iron ore, which is essential for the preparation of the feasibility report. This data is to be provided by the State Government which is still awaited. 

Union Steel Minister, Chaudhary Birender Singh,while reviewing the implementation of major projects related to steel sector on 12th October 2018,instructed MECON to give its technical report to the Task Force immediately without waiting for any other details that is yet to be provided by the State government. He further instructed that MECON may continuously follow up with the State government to furnish the details of mining leases and availability of iron ore at the earliest so as to enable the Task Force to evaluate the technical report of the project and its feasibility. It was also decided that the Task Force will study the mode of investment for the proposed steel plant as a Public Sector, Private Sector, a Joint Venture or a combination of any or all these.

          In the discussion it was stressed that steel plant in YSR Kadapa District of Andhra Pradesh is a very important project for the overall development of that region and all efforts should be made to take the project to its logical end. Further, as per the Reorganization Act, the need for coordinated efforts by all the stakeholders in a time-bound manner was also underscored.

Based on the current experience, about USD 25 billion (Rs. 160,000 crore) worth of capital goods equipment is expected to be imported by 2030-31. 

The steel consumption in the country has been increasing at 7.9% since last two years. As per World Steel Association’s 8 month steel production figures for 2018, India has become the second largest steel producer in the world. Indian steel production has been growing at 6.7%, achieving highest growth amongst the major economies of the world. 

 Through multilateral collaborative efforts by way of MoUs, Joint Ventures, Transfer of Technology and tie-ups, manufacturing base is being widened to make Indiaa global manufacturing hub where most of the capital goods equipment could be manufactured within the country.

Apart from the inaugural session, the one-day Conclave, will have two panel discussions on “Synergising global experience and domestic capital goods capability for the steel sector” and “Incentivising domestic capacity expansion” in which leaders of the steel industry, policy makers and experts from abroad will discuss core issues, challenges and government support required for steel industry in India.

The Conclave will see the participation of five Union Ministers, the Chief Minister of Odisha, Secretaries of Steel Ministry, Department of Heavy Industry and senior officials of Central & Odisha Government. There will also be a huge presence of Indian Capital Goods (CG) manufacturers and steel manufacturers.

Twenty MoUs will be signed between Indian CG manufacturers, foreign technology providers, foreign capital goods manufacturers, consultants and steel manufacturers. The foreign manufacturers are from Luxembourg, Spain, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Finland, China and Japan. With the signing of these MoUs, USD 5 billion worth of imported capital goods will be manufactured in the country as part of Make in India drive in steel sector in the next 12 years.

 Around 350 delegates and a representative from World Steel Association (WSA) and 28 CEOs of foreign technology companies will participate in the Conclave.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the closure of National Jute Manufactures Corporation Ltd. (NJMC) and its subsidiary Birds Jute & Exports Ltd. (BJEL). 

 

Procedure for Closure:

 


	Disposal of fixed assets as well as current assets will be in accordance with the guidelines of DPE dated 14.06.2018 and the proceeds from the sale of assets, after meeting the liabilities, will be deposited in Consolidated Fund of India.


 


	In accordance with the DPE guidelines dated 14.06.2018, a Land Management Agency (LMA) will be engaged for disposal of assets. The LMA will be directed to carry out a thorough verification of the assets before undertaking their disposal in accordance with the DPE guidelines.


 


	Ministry of Textiles does not propose to use any land or building of BJEL for its own purposes or for any of its other CPSEs and the Land Management Agency will be informed upfront accordingly.


 

Benefits:

The decision will benefit the Government exchequer in reducing recurring expenditure incurred in operating both the sick CPSEs in running their activities. The proposal will help in closing loss making companies and ensuring release of valuable assets for productive use, or for generating financial resources for developmental progress.

 

The available land with both the CPSEs will be put up for public use/other government use for overall development of society.

 

Background:


	NJMC has been incurring losses for several years and was under reference to BIFR since 1993. The company's primary product was hessian jute bags used for packaging of food grain used by the various State Governments. Over the years, the demand for hessian bags has eroded and to that extent, it has been found to be no longer commercially viable to run the company;


 


	The Mills of NJMC which were proposed for revival, namely, Kinnison Mill at Titagarh, Khardah Mill at Khardah and RBHM Mill at Katihar are under suspension since August, 2016 (the last mill to be closed was Kinnison Jute Mill on 31.8.2016), because of the failure of the Job Contractor to execute the job efficiently and problems with the local labour. The different models of outsourcing operations which were attempted have not been successful. Looking at its past performance, market conditions and the competition from plastics and the capacity of private jute mills, it was noted that NJMC would not be in a position to recoup its negative net worth through operational profits. Also, NJMC has no staff/workers on its rolls. Hence, the closure; 


 


	BJEL, the subsidiary of NJMC, was referred to BIFR, which had considered a Revival Scheme. The Draft Revival Scheme could not be implemented because conversion of land use was not agreed to by the West Bengal Government and the representative of the State Government to the ASC was nominated after a three year delay. BJEL has no staff and as the factory is not in operation; closure does not have any adverse implications.

                The Central Government today notified the minimum environmental flows for River Ganga that has to be maintained at various locations on the river. Environmental flows are the acceptable flow regimes that are required to maintain a river in the desired environmental state or predetermined state. Calling this a significant development, Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari said that the notification of e-flow for the river would go a long way in ensuring its Aviralta or continuous flow. Reiterating the Government’s commitment towards an Aviral and Nirmal Ganga, the Minister informed that the draft Ganga Act will soon be sent to the Cabinet for approval. 

“This is a very significant moment.  The discussions on notifying e flow of Ganga have been going on for a long time.  We have taken this step to ensure a minimum amount of flow in the river”, Shri Gadkari said. 

The notification issued by the Government  today  will  ensure that the river has at least the minimum required environmental flow of water even after the river flow gets diverted by projects and structures for purposes like irrigation, hydropower, domestic and industrial use etc. This is an important step taken towards maintaining the uninterrupted or Aviral flow of the river. 

The e-flow notified by the Government is as follows:

The above order will apply to the upper Ganga River Basin starting from originating glaciers and through respective confluences of its head tributaries finally meeting at Devaprayag up to Haridwar and the main stem of River Ganga up to Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh. The compliance of minimum environmental flow is applicable to all existing, under-construction and future projects. The existing projects which currently do not meet the norms will have to ensure that the desired environmental flow norms are complied with within a period of three years. The mini and micro projects which do not alter the flow characteristics of the river or stream significantly are exempted from these environmental flows. 

The flow conditions in these river reaches will be monitored at hourly intervals from time to time. The Central Water Commission will be the designated authority and the custodian of the data,  and will be responsible for supervision, monitoring, regulation of flows and reporting of necessary information to the appropriate authority as and when required and also  take emergent decisions about the water storage norms in case of any emergency. 

The concerned project developers or authorities will have to install automatic data acquisition and data transmission facilities at appropriate locations at project sites within six months. The Central Government through National Mission for Clean Ganga may direct release of additional water in the River Ganga to meet special demand as and when required.

The notification also stipulates that the concerned Central and State authorities shall implement demand side management plans to reduce water withdrawal from River Ganga by adopting good and scientific practices such as efficient method of irrigation, reuse and recycle of water including monitoring and regulation of groundwater withdrawals for various purposes.

Talking in detail about the ongoing efforts to clean river Ganga Shri Gadkari informed that many projects like ghats and crematoria development, sewage treatment plants, river surface cleaning etc. on River Ganga are in different stages of construction and assured the people of India that their dream of Aviral and Nirmal Ganga will come true once all these projects become operational. On the issue of construction of hydro-power projects in Uttarakhand, Shri Gadkari said that views of various stakeholders are being taken and a considered decision will then be taken in this regard. 

Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation Sushri Uma Bharti called the notification of e-flow for Ganga a “historic” step and thanked Shri Gadkari for taking forward the work she had started. “Ganga has been a symbol of faith for me personally but after starting working on Ganga I developed the proper understanding of the problems. It is in this regard that this notification is a historic step and a beginning to rejuvenate all the rivers of India.” She added that hydropower projects should be implemented in such a way that they do not disturb the continuous flow of rivers.

                Central Water Commission (CWC), Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation today organized a day-long seminar on “Environment Issues in Water Resources Projects” at New Delhi. The seminar was organized at a time when concerns over issues of sustainable development are being raised from several quarters. 

Inaugurating the seminar, Shri U.P. Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation said, “We no longer talk of development now. We talk of sustainable development and I am happy that CWC has initiated such a dialogue which is very necessary.” Shri Singh added, “While the pendulum should not swing completely in the direction opposite to development, we can no longer ignore the ecological management. Better management of water resources should be done keeping in mind the ecological concerns and the impacts of the development projects must be studied properly.”

Chairman, CWC, Shri S. Masood Hussain stressed on the need to strike a balance between development and environment. “A kind of split has taken place between development and environment. There is no doubt that environmental issues today are one of the most important concerns not just in water sector but others too as manifests in climate change. Its importance cannot be overemphasized. The challenge in the water resources sector is to balance the need for development and environment concerns while ensuring sustainability.” He added, “The dilemma is that there is not much debate over this issue as a result of which many projects are being stalled. There is an urgent need for a proper scientific discussion in this regard and that is the objective of this seminar.” 

During the day-long seminar, the adverse effects of developmental projects in water sector such as displacement of people, submergence of forest and agricultural land, disturbance to biodiversity, flora & fauna , wildlife and e-flow of rivers were raised by several speakers. The need to safeguard against such ill-effects and minimize them through proper Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) plans, Environment Management Plans, Forest Protection Plans etc. was equally emphasized by the speakers. Various experts from different departments discussed at length on “Challenges in Resettlement & Rehabilitation of Water Resources projects”, “Issues in Getting Environmental/Forest/Wildlife Clearances”, “Environmental Flows”, “Aquatic Ecosystem Management - Issues & Solutions” etc.   

Raising an important point of inter-ministerial and inter-departmental coordination, former Secretary of Ministry of Water Resources Shri S.K. Sarkar said that water is a complex and vast subject and crosses several ministries, departments and states. The time has come to think holistically and develop a synchronized mechanism to avoid delays and ensure a healthy environment. 

The seminar provided a platform for discussion among experts from stakeholder organizations like Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, CWC, National Water Development Agency, WAPCOS, Narmada Control Authority, Central Ground Water Board, Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute, National Institute of Hydrology, Tehri Hydropower Development Corporation, National Hydro Power Corporation, State Government of Gujarat, NGPs and others.  

The organizers and speakers expressed hope that the suggestions and feedbacks from the seminar will help in informed decision making at the policy level.

                National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has partnered with Tata Steel Adventure Foundation (TSAF) to launch a month-long rafting expedition of a team of 40 members which will be led by the first Indian woman to scale Mount Everest Ms. Bachendri Pal. The expedition will start from Haridwar on October 5th 2018 traversing a distance of around 1500 km encompassing 8 major towns including Bijnor, Farrukhabad, Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi and Buxar. It will conclude in Patna in Bihar on 30th October. 

 

Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari addressed the team through a video message. He said that Namami Gange is working hard for cleanliness of Ganga River. “Several projects like sewage infrastructure, ghat cleaning, river surface cleaning etc. are going on and are at various stages of completion. But, these efforts need to be supported by all of us. Hence, public participation is one of the key components of the Namami Gange programme and this expedition also will create awareness at the local level through Ganga Chaupals and other interactions the expedition team will have with the local inhabitants”, the Minister added.

 

Speaking on the occasion, DG, NMCG Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra said: “During the month-long expedition, the team will stop at all major locations and carry out cleaning drives in coordination with NMCG stakeholders like Ganga Vichar Manch, Ganga Praharis, District Ganga Committees, local voluntary organizations and people from all walks of life. Awareness campaigns will be conducted in schools to sensitize students towards Ganga cleaning. Events such as Ganga Chaupal will be conducted along the Ganga to create conversations between stakeholders.”

 

TSAF Chief and “Mission Gange” expedition leader Ms Bachendri Pal said: “Our expedition is inspired by Government of India’s Namami Gange mission, which has been a very important step towards cleaning the Ganges that has been a life-supporting river for millions in our country. The aim of our expedition is to reach out to as many people as possible, heighten the awareness around keeping this great river clean and make a people’s movement out of the Mission that had started four years ago.”

 

In the expedition team of 40 members, several are trained mountaineers. Seven of them have climbed Mount Everest. Besides, professionals from backgrounds as diverse as engineering, environmentalists, science etc. are part of the expedition team that is prepared to meet all challenges that they may encounter during the expedition. The team during its stay in the towns will carry out cleanliness drives at ghats and surrounding areas by engaging and motivating more and more people.

                The Government today constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) to examine the existing legal and institutional frameworks for dealing with matters of sexual harassment of women at the workplace.  The GoM will recommend action required for effective implementation of the existing provisions, as well as for strengthening the existing legal and institutional frameworks for addressing issues related to sexual harassment at workplace.

The Group of Ministers has been constituted in view of the felt need for broader consultation on this issue, from the point of view of developing appropriate recommendations and laying down a comprehensive plan of action and for ensuring its time bound implementation.

The Group of Ministers will be chaired by the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh.  Its Members are:

 


	Shri Nitin Gadkari, Minister, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, and Ministry of Shipping.
	Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister, Ministry of Defence.
	Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Minister, Ministry of Women & Child Development


 

The Government is committed to ensure the safety and dignity of women in the workforce. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act is the key legislation for preventing and protecting women against sexual harassment in the workplace and to ensure effective redressal of complaints of sexual harassment. 

 

The Ministry of Women & Child Development has also launched an Electronic Complaints Box that enables women, irrespective of their work status, to raise their voice against sexual harassment at workplace. Once a complaint is submitted to the ‘SHe-Box’, it is directly sent to the concerned authority having jurisdiction to take action into the matter.  A mechanism will be put in place to regularly monitor the action taken on the complaints.           

The Group of Ministers will, within 3 months of its constitution, examine the existing provisions for the safety of women, including those mentioned above, and recommend further measures required to strengthen and make them more effective.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development is organizing the 5th edition of the Women of India Organic Festival from 26th October to 4th November, 2018 at Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, Janpath Road, New Delhi. This is aimed to boost organic culture and promote Women Organic Farmers and Entrepreneurs. Being the country's largest organic festival, it bears witness to the fact that women are the torchbearers of the nation's organic movement.

 

""The WOI Festival has given a successful platform to empower women farmers and entrepreneurs in a festive and fruitful manner for the past 4 years. It is a matter of great satisfaction for me that the Ministry’s efforts ultimately boost these illustrious rural women’s local communities and economy by creating jobs and keeping farmers thriving in addition to spreading awareness about the benefits of organic products,” said The Minister of Women & Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi.

 

With over 500 women entrepreneurs coming together from across the country with their organic products such as cereals, rice, pulses, skin-care products, fabric, jewellery, etc, this is the perfect example of how the festival is creating a revolution and making women self-reliant. For the first time, ‘The Vegan Project’ and Food Court with cooked-on-site delicacies will also be available. 

 

Participants from the remotest parts of the country travel and stay in Delhi for the entire duration of the Festival, while having the opportunity of selling their healthy and wholesome produce to the people of Delhi and surrounding areas. 

 

To make the organic movement more accessible to public, the Ministry has changed the venue for the 2018 edition to IGNCA and has kept Entry and Parking Free for All.

                The Ministry of Women and Child Development had recently consulted Ministry of Law in view of the overriding provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act over other criminal laws and provisions of mandatory reporting of such offences. The Ministry of Law after examining the provisions of POCSO Act vis-à-vis provisions of CrPC has advised that there appears no period of limitation mentioned in Section 19 in regard to reporting of the offences under the POCSO Act, 2012. The POCSO Act does not provide for any period of limitation for reporting the child sexual offences. On receipt of the opinion of Ministry of Law, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Minister of WCD stated that “Now any victim, at any age, can complain the sexual abuse faced by him/her as a child”. She urged the victims to report the cases through POCSO e-Box. 

Often, children are unable to report such crimes as the perpetrator in most cases is either a family member, a relative or closely known person. Studies have also shown that the child continues to carry the trauma of sexual abuse till very late in life.In order to overcome this trauma many grown up people have started coming out to report the abuse faced by them as children. 

The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act(POCSO), Act 2012, came into force on 14.11.2012. It is a gender neutral Actwhichhas been enacted to strengthen the legal provisions for the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation.

The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 defines a child as any person below the age of 18 years and provides protection to all children under the age of 18 years from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography.

                NITI Aayog is organizing the fourth edition of NITI Lecture Series at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi on 22.10.2018. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will attend the 4th edition of NITI Lecture series in which the key note address will be delivered by Jensen Huang, President and Co-Founder, NVIDIA Corporation. The theme this year is “AI for ALL: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Inclusive Growth”. Union Ministers, policy makers, experts from different walks of life along with NITI Aayog Vice Chairman, Members, CEO and Senior officials will be a part of august gathering on this occasion..

AI & NITI

 Artificial intelligence is the use of computers to simulate human intelligence. AI amplifies our cognitive abilities — letting us solve problems where the complexity is too great, the information is incomplete, or the details are too subtle and require expert training. 

Union Budget-2018 mandated NITI Aayog to come up with a national programme on employing Artificial Intelligence towards national development. NITI has, since, published a National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence.

National Strategy lays down the vision of India for evolving a robust ecosystem for AI research and adoption. The Strategy is termed #AIForAll as it is focused on leveraging AI for inclusive growth in line with the Government policy of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.

NITI Aayog has signed Statements of Intent (SoI) with industry leaders such as Google, Microsoft and IBM to leapfrog India into the global arena of future technologies and enable use of artificial intelligence in key, high gain sectors of social development – healthcare, agriculture, smart mobility, education and infrastructure. 

In order to demonstrate impact of AI, multiple pilot projects have been launched in the areas of precision agriculture, creating AI led healthcare solutions, and bridging India’s diversity of languages by creating a digital “Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat” platform using Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a system of protocols which allow machines or computers to understand and interact with human speech and symbols. 

The Prime Minister in his address at the launch of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution has underlined that with each wave of new technology, new opportunities arise.  The rise of Artificial Intelligence will help improve productivity and lead to equitable development.

Aiming to put AI to use for all and across sectors, NITI has identified barriers that needs to be addressed to achieve success in the use of AI. These include lack of expertise, absence of enabling data ecosystem, high resource cost and low awareness, privacy and security issues and absence of collaborative approach to adoption and application of AI.

Recognising the importance of research and its commercial adoption in success of AI, NITI has also proposed setting up of Centre of Research Excellence (CORE) to focus on developing better understanding of existing core research. Besides this, the strategy paper also recommends setting up of International Centres of Transformational AI with a mandate to develop and deploy application-based research in collaboration with private players.

                NITI Aayog launched today the Guidelines and Model Concessionaire Agreement, MCA for Public Private Partnership, PPP for Non Communicable Diseases. The documents have been designed to supplement efforts for provision of prevention and treatment services of non-communicable diseases related to Cardiac Sciences, Oncology, and Pulmonary Sciences at the district hospitals especially in tier 2 & 3 cities.

 

The documents have been developed by NITI Aayog in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, State Governments and representatives from the healthcare industry. Member NITI Aayog, Dr.VKPaulalong with partner agencies involved in preparation of the two documents were present on this occasion.

 

 

Salient features:

 

i.  PPP Units to be established in District Hospitals

ii.Model covers prevention and treatment of 3 Non-Communicable Diseases viz. Cardio Vascular diseases, Cancers and Pulmonary diseases.

iii.Scope of services:

a)Oncology: Palliative care, Medicinal /Conservative Management (including Chemotherapy, Growth Inhibitors & Hormone Therapy)

b)Pulmonology: Emergency Management of acute syndromes, Medicinal/Conservative Management for COPD, Bronchial Asthma and Bronchoscopy.

c)Cardiology: Emergency Management of acute syndromes, Medicinal/Conservative Management and Angiography/Angioplasty.

iv.     All these services in PPP facility to be offered by a Single partner or a single consortium of private partners.

v.    Private partner to invest in upgrading/building and equipping the facility and responsible for operational management and service delivery.

vi.   Government to provide physical space & other infrastructure in ‘as-is where-is’ condition, provide support facilities and hospital amenities.

vii.  User Fee to be fixed as the package rates discovered periodically through States/ Centre Insurance Scheme(s). States which do not have such insurance packages, could use CGHS package rates for period when such insurance rates are not available.

viii.      Viability Gap Funding (VGF) to be provided by the government(s) should be used as the parameter for bidding in the project.

Background:

The guidelines comes in the backdrop of the fact that the contribution of non-communicable diseases (NCD) to the overall disease burden in the country has increased over the years. In the past many district hospitals in the country have focused mainly on communicable diseases and reproductive and child health. As a result of which the capacity for handling NCD cases has not been adequately developed.

Health and wellness component of Ayushman Bharat will address the requirements of preventive and promotive health services through Health & Wellness Centres. Despite the best intent to promote wellness and deliver a broad range of services through these Centres, some cases will require hospitalized treatment and will spill over to district hospitals. 

Presently, in India patients have to travel long distances for availing medical services for NCDs due to urban bias in the availability of private health care, especially secondary and tertiary care which is disproportionately skewed towards Tier-1 cities. The patients in mofussil towns and rural areas are largely underserviced. In this context, PPP for NCDs in district hospitals will play a pivotal role in ensuring the availability of the services at least at the district headquarters.

The Model Concessionaire Agreement and the guidelines co-locating private players for the Non Communicable Diseases - Cardiac, Oncology, and Pulmonary diseases at district hospital covers the rationale, roles and responsibilities, partnership structure, governance and management structure etc. These PPP guidelines and MCA target the critical gaps that can be filled by ‘strategic purchasing’ in public health services highlighted in the National Health Policy 2017.  This would play a key role in directing private investment towards those areas and those services for which currently there are no providers or few providers.

The MCA and Guidelines for the provision of prevention and treatment services for NCDs could be adapted and customized by each State to ultimately develop appropriate strategies in accordance with the requirements provided in these documents. This will make it easier for the State to use these templates and modify them appropriately to invite bidders.

                 NITI Aayog and IBM today announced a first-of-its-kind internship programme for students selected by Atal Innovation Mission (AIM).

 

The internship will see 38 students receive a two-week paid internship, and 14 teachers from Atal Tinkering Labs (ATL) across the length and breadth of the country including from states such as Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar and others, to come together and ideate, collaborate and innovate.

 

These students will be equipped with the skills for new collar careers in areas like artificial intelligence, Internet-of-Things, cybersecurity, cloud computing and blockchain. Apart from being trained in emerging technologies, students will also be coached in critical workplace skills. 

 

As part of the program, select teachers from ATLs will also be trained by IBM volunteers and mentors to become innovation coaches. The two-week program is designed so students can experience the corporate environment and gain exposure to new technologies. To scale the programme, top-performing students are selected for industry exposure to strengthen their technical skills and prepare them for future jobs.

 

The Atal Innovation Mission conducted the Atal Tinkering Marathon in 2017 where Top 30 innovations across five focus areas - agritech, healthcare, smart mobility, clean energy, waste management, water management - were identified as the top innovations.


Students from the Top 30 teams have since been offered various opportunities like the Student Innovator Programme, the ATL Bootcamp with industry partners, opportunity to participate in global innovation contests like World Robot Olympiad (WRO), and an internship opportunity with IBM India at their Bengaluru campus.

 

The IBM internship program is focussed on enhancing the skills of the students via various innovative activities like design thinking approach, developing prototypes and solution for community issues and to solve them.

                The NITI Aayog and ICC International Court of Arbitration organised the inaugural Training-cum-Brainstorming Workshop on Best Practices in International Arbitration in New Delhi today.

Moving towards a New India in 2022, ensuring legal reform is a key and critical priority. Complementing ‘Make in India’ vision with ‘Resolve in India’, strong alternate dispute resolution mechanisms are important levers in encouraging the Ease of Doing Business and Ease of Living in India.

The workshop was inaugurated by the chief guest, Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri, Judge, Supreme Court of India, and was presided over by P.P. Chaudhary, MoS, Ministry of Law and Justice. Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog was also present during the workshop.

The workshop is part of on-going efforts to institutionalize and streamline dispute resolution to make India a hub for doing business. Following the international conference on arbitration held in 2016 and the National Law Day conference in 2017, the present workshop continues to encourage and highlight the need for understanding and implementing arbitration across the spectrum of commercial contracts, with over 200 senior officers from Central and State Governments, and Public Sector Undertakings participating. 

With government’s thrust on ‘Make in India’, it is important for investors, both domestic and international, to have faith in the dispute resolution mechanism in India. In this regard, a well drafted dispute resolution mechanism and a comprehensive understanding of best practices and procedures would complement the initiative and give the much-needed impetus to effective and timely enforcement of contracts. 

The workshop covered basic concepts of international arbitration and included best practices on drafting of arbitration agreements, factors to consider when deciding on the seat, venue, institution and governing law. It also covered topics related to the selection of arbitrators; enforcement of arbitral awards and the role of courts before, during and after the arbitration. The topics of the information sharing session were delivered by world class faculty and practitioners from the United Kingdom, Singapore, Paris and India.

The training-cum-brainstorming workshop is an important part of the on-going endeavour by NITI Aayog in a co-operative setting to skill and prepare senior officers for global best practices and give them the opportunity to gain expertise in enhancing the ability to understand, review, revise and draft Arbitration related aspects of contracts.

NITI Aayog Encouraging Arbitration in India

NITI Aayog first highlighted the importance of Arbitration by organizing a successful two-day conference on international arbitration in 2016 with over 1400 participants, which was presided over by the President of India and Prime Minister of India and saw participation from the Chief Justices of all SAARC countries. The conference explored the vitality of commercial arbitration, both domestic and international, as the preferred method of resolving disputes between parties. NITI also organized the two-day National Law Day Conference in 2017, with the Law Commission of India, which treaded new ground with debate and discussion on a multitude of legal aspects, including dispute resolution. This conference also saw over 1400 participants on each day of the event and the participation of the President of India, the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India, Union Cabinet Ministers and eminent personalities.

                Namrup, Assam: This day of Oct 5th, 2018 is a historic day for India, Northeast and Assam Petro-chemicals, a state-owned company for launching Asia's first cannisters based and India's first ""Methanol Cooking Fuel Program"". The program was inaugurated by Dr V K Saraswat, Member, NITI Aayog and Chairman, Methanol Apex Committee at the Assam Petro-chemicals campus at Namrup. 

500 households inside the Assam Petro Complex will be the first pilot project, scaling it to 40,000 households in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Telangana, Goa and Karnataka. The project is a natural extension of our Prime Minister's vision of reducing import of crude and an effort to provide clean, import substitute, cost effective and pollution free cooking medium. Assam Petrochemicals Limited has been manufacturing methanol for the last 30 years and is in the process of upgrading their 100 TPD methanol plant to 600 TPD by Dec 2019. 

The safe handling cannister based cooking stoves are from Swedish Technology and through a Technology transfer a large-scale cooking stove manufacturing plant will come up in India in the next 18 months producing 10 lakh Cookstoves and 1 Crore Cannisters per year.  This technology is very unique, it handles methanol extremely safely, does not need regulator or any piping system. 

The cooking medium can directly substitute LPG, Kerosene, Wood, Charcoal and any other fuel for cooking. The gaseous form, Methanol - DME, can be blended in 20% ratio with LPG. LPG-DME blending program is expected to kickstart in the country by next year. 

1.2 litres cannisters can last for full five hours on twin burners and 8 such Cannisters as rack can last for one month for a family of three. The cost of energy equivalent of one cylinder of LPG for Methanol is Rs. 650, compared to Rs. 850 per cylinder resulting in a minimum of 20% Savings. For instance, in Manipur the cost of transportation of LPG is Rs. 200, whereas same cost for Methanol will be Rs. 12. This provides for an excellent alternative as household fuel and commercial, institutional and fuel for restaurants. China uses 4 MMTA of Methanol as Cooking Fuel annually.

                The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has allowed the facility of withdrawal of applications by candidates. The arrangement will be implemented beginning with Engineering Services Examination, 2019. This was announced by the Chairman of UPSC Shri Arvind Saxena, while speaking on the occasion of the 92nd Foundation Day Celebrations here today. 

The Chairman said that UPSC’s experience with the Civil Services Examination is that roughly 50% of the 10 lakh plus candidates who fill in the application forms for the Preliminary examination actually write the examination.  “The Commission has to book venues, print papers, hire invigilators and ship the documents for all the 10 lakh applicants – which turns out to be a 50% waste of energy and resources”, he said.  “UPSC’s view is that if we are able to work with genuine and serious candidates, we can give them better facilities and make our system more efficient”, he added. A start is being made with the Engineering Services Examination, 2019 and more examinations will be brought under this arrangement. In order to avail this facility, the candidate has to provide details of application. Separate OTPs will be sent on candidate’s registered mobile number and email id. On successful completion of withdrawal of application, confirmation message will be sent on email and also an SMS. Once application has been withdrawn, it cannot be revived.

With a view to reduce the stress for the candidates, the UPSC has brought an increasing number of exam related interactions and transactions online. In this regard, Shri Saxena said “We are also moving ahead with shifting from a “pen and paper” mode of examination to a computer-based mode.  Apart from making the examination process more candidate-friendly, the new systems also serve to cut down the time cycle for each examination.”

Bearing in mind the aspirations of the youth for better job opportunities, the Chairman said that the Commission is now disclosing the scores and ranking of the non-recommended candidates in some examinations on its website and further linking it with the “National Career Services” portal of the Ministry of Labour and Employment. He said, “Central Ministries and organizations can, conceivably take advantage of this arrangement wherein candidates who have cleared a rigorous screening process in the Civil Services, Engineering   Services or Combined Medical Services Examinations, but could not find a place in the merit list due to constraints of vacancies, can now look forward to being picked up for other Government, public sector or private sector jobs, from the same data base.”  The measure should obviate the need for conducting of multiple and separate examinations by different organizations for posts with similar entry level qualifications, he added. This   will reduce the stress on young job aspirants and also the time taken for recruitment by various bodies.

He also referred to the recent judgment of Supreme Court regarding appointment of DGPs of states as well as Government’s proposal of lateral entry into the services. He said these developments have heightened the responsibilities of UPSC.  

Referring to the ‘Gandhi Jayanti’ on 2nd October, Shri Saxena said that the bronze Gandhi statue in UPSC building signifies the ethos of Civil Services. He said “the message to aspirants is quite simply this: that when you join the civil services, you join to serve the masses.”

The Members of the Commission, former Chairmen and Members of the Commission, officers and staff of the UPSC were present on the occasion.

                Over the nine years of enforcement of the Competition Act, 2002 (the Act), the Competition Commission of India (‘the Commission’) has received 52 cases pertaining to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector. The Commission, while deciding on the cases, has observed that information asymmetry in the pharmaceutical/healthcare sector significantly restricts consumer choice. In the absence of consumer sovereignty, various industry practices flourish which have the effect of choking competition and are detrimental to consumer interest. Such practices may not always violate the provisions of the Act, but they create conditions that do not allow markets to work effectively and healthy competition to drive the market outcomes. The response to these issues can, in many instances,take the form of appropriate regulations that can pre-empt market-distorting practices and help create pro-competition conditions. 

 

As the competition authority of the country, the Commission felt the need for close examination and focused deliberations on these issues, which have implications for markets and competition in this sector of critical importance. In pursuance of the same, a series of initiatives has been taken up by the Commission over the years in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector, which culminated in a Technical Workshop on ‘Competition Issues in the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Sector in India’ organised on August 28-29, 2018 in New Delhi with representatives of all stakeholder groups, including pharmaceutical industry, healthcare service providers, civil society organisations, regulators, healthcare think tanks. 

 

The issues identified and recommendations suggested by the stakeholders have been documented in a Policy Note by the Commission titled ‘Making Markets Work for Affordable Healthcare’.Thekey issues and recommendations are as under:

 

Role of intermediaries in drug price build-up

 


	One major factor that contributes to high drug prices in India is the unreasonably high trade margins. The high margins are a form of incentive and an indirect marketing tool employed by drug companies. Further, self-regulation by trade associations also contributes towards high margins as these associations control the entire drug distribution system in a manner that reduces competition. 
	Efficient and wider public procurement and distribution of essential drugs can circumvent the challenges arising from the distribution chain, supplant sub-optimal regulatory instruments such as price control and allow for access to essential medicines at lower prices.
	Electronic trading of drugs, with appropriate regulatory safeguards, could be another potent instrument for bringing in transparency andspurring price competition among platforms and among retailers, as has been witnessed in other product segments.


 

Quality perception behind proliferation of branded generics

 


	Worldwide, generic drugs are seen as a key competitive force against the patent-expired brand name drugs marketed at monopoly prices. In India, the pharmaceutical market is dominated by ‘branded generics’ which limit generic-induced price competition. The branded generic drugs enjoy a price premium owing to perceived quality assurance that comes with the brand name. Quality consideration may be a reason behind the prescription of branded generics by doctors. However, it is also equally possible that the brand proliferation is to introduce artificial product differentiation in the market, offering no therapeutic difference but allowing firms to extract rents. 
	The regulatory apparatusmust address the issue of quality perception by ensuring consistent application of statutory quality control measures and better regulatory compliance. Unless the quality of drugs sold in markets can be taken to be in conformance of the statutory standards regardless of their brand names, generic competition in the true sense of the term cannot take off.
	The practice of creating artificial product differentiation for exploitation of consumersmay be addressed through a one-company-one drug-one brand name-one price policy.


 

Vertical arrangements in healthcare services

 


	In view of the incentive-based referral system that pervades the healthcare landscape, issuing of periodic validated data by hospitals relating to mortality rate, infection rate, number of procedures etc. could help patients make informed choice. 
	The in-house pharmacies of super specialty hospitals are completely insulated from competition as inpatients are typically not allowed to purchase any product from outside pharmacies. This calls for regulation that mandates hospitals to allow consumers to buy standardised consumables from the open market.
	All accredited diagnostic labs should meet the same quality standards in terms of infrastructure, equipment, skilled manpower etc. for getting accreditation. This will ensure the same degree of reliability and accuracy of test results across labs.
	There is no regulatory framework that ensures and governs portability of patient data, treatment record, diagnostic reports between hospitals. This acts as a constraint for patients in switching from one hospital to another and creates a lock-in effect.Portability of patient data can help ensure that a patient is no longer locked into the data silos and do not bear additional cost for switching medical services and that doctors/hospitals can have timely access to patient data.


 

Regulation and competition

 


	Owing to the multiplicity of regulators governing the pharmaceutical sector at the centre and state level, implementation of regulations is not uniform across the country. This has resulted in multiple standards of same products and also different levels of regulatory compliance requirements.
	A mechanism may be devised under the aegis of the CDSCO to harmonisethe criteria/processes followed by the state licensing authorities to ensure uniformity in interpretation and implementation.
	It is also imperative to make the approval of new drugs time-bound along with publication of detailed guidelines governing each stage of new drug approval process.


            

Finally, two other major issues that affect the healthcare sector and thus warrant policy response are: (i) shortage of healthcare professionals in the country owinginter aliato high cost of medical education and (ii) inadequacy in health insurance. Public health delivery is a complicated policy matter. The focus of the Policy Note does not lose sight of legitimate public policy objectives, but endeavours to determine the extent to which choice and competition can improve outcomes consistent with those objectives. Accordingly, the Policy Note is being shared with Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Department of Pharmaceuticals and NITI Aayog. The Commission will continue to enforce antitrust rules in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector to ensure that effective competition is not undermined in these markets. However, since enforcement cannot address all competition issues in the sector, the instrument of competition advocacy isemployed with more vigour to facilitate discussions and make policy changes that are necessary to address the conditionstriggering non-competitive market outcomes.

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI), in continuation of its efforts towards simplifying and providing greater clarity on the application of the combination provisions of the Act and the Combination Regulations, has further amended the Combination Regulations on 09th October 2018. This amendment inter alia provide certainty & transparency and expedites faster disposal of combination cases before CCI.

The provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 (“Act”) relating to the regulation of combinations as well as the Combination Regulations have been in force with effect from 1st June 2011. 

A key change brought about by the present amendments is that the parties to combinations can now submit remedies voluntarily in response to the notice issued under Section 29(1) of the Act. If such remedies are considered sufficient to address the perceived competition harm, the combination can be approved. This amendment is expected to expedite disposal of such combination cases.

In another significant amendment, where the notice is found to exhibit significant information gaps, parties to combinations are allowed to withdraw the notice and refile the same. With this amendment, the parties could address the deficiencies without facing an invalidation by CCI. Further, fee already paid in respect of such notice shall be adjusted against the fee payable in respect of new notice, if the refiling is done within a period of 3 months. 

Apart from these, certain consequential and other clarificatory changes have also been made in the Combination Regulations.  

A copy of the amendment is available on the website of the Commission: www.cci.gov.in
