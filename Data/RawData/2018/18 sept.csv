                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention in New Delhi today (September 29, 2018).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that achieving universal access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene by 2030 is a major challenge in many parts of the world. Drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene are central to Sustainable Development Goal 6, especially targets 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3. Target 6.2 of the Sustainable Development Goals calls for countries to end open defecation, ensure everyone has access to a basic toilet and put in place systems for safe management of excreta.

The President said that improving access to sanitation and eradicating open defecation have enormous implications. They are critical social and economic investments. The absence of a suitable toilet and appropriate hygiene and sanitation practices can lead to malnutrition and life-long disadvantages. Therefore, for us in India – as elsewhere – a mission such as Swachh Bharat is critical to securing our human capital and our demographic dividend – and to giving our children a better future. No young girl should have to give up school only because a girls’ toilet is not available. Such an occurrence would be a scar on our collective conscience.

The President said that Swachh Bharat is a revolution playing out in real time. As an instrument of mass mobilisation, as a people’s movement, and as a national goal towards which there is near total commitment, Swachh Bharat represents the spirit of our Independence movement. India is striving to eliminate open defecation in its entirety by October 2, 2019. This is the best 150th birthday gift we can give Gandhiji.

The President said that the Swachh Bharat Mission has been shaped by among the world’s leading specialists on sanitation. It has been scripted by common Indians of uncommon quality – men and women of rare courage, of foresight, social empathy and civic pride. Individually and collectively, they have worked to free their neighbourhoods, their villages and their towns and cities from open defecation. Inch by inch, day by day, person by person, family by family, they have persuaded fellow citizens to adopt behaviour change. Our sanitation champions come from all regions of the country, all sections of society, all communities and all social and economic groups.

Addressing Ministers and delegates from 68 participating countries, the President said that our successes with Swachh Bharat, our attainments in the sphere of sanitation, our methods and our mechanisms, are available to all of them to use as they deem necessary. Access to improved sanitation is not a target and a goal for one country or the other – it is the interlinked destiny of humankind.

The President suggested five important themes that countries may choose to adopt while meeting the problem of insufficient sanitation. These are - ensure people lead the planning, implementation and management of sanitation programmes; use smart and affordable technologies for effective and efficient service delivery; eliminate all forms of inequalities in service delivery; create innovative financing instruments to fund and sustain the sanitation movement; and develop capacities within the government to plan, implement and monitor sanitation programmes.

The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention is being organised by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation to mark the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi, also coinciding with the fourth anniversary of the launch of Swachh Bharat Mission.

The President said that India and Bhutan share an exemplary bilateral partnership.  Our relations are unique and special and our historical and cultural linkages make us natural friends and partners.  India has been happy to share its knowledge, experience and resources with Bhutan as per Bhutan’s priorities. He iterated that India remains committed to consolidating ongoing economic cooperation with Bhutan.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the centenary celebrations of the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha in New Delhi today (September 22, 2018).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that languages connect people. There are numerous languages and dialects in India. All of them have their special nature and beauty. This diversity adds to India’s culture and well-being. He said that institutions like the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha have played a very important role in strengthening the emotional unity of our country. He noted that the Sabha has developed a network of about 20,000 Hindi campaigners. 

The President said that every Indian should try to learn an Indian language other than his or her own. When a Hindi-speaking youth learns Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam or Kannada, he or she is introduced to a very rich tradition. This knowledge can create new opportunities for the individual.

Speaking on the occasion, the President was happy to note that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has started the Foundation Training Programme for the General Duty Medical Officers of the Central Health Service to equip them to deal with multiple roles. He said that universal health coverage is a priority for our government. The rollout of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a critical step not just for the management of public health but for safeguarding our most precious asset – our human capital.

The President said that in the course of our development as a nation we have achieved significant milestones in the health sector. But a combination of old and new challenges lies before us. The disease burden in our country is undergoing an evolution. We have to tackle widespread diseases such as TB, malaria and dengue, and at the same time deal with the rising incidence of lifestyle diseases. Along with challenges of our disease burden, we have issues of delivery, access to services and affordability. The road before all of us is tough but not impossible to navigate. With dedication, drive and determination, we can do it.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced a function organised to felicitate Indian scholars who were acknowledged at the 11th World Hindi Conference – held recently in Mauritius – in New Delhi today (September 17, 2018). 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Hindi has a strong presence on the world map. Outside India, more than one crore people speak Hindi and it is being taught in universities of major countries. The 11th World Hindi Conference saw the participation of more than 2,000 representatives from 45 countries.

 

The President said that to enhance its presence, Hindi has to adapt to science and technology – both in content and dissemination. We live in the age of technology, the President said. Smart-phones are eroding distances between languages and technology could similarly be used in the propagation of Hindi. The President also praised the role played by Hindi cinema in popularising the language in India and abroad.

                Separate groups of officer trainees of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service, Indian Trade Service and Indian Information Service together called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (September 17, 2018) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 

Addressing the officer trainees, the President said that the Audit and Accounts Service officers have a critical role in ensuring the accountability of the executive to the legislature. The reports of the CAG, submitted to the legislature, play a pivotal part in enforcing accountability on the executive. Officers of the Audit and Accounts Service are guardians of public trust and financial prudence. 

 

The President said that in today’s globalised world, the strength of a nation is assessed by the strength of its economy. Nations compete for a share of global markets and trade. While we have done quite well in promoting our trade in the past two decades, there is a lot more to be achieved. Historically, India had a substantial share in global trade. Today, our country’s share in global trade is around two per cent. The officers of the Trade Service too have an important role in ensuring that our country regains its position in the global trade order.

 

The President said that despite the Information Age, there is still a large segment of our population that lacks awareness about government programmes and welfare schemes from which they can benefit. We must ensure that information about these programmes and schemes reaches citizens living in the remotest of places and the smallest of villages. It is here that officers of the Indian Information Service play an important role. It is for Indian Information Service officers to make the government’s outreach and communication relevant, timely, practical and effective.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Karnatak Law Society and the Raja Lakhamgouda Law College today (September 15, 2018) in Belagavi, Karnataka.

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that law is not a career, it is a calling. It is a mechanism to assist the cause of justice, to help the poorest and most unfortunate among us, and to build a society and nation defined by adherence to rules, norms and fairness. Advocates and judges are, in the ultimate analysis, seekers of truth.

The President said that we live in an age of technology and of entrepreneurship. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is upon us. It is changing how we live and work. It is also changing aspirations of our young people. Our educational institutions have to become compatible with this quest for innovation and excellence. They have to become compatible with the 21st century.

The President said that the teaching of law, the very evolution of law, amid rapid technological development is critical. The time span for an innovation to take place, and for its mass application in society, is shortening very sharply. This will throw up numerous challenges for law – in areas such as genetic engineering, bioethics and artificial intelligence, among others. The legal profession has to respond quickly. He expressed confidence that our leading legal minds will put their thoughts into such matters.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, attended a roundtable discussion of Indologists at Charles University in Prague today (September 8, 2018).  

Speaking on the occasion, the President said Indology has a very old tradition in Prague, starting with the establishment of a Chair in Sanskrit at Charles University in 1850. Professor Lesny was among the founding fathers of the Czech school of Indology. He was the first European Indologist who translated Rabindranath Tagore’s poetry directly from Bengali into Czech, instead of using English as an intermediary. The President said Indology has not just brought India and the Czech Republic together. It has had an enormous role in the making of modern India and rediscovering India’s rich past.  

Later in the day, the President visited ELI Beamlines International Laser Research Centre in Prague. He received detailed briefings at this cutting-edge institution, one of the world’s centres of laser technology and research. Coinciding with President Kovind’s visit, ELI Beamlines has signed an agreement with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai. Technologists from TIFR also met the President and briefed him on the implications of their work in a variety of fields, including healthcare, energy, and security. 

The President will leave for New Delhi tomorrow (September 9, 2018) on the completion of his three-nation visit to Cyprus, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic. Before leaving Prague, the President will visit Thakurova Park, named in honour of Rabindranath Tagore, and pay respects to the poet.  

Yesterday evening (September 7, 2018), the President addressed members of the India-Czech Republic Business Forum in Prague. The President said the economies of India and the Czech Republic have significant complementarities. Indian companies have expertise in IT, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, automobiles and services. India offers a vast market and potential to scale up for Czech companies in heavy engineering, defence, advanced manufacturing, and automotive and energy technologies.  

The President said the defence sector has been a vital area of cooperation between India and the Czech Republic. He invited Czech defence companies to invest and manufacture in India. He said from Bata to Skoda, the Indo-Czech partnership has been defined by popular embrace, sustainable practices and business confidence.  

The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Mr Andrej Babis, and the President of the House of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, Mr Radek Vondracek, also called on President Kovind yesterday evening (September 7, 2018). In the meeting with Prime Minister Babis, the President discussed closer defence and business relations and the scope for Czech manufacturing companies to partner with India.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, reached the Czech Republic yesterday (September 6, 2018) on the final leg of his state visit to three European nations – Cyprus, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic. The President commenced his engagements today (September 7, 2018) with a visit to the Prague Castle where he was received by Mr Milos Zeman, the President of the Czech Republic, and accorded a ceremonial welcome. 

During the subsequent one-to-one discussions with President Zeman, and later the delegation-level talks that both Presidents lead, President Kovind thanked his host for the warmth and hospitality with which his delegation and he had been received. He emphasised India’s keenness to cooperate with the Czech Republic in the fields of defence, technology and manufacture, business and trade, as well as on issues of multilateral importance such as terrorism. President Kovind said that Czech strengths in manufacturing and advanced technology make the country a natural fit to partner Indian economic growth and next-generation development.

President Kovind also thanked the President and government of the Czech Republic for a special carve-out for mobility of high-skilled Indian workers and business executives to work and live in the Czech Republic on a long-term basis. Initially limited to 500 visas a year, the new procedure will come into effect in October 2018.

India and the Czech Republic are signing five agreements as part of President Kovind’s visit. These are:


	Cooperation between the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, India, and the Czech Academy of Sciences
	A work plan to support Indo-Czech projects in diverse areas of science and technology, with the Department of Science and Technology taking the lead from the Indian side
	A visa waiver agreement for diplomatic passport holders
	Cooperation in laser technology between ELI Beamlines and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research 
	Cooperation between the Haryana Agricultural University and the Czech University of Life Sciences


In addition, India and the Czech Republic have agreed to initiate cooperation in civil nuclear energy. Details of a prospective agreement between the Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership, Jhajjar, Haryana, and a relevant Czech institution are to be worked out.

The President also issued a media statement on his visit to the Czech Republic (attached).  

Later, the President attended a luncheon banquet hosted in his honour by President Milos Zeman of the Czech Republic. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that President Zeman’s visit to India in 2001, in his capacity as Prime Minister, provided impetus to bilateral relations. The President said that the Indian growth story and Czech technology and manufacturing make us natural partners.  

Yesterday evening (September 6, 2018), the President addressed an impressive gathering of the Indian community at a reception in Prague hosted by Smt Narinder Chauhan, Ambassador of India to the Czech Republic. Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India considers every Indian abroad as an ambassador. He urged members of the diaspora to share the beauty of India’s culture and business potential with the host community.

                The President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, today (September 6, 2018) met the Prime Minister of Bulgaria, Mr Boyko Borissov in Sofia. During the discussions, the President said that under his leadership Bulgaria has made appreciable progress as a nation. He also complimented him for successfully conducting the rotating Presidency of the European Union from January to June 2018. 

 

The President said India is keen to substantially upgrade its economic relations with Bulgaria. Bulgaria is doing well in the fields of IT, pharma, technology, food processing, among other sectors. These are areas where there is strong interest among Indian companies to forge joint ventures and invest in Bulgaria. 

 

The President said that our defence collaboration has been going on for long. India is keen to leverage Bulgarian know-how and technology. India invites Bulgarian companies to come and manufacture in India as part of our Make in India programme. 

 

Later in the day, the President, jointly with the President of Bulgaria, unveiled a statue of Mahatma Gandhi at South Park, Sofia. In his remarks on the occasion, the President said that he was grateful to the people of Bulgaria for giving Mahatma Gandhi an eternal home in Bulgaria on their special day – the National Unification Day. This is a meaningful tribute to a man who dedicated his entire life to the service of humanity. In these times of strife, reckless violence and wanton destruction, his thoughts and values are ever more relevant. 

 

Following the conclusion of his visit to Bulgaria, the President left for the Czech Republic – the last leg of his journey to three European nations – Cyprus, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic. 

 

Yesterday (September 5, 2018), the President addressed the Bulgaria-India Business Forum in Sofia.

 

Addressing the gathering, the President said that there are natural synergies between the two economies and we need to tap them for our mutual benefit. Bulgarian companies can take advantage of the high growth trajectory of the Indian economy. And Indian companies could form partnerships in Bulgaria both for the domestic market and for the wider EU economy. The President said that our bilateral trade stands at just over US $ 300 million. This falls way below potential. He expressed confidence that a lot more can be done together if we drive deeper into each other’s economies.

 

Later last evening (September 5, 2018), the President attended a banquet hosted in his honour by the President of Bulgaria, Mr Rumen Radev. In his remarks at the banquet, the President said that the future of our relations lies with our youth. We must get our young ones to engage with each other. Bulgarian star, Dimitar Berbatov has already inspired many football fans in India. And now, with the magic of cinema and the beauty of Bulgarian mountains at work, we are connecting still more.

	It is an honour for me to unveil the statue of Mahatma Gandhi along with President Radev.


 


	Today is a sacred day for the Bulgarian people. You are celebrating your National Unification Day. My good wishes to all of you on this occasion. I am, indeed, grateful to the people of Bulgaria for giving Mahatma Gandhi an eternal home in their beautiful country on this special day. 


 


	 The statue conceived and erected by the eminent Bulgarian sculptor Ivan Rusevis a meaningful tribute to a man who dedicated his entire life to the service of humanity. In these times of strife, reckless violence and wantondestruction, his thoughts and values are ever more relevant.  


 


	 This installation could not have been better timed.  In less than a month’s time, on 2ndOctober, we are launching our worldwide celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birthday. I count on your support to make them a success in Bulgaria.   


 


	This is an emotional moment for me, as we pay homage to our Father of the Nation and to a global apostle of peace and non-violence. He turned the politically unimaginable into the politically inevitable. 


 


	His life was a moral force that influenced many. His struggle in South Africa inspired Nelson Mandela to wage his epic battle against apartheid and his doctrine of Satyagraha became the inspiration for the civil rights movement led by Martin Luther Kingin the United States.


 


	Mahatma Gandhi had a special connection with Bulgaria. The famous Bulgarian painter, Boris Georgiev, spent considerable time with Gandhiji in his ashram developing a close friendship. 


 


	On behalf of the Government and people of India and on my own behalf, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to making this wonderful initiative possible. I once again convey my best wishes for the continued progress and prosperity of the Bulgarian people.   


 

Thank you!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, reached Bulgaria yesterday (September 4, 2018) on the second leg of his state visit to three European nations – Cyprus, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic. 

Today (September 5, 2018), the President delivered an address at Sofia University on the theme “Education as an Instrument of Change and Shared Prosperity”. The address coincided with Teachers’ Day in India, commemorating the birth anniversary of Dr S. Radhakrishnan, India’s second President.

Speaking on the occasion, the President paid tributes to India’s teachers, scholars and academics. He said they have drawn from India’s age-old traditions of learning and wisdom - and they have contributed to India’s reputation as a knowledge power. Across continents, Indian scholarship and academic excellence is recognised. It adds to the global economy and knowledge structures – and it earns India goodwill.

The President said the 21st century is an era of dramatic technological change. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, Artificial Intelligence, and the maturing of robotics and of 3D and precision manufacture are changing how we live and work. Digital technologies are allowing us to make jumps that were hitherto not possible. 

The President said that the technology and digital revolution is being led by young people from campuses. The university campuses of the 21st century are not just providers of degrees but also hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship and incubators of start-ups and small businesses driven by technology – and by creative minds buzzing with ideas and designing game-changing apps.

The President said that this is a revolution playing out in real time in India. It has made India the world’s third-largest innovation and start-up hub. The start-up universe in India is creating not just jobs and wealth – but also intellectual property. India’s R&D investments are expected to touch US dollars 83 billion this year. This is an exciting ecosystem. He invited young Bulgarians to become a part of it. Bulgarians, he said, are among students from 166 countries studying in Indian universities and institutions of higher learning.

Earlier this morning (September 5, 2018), the President visited the Saint Alexander Nevski Square where he was received by President Rumen Radev of Bulgaria and accorded a ceremonial welcome. He also paid respects at the Monument of the Unknown Soldier.   

During the subsequent one-to-one discussions with President Radev, the President thanked him for his warmth and hospitality. The President said his visit is aimed at further strengthening India-Bulgaria political relations and building an economic partnership. Subsequently, the President led delegation-level talks between the two sides. Speaking on the occasion, he said the all-round progress achieved by Bulgaria deserves recognition and admiration. India is also on a strong growth path. There is potential for us to enhance economic cooperation. We could collaborate in the fields of IT, defence, pharma, food processing, entertainment and tourism, among others.  

Following the delegation-level talks, bilateral agreements were signed and exchanged. India and Bulgaria have signed five agreements during President Kovind’s visit:


	An agreement between Invest India and Invest Bulgaria
	An agreement on cooperation in and facilitation of tourism
	An agreement on enhanced science and technology cooperation
	An agreement on civil nuclear research and cooperation
	An agreement between the Indian Council of Cultural Relations and Sofia University to promote Hindi studies


The President also issued a media statement on his visit to Bulgaria (attached).  

Yesterday evening (September 4, 2018), the President addressed an impressive gathering of the Indian community and the Friends of India organisation at a reception hosted by Ms Pooja Kapur, Ambassador of India to the Republic of Bulgaria.  

Addressing the gathering, the President said the Indian diaspora in Bulgaria constitutes a living bridge between the two countries. Their numbers may be small but they have made appreciable contributions to fostering bilateral ties. The President appreciated Friends of India for creating a network of cultural and academic institutions, yoga schools and ayurveda centres in Bulgaria. He noted that the Indology Department of Sofia University has been doing stellar work for the past 35 years. Its scholars have translated eight of the principal Upanishads from Sanskrit into Bulgarian.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, delivered an address at the University of Cyprus today (September 4, 2018). The theme of the address was “Youth, Technology and Ideas: Shaping the Contours of the 21st Century”.  

 

Addressing the gathering, the President said we live in a rapidly evolving world. The scale of change we are likely to see in a decade or so will be unprecedented in human history. The world of technology, start-ups, innovations, new ideas, digital assistants, clean energy and pasta straws would reorient our daily lives in an unbelievable manner. What is of deeper import is that perhaps for the first time in history, youth are directly involved in bringing about sweeping changes and on such a massive scale. 

 

The President said that technology has opened a whole new world of learning. And it has also made it easier to accomplish our tasks. One should, however, not get carried away by the instant nature of technology. The pursuit of excellence should be the key factor that dominates the minds of future generations.  

 

The President said the changing world demands greater collaboration among the global community. We must create open source platforms for communities and countries to access the fruits of science and technology. Access, equity and inclusion should remain key to developing and deploying technologies. The Indian experience is of relevance. Empowerment through digital access is an objective that the Government of India is committed to. 

 

The President said that a far greater challenge for us is to manage climate change and environmental stress. For the present generation, this challenge amounts to dealing with variability in weather patterns, flash floods and forest fires. The severity might be far more serious for future generations. The problem is not insurmountable. By adding sustainability to development, by preserving forests, respecting ecology and by adopting clean energy options, we can tackle climate change. On this count, India has taken the lead through the International Solar Alliance. As two ancient cultures, India and Cyprus have lived in harmony with nature for centuries. It is time for us to bring sustainable practices into our modern lives. New age technology combined with the wisdom of the past can solve many of our ecological problems. 

 

Following the conclusion of his visit to Cyprus, the President left for Bulgaria. This will be the second leg of his journey to three European nations – Cyprus, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic. This evening (September 4, 2018), he will meet and address the Indian community in Sofia.

 

Yesterday evening (September 3, 2018), the President attended a banquet hosted in his honour by President Nicos Anastasiades of Cyprus. Speaking on the occasion, the President said India and Cyprus have always been open and receptive to ideas, cultures and peoples. Our shared historical experience and sensibilities have drawn us closer as friends and as partners. We have been steadfast supporters of each other on issues of vital concern. India’s commitment to Cyprus and its territorial integrity remains deep and abiding.

 

The President said that India and Cyprus are located in a challenging security environment. We must support each other in our quest for peace and security. India deeply appreciates the strong condemnation of terrorist acts by Cyprus and looks forward to closely working with it to defeat and destroy terrorism.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, has greeted teachers across the country on the eve of Teachers’ Day.

In a message, the President has said, “On the occasion of Teachers’ Day, I have great pleasure in extending my greetings and felicitations to teachers.

A characteristic feature of our culture and heritage has been the Guru-Shishya Parampara. We are very fortunate and blessed as a civilization to have always had, since time immemorial, great gurus who have led seekers of truth to their goal.

Today, on Teachers’ Day, we remember the lasting contributions made by the former President, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, an eminent scholar and educationist.

Let us pray, on this auspicious day, that our Gurus continue to help and guide us, individually and collectively, in building a nation and world defined by wisdom, peace and harmony”.

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, reached Cyprus yesterday (September 2, 2018) on the first leg of his State Visit to three European nations – Cyprus, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic. He addressed the members of the House of Representatives of Cyprus today (September 3, 2018) in Nicosia.

 

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that relations between Cyprus and India are old, deep and have multiple facets. As ancient civilisations, our first priority is our people. The strong connection between the citizens of Cyprus and India is the most important source of our bilateral energy. From people-to-people contacts, we build economic and trade links, educational and intellectual connections, and a fruitful bilateral partnership. Then of course are issues of common concern and our mutual commitment to peace, security and sovereignty. This takes us to the multilateral sphere and to global matters, where inevitably we find ourselves on the same side.  

 

The President said that India’s overriding mission is its economic growth and modernisation, with the fruits of development reaching all sections of our people. Cyprus, as a trusted partner and as one of the largest investors in India, is critical to this process. India is at an exciting juncture and offers appealing business opportunities. India’s GDP had grown at a scorching 8.2 per cent in the previous quarter. This is part of a trend of high growth over the past few years. It has made India the world’s fastest-growing large economy. The President invited Cyprus to partner in various initiatives of the Government of India. He said that India is open for business – and India is open for Cyprus. 

 

The President said that earlier this year India co-founded and hosted the inaugural conference of the International Solar Alliance. The ISA is central to our effort to mobilise international resources and technologies to combat climate change. The scope for renewable energy is immense and will be crucial to checking rising temperatures and rising seas. As geographies marked by long coastlines as well as being blessed by sunshine, there is much Cyprus and India can do together. He invited Cyprus to become part of the ISA family.

 

The President said that as responsible nation-states, both Cyprus and India are alive to challenges in the international system. The continued relevance of a rules-based international order, for trade, for our sea lanes and the global maritime commons, and in other domains is an article of faith for us. The salience of national sovereignty and the essential need to defeat radicalism and terrorism unites us. In this regard, India has called for finalising the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism at the United Nations and we count on Cyprus’s support. 

 

Earlier this morning (September 3, 2018), the President commenced his engagements with a visit to the Presidential Palace in Nicosia where he was received by his counterpart, Mr Nicos Anastasiades, and accorded a ceremonial welcome.  He also paid his respects before the statue of Archbishop Makarios.  

 

During the subsequent discussions, the President congratulated President Anastasiades on his recent re-election. The President said that his able leadership has impressed many. He has been successful in turning around the Cyprus economy. India appreciates his commitment to finding a viable solution to the Cyprus issue. 

 

Subsequently, the President led delegation-level talks between the two sides. Speaking on the occasion, the President underlined the common values that mark India-Cyprus relations. India is the fastest growing major economy in the world, he said. This opens up opportunities for investments for Cyprus. Cyprus should look at not just portfolio investments but enter sectors such as infrastructure, real estate, renewable energy, pharma, wellness and healthcare.  

 

Two bilateral agreements were signed just after the delegation-level talks. The first, between the Financial Intelligence Unit, India, and Unit for Combating Money Laundering of Cyprus, aims at sharing financial intelligence and fighting money laundering, terror financing and related crimes. The second agreement commits both countries to greater cooperation on environmental issues. The President also issued a media statement on his visit to Cyprus (attached).  

 

Yesterday evening (September 2, 2018), the President addressed an impressive gathering of the Indian community in Nicosia at a reception hosted by Dr R.K. Raghavan, High Commissioner of India to Cyprus.  

 

Addressing the gathering, the President was happy to note that the Indian community in Cyprus has integrated well and contributes to the economic development of Cyprus. The President spoke about various initiatives of the Government of India to boost its outreach to the Indian diaspora. He said the Government believes the overseas Indian community is a key partner in spreading the message of India.

	I am happy to be here to inaugurate the National Conference being organised by the Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association. As a former member of the legal fraternity and of this Association, this is a home-coming for me. Advocates-on-Record have a proud tradition. As per the Rules of the Supreme Court, they are the only legal professionals entitled to act and plead on behalf of a litigant before the Supreme Court of India. They attain this distinction by virtue of professional competence and passing an examination. In that sense, the Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association is taking forward a fine legacy of assisting the cause of justice in our country. 


 


	This Conference has two themes. The first is “Technology, Training and Infrastructure: Key to Speedy Justice” and the second, “Changing Face of Legal Education in India”. Both these subjects are very important by themselves as well as for quick and efficient delivery of legal services, verdicts and justice to our fellow citizens – especially to the poorer and middle classes, and the traditionally weaker sections of society. 


 


	India’s judiciary is respected across the world as an upholder of justice for the defenceless. It is also true that our judges are overburdened by the sheer volume of cases. As a consequence, the Indian legal system is marked by long delays. As I understand, there is a backlog of 3.3 crore cases in various courts of the country. Of these, 2.84 crore cases are in the subordinate courts. Another 43 lakh are in the High Courts and about 58,000 in the Supreme Court.


 


	There are many reasons for such delays. There are infrastructure gaps and considerable vacancies, particularly in subordinate courts. There is a culture of seeking adjournments as a norm rather than an exception. New thinking is gradually taking place on frequent adjournments. I have been told that the judiciary is making sincere efforts to curb this practice. I am confident that the members of the entire legal fraternity will resolve not to seek adjournments except in absolutely unavoidable circumstances.


 


	It has been observed that various governments and government agencies themselves are party to many cases of litigation. I must commend the government of India for making a sincere effort to reduce this number. Several remedial measures have been taken in recent times. For example, the government has enhanced the threshold for filing appeals in tax disputes in various tribunals and courts. In the Supreme Court, the threshold has gone up from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore. The government has also decided to withdraw many pending appeals.


 


	The government has piloted the Enactment of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act 2015. This aims at efficient and fair disposal of complex commercial disputes, especially of high value. It eases business procedures. Further amendments have been made to this Act in 2018. They will benefit small investors involved in disputes of even three lakh rupees. 


 


	There has been a conscious rationalisation of tribunals. 36 identified tribunals have been merged to form 18 tribunals. This prevents overlapping of jurisdictions and provides greater clarity in ensuring early solutions and justice to aggrieved parties. These are only some of the measures that the government has taken. There are so many more. 


 


	Technology can be a great enabler of justice. A start was made in 2016 with the opening of India’s first e-court in the High Court of Hyderabad. Since then, the idea of e-courts has spread elsewhere. The setting up of such e-courts requires centralised electronic filing, digitalisation of documents, adoption of a document management system, creation of e-filing and e-payment gateways, as well as the use of hardware and software in the disposal of cases. I am happy that this concept is gaining ground, and I appreciate the judiciary for taking a lead here. Innovations such as evening courts and family courts, and the concerted effort made in delivery of speedy, fast-track judgements in cases of sexual crimes against women, are also noteworthy.
	On the pathway of the government’s Digital India initiative, the Legal Information Management and Briefing System (or LIMBS) has been introduced as an online mechanism to monitor and streamline court cases, and to reduce the government’s own litigation. LIMBS attempts to bring all stakeholders – from Ministries to advocates to claimants and others – on the same platform. This will check delays and financial costs. So far 2.6 lakh court cases have been placed on this platform. The digitalisation of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the online system for notary certificates too are worthy of appreciating. 


Ladies and Gentlemen


	The subject of legal education is linked closely to technology adoption and efficient justice delivery. Appropriate use of infrastructure calls for training of all those who are part of the system – be they judges, lawyers or administrators. Strides have been made in improving training for judicial officers. Judicial academies have been set up in almost all states, complemented by the National Judicial Academy in Bhopal. 


 


	The process of training advocates has a long history in our country, and has evolved in response to the times. After Independence, the first step at reforming the structure of legal education was taken with the enactment of the Advocates Act 1961. The Bar Council of India was established as the primary institution to supervise and conduct legal education in India.


 


	The second stage of reforms came in the mid-1980s. It was felt that a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach was required for rounded legal education. This resulted in the setting up of deemed universities where, over a period of five years, a wide range of subjects are taught to prospective lawyers. These are not limited to law, but also cover the social sciences and aspects of natural sciences.


 


	The establishment of the deemed universities anticipated the emerging legal landscape. Demands from our advocates and legal professionals have changed dramatically in recent decades. As the Indian economy has opened up, business and trade law and technology law have come to acquire a new salience and specialisation. The study of these has added lustre to our legal education.


 


	Now we need to raise the bar once more. The traditional law faculties in public universities provide the backbone of the legal fraternity in India. Their rejuvenation, including access to greater funding from private and innovative sources, should be a common endeavour. When it comes to private law schools of a certain stature, the Bar Council of India could consider providing greater autonomy – perhaps recognising them in the manner of “institutes of eminence”. 
	With those words, I once again wish this Conference and its participants, and wish the Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association, all the very best. It is for you to ensure that your deliberations, in some manner, help bring efficient and affordable justice closer to the weakest and most vulnerable among our fellow citizens. Let that be the test of your success. 


 

Thank you

Jai Hind!

                The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the National Conference being organised by the Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association in New Delhi today (September 1, 2018).

Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India’s judiciary is respected across the world as an upholder of justice for the defenceless. It is also true that our judges are overburdened by the sheer volume of cases. As a consequence, the Indian legal system is marked by long delays. He noted that there is a backlog of 3.3 crore cases in various courts of the country. Of these, 2.84 crore cases are in the subordinate courts. Another 43 lakh are in the High Courts and about 58,000 in the Supreme Court.

The President said that there are many reasons for such delays. There are infrastructure gaps and considerable vacancies, particularly in subordinate courts. There is a culture of seeking adjournments as a norm rather than an exception. New thinking is gradually taking place on frequent adjournments. He noted that the judiciary is making sincere efforts to curb this practice. He expressed confidence that the entire legal fraternity will resolve not to seek adjournments except in absolutely unavoidable circumstances.

The President said that demands from our advocates and legal professionals have changed dramatically in recent decades. As the Indian economy has opened up, business and trade law and technology law have come to acquire a new salience and specialisation. The study of these has added lustre to our legal education.

The President said that the traditional law faculties in public universities provide the backbone of the legal fraternity in India. Their rejuvenation, including access to greater funding from private and innovative sources, should be a common endeavour. When it comes to private law schools of a certain stature, the Bar Council of India could consider providing greater autonomy – perhaps recognising them in the manner of “institutes of eminence”.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Technology brings transparency, prosperity and opportunities for rural youth. He was addressing the gathering after launching 100 Digital Classrooms in 75 Rural Government Schools in Gwalior district under ‘Mera School Digital School’ programme, in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh today. The Union Minister for Rural Development, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, the Minister for Higher Education, Govt. of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Jaibhan Singh Pawaiya, the Minister for Urban Development and Housing, Govt. of Madhya Pradesh, Smt. Maya Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President said that India’s future is bright because it rests on the innovative abilities of our younger generation. He further said that connecting rural students with digital technology will change their lives as technology gives them access to information, opportunities at par with those living in urban areas and helps them become part in the process of Nation Building. Technology is an equalizer it has the potential to bring transparency, prosperity and opportunities for rural youth, he added.

Lauding the efforts of Government and the NGOs, the Vice President said that education is essential for enhancement of knowledge, economic progress and empowerment. He stressed on the need to provide education to all the girls, especially in rural areas.

The Vice President said that these digital classrooms will help students understand the complexities if science and Mathematics better. Audio-visual content and the support of internet will help them immensely, he added.

The Vice President said that if knowledge is power and education a deliverance from ignorance and poverty, then teachers are the agents of social change and schools are social assets and education a community resource. These digital intervention have made schools truly social assets, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“Any adventure into the realm of fresh ideas is an exhilarating experience. It fills you with hope for exciting opportunities. It is a very positive experience. And I am experiencing exactly the same sublime feeling, as I join you in inaugurating this project of 100 Digital Classes in Madhya Pradesh.

This project has proved that India’s future is bright because it rests on the innovative abilities of our younger generation. They have the drive to make a difference. They have ideas and vision for their country. We only have to provide the facilitative framework to make them realize their dreams. 

The story is really remarkable.

A group of youngsters came together to teach children in an orphanage over weekend- By itself a commendable initiative- But they didn’t stop at that. With the generous help of a socially conscious Company, they scaled up their initiative to make it a social start-up. Two concepts that are currently in vogue - Corporate Social Responsibility and Start-up programme have gained a remarkable relevance and salience. Kindling the imagination of our youth and motivating them to become entrepreneurs is the need of the hour. I appreciate the achievement of Shri Abhishek Dubey and his team of 250 volunteers who have shown an incredible passion to educate young boys of three districts-Gwalior, Bhopal and Indore. It is heartening to learn that these 100 rural schools will transform the learning experience of some 15000 students and 300 teachers.I also compliment Hindustan Zink Ltd. for their social consciousness and activism.

Sisters and brothers,

Governments have been constantly trying to improve the school infrastructure but there is much more to be done. The results of independent surveys of learning outcomes in village schoolsshow that quality of learning is a matter of great concern in many schools, especially in rural areas.

Most often, children find arithmetic difficult and develop a lifelong aversion. We need new ways of teaching. We must focus on concept formation and application of knowledge.  We must promote active learning and enable children to learn by discoursing, questioning and experimenting.

Many of our rural schools lack requisite infrastructure for science education.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to find and retain good maths and science teachers for village schools. Science and Maths are not even offered as subjects for want of subject teachers in higher classes in these schools. This imbalance in school education must be corrected to develop the scientific temper in our society.

Fortunately, we have many digital tools that can improve the quality of education in our schools. With Digital Classrooms equipped with multimedia environment, abstract scientific concepts like configuration of atoms or biological Cells, movement of electro-magnetic waves, can be easily understood. A three-dimensional multi-media digital projection can make children understand a complex mathematical equation or a scientific concept very easily.

Sisters and brothers,

If knowledge is power and education a deliverance from ignorance and poverty, then teachers are the agents of social change. Schools are social assets and education a community resource. Your digital intervention has made schools truly social assets.

Technology, more so the Digital Technology, by itself has a great democratising impact over society. It has linked insulated communities with information highways and World Wide Web networks. It has delivered the power of knowledge to people on their handheld smart phones. 

Quality education with the help of digital technology can be delivered on various mobile devices. It will make quality education widespread and inclusive. It will open new horizons and enhance access to knowledge to school students in remote villages. Technology helps us transcend the limitations of space and time. One can now learn anywhere, anytime and virtually in any language one wants.

I believe you will also be teaching English to the students. It is a welcome step. However, do take care to ensure that the child learns his or her mother tongue first. Every language has its own rich vocabulary and distinct grammar. Every language bears the creative wisdom of ages.I hope you will create a conducive learning environment in these schools where children start learning in their mother tongue and gradually learn English and other languages.

Your initiative will require regular development of content, using multimedia technology, in an imaginative way. This will not only require expert content writers but also graphic designers, animators etc. I am sure with the requisite skill sets, you will be able to set an example in using the hidden powers of technology to transform learning.

I will also suggest that, education and skill development should be part of all education programmes.

I am hopeful that soon you will be able to expand your foot prints and area of activity to cover 1000 schools located in rural and semi-urban areas. You will be able to bridge the knowledge and skill gap between rural and urban education. It will be great service to the society if you could improve the learning outcomes in these schools. 

मुझे आशा है कि आप शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में ग्रामीण शहरी अंतर को समाप्त करने में सफल होंगे। ग्रामीण क्षेत्रों के स्कूलों के Learning Outcomesमें सुधार आ सकेगा। आपका यह प्रयास child-friendly, child centered educationके क्षेत्र में नया माडल स्थापित करेगा। मैं आपको और हिन्दुस्तान जिंक लिमिटेड को आपके भावी सामाजिक सरोकारों में सफलता के लिए शुभकामनाऐं देता हूं। आपने मुझे अपने विचार और अपेक्षाऐं साझा करने के लिए आमंत्रित किया इसके लिए आभार व्यक्त करता हूं।

 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Dr. M.S. Subbulakshi with her divine and enchanting voice brought a huge transformation on the cultural canvas of this country. He was addressing the gathering after conferring Sri Shanmukhananda Bharat Ratna Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi Fellowship in Music, in Mumbai today, organized by the Sri Shanmuukhananda Fine Arts & Sangeeth Sabha. The Governor of Maharashtra, Shri Ch. Vidyasagar Rao, the Minister for Housing, Maharashtra, Shri Prakash Mehta and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President presented degrees to 50 Young and promising musicians on the occasion of 102nd birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi and he told them to draw inspiration from Dr. M.S Subbulakshmi’s life and strive hard to reach supreme levels of acclaim during their musical career.

The Vice President said that young musicians of today should not merely continue the musical legacy left behind by Dr. Subbulakshmi but also imbibe qualities of her head and heart, her compassion for the Rasikas, her philanthropy and the abiding interest she had in her fellow artistes.

The Vice President stressed on the need to preserve the fascinating diversity, culture, art and the extraordinary breadth and incredible depth of Indian music. He further said that the electronic era has brought new dimensions to music concerts. Technology has transformed the way in which music is produced and consumed, he added.

The Vice President said that art unites hearts and Music transcends the conventional boundaries of geography and history and has a unique timeless relevance like many of our ancient scriptures. He further said that it enriches the quality of our lives and it has no religion. Constant process of synthesis is required to make sure that music remains alive and is constantly enriched, he added.

Saying that the vast universe of music should reinvent itself making use of the opportunities of the day, the Vice President highlighted the need to take tangible action by the governments, private bodies, Sabhas and gurus. He further said that we are already using technology to spread this knowledge and more students in India and abroad are learning Indian classical music through online resources and tutors. These efforts need to be further expanded, he added.

Saying that Indian classical music, especially Carnatic music, has blended melody with message, rhythm with reason, sound with spirituality, the Vice President said that Dr. M.S. Subbulakshmi epitomized the best in Carnatic music and shines as one of the brightest stars in the vast firmament of Indian Classical Music. Her music opened a vibrant dialogue between the north and the south and the west and the east and she continues to live in the homes, and hearts of all music lovers, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It gives me great pleasure to be with you this evening as the Sabha celebrates the 102nd birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna Dr. M. S. Subbulakshmi and also confers the Sri. Shanmukhananda Bharat Ratna Dr. M. S. Subbulakshmi Fellowship in Music to 50 young and promising artistes.

The classical music and dances of India, like India’s philosophical and religious thoughts, have flourished over two millennia. Believed to have roots in the ancient Vedas, they evolved with time to enrich India’s religion, rituals, folklore and art forms.

India is indeed blessed with two distinct systems of classical music, Carnatic and Hindustani which have always enjoyed the status of being highly cultivated art forms. Thanks to the pioneers like the late Bharat Ratnas Dr. M.SSubbulakshmi, Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, Indian music has become popular throughout the world.

More and more scholars from both India and the west have studied and mastered these arts. Many universities and institutions like your Sabha have kept alive and added further richness to the grand tradition.

Like every facet of India, there is a fascinating diversity, extraordinary breadth and incredible depth in Indian music.

Carnatic music which traces its origin to the Gandharvaveda also displays significant aspects of ancient Tamil music. Hindustani music has drawn much from the musical traditions of Persian and Arabian cultures. Ustad Ali Akbar Khan once said “It is not the question of Indian music, or American music, like that.  Any type of music, in tune and in rhythm, gives you food for your mind, heart and soul.”

Indian music has a vast repository of songs that has been providing continuous nourishment to the mind, heart and soul. In many ways, the Indian musicians have given the world a rare menu of soul stirring musical masterpieces.

I am glad that this ancient tradition is being continued without a break. However, I am aware of the innovations being tried out within this tradition.

The electronic era has brought new dimensions to music concerts. In many ways, technological innovation has transformed the way in which music is produced and consumed. There should be a constant process of synthesis to make sure that music remains alive and is constantly enriched.

‘I do not subscribe to the superstition’, said Mahatma Gandhi, ‘that everything is good because it is ancient and I do not believe either that anything is good because it is Indian’.

The vast universe of music should reinvent itself making use of the opportunities of the day. We need more tangible action by the governments, private bodies, sabhas and gurus. We are already using technology to spread this knowledge and more students in India and abroad are learning Indian classical music through online resources and tutors. These efforts need to be further expanded.

It is here that Sabhas like yours have a noteworthy role to play. You have over the last 66 years done that with distinction. I am confident that in the years ahead, you will take large strides to further the cause of the culture of our land. I am hopeful that many young people will be inspired to join the fascinating world of Indian musical tradition.

Today is an occasion to remember a great musical legend, Dr. M. S. Subbulakshmi who epitomized the best in Carnatic music and shines as one of the brightest stars in the vast firmament of Indian Classical Music.

She received all possible honours of the nation, from SangitaKalanidhi to Bharat Ratna. Yet she retained her rare innate qualities of humility, grace, simplicity and spiritual grandeur. Her voice was divine and enchanting. She used it to bring about a huge transformation on the cultural canvas of this country.

When she sang, there was a confluence of her heart and soul. Her rendition captivated all with enduring charm that is sweet, memorable, absorbing and magical. Whether it be alapana, kriti or swara, be they songs of the eminent composers or of the lighter variety, whether the theme be one of absolute patriotism or pure devotion, she was truly a maestro.

Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru most beautifully confessed, “Who am I, a mere Prime Minister, to comment on the music of the Queen of Music?” What better tribute to her involvement to devotion and music could there ever be?

Sarojini Naidu surrendered her title ‘Nightingale of India’ after hearing her sing.

‘Her music is a gift of the Gods which she plays at the service of the nation’ said Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.

MS Subbulakshmi’s music was about balance and proportion. The clarity of her pronunciation, the precision in the placement of her sruthi, her ability to sustain notes, and the superb control she had over her breath, combined with her unique vocalization made her renditions inimitable.

Her music opened a vibrant dialogue between the north and the south and the west and the east. She travelled all over the world enthralling audiences with her music. She was invited to render a concert before the UN General Assembly, where she performed masterfully before a spellbound audience. The bhava and rasa which her music inspired, overwhelmed the Rasikas and often left them in tears. A ‘Bhajagovindam’ or a ‘Bhavayami’ elevated the listener to a higher plane of emotion or bhakti. Her ‘Suprabhatam’ woke us up to a deeply spiritual reality. She continues to live in the homes, and hearts of all music lovers.

As I went around the Auditorium, I was happy to see several new additions. You have, infact, converted the entire auditorium into a virtual museum for the Nightingale of Music. The exhibition on Subbulakshmi showcasing all facets of her personality, particularly those details of her life that are not easily available in the public domain, create an engaging narrative of her extraordinary life.

I am pleased that you have instituted the Sri. Shanmukhananda Bharat Ratna Dr. M. S. Subbulakshmi Fellowship in Music carrying an annual grant of Rs. 1,00,000/- per fellow for 3 years.

50 Young and promising musicians who are decorated with this fellowship will certainly draw inspiration from Smt. M.S Subbulakshmi’s life and would strive hard to reach supreme levels of acclaim during their musical career.

The young musicians of today should not merely continue the musical legacy left behind by Smt. Subbulakshmi but also draw inspiration from the qualities of her head and heart, her compassion for the Rasikas, her philanthropy and the abiding interest she had in her fellow artistes.

I congratulate all the fellowship awardees and I am confident that they shall, through their riyaaz or saadhana perfect the art and emerge as great musicians of our times.

Art unites hearts. Music transcends the conventional boundaries of geography and history and has a unique timeless relevance like many of our ancient scriptures. It enriches the quality of our lives.

Indian classical music, especially Carnatic music, has blended melody with message, rhythm with reason, sound with spirituality.

Organizations like your Sabha are doing their best to preserve this invaluable heritage. But, certainly, much more needs to be done.

This is a collective heritage and it requires a collective effort to preserve and enrich it further.

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asked students to not to indulge in any activity that dishonor the prestige of our mothers and sisters and remain committed to highest moral and ethical values in their life. He was addressing the 4th Convocation of the National Institute of Technology, Panaji, Goa today. The Governor of Goa, Smt. Mridula Sinha, the Chairman and Members of Board of Governors, NIT Goa and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President advised the graduating students not to take any short-cuts or quick fixes to scale new heights. He further said that perseverance, honesty, empathy, patience and self-belief will enable you to realize their dreams. Nothing is impossible to achieve but the path you choose has be a righteous one, he added.

 

The Vice President said that as engineers, it is important for students and the youth to take a closer look at the collective needs of the populace and come up with innovative, cost-effective solutions, especially in areas such as healthcare and education. He further said that wherever they go, do not forget their obligation towards the society and the nation. You cannot neglect the ethical aspect of your engineering profession and remember that if you make your contribution towards the cause of the society with a sense of responsibility and commitment, you will always be remembered, he added.

 

Saying that India poised to become a high middle-income country by 2030, and lot of opportunities will be waiting for the skilled youth in different sectors, the Vice President asked the Teachers to impart skills to the youngsters to enable them find gainful employment or become self-employed. Government’s ‘Skill India’ programme is a step in that direction, he added.

 

The Vice President said that even 71 years after attaining Independence, we are saddled with numerous challenges such as poverty, illiteracy, diseases, farmers’ distress and social evils like atrocities on women and weaker sections, child labour, terrorism, communalism and corruption have to be eradicated to build a New and Resurgent India. I expect the youth of the country to be in the forefront of this noble mission, he added.

 

Stressing the importance of education, the Vice President said that it is not just for employment and it is meant to empower, enlighten, widen the perspective of the students and develop them into global citizens.

 

He emphasized the urgent need to revamp our higher education in tune with contemporary requirements. We simply cannot continue to have lakhs of engineering students graduating without basic employable skills every year and this undesirable trend has to be stopped. Our Universities need to overhaul the syllabi and the teaching methodologies to make the courses relevant to the needs of the industries, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am delighted to address you all on the occasion of the 4th Convocation of NIT Goa and share my thoughts.

 

Dear students, a convocation is not a mere ceremonial occasion, but a milestone marking the beginning of a new chapter in your life - a new chapter full of hopes, dreams and expectations of a bright and fulfilling career ahead. My best wishes to all of you for your future endeavors!

 

Today is the culmination of the years of hard work you had put in as a student. But remember that this is not the end of your learning as there are no full-stops to acquiring knowledge and skills. In fact, learning is a life-long process and every experience teaches you something new. However, what is important is to set new goals and targets and remain committed to achieving them. 

 

As you embark on a new and exciting journey, never look for short-cuts or quick fixes to scale new heights. Perseverance, honesty, empathy, patience and self-belief will enable you to realize your dreams. Nothing is impossible to achieve but the path you choose has be a righteous one. Never yield to temptations for short term or selfish gains. Always remain committed to highest moral and ethical values.

 

You are all aware that India is the fastest growing economy and the GDP is expected to grow at 7.3 per next year. With improvement in the ease of doing business rankings, India has become an attractive destination for FDIs, while the World Bank had stated that private investments are expected to grow by 8.8 per cent in FY 2018-19. The IT sector continues to be a leading employer even as India remained the third largest hub for technology startups.

 

With India poised to become a high middle-income country by 2030, there will be lot of opportunities for the youth in different sectors. The need of the hour is to impart skills to the youngsters to enable them find gainful employment or become self-employed. The Government’s ‘Skill India’ programme is a step in that direction.

 

Dear youngsters, even 71 years after attaining Independence, we are saddled with numerous challenges that have to be combated in a concerted manner by all conscientious citizens. Poverty, illiteracy, diseases, farmers’ distress and social evils like atrocities on women and weaker sections, child labour, terrorism, communalism and corruption have to be eradicated to build a New and Resurgent India, and I expect the youth of the country to be in the forefront of this noble mission.

 

As engineers, it is important for you to take a closer look at the collective needs of the populace and come up with innovative, cost-effective solutions, especially in areas such as healthcare and education. I would also like the engineering professionals to assume greater responsibility in creating safe, secure, healthy, productive and sustainable life for the countrymen. 

 

The education system lays the foundation for the all-round progress of a nation. For India to become the third largest and $ 10 trillion economy by 2030, we have to surmount many barriers and achieve faster growth. Young engineers like you need to play a play catalytic role in accelerating the wheels of progress. In the present era of globalization, you not only have to be tech-savvy, but highly motivated, competent, innovative and push the boundaries of performance.

 

At the same time, you have to remember one important aspect-- the Indian value system is based on the principles of universalism, peace and prosperity for all, or you may say, “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” - the whole world is one family. True education inculcates the values of humility and tolerance. Value-based teaching modules aim at holistic development -  physical, psychological and moral. Knowledge of technology combined with ethics and values can ensure transparency, prevent social evils like corruption and gender discrimination. A strong and vibrant nation can be built only on the bedrock of a sustainable value system in accordance with our national ethos and human values.

 

Dear students, you are on the threshold of a new life. As you step out into the bigger world, take an oath to work for the good of the society and the country. Education is not only for employment. It is meant to empower, enlighten, widen the perspective of the students and develop them into global citizens.

 

Here, I would like to emphasize upon the urgent need to revamp our higher education in tune with contemporary requirements. We simply cannot continue to have lakhs of engineering students graduating without basic employable skills every year. This undesirable trend has to be stopped. 

 

Our Universities need to overhaul the syllabi and the teaching methodologies to make the courses relevant to the needs of the industries. I also feel that engineering students should be made to work as interns for some weeks every year to enable them gain firsthand experience.

 

Although our achievements have been quite impressive during the past seven decades in various fields including agriculture, industry, health, atomic energy, defense research and information technology, among others, we have miles to go. As mentioned earlier, we need to improve the quality of life of the millions of Indians, and the role of scientists and engineers is very important in overcoming various challenges. 

 

Climate change and global warming are two of the biggest challenges the world is facing today and all nations have to step up their efforts to protect the environment and reduce carbon footprint. I have always maintained that man should not tamper with nature but co-exist in harmony with nature for a greener, life-enhancing future. Please remember that from times immemorial, Indians believed in worshipping nature and its bounty. Therefore, always     uphold our culture and protect nature for a better future. 

 

Dear Graduates: The life beyond this institution is vast and complex. Wherever you go, please do not forget your obligation towards the society and the nation. You cannot neglect the ethical aspect of your engineering profession.  Please remember that if you make your contribution towards the cause of the society with a sense of responsibility and commitment, you will always be remembered. 

 

I, once again, congratulate all the degree recipients.  Today is your day.  The years which you have spent at NIT Goa as students in the company of your peers and facilitators, would always be cherished by all of you. Intertwined with these good memories, you are now embarking on a new journey to explore new vistas. The road ahead may be rough and tough, but continue with perseverance and passion. I am sure you will make the nation and your alma mater proud. 

 

All the best for a bright and rewarding career!

 

JAI HIND!""

He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Second Edition of the four-day Lok Manthan 2018 by the Colloquium of 'Nation First' Thinkers and Practitioners to discuss on building of Ek Bharat Shresth Bharat, in Ranchi, Jharkand today.

The Vice President said that a nation that is formed by its people, sentiments, and demographics must discuss and analyze itself from time to time. He further said that such practices are essential to keep the national life alive. Discuss Debate and Decide should be a three line mantra, he added.  

Stressing the need to study the social evils that are hampering the growth of our country, the Vice President said that serious study of the impact of the economic exploitation of the society due to the long colonial occupation of social and ethnic structures and relations must be analyzed. The colonial mindset has to go, he added.

The Vice President said that social awareness and collective responsibility of communities helped India's fight for freedom. He further said that our independence struggle was broad and all-encompassing. It incorporated the acceptance of all sections of the society and our independence struggle was not only political independence, but also a society reform movement, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address in Hindi:

 

"" द्विवार्षिक लोकमंथन की श्रृंखला में, इस दूसरे लोकमंथन के प्रज्ञा प्रवाह में आपके साथ भारतबोध-जन, गण, मन; जैसे महत्वपूर्ण विषय पर विचार मंथन करने का सुअवसर, प्रदान करने के लिये, आयोजकों के प्रति आभार प्रकट करता हूँ।

            बहनों और भाइयों,

            कोई भी राष्ट्र- उसकी जनता, जन संस्कारों और जनांकांक्षाओं से बनता है। अत: समय-समय पर जन संस्कारों और आकांक्षाओं का विमर्श और विश्लेषण राष्ट्रीय जीवन को जीवंत बनाये रखने के लिये आवश्यक है।  इस संदर्भ में यह लोकमंथन एक महत्वपूर्ण और आवश्यक कदम है।

बहनों और भाइयों,

भारत में संवाद और विमर्श की प्राचीन परंपरा रही है। हमारे प्राचीन ग्रंथों में तर्क, वाद, युक्ति, प्रमेय, प्रमाण, निर्णय जैसे शब्दों का संदर्भ, हमारी परंपरा में विमर्श की स्वस्थ परंपरा की ओर संकेत करता है। ज्ञान की प्रामाणिकता और सत्यान्वेषण के लिए संवाद एक सभ्य स्वीकार्य पद्धति है। भारतीय परंपरा में ऐसे कई संवादों का प्रसंग मिलता है जैसे कृष्ण अर्जुन संवाद से गीता का उदय हुआ, याज्ञवल्क्य-गार्गी संवाद से वृहद्वारण्यक उपनिषद का निर्माण हुआ। इसी प्रकार याज्ञवल्क्य-मैत्रयी संवाद में नैतिक और आध्यात्मिक तत्वों का गहन चिन्तन है। यह ध्यान देने योग्य है कि गूढ प्रश्नों के विमर्श में महिलाऐं भी भाग लेती थीं। कठोपनिषद के यम और बालक नचिकेता संवाद में मृत्यु जैसे गूढ सत्य पर चिंतन है। लोक मंथन के माध्यम से आप समाज में प्रबुद्ध विमर्श की संस्कृति को पुनर्स्थापित कर रहे हैं। इसके लिए मेरी शुभकामनाऐं। इस मंथन से न केवल नये विचारों का सर्जन होगा – कुछ पुरानी भ्रांतियां भी टूटेंगी।

            बहनों और भाइयों,

            यह विषय प्राय: उठा है कि आखिर भारत है क्या? 19 वीं सदी के उत्तरार्ध में 1857 के प्रथम स्वतंत्रता संग्राम के बाद जान स्ट्रैची जैसे कुछ नौकरशाहों ने भारत में अंग्रेजी शासन की सार्थकता गढ़ने का प्रयास किया। ऐसे इतिहासकारों का मत था कि भारत कभी एक देश के रूप में था ही नहीं, बल्कि अनेक रियासतों का संग्रह था जो इस भू-भाग पर राज करती थी, जिनमें प्राय: सांस्कृतिक या भाषाई एकता या संवाद भी नहीं था।

            बहनों और भाइयों,

            लंबे समय तक औपनिवेशिक गुलामी न सिर्फ हमारी राजनीतिक आदर्शों और संस्थाओं को समाप्त करती है बल्कि उनके नैसर्गिक विकास को भी विकृत कर देती है। लंबी गुलामी समाज के अपने इतिहास बोध को समाप्त कर देती है और सामुदायिक रचनात्मक मेधा को नष्ट कर देती है। अत: आवश्यक है कि समाज स्वयं अपना इतिहास बोध विकसित करे जिसमें मौखिक इतिहास, लोक परंपराओं, स्थानीय परंपराओं, भाषा-साहित्य, लोक कलाओं को प्रमाणिक ऐतिहासिक स्रोत के रूप में महत्व दिया जाय।

            बहनों और भाइयों,

            आजाद भारत आज भी भारतीयता के सच्चे स्वरुप को खोज कर रहा है। लोक मंथन जैसे आयोजन, हमारे इतिहासबोध  को पुनर्जीवित करने में और भारत बोध को हमारी सांस्कृतिक पृष्ठभूमि में देखने का एक अभिनंदनीय प्रयास हैं।

            बहनों और भाइयों,

            मुझे हाल ही में, स्वामी विवेकानंद द्वारा 1893 में विश्व धर्म संसद, शिकागों मे दिये भाषण के 125वें स्मारकोत्सव के अवसर पर वहाँ जाने का अवसर प्राप्त हुआ। यह अवसर मेरे लिए एक तीर्थयात्रा के समान था। अपने भाषण में स्वामी जी ने कहा था “जब भी भारत का सच्चा इतिहास लिखा जायेगा यह सिद्ध हो जायेगा कि धर्म के विषयों में या ललित कलाओं में भारत सदैव विश्व गुरू रहा है।” इस अवसर पर मुझे श्री अरविन्द के शब्द स्मरण हो आये जो उन्होंने स्वामी विवेकानंद के वक्तव्य पर दिये थे- “विवेकानंद का पश्चिम में जाना पहला संकेत था कि भारत अभी भी सजग, सचेत है---वह मात्र जीवित ही नहीं बल्कि विश्व विजय के लिये तत्पर भी है।”

             वास्तव में ये शब्द भविष्यवाणी ही थे। अगली एक शताब्दी, भारत ने विश्व की सबसे बड़ी उपनिवेशवादी ताकत के खिलाफ एक रचनात्मक और अहिंसक राजनैतिक आंदोलन खड़ा किया। इस आंदोलन में, भारतीय की प्राचीन संस्कृति के संस्कारों का आहृवान किया गया। सत्य, अहिंसा, सेवा, सामुदायिक सौहार्द, समानता, स्वावलंबन जैसे मानवीय मूल्यों को समाज में पुनर्स्थापित किया गया। यह एक रचनात्मक सौहार्द पूर्ण और व्यापक आंदोलन था।

गांधी जी का मानना था कि मैं सभी संस्कृतियों का प्रतिनिधित्व करता हूं, क्योंकि मेरा धर्म, हर संस्कृति के उत्कर्ष को स्वीकार करता है। उन्होंने कहा कि “मैं नहीं चाहता कि मेरा घर दीवारों से घेर दिया जाये और खिडकियां बंद कर दी जायें। मैं हर संस्कृति से परिचित होना चाहता हूं पर वे मुझे मेरे स्थान से डिगा सकें, यह मैं स्वीकार नहीं करूंगा।”

बहनों और भाइयों,

            सदियों के राजनैतिक विप्लव और आर्थिक दोहन के कारण सामाजिक विपन्नता दुर्दशा के बावजूद, सांस्कृतिक, आध्यात्मिक और वैचारिक सुधार और सौहार्द की प्रक्रिया सतत चलती रही। शंकराचार्य से विवेकानंद तक दार्शनिक समाज सुधारकों की लंबी श्रृखंला रही है जिन्होंने राजनैतिक और आर्थिक चुनौतियों में भारतीय समाज को आध्यात्मिक पुनर्जागरण और सामाजिक सौहार्द के लिए प्रेरित किया। स्वामी विवेकानंद ने कहा – “समस्त मानवता के प्रति प्रेम और सद्भाव ही सच्ची धार्मिकता है। आत्मबोध ही धर्म है … धर्म वह है जो आप हैं या हो सकते हैं न कि वह जो आप सुनते या स्वीकारते हैं।”

            सामाजिक नवजागरण के ये अंकुर हर क्षेत्र में फूटे - चाहे असम के शंकरदेव या उड़ीसा के चैतन्य महाप्रभु, कर्नाटक के बसवाचार्य, काशी के कबीर या रैदास या सौराष्ट्र के नरसी मेहता या पंजाब के नानकदेव या आर्य समाजी संत, महाराष्ट्र के ज्योतिबा फूले, पंडिता रमाबाई या स्वयं डॉ. अंबेडकर, सभी ने भारतीय समाज में नवचेतना का संचार किया।

बहनों और भाइयों,

यह आवश्यक है कि दीर्घकालीन राजनैतिक आधिपत्य के कारण आयी सामाजिक कुरीतियों का अध्ययन किया जाये और उनका प्रतिकार किया जाय। लंबे औपनिवेशिक आधिपत्य के कारण हुए समाज के आर्थिक दोहन का सामाजिक और जातीय संरचना और संबंधों पर क्या प्रभाव पड़ा, इसका गंभीर अध्ययन होना चाहिए।

सतत सामाजिक चेतना और सुधार के कारण ही हमारा स्वाधीनता संग्राम इतना व्यापक और सर्वस्पर्शी बन सका जिसमें समाज के सभी वर्गों, क्षेत्रों की स्वीकृति थी।

हमारा स्वाधीनता संग्राम, राजनैतिक स्वतंत्रता ही नहीं अपितु समाज सुधार का आंदोलन भी था।

 इसमें अस्पृश्यता का विरोध, जातिवाद की कुरीतियों का विरोध, सामुदायिक स्वच्छता, आर्थिक स्वावलंबन, जमींदारी का विरोध, शिक्षा सुधार, महिला सशक्तिकरण, अहिंसा आदि प्रगतिशील मुद्‌दों पर  जन समर्थन और जन जागरण का आहृवाहन था। जिसने दीनदयाल उपाध्याय जी के एकात्म मानवता को भी प्रेरित किया।

जनमानस स्वाधीन भारत के प्रति आशान्वित था।

हमारे संविधान ने इस आशा को मुखरित स्वर दिया और इसे राष्ट्रीय संकल्प के रूप में संकल्पबद्ध किया।

13 दिसंबर 1946 को पं. नेहरू द्वारा संविधान सभा में लाये गये उद्देश्य प्रस्ताव में कहा गया कि “यह संविधान सभा ऐसा संविधान बनायेगी जिसमें भारत के सभी नागरिकों के लिये सामाजिक, आर्थिक और राजनैतिक न्याय सुरक्षित और सुनिश्चित किया जायेगा, अवसरों और स्तर की समानता होगी, विचारों, अभिव्यक्ति, आस्था एवं विश्वास, व्यवसाय की स्वतंत्रता होगी। जिसमें, अल्पसंख्यकों, पिछड़े तथा जनजातीय क्षेत्रों, पिछड़े और वंचित वर्गों के लिये विशेष प्रावधान होंगे।”

हमारा संविधान मूलत: सामाजिक सौहार्द और विकास का दस्तावेज है जो राजनीति को सामाजिक अपेक्षाओं की पूर्ति साधन बनाता है।

समाज का सर्वस्पर्शी विकास और एकता हमारी संवैधानिक प्रतिबद्धता है।

18 दिसंबर 1946 को संविधान के Aims and Objectives Resolution पर हुई चर्चा में भाग लेते हुए डॉ. अंबेडकर ने इसी सर्वस्पर्शी विकास और सामाजिक एकता की आवश्यकता पर बल दिया।

उन्होंने कहा “मैं जानता हूं आज हम राजनैतिक, सामाजिक और आर्थिक रूप से बंटे हुए हैं। और एक दूसरे के कटु विरोधी हैं संभवत: मैं स्वयं उनमें से एक दल का नेतृत्व कर रहा हूं। लेकिन यदि समय और परिस्थितियां साथ दें तो संसार की कोई शक्ति इस देश को एक होने से नहीं रोक सकती।”

उन्होंने आगे कहा कि “मैं हमारे भावी भविष्य के प्रति आशान्वित हूं लेकिन हमारी समस्या वर्तमान की विविधताऐं और सामाजिक विषमताएं हैं। हमें अंत की नहीं बल्कि प्रारंभ की चिंता है।”

इसी प्रकार नये भारत के निर्माता, सरदार पटेल को भी भारत की एकता और विकास को लेकर चिंता थी।

देशी रियासतों को भारतीय संघ में सम्मिलित करने के बावजूद वे इस प्रयोग की सफलता के प्रति सशंकित थे-“हमने रातोंरात इन रियासतों में आधुनिक शासन प्रणाली लागू कर तो दी है लेकिन यह प्रणाली ऊपर से थोपी गई है, न कि इसके लिए जनता ने मांग की थी। जब तक यह थोपी गई शासन प्रणाली जनमानस में जड़ न जमा ले, तब तक विप्लव और अशांति का खतरा बना हुआ है।”

बहनों और भाइयों,

हमारे संविधान निर्माताओं की देश के प्रति निष्ठा और उसके भविष्य के प्रति आस्था, अभिनंदनीय है, स्तुत्य है। वे देश की समस्याओं से अवगत थे। क्या नया राज्य, प्राचीन राष्ट्र की सदियों संचित अपेक्षाओं को पूर्ण कर सकेगा?

हमारे सर्वस्पर्शी संविधान ने हमें दिशा दी है। एक देश के रूप में हमारे प्रयासों को संकल्पबद्ध किया है। कालान्तर में नयी चुनौतियां भी आयी हैं। हम अपनी संवैधानिक चेतना से इन चुनौतियों को अवसरों में बदल सकेंगे।

मुझे आशा है कि लोक मंथन का यह संस्करण, हमारे संविधान निर्माताओं के प्रश्नों और शंकाओं पर गंभीर विमर्श करेगा और स्वीकार्य समाधानों और निष्कर्षों तक पहुंच सकेगा। सार्थक संवाद और विमर्श की यह स्वस्थ परंपरा आप समाज के हर स्तर तक ले जाने में सफल होंगे, यह मेरी शुभकामना है। इस लोक मंथन से आलोकामृत निकले और पूरे विश्व को भारत भारती की विचारधारा से आनन्दमय बनाए। यह मेरी शुभेच्छा है।

जय हिन्द।""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said that the Medicine is a noble profession. He was addressing the 1st Convocation of Homeopathy University, in Jaipur, Rajasthan today. The Minister for Health, Rajasthan, Shri Kali Charan Saraf, the Member of Parliament from Rajasthan and President of Sponsoring Society of Homeopathy University, Dr. Manoj Rajoria and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that unaffordable healthcare is a serious social handicap and Ayushman Bharat scheme would be a real boon for the poor and needy sections of the society. Saying that Homeopathy fits the bill as an alternative system of medicine, he said that there is immense scope for preventive and curative Homoeopathy treatment in interior remote locations where no modern, diagnostic medical facilities are available.

 

The Vice President said that the need of the hour is to put in place standardized practices and processes for all systems of medicine and stressed the need to standardize and maintain the quality of homoeopathy education and research in the country. It should be our collective obligation to not let this humanitarian discipline to be besmirched by the unethical lust for profit, he added.

 

The Vice President said that it is therefore essential that homoeopathy institutions and research councils take initiatives and create a critical mass of skilled manpower to take up such assignments.  There is a need to strengthen quality control the drug manufacturers should be made to adhere to Good Manufacturing Practices, he added.

 

The Vice President said that the safety assessment is of paramount importance to remove any impurities of source material or contamination. All public leaders should involve themselves in some service and School, College and University Education should be in mother tongue, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am pleased to be among the bright students of this prestigious institution, the Jaipur Homeopathy University, to share their joy and hope, at this crucial juncture of their professional career.

 

Friends, it has been my endeavor to reach out to the makers of the destiny of new India, our students. You will fashion destiny of new India. You represent the idealism, hope and aspirations of the country. This is the age of information explosion and you are aware of global trends in healthcare and medicine. You know the challenges and opportunities the new professional life will offer.  I would like you to make the right choices in accordance with the professional knowledge you had gained and the values taught by your family and teachers.

 

Today is a special occasion. As you step out of the portals of this university, remember that you a have special responsibility towards the society as members of a noble profession. I expect you to uphold the highest ethical and moral values and bring glory to this prestigious institution.

 

I am happy to note that the University established in 2009-10, has emerged as center of excellence in Homoeopathy education and research. Apart from Bachelor’s degree in Homoeopathy, you have MD and Ph.D programmes in Homoeopathy, MSc Biotechnology, Bio-Chemistry, Pharmacy and Nursing courses, apart from Certificate course in Homoeopathy for Allopathy doctors.

 

Dear young friends, as I had stated earlier, you are in this noble profession in challenging times. We have less than 1 doctor per 1000 population, which is lower than WHO prescribed ratio of 1:1000.  The situation is worse in rural areas. In such a scenario, the alternative system of medicine, AYUSH can bridge this gap, particularly in semi-urban and rural areas.

 

Today’s occasion is all the more special because this is my first interaction with young healthcare professionals after the launch of the ambitious Ayushman Bharat scheme on the Birth Anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Updhyay ji. It is truly a befitting tribute to Upadhyay Ji, who had propounded the sublime philosophy of Integral Humanism.

 

The scheme seeking to provide insurance coverage of Rs 5 lakh per family will cover 10 crore marginalized and vulnerable families for secondary and tertiary healthcare. 

 

Sisters and Brothers,

 

As you all are aware, technology-driven modern healthcare is becoming increasingly expensive.

As per the World Development Indicators, out of total expenditure on health in India, only 30 per cent is contributed by the public sector. Remaining 70 per cent of the expenditure is borne through private expenditure.  Of the Household expenditure on health, it is estimated that 95 per cent is out-of-pocket expenditure borne directly by the individuals at points of health services, while the remaining 5 per cent goes towards insurance.

 

As regards out-of-pocket expenditure, 52 per cent expenditure is towards medicines, 22 per cent towards hospitalization at a private hospital and 10 per cent goes for diagnostic labs. It is a matter of concern that in many instances families were pushed into debt trap by high costs of medical treatment. 

 

Unaffordable healthcare is a serious social handicap and Ayushman Bharat scheme would be a real boon for the poor and needy sections of the society.

 

People are looking for affordable healthcare and Homeopathy definitely fits the bill on this count as an alternative system of medicine. There is immense scope for preventive and curative Homoeopathy treatment in interior remote locations where no modern, diagnostic medical facilities are available.

 

Keeping this in view, the Government has introduced Homoeopathy treatment in its primary and secondary health centers. Homoeopathy treatment is available in 30 per cent clinics of the Central Government AYUSH dispensaries.

 

Today, there are 2.8 lakh homoeopathy doctors in the country. Apart from seeking homoeopathy treatment for common illnesses and diseases, it is being adopted for preventive and curative care. Homoeopathy has also been integrated into screening and prevention of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, strokes and other lifestyle related ailments.

 

The need of the hour is to put in place standardized practices and processes for all systems of medicine and I glad that the National Health Policy proposes to mainstream Homoeopathy and other Indian systems of medicine by standardizing the processes and practices.

 

In order to standardize and maintain the quality of homoeopathy education and research, the Parliament has recently passed the Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill to regulate education institutions and weed out unscrupulous elements that seek to exploit the growing opportunity in this sector.

 

The Bill makes Central Government’s approval necessary for establishing a new institution or even to start a new course.  It should be our collective obligation to not let this humanitarian discipline to be besmirched by the unethical lust for profit. 

 

An area of concern that needs to be addressed by all, including prestigious institutions like yours, is the quality control of homeopathy medicines. The quality control needs to be strengthened and the drug manufacturers should be made to adhere to Good Manufacturing Practices.

 

It should be remembered that safety of homeopathy medicines largely depends on their quality. Although, homeopathy medicines are often diluted when administered, their safety assessment is of paramount importance to remove any impurities of source material or contamination. 

 

I am told that a Central Scheme of Pharmacovigilance for AYUSH medicines is being framed by the Government to monitor the quality control at every level. It is necessary to have at least one testing and drug manufacturing facility in every State under this scheme.

In the absence of quality control and standardization of medicine, this upcoming sector of affordable healthcare may lose public faith. It is therefore essential that homoeopathy institutions and research councils take initiatives and create a critical mass of skilled manpower to take up such assignments. 

 

Homoeopathy as a healthcare system has been recognized in 80 countries today. It is therefore your social and academic obligation to take your discipline forward with new discoveries and innovative research. I am happy to learn that homeopathy practitioners have actively used digital methods to store their data, analyze them and share their research with larger community of Homoeopaths. 

 

I am happy to note that the Homoeopathy University conducts Ph.D programme and also publishes the Journal to share the research work with larger medical community.

 

Young Doctors and Distinguished Members of the faculty,

 

At the end of my Convocation Address, let me quote a message from Taittariya Upanishad, which the teacher gives to the students at the end of course: “Be truthful. Do your duties. Continue to study and learn. Do not swerve from the path of Truth and Dharma, and contribute something useful to the society. Aim for excellence. Keep improving your knowledge. Use whatever you have learnt and share your knowledge with others. Respect the gods and your ancestors. Look upon your parents, teachers and guests as gods. Always analyse and distinguish the good from the bad. Avoid the latter and always do what is good. Follow all that was good in your teacher’s life, not any other. You will meet with better men than even the teachers with whom you have lived. Show them due respect.” I find this message to be quite appropriate for today’s occasion.

 

I wish all success to the distinguished Faculty of this esteemed institution and the students in their professional careers and personal endeavors. 

 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the creation of pedestrian non-motorized zones is the need of the hour curb traffic congestions. He was addressing the inaugural session of the Smart City Expo India 2018, in Jaipur, Rajasthan today. The Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs (I/C), Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, the Minister for Urban Development, Rajasthan, Shri Shrichand Kriplani, the Minister for Minority Affairs, Rajasthan, Shri Arun Chaturvedi, the Governor of South Australia, Mr. Hieu Van Le AC and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

 

The Vice President asked city planners to accord highest priority to the livelihood, security, health, education and skilling of the poor, migrants, and women and said that vulnerabilities of the marginalized sections of the society must be kept in mind. Social development should be at the core of every project undertaken by Smart Cities, he added.

 

The Vice President that you should address the concerns of air, water, soil and sound pollution in cities, apart from the need to promote energy efficiency, recycling urban waste, sustainable soil and land use. He also stressed on the need to develop neighboring villages as Smart villages by ensuring quality education, health, income opportunities in non-agriculture and allied industries to counter or limit the uneven influx of population into cities.

 

The Vice President said that India cannot afford lopsided development by allowing the villages to lag behind. He further said that top priority has to be given to provide road, electric and digital connectivity to villages. Digital technology can link villages with wider market for their produce and roads can ensure logistical linkage, he added.

 

Vice President said that traffic congestions and vehicular pollution have become the order of day in our cities and highlighted the need to look critically at the issue of city mobility and urban planning. He further said that our cities have become energy guzzlers with people preferring fuel-inefficient private vehicles over mass public transport. We cannot allow this trend to continue and concerted action is needed to promote public transport in a big way, he added.

 

The Vice President said that Governance at door step is the key objective of smart cities and he asked authorities to work towards digitization of city governance, services, certifications and approvals without unnecessary personal interface.

 

The Vice President said that no line but online should be the mantra to cut down red tape and provide citizen-centric services. This singular step will save the time and effort of citizens and enhance the overall efficiency of the city, he said.

 

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

 

“I am pleased to join you at this important conference that brings global smart city experts, technological solution providers, town planners and administrators to discuss various aspects of techno-administrative interventions to make our cities smart.

 

Ever since we embarked upon the economic reform process, India has witnessed rapid urbanization. Today 30 per cent of the population lives in towns and cities. Initially, the urban centres developed around the seat of administrative authority and power to cater to the needs of administration.

 

However, during the last three decades, with the expansion of economic opportunities, the cities and towns have become hubs of booming business and construction activities drawing waves of migrant populations from the hinterland. This constant influx of migrant population has put pressure on the existing civic infrastructure and urban facilities. Irregular settlements have come up at unauthorized localities without basic amenities. This boom in urbanization not only poses a challenge but also provides us an opportunity to make our cities smart with techno-administrative interventions and turn them into livable, inclusive investment destinations where a continuous cycle of investment, employment and prosperity could flourish.

 

With this objective, the Government of India had launched the Smart City Mission in June 2015 when I was the Urban Development Minister.

 

The Mission has three components - Retrofitting, Renewal and Redevlopment. I am sure all of you are aware of the details and I do not wish to dwell upon them. The Government also launched complementary schemes like AMRUT, HRIDAY, Clean India and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Housing for All)  with a target to provide a house to every family by 2022.

 

I am aware that lot of progress has been made in each of the programmes, but a lot more needs to be done rather expeditiously. With all these schemes converging under the umbrella Smart City Programme, I am told that a comprehensive Livability Index for our cities is in the process of being prepared.

 

These indices have four components - economic development, environmental development, social development and physical development. Each component is measured against 15 parameters. I do believe that the cities covered under Smart city programme will rank impressively on the Livability Index and become lighthouses for other cities. 

 

Following selection of 100 Cities from different States on the basis of competitive bidding, every city is being provided Rs 100 crores every year by the Government of India for five years, while the States are coming up with matching contribution.

 

I do understand that renewal and redevelopment of a thriving city with floating population is a Herculean task and requires perseverance, political will, administrative skill, technical expertise and massive investment. Removing bottlenecks need persistent effort. It is an ambitious, capital-intensive and technology-driven programme. The selected 100 cities will require an investment of more than Rs 2 lakh crores.

 

I am happy to note that after obvious initial planning, the programme is in its acceleration phase.  Projects amounting to Rs. 6,500 crores have been completed. Other projects with an aggregate value of Rs 16,000 crores have been initiated and are in various stages of implementation.

 

Friends,

 

The trend of making our cities smart, economically viable and environmentally sustainable with technological interventions is catching fast world over. This Conference will give you the opportunity to share your experiences, find solutions and help build synergies to remove bottlenecks.

 

Your choice of the venue is very appropriate. The Pink city, as Jaipur is known for the color of its buildings, has been a Smart city of its time. It was established by a visionary ruler with inquisitive scientific temper, Maharaj Man Singh in 18th century, based on the principles of ancient Vastu Shastra, the science of architecture and town planning. Its buildings, road networks and water storage and sanitation still remain a subject of study.

 

As we gather here to discuss the smart solutions to our city life, I take this opportunity to compliment the Government and people of the State for their revolutionary work in water storage, preservation of water bodies and rainwater harvesting in this largely arid and semi-arid State. With their efforts, I am told that the ground water table has risen by 5-8 feet in last 4-5 years.

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

I am happy to learn that the agenda for conference is comprehensive and you will focus on Innovation, Technology and digital governance to bring transformational change in our city life and make cities truly autonomous.

 

We should work towards digitization of city governance. Information relating to various services, certifications and approvals should be available digitally without unnecessary personal interface. No line but online should be the mantra to cut down red tape and provide citizen-centric services. This singular step will save the time and effort of citizens and enhance the overall efficiency of the city.

 

Urban planners should increasingly promote Smart IT-based communication and information services to resolve issues like maintenance of records and enable easy retrieval, real-time monitoring and analysis of data. Encouraging e-governance programmes will provide employment to educated professionals and also facilitate public–private partnership in the affairs of their city. 

 

I would like the experts gathered here to look critically at the issue of city mobility and urban planning.  Traffic congestions and vehicular pollution have become the order of day in our cities and need urgent solutions. Our cities have become energy guzzlers with people preferring fuel-inefficient private vehicles over mass public transport. We cannot allow this trend to continue and concerted action is needed to promote public transport in a big way.

 

I am glad to know that under Smart city scheme, pedestrian non-motorised mobility is being promoted in Jaipur. Also a target has been set to achieve 45 per cent mobility through mass public transport by 2025. I believe that Jaipur will be benefitted by the global experiences in this regard.

 

As the demand for energy increases with rising urbanization, we need to explore eco-friendly and renewable sources of energy. Our cities generate enormous amount of waste. Piles of garbage, littered plastic bags are common site and choke the water bodies. Clean Technology and Circular economy are the other important issues you will be discussing. You should address the concerns of air, water, soil and sound pollution in cities, apart from the need to promote energy efficiency, recycling urban waste, sustainable soil and land use.

 

I would advise you to also study the programmes of Union and State governments in this regard and suggest their convergence. I am told that door-to-door collection of waste and garbage is being promoted in this city with a target of 100 per cent coverage. 

 

Sanitation is being given adequate priority with a target of providing 100 per cent access to clean and water-efficient toilets. Rag pickers are important stakeholders in the management of urban waste. They are being registered. The bio-degradable waste is being used in energy processing plants. I am told that to promote efficient use of water, it is proposed to ensure 100 per cent coverage of smart water meters. I am glad to know that the green cover in the city will be expanded and the façade of the heritage buildings of the Jaipur will be improved under the Smart City programme.

 

Every city has its distinct ethos which is weaved around its history, cultural and literary traditions, customs, beliefs of its citizens, their crafts and skills.

 

As we seek to make our cities smart with technology interventions, it will also impinge upon the social development of the city. Migration is inevitable and new groups will settle in the city.  They will also claim ownership to city’s resources. Since a city is essentially made up of its citizens, social development should be at the core of every project undertaken by Smart Cities. While catering to the needs of the aspirational generation, the smart city planners should consciously address vulnerabilities among marginalized classes. We must focus on the vulnerabilities that marginalize the poor, migrants, and women accord highest priority to their livelihood, security, health, education and skilling.  

 

In Smart cities, technology should not only act as leveler, but must be used extensively to monitor and track societal crimes against women and other vulnerable sections.

 

Associated with the issue of social development is the question of developing neighboring villages as Smart villages by ensuring quality education, health, income opportunities in non-agriculture and allied industries. This can contain the regular migration to cities. India cannot afford lopsided development by allowing the villages to lag behind. Top priority has to be given to provide road, electric and digital connectivity to villages. Digital technology can link villages with wider market for their produce and roads can ensure logistical linkage.

 

Heritage city like Jaipur can be immensely benefitted by technological intervention. The old heritage buildings and tourist places have to be developed in a way without changing the character of the building. Smart signage, simultaneous multi-lingual interpretation services, tourist friendly affordable mobility and accommodation, virtual presentation of places of tourist attraction and tourist help services are only a few measures that could turn the whole experience of Jaipur into a memorable one. During my recent visit to historical cities of Eastern Europe, I found the concept of Heritage Walks to be very popular. To facilitate such walks in Jaipur, the city will have to be tourist friendly with smart facilities.

 

I expect that your discussions will give some practicable solutions. I wish this Conference every success and thank the organizers for inviting me to share my views.

 

Jai Hind!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Indian culture promotes talent and service. He was addressing the gathering at a Programme on Initiatives for Women Empowerment & Farmers Development organized by Rashtriya Seva Samiti, in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh today. The Minister for Industries, Andhra Pradesh, Shri N. Amarnath Reddy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President complimented the Rashtriya Seva Samiti for organizing programmes by making women and farmers in the welfare programs and development schemes of the government, working hard to promote harmony and national integration. There is a need to change the society's perspective to get women empowerment, he added.

The Vice President said that agriculture is our basic culture and we all have to support it and make it more viable to the farmers. Other activities like poultry and dairy will provide additional income to the farmers, and farmers should consider adopting these activities, he added.

The Vice President complimented the civic authorities for maintaining Tirupati city clean and green. The programmes like Swachh Bharat will be successful with the participation of pubic, he added.

The Vice President said that every man should have service motto in their minds. Share and care is the core of our Indian philosophy, he added.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Indian food heritage is a mixture of art and science and is exceptionally vast and diverse. He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the Indian Culinary Institute, Tirupati and two projects in Nellore and East Godavari Districts of Andhra Pradesh, implemented under the Coastal Circuit theme of Swadesh Darshan Scheme of Ministry of Tourism, Government of India, in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh today. The Minister of State for Tourism (I/C), Shri Alphons Kannanthanam, the Minister for Tourism, Andhra Pradesh, Smt. Bhuma Akhila Priya Reddy, the Minister for Industries, Andhra Pradesh, Shri N. Amarnath Reddy and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that the rich cultural diversity, native ethnicity, unique flavor of each region and different customs are best encapsulated by the Indian cuisine, which became enriched over thousands of years due to the intermingling of people belonging to different religions, languages and eating habits. ‘Annam Parabrahma Swaroopam’, loosely translated as ‘Food is like God’ is a part of our collective conscience and our ethos, he added.

The Vice President said that a painter appeals to visual sense, while a musician plays to auditory senses; an actor performs to engage both, the eyes and ears of the audience. However, a culinary artist has a much more complex role to play, he said. He is said to be successful with his creation if he is able to satisfy all five senses of the recipient; the eyes, ears, touch, smell and taste, he added.

The Vice President said that Indian cuisine reflects the culture and tradition of the country which includes varied landscapes, linguistic diversity, colorful festivals, and multi-ethnicity. He further said that he looks at Chefs as not only the practitioners of their art but also as the protectors and flag bearers of our great culinary heritage and legacy. 

The Vice President said that India’s rich cultural, historical, religious and natural heritage provides a huge potential for development of tourism and job creation. He further said that the tourism industry is one of the greatest sources of economic growth and job creation. Tourism sector has become a mass industry in the last two decades and is considered to be a significant sector for regional development, he added.

The Vice President said that he was happy to inaugurate Projects worth 60.37 cr for the development of tourism destinations in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh viz. Nellore Tank, Ramatheertham Beach, Mypadu Beach, Moths Koduri Beach, Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary, Iskapally Beach, B.V. Palem Beach (Pulicat Lake). He further said that he was equally delighted to inaugurate Projects worth 69.82 cr for the development of tourism destinations in East Godavari district viz., Kakinada Beach, Hope-Island, Coringa Wild-Life Sanctuary, Vodalarevu/Pasarlapudi, Aduru, S. Yanam and Kotipalli. These were the schemes which were initiated and followed up by him during the period he was a Central Minister, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It is a matter of great pleasure for me to inaugurate the Indian Culinary Institute and two projects implemented under the Coastal Circuit theme of Swadesh Darshan Scheme of Ministry of Tourism.

The first project constitutes development of Kakinada - Hope Island - Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary - Passarlapudi - Aduru - S Yanam – Kotipally circuit, while the second project comprises the development of Nellore- Pulikat Lake - Ubblamadugu Water Falls - Nelapattu -Kothakoduru- Mypadu - Ramateertham – Iskapalli circuit.

Dear sisters and brothers,

If variety is the spice of life, Indian cuisine best fits the bill.

The rich cultural diversity, native ethnicity, unique flavor of each region and different customs are best encapsulated by the Indian cuisine, which became enriched over thousands of years due to the intermingling of people belonging to different religions, languages and eating habits.

From Kanyakumari in the South to Kashmir in the North, every cuisine across the length and breadth of India leaves a unique taste in the mouth, irrespective of whether one is a connoisseur of food or a commoner. With every state or region having its own mouth-watering delicacy, the kaleidoscope of the Indian cuisine is quite vast.

I am happy to see and interact with young faces -- the budding, aspiring chefs of the future. In my opinion, creating culinary delicacies is the highest form of art. A painter appeals to your visual sense, while a musician plays to your auditory senses. An actor performs to engage both, the eyes and ears of his audience. However, a culinary artist has a much more complex role to play. He is said to be successful with his creation if he is able to satisfy all five senses of the recipient; the eyes, ears, touch, smell and taste. My best wishes to every student present here for a successful career and bright future. 

In our tradition, food is not just a means for satiating hunger but is an important part of our culture. Indians cook not only for sensory delights. Food has been an integral part of our socio-cultural life and rituals. Indian cuisine reflects the culture and tradition of the country which includes varied landscapes, linguistic diversity, colorful festivals, and multi-ethnicity. 

It should be noted that the different climatic conditions and terrain diversity has provided great choice and the availability of ingredients and spices. Indian food heritage is a mixture of art and science and is exceptionally vast and diverse. ‘Annam Parabrahma Swaroopam’, loosely translated as ‘Food is like God’ is a part of our collective conscience and our ethos. 

Indian cuisine has evolved over a period of time, both, through a process of internal churning and also because of various foreign influences. Today, its aroma and flavors have transcended geographical boundaries and it is the preferred choice of commoners and connoisseurs across the globe. I look at Chefs as not only the practitioners of their art but also as the protectors and flag bearers of our great culinary heritage and legacy.

Many of our recipes and part of our food heritage are getting lost because of a lack of documentation, recording and research in this field. Setting up of two dedicated Culinary Institutes by Ministry of Tourism, GoI at Noida and Tirupati is a commendable step in the direction of not only preserving but also promoting our culinary heritage. I am confident that ICI will not only create internationally recognized culinary experts, but also preserve the varieties of Indian cuisine, document them and showcase them internationally. I hope to see these institutes as centers of excellence in the near future. 

Today, when the world is grappling with lifestyle diseases and the menace of junk food, our ancient practices of healthy eating, balance of ingredients to get right nutritional balance and the medicinal use of food in curing various ailments need to be researched and presented for the benefit of mankind. We look at these institutes to play pivotal role in this direction. In fact, most of our traditional cuisine caters to our needs based on various seasons.

The flavorful aroma and delicate blend of spices in our cuisine, which is as varied as our country itself, is not only just our cherished heritage but also a very significant tourism product. Today, Culinary Tourism is the buzz word across the globe. Tourists are travelling not only for sightseeing or for pilgrimage but also to taste the local cuisine. Our country has great potential in this regard. We have on offer the cuisines of emperors and of peasants, cuisines of temples and of tribals, cuisines of mountains and of desert or of the coastal belts, besides many others. This is a powerful tourism product which we need to leverage to bring in more and more tourists to visit our country.

I am told that ICI has state-of-art infrastructure which is comparable to the best in the world. This coupled with the expertise of capable chef instructors and support staff will create conducive environment for learning and acquiring the right skills.

I once again convey my best wishes to all of you and look forward to see these institutes position themselves as the world-class premier academic centers in this segment.

Tourism industry is one of the greatest sources of economic growth and job creation. Tourism sector has become a mass industry in the last two decades and is considered to be a significant sector for regional development.

India’s rich cultural, historical, religious and natural heritage provides a huge potential for development of tourism and job creation.  The vision of the Government is to position Tourism as an engine for growth and development in an equitable manner (Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikas) through employment generation, leading to poverty reduction and promoting Brand India worldwide.

The tourism sector in the country has been on a growth trajectory. India’s ranking in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index (TTCI) of World Economic Forum moved from 65th position to 52nd position in 2015. Now India has moved up by another 12 positions and ranked at 40th position.  In all, in last three years, India has cumulatively improved its ranking by 25 places which is a significant achievement.

Undoubtedly, tourism and hospitality sector is an important driver of growth. With the Indian economy emerging as the fastest growing in the world, there is a huge potential for this sector to generate employment. With more and more youngsters joining this sector, there is a need for establishing more such institutes in the country.

The travel and tourism sector is estimated to have provided employment to 41.6 million people in 2017, accounting for eight per cent of the total employment opportunities generated in the country in the same year. The total jobs in the sector are expected to rise to 52.3 million by 2028.

I think there is also a need for India to start its own rating system for restaurants and chefs on the lines of globally-known Michelin star grading.

The Government is focused on development of quality infrastructure in the country with the objective of providing better experience and facilities to the visitors on one hand and fostering economic growth on the other hand.

I am happy to know that the two projects sanctioned in Andhra Pradesh under coastal Circuit are now complete.  The projects will go a long way in development of region by triggering more investment and at the same time bringing more visitors to Andhra Pradesh, and in turn, more employment opportunity to the locals.

He further said that ISRO maintains one of the largest fleet of communication and remote sensing satellites with the versatile workhorse, Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) becoming a favoured carrier. After making every Indian proud with the success of Chandrayaan-1 and Mars Orbiter Spacecraft, now ISRO is gearing up for the launch of Chandrayaan-2 early next year, he added.

The Vice President said that rural development is vital for the country’s growth and several national flagship programmes are being implemented in the country for the same. For effective implementation of those schemes, there is a need for optimal utilisation of satellite data for mapping and monitoring the resources and also take up impact assessment studies, he added.

Saying that India is committed to accord high priority to water conservation and its management through Watershed Development Component of Kisan Sinchaayi Yojana, the Vice President said that satellite data is being used to verify the execution of works under watershed development programme and also to assess the impact in terms of additional crop area.

While lauding ISRO for its innumerable achievements, the Vice President asked the prestigious organisation to take up futuristic, innovative projects for societal benefits.

The Vice President said that in view of the increasing demand for citizen centric services NRSC has to play an important role in providing Satellite Data and expand its technical interactions with various states for capacity building. Based on its expertise and capability, he was confident that NRSC will intensify its efforts to come up with innovative citizen-centric applications for national flagship programmes, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""I am happy to be here today amongst the ISRO scientific community and understand firsthand the excellent work being carried out in this important centre.

I am also glad to see lot of youngsters here and appreciate them for choosing to work at ISRO. I am sure that many of you will get opportunities to work on challenging scientific projects and prove your calibre.

Since the launch of the first satellite, Aryabhata in 1975, Indian space programme has made rapid strides with India becoming a hub for the launch of Indian and foreign satellites. 

With the successful launch of two satellites belonging to UK earlier this month, ISRO has so far launched 239 foreign satellites of 28 countries and proved to be a reliable and affordable global space agency. I am sure that in the coming years, ISRO would be a leading player in the commercial satellite launch market in the world.

Let me first congratulate all scientists for the success of the missions such as the launching of 104 satellites at a time, development of testing Crew Escape System which is a critical technology for human spaceflight GAGANYAAN and the launch of GSLV Mk-III with fully indigenous cryogenic technology. 

ISRO with its state-of-the-art facilities has been harnessing space technology for rural and urban development. I am aware that ISRO maintains one of the largest fleet of communication and remote sensing satellites with the versatile workhorse, Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) becoming a favoured carrier. 

Remote sensing satellites have enabled India to map, monitor and manage its natural resources. Data generated from them is being used for a variety of applications covering agriculture, water resources, urban planning, environment, forestry, ocean resources, hydrology, disaster management, biodiversity, drought monitoring, flood risk zone mapping and mineral prospecting. 

After making every Indian proud with the success of Chandrayaan-1 and Mars Orbiter Spacecraft, I am glad to know that ISRO is gearing up for the launch of Chandrayaan-2 early next year. 

I had visited this Centre in 2002 when I was Union Minister for Rural Development. I am happy to be here again after 16 years and share my thoughts with all of you. There have been several satellite missions every year since then. 

Scientists play a key role in providing data and should focus on the requirements of the common man, more importantly of the farmer, and help in formulating strategies for better Governance.

When you look at the flagship programmes which are being implemented by various ministries, it is clear the data acquired from Earth Observation Satellites play a major role in generation of information. Frequent observations recorded by satellites are useful to know the past and current status as also the future scenario. 

Dear sisters and brothers, 

Rural development is vital for the country’s growth. Hence, several national flagship programmes are being implemented in the country. For effective implementation of those schemes, there is a need for optimal utilisation of satellite data for mapping and monitoring the resources and also take up impact assessment studies. I am glad  that ISRO has facilitated geo-tagging of nearly 3.68 Crores of assets created under MGNREGA and uploading the details on Bhuvan geo portal.

I am told that Cartosat satellite data was extensively utilised by NRSC for monitoring the progress of 100   irrigation projects. Satellite derived information on periodic rainfall and groundwater prospects has facilitated the water resource planners for prioritisation of works. Satellite-based information should be available for supporting the management plans for rural development, particularly at village / taluk level to enable decentralised planning.  

India is committed to accord high priority to water conservation and its management through Watershed Development Component of Kisan Sinchaayi Yojana.  Satellite data is being used to verify the execution of works under watershed development programme and also to assess the impact in terms of additional crop area.

I am aware that the major efforts of NRSC will help the planners in relation to mapping of various cropping systems, analysing drought scenarios, preparing plans for crop intensification and locating the available proximate water resources.

I am glad that high resolution satellite data is being utilised in AMRUT scheme, which seeks to provide basic amenities and improve urban transport in 500 cities, as part of enhancing the quality of life of the people, especially the poor. 

Periodic mapping, monitoring of natural resources like landscape changes, land utilisation, land degradation, wasteland database would facilitate several projects of rural development. Potential estimate of power generation in waste lands or suitable land parcels through satellite derived solar parameters is a classic case of utilisation of satellite data to harness the renewable energy. 

While lauding ISRO for its innumerable achievements, I would like the prestigious organisation to take up futuristic, innovative projects for societal benefits. 

It should take up the challenge to provide web-based analytics from satellite images for various users. 

Inter-linking of rivers is a major effort which is under discussion for a long time and requires huge information in spatial domain from satellites. Several plans have to be drawn with the help of aerial / satellite data and I assume that ISRO has the capability to support this planning activity with help of high resolution satellite data and terrain / elevation information retrieval methodologies. I am told that a few river link studies have already benefitted from your expertise.

It is very difficult to manage disasters like Kerala floods or  other such events due to the devastation caused by them. While the Disaster Management Support Programme of ISRO at NRSC is providing flood-related information to the State and Central Relief departments, I would like ISRO to come up with early flood warning and Inundation Simulation of all vulnerable river reaches and reservoirs for preparation of evacuation plans. 

This may require launching of all weather satellites, experiments with unmanned aerial flights with imaging sensors to provide information to the field teams at frequent intervals during the floods. I am sure ISRO would take up this challenge.

Landslides are one of the major concerns for the country in hilly regions in eastern part of India and also in other areas. Hence, NRSC should utilise satellites to monitor landslide susceptible areas and prepare hazard zonation maps. I am sure this noble task would save many lives. We need an efficient retrieval of sufficient information for disaster risk reduction.

Though NRSC data is extensively utilized in forest management, there is a need to provide location specific information in near real time with greater accuracy.

Institutions like NRSC should also focus on ocean atmosphere studies in view of global warming and climate change. There is a need to look into climate patterns and atmospheric interaction processes for more reliable prediction of cyclones, their genesis, prediction of track, land fall and genesis of Tsunami, among others. As these processes are global in nature, we need to think of global collaborations and the utilisation of Indian and global satellites

In view of the increasing demand for citizen centric services NRSC has to play an important role in providing Satellite Data and expand its technical interactions with various states for capacity building.

Based on its expertise and capability, I am confident that NRSC will intensify its efforts to come up with innovative citizen-centric applications for national flagship programmes. 

I am told that ISRO’s future plans include development of heavy lift launchers, human spaceflight projects, reusable launch vehicles, semi-cryogenic engines, development and use of composite materials for space applications. It is also aiming to conduct 12 launches per year.

My best wishes to ISRO Chairman and his team for their future endeavours. 

I wish you all a grand success for your targeted 12 launches per year.

Thank you all.""

At every step of Bhutan’s development journey, India has been privileged to be Bhutan’s partner. We applaud the remarkable progress made by Bhutan in its pursuit of economic growth and happiness for its people, under the guidance and wisdom of His Majesty the King of Bhutan. I have fond memories of my meeting with His Majesty the King of Bhutan, Her Majesty the Queen and His Royal Highness the Gyalsey when they visited India last year in November 2017. 

India-Bhutan partnership is anchored on utmost trust, goodwill and mutual understanding at all levels. It is a celebration of the shared values that we cherish. Today, our partnership is multi-faceted and encompasses several areas of cooperation, which include joint endeavors in sectors such as trade and economic ties, infrastructure development, security cooperation, health, culture, education, information technology, capacity building and skill development, and most importantly people to people contacts.

Our special relationship is not just characterized by political exchanges at the highest levels, but deeply strengthened at the people to people level by such interactions as the Bhutan Week.

 Even as we celebrate many successes of the past, a milestone moment in history gives an opportunity to envision and shape the future of things to come. As we celebrate the glorious moments of the last fifty years, on behalf of the Government and the people of India, I reaffirm India’s abiding commitment to advance cherished partnership between India and Bhutan.  I am confident that our close and friendly ties will continue to grow from strength to strength. 

Before I conclude, I would like to congratulate Ambassador Namgyel and his team for their commendable efforts in organizing these week-long celebrations. I am confident that the people of India would participate in the Bhutan Week in large numbers and enjoy the rich heritage of Bhutan. I wish the Bhutan Week a resounding success.

Long live India-Bhutan friendship!

                The Vice President, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today advised medical students to imbibe the values of discipline, dedication and serve selflessly to become successful in their careers. 

Interacting with MBBS third year students from Gitam Institute of Medical Science and Research, Visakhapatnam, he reminded them that medicine was a noble profession and asked them to be always guided by moral compass. “ Medical profession is a mission and not for commission… there should not be any remission or omission”, he added.

He said that people treat doctors as demigods and asked them not to betray the trust reposed in them.

Pointing out that lack of physical activity was leading to lifestyle diseases, he cautioned the students against sedentary way of living.

Recalling the contributions Charaka and Sushruta to the field of medicine, he said India was once known as ‘Vishwaguru and Indians were pioneers in many scientific advancements. He also emphasized the need for youngsters to be rooted to Indian culture, traditions and customs.

 

The Vice President told the students that it was essential to work with passion for leading a happy and productive life.

He also advised them never to forget or neglect mother, motherland, mother tongue, native place and their Guru or teacher, who shaped their personalities. “Unfortunately, because of colonial rule, we are forgetting mother tongue” he lamented. It was necessary to be proficient in mother tongue to articulate one’s views effectively.

                The Vice President of India, Shri Venkaiah Naidu has advised the graduating Doctors to be never content on complacent with status quo and yearn to learn and learn to innovate. He was addressing the 19th Convocation of the National Board of Examinations, in New Delhi today. The Ministers of State for Health & Family Welfare, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Smt. Anupriya Patel and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.  

Congratulating the young doctors who were graduating as the ‘Diplomates of the National Board’, the Vice President remarked that they were about to undertake a fascinating voyage that would offer them rewards of recognition, service and personal fulfilment, while helping them improve the quality of human lives. He extolled the objectivity, thoroughness and the rigour of the examination process of the National Board of Exams, he said that the graduates who acquire the DNB qualification are as good, if not better than those who acquire MD, MS, DM and other equivalent degrees.

The Vice President said that education is a life-long learning process, especially when it comes to the Medical Field where breakthroughs and advancements happen rapidly. Medical scientists, epidemiologists and clinicians, must continue their experiments with truth and strive to extend the frontiers of scientific and medical knowledge, he added.

The Vice President told the Graduates to always be observant and curious and to keep up their Scientific temper. This Scientific temper, he said, was a grand tradition in India right from the times of Charaka and Sushruta. He implored the young doctors to never be content with status quo and to continually yearn to learn and learn to innovate. He advised them to be knowledgeable, skilful, and above all, generous and caring, making empathy and service their basic approach. He went on to say that Medicine was a mission and quoted Mahatma Gandhi’s words, ‘The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others’, encouraging the Doctors to make service their life’s motto.

Before closing his address, the Vice President raised three problems, that deserved the undivided attention of Healthcare professionals. He spoke about the urban-rural divide and added that rural India suffered from a lack of access to medical facilities, especially specialist care. He encouraged the young doctors who are at the prime of their career to dedicate themselves to serve the un-served and reach the un-reachable rural population and to ensure equity in access to health care facilities.

The Vice President noted that in spite of progress on the economic front, there have been many instances in which families have been driven into penury due to huge medical costs incurred on the treatment of their dear ones. He added that every effort should be made by the Medical fraternity to aid the government’s initiatives such as ‘Ayushman Bharat’ to provide good quality healthcare at affordable prices. Recalling the golden period of Medicine in India during the times of Charaka, Jeevaka and Sushruta, he told the Doctors that it was time to make India the Global Leader in Healthcare once again.

The Vice President emphasized upon the role that is to be played by holistic health practices including yoga and Ayurveda in complimenting Modern Medicine and in making India the most trusted healthcare destination of the world. He wished the Young Graduates a satisfying career for themselves and said that he hoped for a brighter, healthier future for India and the world.  

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“It gives me a great pleasure to be here with you and share my thoughts. It is truly a day of celebration as it marks the completion of a major chapter in your lives as you commence a new voyage. A new voyage equipped with the credentials of reputed organization. It will be a voyage that offers a reward of recognition, service and personal fulfilment. You, graduates who have taken this challenging voyage, have done so because you have felt it answers an inner urge in you to improve the quality of human lives.

This voyage is most demanding and calls for commitment and hard work, discipline and dedication. It is not easy.

But when one chooses a path that one likes, the turbulent waters don’t deter us. The journey becomes so much enjoyable. The challenges are seen as opportunities. I congratulate each one of you on choosing this fascinating journey and wish you well as you embark on it after crossing a major academic milestone.

Indeed, it is a day of great happiness, joy and cheer for you and your families. It is also an equally big day for the teachers who helped you acquire new knowledge and skills.

Today is a day to celebrate your achievement and also the contribution made by the National Board of Examinations which has been setting higher benchmarks of excellence with each passing year since 1982. It is an organization that has stood for exacting standards of professional competence. Thanks to the consistent effort of this Board, the graduate who acquire the DNB qualification are as good if not better than those who acquire MD, MS, DM and MCh degrees. I am told that a candidate has to pass the theory exam independently before qualifying for clinical exam and the clinical competence is evaluated byfour external examiners. So, there is objectivity, rigour and credibility in the entire process.

I compliment each of the new graduates on your success in acquiring this badge of honour. It is a recognition that is well earned.

I hope it will be only a good beginning of a long journey that will bring you many more laurels through out your professional life.

The knowledge, skill and competence that youhave acquired certainly a long way in easing and alleviating the pain and suffering of a vast number of people and bring them good health and joy.

At the same time, it is also a day of introspection for all of you as you chalk out your future plans. Remember that education is a life-long learning process—the quest for acquiring new knowledge and skills—has no boundaries or limits. This is particularly true of medical education, where new breakthroughsand   advancements make it incumbent upon all of you to constantly update your learning.

As medical scientists, epidemiologists and clinicians, you must  continue your experiments with truth and extend the frontiers of scientific and medical knowledge. 

Dear young friends, always be observant and curious. Build a scientific temper. Develop the intrinsic virtues of inquiry, exploration, analysis, discussion, patience, tolerance, humanism and an inclusive outlook. It is these qualities which shall take you far. Knowledge, tempered with such values will always stand in you in good stead, sharpen your intellect and above all will make you a good human being.

It is this spirit of scientific thinking from times immemorial, from the days of Sushruta and Charaka to the modern day luminaries in medicine has brought us where we are today.

You must continue and enrich the grand tradition and for this, it is crucial for you to develop critical thinking and expand your horizons of knowledge.

Never be content or complacent with status quo. Yearn to learn and learn to innovate.

As voyagers, be conscious of the moral compass that will guide you to your cherished goals.

Be knowledgeable, be skilful, but be generous, and be caring. Make empathy and service your basic approach. As the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi had said: “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others”. That should be the motto of doctors. Patients, who come to consult doctors, seek solace and advice from them. They need empathy, comforting words and a human touch.

I wish you the very best in your journey ahead. The 18th century French philosopher, Voltaire had said this about physicians, and I quote: ""Men, who are occupied in the restoration of health to other men, by the joint exertion of skill and humanity, are above all the great of the earth. They even partake of divinity, since to preserve and renew is almost as noble as to create."" This is the same perspective as India from time immemorial has held. We have said, “Viadyo narayano Harih” (doctors are like Narayana, the god who protects and preserves).

May each one of you excel in your life's mission and preserve and renew the human lives you touch. However, before I close, let me briefly share with you my concerns on three key themes, each of which is related to the other.

A large part of Indian population lives in rural India. Despite several governmental initiatives, we have been unable to provide adequate healthcare facilities to our rural people, the farmers and their families who feed us. At present, most parts of rural India have limited access to specialist healthcare, and this crisis partly stems from reluctance of our doctors to go and work in rural centres. The time has come for you to change this situation and consider serving these unserved populations.

Secondly, it should be noted that despite the progress on economic front, public and private financial resources continue to be scarce and we must look at delivering healthcare at an affordable cost. We must find ways and means to ensure that every citizen benefits from the advancements in medicine. There have been many instances in which families have been driven into penury and debt-traps due to huge medical costs incurred on the treatment of their dear ones.

In view of the low penetration of medical health insurance and an estimated 62.58 per cent of the people meeting medical and hospitalization expenses on their own, the Union Government has conceived of “Ayushman Bharat” aiming to provide financial protection to 10.74 crore deprived rural families by offering a benefit cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family per year. It covers almost all secondary and most of the tertiary care expenses. Thus, it is expected to provide a fillip to India’s goal of achieving Universal Health Coverage.

As doctors, you have an unprecedented opportunity to serve and be a part of this inclusive growth that India is aiming for with sharp focus on cleanliness and affordable healthcare.

And finally, I would like to advise you to think, innovate, create new paradigms, new ideas and new technologies in healthcare and turn India into a trailblazer in this field. The world must look up to us.  In my most recent visits to Serbia, Malta and Romania, I noticed how valued our healthcare professionals are in the world.

I think we should once again be the global leaders in healthcare, just as we were thousands of years ago, in the times of Sushruta, Jeevak and Charak. Medical tourism is becoming a reality and many people from different corners of the world are coming to India for treatment. In addition, there are a number of people who are looking towards India for holistic health practices including yoga and Ayurveda that can complement allopathic medicine.

You have, therefore, an exciting journey ahead. Set sail with confidence, competence, courage and commitment.

You must set your sights high and aim for a building a satisfying career for yourself and a brighter, healthier future for our country and the world.

Make India a trusted healthcare destination and lend a healing touch to the suffering humanity, a touch that only you can give with your knowledge, skills and attitude.

As the Vedic sages had said, let me wish you all the very best and say “Let there be freedom from disease. Let there be all round well being. Let your path be full of goodness”.

 

JAI HIND!”

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am delighted to be here amongst large gathering of eminent Romanian business leaders this afternoon. Your presence here is an affirmation of your continued and renewed interest in exploring business opportunities. I hope the interactions among the business leaders of the two sides during the course of the day have been fruitful.

India-Romania annual bilateral trade has risen to US $ 810 million in 2017-18, a 40% increase over last year (USD 575 million). This is a huge development in our bilateral economic relations. We need to sustain this momentum to scale it up even higher

India has embarked on the path of economic transformation and this presents fresh opportunities in multiple sectors for Romanian entrepreneurs. Indian economy is growing at over 8%, which is one of the fastest growth rates in the world for a large economy. We have managed a positive swing in stock market indices, foreign exchange reserves, public investment in infrastructure and welfare measures. Government investment in infrastructure development has increased exponentially and it is already visible in the improved railways, roads, airports and shipping infrastructure in our country.

We are committed to build a five trillion dollar economy by 2025, making us the 3rd largest consumer market in the world. India has climbed 42 placed in the World Bank’s Ease of Business Index. We are strengthening the manufacturing sector through the Make in India program even as our services sector remains robust and high-tech.

India also has one of the best regulated financial systems in the world.  It is now ranked as one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the world. We have a TRIPS compliant IPR regime and our multi-party democracy ensures essential stability and predictability.

Demonetisation and the GST have been successfully implemented for India to emerge as a transparent, modern and unified market. Greater ease of doing business is being reported from different corners of the country and tax rates are harmonised across the country. More than 320 million bank accounts have been opened under the Jan Dhan Yojana for the first time enabling direct cash benefit transfers. Millions of LPG connections have been given to rural women.

We have launched flagship programs including the Swachh Bharat i.e. Clean India, Skill India, Make in India, Digital India, Industrial Corridors and Smart Cities development programs.  I encourage Romanian companies to participate actively in these and reap the dividends from these profitable flagship programmes.

Today, I had meaningful discussions with Prime Minister Madam Dancila, on taking forward India-Romania multifaceted relations, with special emphasis on our economic ties. We are both convinced that there is immense potential to take the relationship, to a higher level.

Our economies have significant complementarities which can be leveraged for mutually beneficial cooperation. Several Indian companies in the sectors of IT, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, healthcare have made their mark in Romania. These companies have invested significantly and have created thousands of jobs to benefit the local communities and economy. I am told that Genpact and WIPRO each have engaged more than 4000 employees.

Romanian companies are also operating in India and the cumulative FDI inflows from Romania to India is around USD 7.5 million. There are opportunities for bilateral investment flows between a growing Romanian economy and a huge Indian market in sectors such as IT, automobiles, mining, agriculture and food processing, tourism, healthcare products and energy. India stands ready to welcome more Romanian investors and I encourage Romanian entrepreneurs to partner in Indian growth story.

India has emerged as one of the leaders in renewable energies and my Government has launched a massive push for clean power.  We aim at installing 100 GW of solar power by 2022.  Solar power prices in India have hit a record low, thus bringing us close to achieving our goals under the Paris Climate Change accords.  In this sector therefore, we offer one of the most exciting opportunities for Romania.

Earlier this evening Bucharest Chamber of Commerce of Romania signed 3 MoU with with leading chambers of commerce CII, ASSOCHAM and PHDCCI will  surely pave the way for greater and better exchange of information and cooperation in the trade and investment sectors.

In conclusion, I invite you all to partner us in India’s exciting and transformative journey which is going to usher in a new era not just for India and Romania but also for the world. Let us use our imagination to open up exciting and growing opportunities in many spheres with a friendly democratic partner and create a genuine, multifaceted Indo-Romanian partnership. 

 

Thank you!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India and Romania are growing at an unprecedented and steady pace. He was holding bilateral discussions with the President of Romania, Mr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, the President of the Senate of Romania, Mr. Calin Popescu-Tariceanu and the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Mr. Nicolae-Liviu Dragnea, in Bucharest, during his two-day visit to Romania today. The Minister of State for Finance, Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla and other dignitaries were present on the occasion. 

The Vice President explained the working of the parliamentary system and how both India and Romania have been strengthening diplomatic relationship over the last 70 years. He conveyed the good wishes of the people of India to the people of Romania on the centenary year of Romania. He touched upon various initiatives being taken up by the Government of India to deepen the roots of democracy through the three tier governance structure comprising of Parliament, State Assemblies and the local bodies. He underscored India’s commitment and desire to work towards enhancing the already excellent trade relations between the two countries. He appreciated Romania’s initiative to celebrate the International Day of Yoga in Romanian Parliament.

The Vice President had a very fruitful meeting with the President of Romania, Mr. Klaus Werner Iohannis and greeted the people of Romania on the centenary year of Romania and also expressed happiness that his visit is coinciding the 70th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between the two countries. He complimented the President on Romania’s sustained economic growth and hoped that the trade and investment relationship will further expand deepening the economic linkages between the two countries. The two leaders shared thoughts on regional and global issues with friendly candor. The President of Romania congratulated India on its success in accelerating economic development and promised that he would take further steps to strengthen the relationship between the two countries as well as between European Union and India.  

The Vice President said that India values its partnership with European Union and seeks Romania’s support to carry forward the negotiations on India-EU Free Trade Agreement which is under discussions for over three years. The Vice President appreciated Romania's support for resumption of talks on India-EU BTIA (India-European Union Broad-based Trade & Investment Agreement) and willingness to bring this negotiations to an early and successful closure when Romania assumes the presidency of EU later this year. 

Responding to the remarks of the President of Romania regarding their countries support to India’s aspiration for permanent membership of UN Security council, the Vice President expressed great appreciation of Romania’s gracious gesture of support not only for this specific issue but also for the broader reforms of UN system. 

The Vice President thanked Romania for supporting India’s efforts at developing consensuses on draft Comprehensive Convention on International terrorism. Both the leaders also underscored the need to fight the scourge of terrorism in all forms.

Later in the day, the Vice President would be having discussions with the Prime Minister Ms. Vasilica Viorica Dancila and will be addressing the India-Romania Business meeting which will hopefully result in fruitful collaboration and diversification of trade basket covering sectors such as ICT, Pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, infrastructure, logistics, agri-foods and tourism.

Venkaiah Naidu has said that the ambitious, transformative vision that is making India one of the most favourite investment destinations in the word. He was addressing the India-Malta Business Forum in the presence of the President of Malta, Ms. Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, organized by the Malta Chamber of Commerce and the Confederation of Indian Industry, at Valletta, Malta today. The Minister of State for Finance, Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that Indian economy is growing at around 8%, currently is one of the fastest growing major economies of the world. He further said that growth and development are vital to implement social reform and Government is taking all the measures to bring in change, transformation in every sense is the motto of this government.

The Vice President said that India is committed to build a five trillion-dollar economy by 2025, making India the 3rd largest consumer market in the world. He further said that India has climbed 30 places in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index this year and IMF has forecast that India will grow at more than 7 percent in 2018 and 2019, ahead of other major economies.

The Vice President said that a number of economic reforms have been undertaken by Indian Government including digitization of the economy, financial inclusion, tax reforms like Goods and Services Tax (GST). He further said that more than 326 million persons have opened bank accounts in the last four years making financial inclusion a reality. Tax base has been widened and tax compliance has increased, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

""It gives me great pleasure to be with all of you along with Her Excellency President of Malta. 

Madam President,

Your presence here is an affirmation of your continued commitment to strengthening our bilateral ties.

After the fruitful discussions with Her Excellency the President of Malta, today morning, I am convinced that the economic relationship between Malta and India can move on to a much higher trajectory. I convey my compliments to the Malta Chamber of Commerce and the Confederation of Indian Industry for their efforts in organising this interaction. 

Sisters and brothers,

I am happy to share with you the ambitious, transformative vision that is making India one of the most favourite investment destinations in the word.

Indian economy, growing at around 8%, currently is one of the fastest growing major economies of the world.

Over the past half a decade, India has witnessed a positive swing in stock market indices, foreign exchange reserves and public investment in infrastructure.

As the World Bank has noted in its latest report, “India’s growth in recent years has been supported by prudent macroeconomic policy: a new inflation targeting framework, energy subsidy reforms, fiscal consolidation, higher quality of public expenditure and a stable balance of payment situation. In addition, recent policy reforms have helped India improve the business environment, ease inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and improve credit behavior.”

Sisters and brothers,

We in India, are committed to build a five trillion-dollar economy by 2025, making India the 3rd largest consumer market in the world.

India has climbed 30 places in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index this year and IMF has forecast that India will grow at more than 7 percent in 2018 and 2019, ahead of other major economies.

A number of economic reforms have been undertaken by Indian Government including digitisation of the economy, financial inclusion, tax reforms like Goods and Services Tax (GST). More than 326 million persons have opened bank accounts in the last four years making financial inclusion a reality. Tax base has been widened and tax compliance has increased.

India is rapidly expanding its infrastructure. For instance, over 9829 Km national highways were constructed during the year 2017-18 as compared to 8231 km during the previous year.

The policy initiatives taken by the Indian government such as Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Smart Cities and Start-up India are opening up new opportunities.

We have seen a strong global confidence in the India story with a surge in Foreign Direct Investments which reached over US $ 62 billion in 2017-18. We have a TRIPS compliant IPR regime and our multi-party democracy ensures essential stability and predictability.

Sisters and brothers,

India and Malta have had trade ties for over a century. We now need to take this to the next level. Malta is a freight trans-shipment point, financial centre, and ICT and R&D hub. The business houses in India would do well to consider new and emerging opportunities.

At the same time, Maltese companies could consider investing in India in health, maritime transport, films, pharmaceutical, travel and tourism sectors.

I hope entrepreneurs in both countries will create a new dynamic that will propel our countries’ economies to grow at a pace much faster than today. 

We appreciate the recent visit by the Maltese Foreign Minister, Mr.Carmelo Abela to India, to participate in the India-Europe 29 Business Forum, leading a large business delegation to explore trade potential in different sectors.

I do hope the India-Malta Business Forum will set the pace for a new era of enhanced, mutually enriching business environment.  India, let me assure you, will most warmly welcome your collaboration, participation and contribution. 

I am sure Malta, under the able leadership of Her Excellency, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca will further enhance our trade relationship in the coming years.

Thank you.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India and Malta are growing at a steady pace and if we can work together, both can certainly grow faster. He was making the joint Press Statement following delegation level talks with the President of Malta, Ms. Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, at San Anton Palace, Halbalzan, Malta today. The Minister of State for Finance, Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla, the High Commissioner of India to Malta, Shri Rajesh Vaishnaw and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that diplomatic relations between India and Malta were established soon after the independence of Malta and India see Malta as one of the most trusted partners within the EU. He further said that India was one of the first countries to recognize independence of Malta and now, we have taken the decision to open a resident mission in Malta in order to scale up our relationship.

 

Saying both economies are complimentary and technology based, the Vice President said that India and Malta need to bolster relationship with far more substantive cooperation on the economic, scientific and technological, human resource development fronts. Malta can take the advantage of India’s highly skilled professionals in the field of IT, financial services, health, pharmaceuticals, transport, freight and tourism, he added.

 

The Vice President said that India and Malta have signed three Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) in the field of (i) Maritime Cooperation; (ii) Diplomatic Training; and (iii) Tourism Cooperation. It is a good beginning  in creating a modern, enabling framework for enhancing relations between both the countries, he added.

 

The Vice President said that both the Governments should work towards facilitating easy mobility of professionals on both sides. I strongly believe this will certainly go a long way in further strengthening the ties and accelerate progress and growth in both our countries, he added.

 

The Vice President thanked Malta for the assistance provided in the evacuation of Indians from Libya. He also conveyed his best wishes to the people of our friendly country Malta for the upcoming National Day of Malta.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's Press Statement:

 

""Your Excellency President Ms Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, I thank you for your kind words. I am delighted to visit your beautiful country. I take this opportunity to thank you for warm reception and the excellent hospitality extended to me and my delegation. 

 

Diplomatic relations between our countries were established soon after the independence of Malta.

 

Ever since then, our relations have always been warm and friendly and India is very keen to further strengthen bilateral ties. We see Malta as one of our most trusted partners within the EU.

 

In order to work more closely with your government towards further strengthening the relationship, we have reopened our resident Mission in Malta.

 

India and Malta are growing at a steady pace. If we can work together, we can certainly grow faster.

 

Both our economies are complimentary and technology based. We need to bolster our relationship with far more substantive cooperation on the economic, scientific and technological, human resource development fronts. You can take the advantage of India’s highly skilled professionals in the field of IT, financial services, health, pharmaceuticals, transport, freight and tourism.

 

India today is one of the main sources of affordable generic drugs in the world. Malta can consider collaboration in this sector. We can also cooperate in the use of the ancient sciences of Yoga and Ayurveda to promote wellness. Malta may like to take advantage of India’s advancement in affordable, quality healthcare facilities.

 

In this context, the signing of three Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) namely; (i) MoU on Maritime Cooperation between Ministry of Shipping, India and Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure and Capital Projects, Malta;  (ii) MoU on mutual cooperation between the Foreign Service Institute, India and The Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies, University of Malta, and (iii) MoU in the field of Tourism Cooperation between India and Malta mark a good beginning  in creating a modern, enabling framework for enhancing relations between our countries.

 

Easier facilitation of visa promotes people-to-people contact and business. Our governments should work towards facilitating easy mobility of professionals on both sides.  I strongly believe this will certainly go a long way in further strengthening the ties and accelerate progress and growth in both our countries.

 

On behalf of my government, I convey our gratitude to Malta for the assistance provided in the evacuation of Indians from Libya.

 

Terrorism is one of the foremost threats to international peace and security. We resolved to fight the scourge of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and agreed to strengthen cooperation in fight against terrorism at various international forums. It is a global challenge that requires a global response.

 

We are happy that both our countries have been lending support for each other’s candidates at various multilateral forums.

 

I will also be meeting the Hon’ble Speaker of the House of Representative of Malta, Acting Prime Minister and Hon’ble Minister for Economy as well as the Leader of Opposition of Malta. I will also be interacting with India-Malta Business Forum with representatives from both the countries.

 

Our meetings, I am confident, will contribute to mutual understanding and help in taking bilateral relations to even higher levels.

 

On this occasion I would like to convey my best wishes to people of our friendly country Malta for the upcoming National Day of Malta.

 

I would once again like to thank President Ms. Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca for the warm welcome and gracious hospitality. I also extend warm greetings for the progress and prosperity of the people of Malta. India looks forward to cooperation with Malta to further strengthen the traditional bonds of friendship with Malta and its people.

""Namaskar to all of you. I bring you the warmest of greetings from India.

 

I thank all of you for welcoming me and my delegation members with such warmth and affection. I am accompanied by Hon’ble Minister of State for Finance, Mr. Shiv Pratap Shukla and Mr. Prasanna Acharya, Mrs. Vijila Sathyananth and Ms. Saroj Pandey, Hon’ble Members of the Upper House of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) and Mr. Raghav Lakhanpal, Hon’ble Member of the Lower House of Parliament (Lok Sabha). 

 

I am delighted to visit this beautiful and historic city of Vellatta. I would like to thank the Government of Malta for extending warm hospitality to me and my delegation members. During the visit, I look forward to fruitful interactions with President, Hon’ble Speaker of the House of Representative of Malta, Acting Prime Minister and Leader of Opposition of Malta.  I will also have an opportunity to address India-Malta Business Forum during the visit.  

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

In this distinguished gathering, some of you are professionals, researchers, students or businessmen. Some of you may have come to this country decades ago, some of you may have arrived only a few years ago. I am so pleased that you have integrated into the Maltese society and made valuable contributions in sectors like pharmaceuticals, information technology, and healthcare and tourism service industry.

 

 It is not surprising that the vast and growing Indian diaspora is doing so well everywhere. There is within each one of us that invisible common thread of essential Indian-ness. For us, the whole world is actually a large family. The geographical boundaries do not limit us nor do the linguistic and cultural differences. We learn and appreciate good ideas irrespective of where they originate from. “Let noble thoughts come to us from all sides” said our ancient sages.  

 

I am happy to note that the Indian community enjoys the reputation of being peace loving and able to assimilate into the local environment. You are making a contribution in the socio economic development of Malta by way of investments, knowledge transfer, philanthropic engagements, and catalysing demand of Indian goods in their countries of settlement. 

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

I feel very proud that I represent an India that is at the cusp of a transformative movement.

 

I am happy to inform you that India is in the midst of an unprecedented economic and social transformation. The economy is growing at a steady pace and the systemic governance reforms are creating a more inclusive society.

 

India has climbed 30 places in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index this year and IMF has forecast that India will grow at more than 7 percent in 2018 and 2019, ahead of other major economies.

 

A number of economic reforms have been undertaken by Indian Government including digitisation of the economy, financial inclusion, tax reforms like Goods and Services Tax (GST). More than 326 million persons have opened bank accounts in the last four years making financial inclusion a reality. Tax base has been widened and tax compliance has increased.

 

India is rapidly expanding its infrastructure. For instance, over 9829 Km national highways were constructed during the year 2017-18 as compared to 8231 km during the previous year.

 

The policy initiatives taken by the Indian government such as Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Smart Cities and Start-up India are opening up new opportunities.

 

India is creating an enabling eco system that will spur growth, skill youth and foster entrepreneurship. India, today is a veritable land of opportunity for those who want to connect, innovate, trade and invest

 

India is contributing to and witnessing the onset of an information technology revolution which is changing the way a government engages with its citizens. A revolution, which rests on digital infrastructure that allows free flow of information, innovation and ideas on the information high-ways.

 

Dear Sisters and brothers,

 

We have also set the goal of providing affordable and inclusive healthcare to the citizens and to realise this goal we have launched  the world’s largest and India’s most ambitious healthcare program, Ayushman Bharat — National Health Protection Mission,  announced in our Union Budget of 2018 and reiterated by our PM on 15 August this year.  The scheme will provide a health insurance cover to 100 million families.

 

India has taken the lead in the field of energy, and we have set a goal of 175 Gigawatts of renewable energy. We hosted the founding conference of International Solar Alliance in Delhi in March this year. This is one of the largest commitments to financing solar energy projects around the world.

 

We are a young nation of 800 million strong youth. This demographic advantage is being converted into a demographic dividend. We are upgrading the competence of this aspirational, young population through “Skill India” programme.

 

Sisters and brothers, 

 

You represent India in Malta and Malta in India and your role in both connecting and developing our ties is very important. 

 

Your presence in Malta from different parts of India helps in creating awareness about the rich cultural diversity of India, and taking the message of Indian music, art, dance, and other heritage, like Yoga and Ayurveda to our Maltese friends. 

 

A resurgent India awaits you. We have taken several steps towards eliminating barriers of your connect with India. It has been our resolve to be available to overseas Indians and to ensure that interface between our government and you remain smooth and a pleasurable experience. I am sure, you are taking advantage of the e-Visa scheme of India launched in 2015 and further liberalised last year for business, tourism and health purposes.

 

To facilitate easy stay of foreigners of Indian origin in India, we offer OCI cards. I would encourage you to join the scheme and enjoy the facilities offered under it and strengthen the bonds with the country of your origin and the country of your ancestors.

 

In order to engage with our vast Diaspora and to bring their knowledge, expertise and skills on a common platform, we have created a new facility- the Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra- in New Delhi, as a one stop resource center for our diaspora. You must visit it whenever you come to India. Our Government also runs a special programme – the Know India Programme- to bring our diaspora youths together and expose them to India.

 

The Government and people of India are thus proud of your achievements.  The decision to open a resident Indian High Commission in Malta has been taken with the desire to connect with you all.

 

It has been a pleasure and privilege for me to connect with you. Each one of you, member of the Indian diaspora, have made us proud because of your accomplishments, your acceptance within the country of your adoption and your well-recognized contribution to the development of the society which you have adopted. 

 

You are the face of India in Malta exemplifying to the people you interact with, the mind and heart of Bharat.

You are the inheritors of the universal vision that India has been expounding since time immemorial. You are the valuable human resource for India bringing in new Knowledge, skills and attitudes to accelerate India’s growth.

 

I thank you all once again for being here today and welcoming me with so much warmth.

 

I wish you all the best in your endeavors to make Malta and India come closer, grow together and share a prosperous future. 

 

Jai Hind.

                Marking the revival of the spirit of warmth and cooperation of Marshal Tito-Pandit Nehru years, the Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu was extended the rare honour of addressing the special session of the  Parliament of the Republic of Serbia in Belgrade last night. It was in the same hallowed hall of the National Assembly of Serbia that former Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru addressed the world leaders while launching the Non-Alignment Movement along with the veteran leader of Yugoslavia Marshal Tito.

 

In his hour long address to the laws makers of the host country, Shri Naidu fondly recalled the close affinity and shared vision with which leaders of both the countries played a key role in launching the Non Aligned Movement (NAM). He said “Relations between the two countries are deeply rooted in history. From the early days of Independent India, both countries laid great emphasis on NAM and contributed much to creation of a new and democratic world order, particularly for the post-colonial third world that challenged the concept of bipolar world. The changes in global geo-politics now again give us an opportunity to work together for mutual benefit and for sharing prosperity with others”.

 

Referring to the International Day of Democracy yesterday, Shri Naidu gave a detailed account of the steady growth and consolidation of parliamentary democracy in India. He said “Over the years, Indian Parliament has evolved as a democratic forum that attentively listens to fascinatingly complex voices from different parts of the vast country and responds to diverse concerns with agility.”

 

Highlighting the importance of democracy for participatory development, Shri Naidu quoted Pandit Nehru from his speech at the same venue in 1961 and said Nehru gave a call ‘’For building in our countries societies where freedom is real.  Freedom is essential because freedom will give us strength and enable us to build prosperous societies” .

 

Speaker of the Serbian Parliament received Shri Naidu and escorted him to the podium and introduced him to the Members of the House. The Vice President’s address was applauded quite a few times and particularly when he said that Marshal Tito was a household name in India when he (Shri Naidu) was a school student. The Vice President received huge standing ovation on the conclusion of his address to the law makers of Serbia.

 

During the hectic day of high level engagements, Shri Naidu held detailed discussions on a range of bilateral and multilateral issues with President Mr. Aleksander Vucic, Prime Minister Ms. Ana Brnabic and Speaker of the National Assembly of Serbia Ms. Maja Gojkovic besides addressing a business forum.

 

During the joint media briefing along with Shri Naidu, President of Serbia Shri Aleksander Vucic complimented the Indian political leadership for stellar economic results. He said “India is witnessing exceptional economic progress. We are happy for the country who has been our longtime friend and well wisher”. He also thanked India for recognizing Serbia’s territorial integrity. Shri Vucic stressed that Serbia is keen to engage with India on agriculture, pharmacy, IT and generic medicines. He evinced interest in defense cooperation.

 

During his talks with the top leaders and businessmen of Serbia, the Vice President gave a detailed account of the rapid strides being made by India in various fields including an enabling, predictable and reform oriented financial and investment eco-systems offering  mutually beneficial partnerships. Voicing concerns over the menace of terrorism, he called for early finalization of draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT).   

 

The Vice President of India noted that both the countries had difficult periods in recent history but have emerged stronger from each of these crises because of the courage to reform.”The economic reforms in India and in Serbia in the 1990s have effectively converted some of the major challenges into opportunities” he observed.

 

On the occasion of 70 years of establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, Serbia Post and India Post have released commemorative stamps on renowned Serbian physicist and innovator Nikola Tesla and Swami Vivekananda. Shri Naidu noted that Swami Vivekananda’s thoughts and ideas left a deep impression on Tesla’s works.

 

In the presence of the President of Serbia and Vice President of India, both the sides signed two agreements. The agreement on Plant Protection and Quarantine seeks to enhance trade in fruits, vegetables and processed foods. The second one ,Revised Air Services agreement aims at promoting connectivity boosting trade and tourism including direct air link between the two countries.

 

On his second overseas visit as Vice President, Shri Naidu will also visit Malta and Romania before returning home on Friday next week. On his first such visit, Shri Naidu visited the Latin American Countries of Guatemala, Panama and Peru.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I feel privileged to be with all of you on a special day, in a special year and at a special place.

 

Today is the International Day of Democracy.

 

This year marks the 70th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries.

 

This place is the historic meeting ground of nations that decided to launch the Non- aligned movement in 1961. It is good to recall that India and the then Yugoslavia were the pioneers of that movement.

 

We share a common perspective on many issues and have a deeper affinity that brings us closer.

 

I am deeply honoured by the invitation to address this august House. I am grateful for the kind invitation and warmth and hospitality accorded to me and the members of my delegation during my visit.

 

I am accompanied by Hon’ble Minister of State for Finance, Mr. Shiv Pratap Shukla, Hon’ble Members of Indian Parliament, Mr. Prasanna Acharya, Mrs. Vijila Sathyananth, Ms.Saroj Pandey and Mr. Raghav Lakhanpal.  We bring the greetings and best wishes of the people of India to the eminent leaders of Serbia and great friends of India present in this House and for the people of Serbia.

 

Sisters and brothers of Serbia,

 

Both Serbia and India share a common commitment to democratic values and the need to continuously nurture the democratic spirit for improving the quality of the lives of our people.

Serbia has a long history of National Assembly and constitution, one of the oldest in Europe, dating back to the nineteenth century. We, Indians, having firm belief in Parliamentary democracy, are deeply impressed by Serbia's strong Parliamentary tradition.

 

This impressive National Assembly building built nearly hundred years ago, truly reflects the rich Parliamentary heritage of Serbia.

 

It is not merely the architecture of this building that is impressive. What is equally important is the architecture of path breaking ideas that has made this a significant landmark in the annals of modern world history.

 

It was here that the first NAM Summit took place in 1961. Prime Minister of India Pandit Nehru and other world leaders of Non-Aligned Movement addressed the NAM Summit in this hallowed hall.

 

Sentinels of people’s welfare,

 

Relations between India and Serbia are deeply rooted in history. From the early days of Independent India, both countries laid great emphasis on Non-Aligned Movement and contributed much to creation of a new and democratic world order, particularly for the post-colonial third world that challenged the concept of bipolar world. Numerous high level exchange of visits between the two countries during that period is a testimony to that shared belief. Marshal Tito was a familiar name in many Indian households. I understand that he addressed Indian Parliament during his visit to India in 1954. Thus, the Parliaments of our two countries had the privilege of and benefit of learning from each other. I am happy that the dialogue is continuing through the Serbian National Assembly’s Parliamentary Friendship Group with India.

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

At this juncture, let me share few words about the parliamentary system in India, the largest democracy in the world. The Parliament of India is the supreme legislative body of the Republic of India. It is a bicameral legislature with two houses: the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the Lok Sabha (House of the People). As Vice President of India, I also function as Ex-Officio Chairperson of Raja Sabha or Council of States. I have a long experience with our Parliamentary system. I became a member of the Legislative Assembly of my state, Andhra Pradesh, forty years ago, in 1978. I have been a member of Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of Parliament since 1998. I functioned as Minister of Parliamentary Affairs of India, in addition to discharging my other Ministerial responsibilities, from 2014 to 2016.

 

While Serbia has a unicameral Parliament, India's federal structure requires a bicameral body to give adequate representation to the States.

 

Over the years, Indian Parliament has evolved as a democratic forum that attentively listens to fascinatingly complex voices from different parts of the vast country and responds to diverse concerns with agility.

 

Nurturing and encouraging participatory democracy, our Parliament has been instrumental in ushering in social change and development through progressive legislations.

 

The accent is on preserving the democratic spirit by putting the people at the centre of the development architecture.

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

Today, we are also commemorating the International Day of Democracy that was proclaimed by the United Nations On 8 November 2007. The opening words of the UN Charter, “We the Peoples”, reflect the fundamental principle of democracy, that the will of the people is the source of legitimacy of nations.

 

Kautilya, one of the prominent political scientists of ancient India, had said in his treatise called Artha Shastra, “The King’s happiness should lie only in the happiness of the people in the kingdom and not on any other factor”. The legitimacy of the king or the sovereign State is essentially derived from the ability to respond to people’s will and aspirations, to their needs and concerns.

 

Popular democracy and representative institutions are neither entirely alien to the Indian soil nor of recent origin. The history of democratic traditions in India, in fact, goes back to the Vedic period. The Vedas, the oldest Indian compendium of knowledge, have a number of references to popular assemblies known as the Sabhas and the Samitis. In the post-Vedic period, the Republics which were known in popular parlance as Ganarajya or Sangha were functioning as self-governing institutions.

 

We all recognize that the essential elements of democracy are the values of freedom, respect for human rights and the principle of holding periodic and genuine elections by universal suffrage.

 

India adopted universal suffrage to all citizens above the age of 18 years. Since 1951, the people of India have elected their representatives to the legislative bodies through free and fair electoral process. The voter turnout has been steadily going up over the last 64 years, from 44.87 percent in 1951 to 66.4 percent in 2014. It is worth noting that 65.6 percent of the voters who voted in the latest election in 2014 was women.

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

Having spoken at length on Indian Parliamentary system and Indian democracy, let me come back to India-Serbia ties. Interaction between Indians and Serbians of course was not confined to post-independence period of India. Much before that, people to people interaction between these two parts of the world has contributed richly to their intellectual and cultural capital.

 

Interaction between the renowned Serbian innovator and inventor Nikola Tesla and the great spiritual leader of India Swami Vivekananda is one such example.

 

Swami Vivekananda's thoughts and ideas left a deep impression on Nikola Tesla's work. I am happy that Serbia Post and India Post have duly acknowledged this by jointly bringing out commemorative stamps on these two visionaries.

 

Both had a grand vision for the entire humanity. They were creative geniuses who left a lasting impact on the world. One was an epitome of outstanding innovation in physics. The other was an accomplished spiritual master who explained metaphysical realities to the world.

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

Both Serbia and India had difficult periods in recent history but have emerged stronger from each of these crises because we had the courage to reform. The economic reforms in India and in Serbia in the 1990s have effectively converted some of the major challenges into opportunities.

 

Our two countries have always been supportive of each other on the issues of core interest. Serbia has faced and still faces challenges to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. On this, India has always maintained its principled stand and support for Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. India firmly believes that the Kosovo issue should be resolved peacefully through consultation and dialogue.

 

India is also happy with principled support India receives from Serbia on several core issues like, for instance, India's application for membership of Nuclear Suppliers Group.

 

I am glad that Serbia shares India's views on the need for reforming United Nations, particularly the UN Security Council.

 

Our two countries also agree that terrorism is one of the foremost threats to international peace and security. There is an urgent need to strengthen the global counter terrorism legal framework to combat this scourge by expediting finalization of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) under the UN umbrella.

 

In recent years, our bilateral ties have reached a distinctly higher level. In January 2017, H.E. Mr. Aleksandar Vucic, Hon'ble President of Serbia, visited India in his capacity as Prime Minister of Serbia. The visit was truly historic. This was a first visit at the level of Head of State or Head of Government from Belgrade to India after thirty years. There has also been lack of high level visits from Indian side for almost three decades. With my visit, I want to underline India's keen desire to maintain close ties with Serbia through high level engagements.

 

On the occasion of Hon'ble Vucic's visit to India last year, Serbia participated in Vibrant Gujarat Summit. I am happy that Serbia again participated in another major event in India, World Food India 2017 in New Delhi in November last year.

 

Agriculture is a major economic activity both in India and Serbia and we can benefit from each other’s expertise in agriculture and food processing sector. Hon'ble First Deputy Prime Minister & Foreign Minister of Serbia Ivica Dacic visited India in May this year. During his meeting with me, I was glad to learn about the steps our two countries are taking to strengthen or bilateral ties further. I was particularly happy to know to that Serbia had abolished visa requirements for short term visit of all Indian passports holders last year.

 

Our annual bilateral trade is currently about US$ 200 million. Undoubtedly, this is much below the true potential. More exchange of business delegations is necessary to boost our bilateral trade further. While there is a need for boosting our bilateral trade, investment in each other's countries and more innovative approaches are necessary for strengthening of economic ties. In this context, the recent examples of foreign investment are a new positive development. An Indian company has acquired a major Serbian tractor manufacturing company. This can contribute to production of high quality agriculture machinery in Serbia at an affordable cost and certainly help Serbia's agriculture sector. An Indian company has established an IT park in Serbia. India's strength in IT sector is globally renowned. Serbia can also benefit from India's capability of producing high quality, lifesaving drugs at a cost within the reach of common Serbians.

 

Indian tourists are now visiting foreign countries in large numbers. Serbia, with its fascinating history and landscape, has the potential to attract these Indian tourists. Serbia also has strength in some areas of defence production. Since India now permits participation of Indian private sector and even foreign companies in defence production and defence procurement, the private companies of both sides can join hands and benefit from India's liberalized policy. While both governments are strengthening the framework for greater economic engagement, we have added further to these efforts by signing relevant agreements during my visit. Signing of Agreement on Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine will help in enhancing trade in fruits, vegetables and processed products. The revised Air Services Agreement will enhance connectivity besides boosting trade and tourism.

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

At this juncture, let me say a few words about what my Government is doing in India to attract foreign businessmen and entrepreneurs. We are committed to build a five trillion-dollar economy by 2025, making us the 3rd largest consumer market in the world. India has climbed 42 places in the World Bank’s Ease of Business Index over the past two years and is committed to improve it further. We are strengthening the manufacturing sector through the Make in India programme while our services sector remains robust and high-tech. We have also moved up 21 places on the Global Innovation Index of the WIPO in two years as well as 19 places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of the World Bank.

 

Foreign Direct Investment as a fairly accurate indicator of foreign confidence in a nation’s political and economic systems is widely acknowledged. According to the latest data, FDI inflow into India rose to US$35.9 billion over the period April to December 2017. In fact, FDI has risen from US$36 billion in 2013-14 to US$60 billion in 2016-17. We have a TRIPS compliant IPR regime and our multi-party democracy ensures essential stability and predictability.

 

A number of systemic tax reforms including the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax(GST) have enabled India to emerge as a transparent, modern and unified market. Tax base and tax compliance has greatly improved. Financial inclusion has been a key priority of the current government. 326 million new bank accounts have been opened for the first time enabling direct cash benefit transfers.

 

Thus, we have put in place a sound policy framework in India and created a business friendly environment. The liberal e-Visa regime that we have for Serbians should make it easy to travel to India.

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

In the early days of India's independence, our ties started on a strong foundation of a shared global view of Non-Aligned Movement and we together created a large platform for the third world. The changes in global geo-politics now again give us an opportunity to work together for mutual benefit and for sharing prosperity with others. It would be good to recall the words of India’s first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru at the Conference of Non- Aligned nations in Belgrade on September 2, 1961. His call which rings so true and relevant even today was “to build in our own countries societies where freedom is real. Freedom is essential, because freedom will give us strength and enable us to build prosperous societies.” We must strive to strengthen our democratic polities and internalize the concepts of freedom, dialogue, inclusion and rule of law in our governance structures.

 

Let me end with an ancient Indian prayer from the Vedas:

 

“Sahanaavaatu,  Sahanau  Bhunaktu,  Sahaveeryam  Karavaavahai,  Tejaswinavadhitamastu, Maa vidwishavahai” (Let us move together, Let us have food together, Let us grow together, Let us acquire and share knowledge, Let us never hate each other”.

 

That is the wish I would like to share with you. As a representative of a country that saw the entire world as one large family, I bring you the love, affection and warm greetings of India for all Serbians and hope that we shall continue to work together towards a world that is inclusive, harmonious and sustainable. 

 

Thank you, Hvala.""

The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India and Serbia have historic and special relations as co-founders of the Non-Aligned Movement and our relationship is based on mutual trust, mutual understanding and support to each other on issues of core interest. He was making a press statement after holding delegation level talks with the President of Serbia, Mr. Aleksandar Vucic at Serbia Place, in Belgrade, Serbia today. The Minister of State for Finance, Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla, the Ambassador of India to Serbia, Shri Subrata Bhattacharjee and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President said that India and Serbia have historic and special relations as co-founders of the Non-Aligned Movement and our relationship is based on mutual trust, mutual understanding and support to each other on issues of core interest. He further said that we agreed to expand the bilateral cooperation especially in the areas of economic and cultural relations. India and Serbia are on the path of economic reforms to realize the goal of socio-economic development of our peoples, he added.

The Vice President along with the Serbian President has witnessed the signing of MoUs between India and Serbia on cooperation in the fields of Plant Health and Plant Quarantine and a revised Air Services. Addressing on this occasion, the Vice President said that these agreements will contribute to further enhancing bilateral economic ties between India and Serbia.

Both leaders have jointly released the Commemorative Stamps on two great personalities, Swami Vivekananda, the great Philosopher from India and Nikola Tesla, the great scientist from Serbia to commemorate 70 years of diplomatic relations between India and Serbia. The Vice President along with the Serbian President also visited the Exhibition on ‘Belgrade/New Delhi – 70 years of Diplomatic Relations’.

The Vice President and the Serbian President have gave a joint Press Statement. Later, both the leaders have addressed the India-Serbia Business Forum Meeting.

The Vice President thanked the President of Serbia for extending invitation to visit Serbia and for hosting  in his beautiful country. We appreciate your inspiring leadership of Serbia and your constructive role in the region, he added.

The Vice President congratulated the President of Serbia for the success of economic reforms undertaken by the Serbian Government which have resulted in significant improvement in the economic situation and business environment of Serbia.   

The Vice President said that today India is one of the fastest growing major economies in the world and Serbian companies can take advantage of the favourable trade and investment environment as well as major policy initiatives like Make in India, Smart cities, Digital India, Start-up India, etc. by participating in these programmes in Business to Business mode including Joint Ventures. He further said that there is huge scope to promote collaboration in sectors like agriculture and food processing, science & technology, IT & Electronics, pharmaceuticals, education and tourism. Agriculture holds enormous significance for the development and food security of both our countries, he added.

The Vice President said that India is one of the largest global manufacturers of generic medicines and with the new Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy, India has the potential to become the largest drug manufacturer and exporter in the world, including in the East European region. Both sides can collaborate for enhancing export of Indian generic drugs to Serbia and this enhance availability of quality medicines to the people at affordable prices, he added.

The Vice President noted with great appreciation the growing interest and increasing popularity of Indian culture, especially in Yoga, Ayurveda and Homeopathy in Serbia. Signing of agreement on cooperation in the fields of culture, sports, youth and mass media signed between the two countries earlier this year was an important step to further promote cultural interaction between the two countries, he added. 

The Vice President said that Terrorism is the most serious global threat in today’s world. He further said that this can only be defeated by coordinated international action. There is an urgent need to expedite the finalization of the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, mooted by India in 1996, he added.

Following is the text of Vice President's Press Statement:

""It is my first visit to this beautiful country. The country is not only beautiful but the people also seem to be dutiful because in short time under the able leadership they could develop the country as one of the important countries in this part of Europe. I am delighted to visit Serbia on the very first leg of my first trip to Europe in my current capacity.

Earlier I was a minister and political functionary but now after assuming office as the Vice President of India this is my first trip to Europe and that I am starting from Serbia. I thank Hon’ble President Aleksandar Vucic and the people of Serbia for the warm welcome and hospitality extended to me and my fellow delegation members. We were happy to receive President Vucic in India during his visit in January last year in his capacity as the Prime Minister of Serbia.

India and Serbia have historic and special relations as co-founders of the NAM i.e. Non-Aligned Movement. Our relationship is based on mutual trust, mutual understanding and support to each other on issues of core interest.

My visit to Serbia assumes special significance as both our countries are celebrating the 70th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations this year that is very significant. I am happy that today, Serbia Post and Indian Post have jointly released commemorative stamps on the renowned Serbian scientist and inventor, Nikola Tesla and the great spiritual leader of India, Swami Vivekananda, to celebrate this occasion.

I had extensive discussion with His Excellency President Vucic this morning on all important aspects of our bilateral relationship as well as global and regional issues of common interest to both of our countries. We expressed our commitment to further build on long-standing friendly ties between our two countries.

We agreed to expand the bilateral cooperation especially in the areas of economic and cultural relations. In the area of economic cooperation, both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in the areas of priority such as agriculture, food processing, defence manufacturing, science and technology, information technology, infrastructure, tourism and pharmaceuticals. We expressed satisfaction at the investments made by Indian companies in Serbia especially in sectors of farm equipment like tractors, food processing, and pharmaceuticals.

India and Serbia are on the path of economic reforms to realize the goal of socio-economic development of our people. India as one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, presents opportunities for win-win partnership between Serbian and Indian entrepreneurs in multiple sectors to realize the vast potential of our bilateral relationship.

Your Excellency, I welcome the signing of two agreements during this visit. The Agreement on cooperation in Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine would contribute to increasing bilateral trade in agricultural products. The Air Services Agreement would boost trade and tourism by launch of direct air connectivity between India to Serbia in future.

We conveyed our mutual satisfaction at the growing cultural cooperation and people-to-people relations between both the two countries. I thanked President Vucic for Serbia’s unilateral decision to waive visa for short visits by Indians travelling to Serbia. India has also extended e-Visa facility to Serbian nationals. Our initiatives would further promote tourism and greater people- to-people contact.

In our discussions today, we also exchanged views on multilateral issues and agreed to intensify cooperation in the areas of mutual interest. India and Serbia have had close cooperation at the United Nations and other multilateral fora. We agreed that United Nations need to be reformed to reflect the realities of today and address current global challenges, it is long overdue.

We resolved to fight the scourge of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and agreed to strengthen cooperation in fight against terrorism at various international fora. It is a global challenge and requires a global response. Terror has no religion. Terroism is enemy of humanity. We must all come together. I am happy that both of us agreed to move in the direction of creating the needed public opinion.

I will also meet the Hon’ble Speaker of Serbian National Assembly, H.E. Ms. Gojkovic and Prime Minister, H.E. Ms. Brnabic. I would have the honour to address the Special session of the National Assembly of Serbia. President Vucic and I will together attend the India- Serbia Business Forum and have opportunity to meet the business representatives of both the countries just after this event.

I would once again like to thank Hon’ble President Vucic for the warm welcome and gracious hospitality. I also extend warm greetings for the progress and prosperity of the people of Serbia. India looks forward for further closer cooperation with Serbia to further strengthen our traditional bonds of friendship with Serbia and its people.

I have already assured the President that India stands for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Serbia. There is no question of any dilution and deviation of our stand. I am also equally happy that the Hon’ble President has unequivocally publically declared their support to India’s cause in the United Nations and also in the other international forums.

I am thankful to the Hon’ble President and his team and also to the people of Serbia for all the warmth and affection they are showing towards us during our stay. I hope that my two day visit to this part of Europe will be a gateway for further cooperation and deeper understanding between India and European countries starting with Serbia.

Excellency, you have just said that Serbia is a small country. No, may be size wise small but it is tall and has a tall leader also. So I am sure in the coming days Serbia will further grow in height and also join the process of development that is happening everywhere.

The aspirations of the people, I am sure, are being met and then you will take further steps to bring reforms wherever they are needed as our Indian Prime Minister is implementing the reforms. He has the three line advice to everybody i.e. Reform, Perform and Transform, transforming the nation.

I am happy that both our Prime Minister and your good-self Excellency are moving in the direction of transforming the respective nations. Together will be able to transform the conditions for the humanity.

Thank you very much.

Namaskar.

Jai Hind.""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu asked Indians living in Serbia to play a key role in deepening India-Serbia relations. He was interacting with the Indian Community in Belgrade, Serbia on his arrival today. The Minister of State for Finance, Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla, the Ambassador of India to Serbia, Shri Subrata Bhattacharjee and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

 

The Vice President's visit assumes significance as India and Serbia celebrate 70 years of diplomatic ties this year. This is the first high level visit from India to Serbia since the breakup of Yugoslavia in early 1990. 

 

Calling the Indian Diaspora as unofficial ambassadors of India to Serbia, the Vice President asked them to play an important role in deepening India’s relationship with Serbia. You are the face of India in Serbia exemplifying to the people you interact with, the mind and heart of Bharat. You are the valuable human resource for India bringing in new Knowledge, skills and attitudes to accelerate India’s growth, he said.

 

The Vice President said that there is a vast potential in further expanding bilateral economic cooperation. One of the key objectives of his visit to Serbia is to expand the political, economic and cultural relations that tie the two countries together, he added.

 

Talking about cultural ties and people to people contact, the Vice President said that he was impressed to learn about the interest of Serbian people in Indian culture, particularly in Yoga and Ayurveda.

 

The Vice President said that he greatly appreciate the unilateral gesture of Serbian government to abolish visas for Indian nationals to travel to Serbia for short duration. I am sure, you are taking advantage of the e-Visa scheme of India launched in 2015 and further liberalised last year for business, tourism and health purposes, he added.

 

The Vice President also apprised the gathering of the initiatives taken by the Indian Government for the benefit of the Indian Diaspora. He said that India is on the move and is witnessing transformation all spheres with its approach – Reform, Perform and Transform.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asked the Indian diasporas in the USA to convey the timeless, harmonious vision of India to the world and bring the best ideas and practices from the world to India. He was addressing the Indian Community at the Historic Art Institute of Chicago, the place where Swami Vivekananda delivered his speech in 1893, in Chicago, USA today.

The Vice President said that Indians living abroad, have become the spiritual and cultural ambassadors for India. The friendship between India and the United States is based on our shared values of individual liberty, freedom, democracy, pluralism, rule of law, and justice, he added.

The Vice President said that the Indian diasporas also represent one of the strongest and most vibrant Indian diasporas anywhere in the world. Your excellence in various fields including medicine, engineering, business, academia, are a matter of pride to us, he added.

The Vice President said continued connect with India and sharing of best practices, expertise and advice will be extremely helpful in shaping our youth and making them better skilled thus contributing to the overall growth and development.

The Vice President said that India is undergoing transformation at an unprecedented pace and scale. He further said that inclusive development and good governance are essential elements of this endeavour towards imparting a new energy to the country and the economy. You all can be a part of this growth story, he added.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am happy to join all of you at the iconic Art Institute of Chicago. I am also honoured and privileged to have the opportunity of addressing my countrymen from the same stage where Swami Vivekananda delivered his historic speech 125 years ago. 

It was this famous speech which drew the world’s attentions towards India and its rich heritage. He spoke about the antiquity of our culture and civilization including its numerous achievements and remarkable contributions. It was also Swami Vivekananda who propagated the importance of the ancient Indian philosophy of Vedanta and the spirit of universality, tolerance and acceptance that underpins ancient Indian thought.

Swami Vivekananda’s journey to Chicago in the winter of 1893 is also symbolic of the journey that the Hindu philosophical thoughts have made across the World and have brought enlightenment in lands, far and diverse.

I am proud that my fellow countrymen who despite being far away from their land, many of them since generations before, have created a name for India on the world stage and have enhanced its glory and honour.

Swami Vivekananda was among the pioneers who brought the rich philosophical and civilizational ethos of India to the western world and beyond.  Today, Indians living abroad, have become the spiritual and cultural ambassadors for India. We consider the whole world as one family, we say: “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” and for us these are not just words, this is our inherent character, our intrinsic approach rooted in our culture. This is not merely a thought, but also a way of life for us. This is the reason why you would see people who have emigrated from India living in harmony with diverse religious, ethnic and linguistic communities across the world.

I take this opportunity to convey my deep appreciation for the warm greetings from the Governor of Illinois, Mr Bruce Rauner and to the Mayor of Chicago, Mr. Rahm Emanuel. I am also happy to learn that the Delhi-Chicago sister city partnership is continuing in a strong and vibrant manner like the partnership between our countries.

The friendship between India and the United States is based on our shared values of individual liberty, freedom, democracy, pluralism, rule of law, and justice. These ties have witnessed considerable deepening and strengthening in the recent years. Our natural affinity based on shared values has become stronger due to the growth in convergences between our two countries on an increasing number of bilateral and regional issues.

About two decades ago, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee had described India and the U.S. as “natural allies”. Since then we have witnessed the multifaceted development of this relationship, and we can now confidently say that we are not only rapidly realizing the true potential of our strategic partnership, but also working as global partners more closely than ever before.

Our relationship today is broad-based and multi-sectorial. It covers many new areas such as defence, security, energy, science and technology, and civil aviation. Both India and U.S. have worked continuously to bring the relationship to the current level.

India’s emergence as the world’s fastest growing major economy and the revival of economic growth in the US create mutually beneficial opportunities for both countries. Speaking at the Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore in June this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, therefore, stated that “India’s global strategic partnership with the United States has overcome the hesitations of history and continues to deepen across the extraordinary breadth of our relationship. It has assumed new significance in the changing world.”

Earlier this afternoon I addressed the concluding session of the Second World Hindu Congress. I was very happy to see the presence of people from all walks of life from nearly 60 countries.

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to address another large gathering of Indians living in the United States. Both these events were focused on the large Indian Diaspora which has expanded through several centuries of migration and co-existence all over the world.

We in India are extremely proud of this Diaspora, and I am happy that my visit to Chicago involves outreach to our compatriots living abroad. We have a series of programmes and initiatives to strengthen our ties with members of the Indian Diaspora, and my current visit is only a part of the broader efforts in this regard. I understand that many of you present here have travelled from different states in the US to be here at this event, and I would like to thank you all for this kind gesture.

In this distinguished gathering, we have Indians from different walks of life -- businessmen, entrepreneurs, doctors, engineers, professors and students.  Many of you are citizens of the USA but are deeply attached to your country of origin. This is because we are bound by a common thread of goodwill, kinship, and mutual understanding which is inherent to our cultural and spiritual heritage. I am very happy to know that you have preserved your traditions and festivals in this country while assimilating American values and ethics.  I am also very happy to see the way our American friends appreciate and participate in your festivities and cultural events. You have worked hard to bring the peoples of our two countries closer.

You also represent one of the strongest and most vibrant Indian diasporas anywhere in the world. Your excellence in various fields including medicine, engineering, business, academia, are a matter of pride to us.

You contribute not just through your professions but also through your active commitment to political and social discourse. It is heartening to see that many Indian-Americans are playing a positive and influential role in formulating public policy not only in the US Congress, but also at the State and the local level. Through your contributions, you have not only enriched this country but also served as an inspiration for us in India. It has driven us to strive for greater heights and prosperity and the ongoing transformation in India is a reflection of this new found aspiration. In the same way, I am sure that resurgence of India at the global level also gives you a sense of pride and satisfaction.

 

Sisters and brothers,

 

You are aware that India is a young country where about 65% of our population is below the age of 35. This richness of human resource and potential has to be harnessed efficiently to produce the desired results. Your continued connect with India and sharing of best practices, expertise and advice will be extremely helpful in shaping our youth and making them better skilled thus contributing to the overall growth and development.

India is undergoing transformation at an unprecedented pace and scale which goes beyond mere economic development. This comprehensive restructuring and change reflects the aspirations of India’s youth. Inclusive development and good governance are essential elements of this endeavour towards imparting a new energy to the country and the economy.

The World Bank has noted that “India’s growth in recent years has been supported by prudent macroeconomic policy: a new inflation targeting framework, energy subsidy reforms, fiscal consolidation, higher quality of public expenditure and a stable balance of payment situation. In addition, recent policy reforms have helped India improve the business environment, ease inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and improve credit behaviour. India’s long-term growth has become more steady, stable, diversified and resilient.”The IMF, World Economic Forum and other bodies have also been noting the steady growth that India is making on the economic front.

Backed by robust economic growth we are making steady progress towards becoming a 5 trillion-dollar economy and emerge as the third largest consumer market in the world by 2025.  India’s foreign exchange reserves have steadily grown to U.S. $ 400 billion. India has been among the world’s foremost countries attracting green field foreign direct investment.  It is also among the top two emerging markets in terms of FDI confidence index.  India’s rankings have improved from 71 to 40 in the global competitive index of the World Economic Forum.

The most remarkable progress has been registered in the World Bank’s ranking for the Ease of Doing Business, where India has moved up 42 places in just the last three years and is ranked at 100th position. All these indicators reflect the progress that has been made in establishing India as a stable, secure, and attractive destination for business, industry, and investment.

I am here in this iconic building where Swami Vivekananda delivered his memorable speeches. My thoughts go back to his stirring words about India. He had said, “Gifts of political knowledge can be made with the blasts of trumpets and the march of cohorts. Gifts of secular knowledge and social knowledge can be made with fire and sword; but spiritual knowledge can only be given in silence, like the dew that falls unseen and unheard, yet bringing into bloom masses of roses. This has been the gift of India to the world time and again”. Preservation of this great cultural heritage is of paramount importance and I am really pleased that many of you are ensuring that this happens in your homes and communities.

I would like to conclude by saying that there are immense opportunities waiting for you in India. India is changing and the rate of transformation is rapid. There is an extraordinary political commitment and enlightened leadership at all levels that is keen to bring change in people’s lives. You all can be a part of this growth story and accelerate the pace and improve the quality of various initiatives being taken up by the Union Government and the state governments.

The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas which is being organized from 21 to 23 January 2019 at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh would provide a very good opportunity for all of you to come and have a glimpse of the transformative endeavour India is engaged in. We look forward to welcoming you in India for this event.

We hope you would continue to convey the timeless, harmonious vision of India to the world and bring the best ideas and practices from the world to India. 

 

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Swami Vivekananda was an embodiment of Hindu Culture and his messages that are relevant till today reverberate across India. He was addressing the valedictory session of the 2nd World Hindu Conference 2018, in Chicago, USA today, in commemoration of 125th year of Swami Vivekananda’s address at Parliament of the World's Religions in 1893 held in Chicago.

The Vice President said that preserving the invaluable heritage of India is true nationalism and said that with its knowledge and wisdom India could provide honey of wisdom in the bitter world.

The Vice President said that the extraordinary vision of ancient India encapsulates a message that is timeless and eternally relevant because it is holistic, integrated and universal. Whenever the world is faced with the threats of fragmentation, conflict, hatred and irrational prejudices, the Indian voice brings to the world the soothing, inclusive perspectives that have pervaded its cultural world for more than two millennia, he added.

The Vice President said that the Parliament of the World's Religions emerged as a celebration of the rich diversity in religious and cultural beliefs around the world and brought the world together to understand different world views. He further said that it deepened our appreciation of the common quest for peace and harmony that human beings have been engaged in from time immemorial. Swami Vivekananda’s addresses at this Parliament have had an incredibly influential, he added.

The Vice President said that the unequivocal messages of tolerance, acceptance, unity and plurality of love, compassion, service, charity, gender equality, poverty alleviation and protection of the environment that exponents like Swami Vivekananda had spread across the world embody timeless values that are more relevant today than ever before. We should ensure that these values are further reinforced through behavior and action, as Swamiji said, by ‘being’ and ‘becoming’, he added.

Saying that India is also moving on an ambitious reform agenda that seeks to transform people’s lives, the Vice President said that at this juncture, the values we all cherish, as Indians, can be the guideposts for our individual growth and collective advancement.

We have inherited a treasure house of ideas, values and attitudes. In a world of unprecedented changes, we need a sheet anchor and a spiritual compass. India could offer those to the world. In a world that is filled with bitterness, India could provide the honey of wisdom gathered from different flowers by different bees.

The Vice President held a bilateral meeting with the Vice President of Surinam, Mr. Adhin Ashwin on the sidelines of the World Hindu Congress and discussed issues of mutual interest. The Congressmen Mr. Mr. Bill Foster and Mr. Peter Roskam called on the Vice President and shared their appreciation of the progress in Indo-US relationship as well as the common understanding on many issues of contemporary relevance.  

Twelve CEOs of various companies in Chicago met the Vice President and shared their experiences. The Vice President gave an overview of the policies and administrative reforms in India, especially those facilitating ease of doing business.

 

Following is the text of Vice President's address:

 

""I am pleased to be here with all of you at this valedictory session of the second World Hindu Conference. I am very happy that all of you have travelled from different parts of the world from Suriname to Fiji, from Mauritius to Thailand to commemorate the 125th year of Swami Vivekananda’s address in this city.

It was, indeed, a unique event in modern world history that is worth commemorating. It is a moment that is worth celebrating. Not once but many times over.

Organized as a part of the celebration of the voyages of Christopher Columbus around the world, the World’s Parliament of Religions emerged as a celebration of the rich diversity in religious and cultural beliefs around the world.

It brought the world together to understand different world views. It deepened our appreciation of the common quest for peace and harmony that human beings have been engaged in from time immemorial. Swami Vivekananda’s addresses at this Parliament have had an incredibly influential. As Dr. J.H. Barrows, Chairman of the General Committee of the Parliament of Religions said, “Swami Vivekananda exercised a wonderful influence over his audience”. Mr. Merwin-Marie Snell, President of the Scientific section of the Parliament, said that Swami Vivekananda was “beyond question the most popular and influential man in the Parliament”. The grand vision of Indian thinkers found the most eloquent and sublime expression in Swami Vivekananda’s exposition. While the main exposition was showcasing the discover new lands, the Swami’s exposition showcased the discovery of spiritual well springs that have sustained the world over many centuries.

We, in India, feel proud that such a voice that stirred the hearts and minds of the delegates in the conference 125 years ago, still reverberates and strikes a deep resonance in many people across the globe. It does so, in my view because of the extraordinary vision of ancient India that encapsulates a message that seems timeless. It is timeless and eternally relevant because it is holistic, integrated and universal.

It is said of the great Indian epic Ramayana that “as long as mountains stand on this earth and the rivers flow, the story of Ramayana shall continue to be popular”. What is true of the Ramayana is true of the entire treasure house of knowledge that India has given to the world.

Whenever the world is faced with the threats of fragmentation, conflict, hatred and irrational prejudices, the Indian voice brings to the world the soothing, inclusive perspectives that have pervaded its cultural world for more than two millennia.

As Swami Vivekananda said in his inaugural speech at Chicago on September 11, 1893, ours is a country that has “taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance.” India believes “not only in universal toleration but we accept all religions as true.”

Sisters and brothers from around the world,

We have come here to celebrate an event. We have come here to celebrate the remarkable exposition of important facets of the Indian world view. We have had an opportunity to listen to eminent personalities who have dedicated their lives to spread this message. As we come to the conclusion of this three-day conference, I would like to suggest some important aspects of our shared cultural heritage that were articulated so elegantly and emphatically by the great sage of modern India, Swami Vivekananda in his Chicago addresses.

This event is called the World Hindu Congress. But, what exactly is Hinduism? As Dr. Radhakrishan observed, “we find it difficult, if not impossible, to define Hindu religion or even adequately describe it. Unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim any prophet; it does not worship any one God; it does not subscribe to any one dogma; it does not believe in any one philosophic concept; it does not follow any one set of religious rites or performances; in fact, it does not appear to satisfy the narrow traditional features of any religion or creed. It may broadly be described as a way of life and nothing more.”

The question is: what are the essential elements or facets of this “way of life”? Let me outline a few important ones.

First and foremost is the breadth of our vision. For the Hindus, the whole world is a family.  The following verse from the Hitopadesha provides that enlarged, enlightened, all encompassing view.

“Ayam nijah paroveti ganana Laghuchetasam, Udaara Purushaanam tu vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (To consider some of our fellow beings as our own and others as not our own reflects a poor understanding. In contrast, the enlightened persons see the the entire world as one family).

This view emanates from second key principle in Indian thought: World as a manifestation of the divine. The whole world including all the animate and inanimate objects are composed of the same elements and have the same divine energy within them.

The first name out of the thousand names of Lord Vishnu in Vishnu Sahasranamam is “Viswam” (The world). The Hindus believe that the entire universe is a manifestation of God. God lives in each living and non-living entity in this world.

As the Ishavasya Upanishad says, “Ishavasyam idam sarvam, yat kinchit Jagtyam jagat, tena tyaktena bhunjithah maa grudhah kasya svidh dhanam” (The divine principle pervades every atom in this universe. So, enjoy the bliss of being a part of this universe and share the joy of living on this bountiful, beautiful earth with all your fellow beings and other objects without excessive greed and avarice).

When we see the world in this light, we cannot have a world which is fragmented or broken into “narrow domestic walls” as Gurudev Rabindranath had said.

We see everything and every person as divine, to be respected and treated as equal. Democracy and egalitarianism come naturally as corollaries to this world view.

This world view makes us care for our fellow beings and their needs. We also care for the preservation of natural resources and environment. We will create a more sustainable planet. The echoes of this principle are unmistakable in Mahatma Gandhi’s statement that “Nature has enough to meet man’s need but not for his greed”.

The third aspect is tolerance and acceptance of plurality. The Vedic sages had recognized that there are multiple perspectives on many issues. There was therefore no dogma and a singular path. The Rig Veda succinctly states,  “Ekam sat, viprah bahudha vadanti” (The truth is one, the wise men describe it in different ways). As Swami Vivekananda says, “From the high spiritual flights of the Vedanta philosophy, of which the latest discoveries of science seem like echoes, to the low ideas of idolatry with its multifarious mythology, the agnosticism of the Buddhists and the atheism of the   Jains, each and all have a place in Hindu’s religion.”

The fourth aspect is the realization that there is unity in diversity. Swami Vivekananda, in his address, refers to it quite explicitly when he says, “Unity in variety is the plan of nature, and the Hindu has recognized it”. Swami Vivekananda’s exquisite description is worth recalling. He said, “We Hindus accept every religion, praying in the mosque of the Mohammedans, worshipping before the fire of the Zoroastrians, and kneeling before the cross of the Christians, knowing that all the religions from the lowest fetishism, mean so many attempts of the human soul to grasp and realize the infinite, each determined by the conditions of its birth and association, and each of them making a stage of progress. We gather all these flowers and bind them with the twine of love, making a wonderful bouquet of worship”.

The fifth important aspect is the ability to absorb and adapt. Saints and religious reformers like Buddha, Mahavir, Basava, Dhyaneswar and Tukaram, Guru Nanak, Dayanand Saraswati and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu have constantly made Hinduism a dynamic religion with the capability to reform, refine, reinvent its practices.

Sisters and brothers,

I have pointed out some salient aspects of the Hindu world view that Swami Vivekananda had brilliantly elaborated not only in his Chicago addresses but also in his lectures in India and abroad. Swamiji, in one his lectures, says, “Love and charity for the whole human race, that is the test of true religiousness. Religion is realization; not talk, nor doctrine, nor theories, however beautiful they may be. It is being and becoming, not hearing or acknowledging.”

Swami Vivekananda had also focused on possible ways in which India should build on the spiritual strength. It is good to recall what he had said. He was convinced that “the best thermometer to the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women.” He also prioritized “first bread and then religion” and felt that “No amount of politics would be of any avail until the masses in India are once more well educated, well fed, and well cared for.”

I think Hinduism’s unequivocal messages of tolerance, acceptance, unity and plurality of love, compassion, service, charity, gender equality, poverty alleviation and protection of the environment that exponents like Swami Vivekananda had spread across the world embody timeless values that are more relevant today than ever before.

We should ensure that these values are further reinforced through behavior and action, as Swamiji said, by ‘being’ and ‘becoming’.

The organizers of this conference have chosen a good motto “Sumantrite suvikrante” that could provide a good way forward.

This is taken from the Chapter 3 of Mahabharata in which Yudhishthira tells Bheema

“Sumantrite suvikrante sukrute suvicharite

Siddhyantyarthaah mahabaho daivam chatra pradakshinam”

(Whatever task is carried out after wide consultation and careful consideration, with the required competence will achieve the desired outcomes. Gods also will be pleased with this kind of work)

Sisters and brothers,

Hinduism provides a practical and seamless continuum between the inner spiritual world and the outer materialistic world, thus, bringing great harmony between our day-to-day existence and the existential questions we face as modern societies.

The world has embarked on an ambitious and transformative agenda focused on ‘people’, ‘prosperity’, ‘planet’, ’peace’ and ‘partnership’. The sustainable development agenda accepted by all the countries around the world is to “foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies which are free from fear and violence. There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development.”

India is also moving on an ambitious reform agenda that seeks to transform people’s lives.

At this juncture, the values we all cherish, as Indians, can be the guideposts for our individual growth and collective advancement.

Let me recall  what Max Muller, the great Indologist had said:  “If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered over the greatest problems of life, and has found solutions of some of them which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant, I should point to India. And if I were to ask myself from what literature we who have been nurtured almost exclusively on the thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of the Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw the corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more universal, in fact more truly human a life... again I should point to India.”

We have inherited a treasure house of ideas, values and attitudes. In a world of unprecedented changes, we need a sheet anchor and a spiritual compass. India could offer those to the world.

In a world that is filled with bitterness, India could provide the honey of wisdom gathered from different flowers by different bees.

As Swami Vivekananda had said about India: “Her influence has fallen upon the world like that of the gentle dew, unheard and scarcely marked, yet bringing into bloom the fairest flowers of the earth”.

I do hope the delegates from this conference will take inspiration from Swami Vivekananda’s speeches made in this country that shares with India a common commitment to core values and do their best to promote a more inclusive, harmonious world we all want.  I hope the dew drops from our sacred clouds will make the flowers around the world bloom.

Let me conclude, as all Upanishads start and end, with a shanti mantra, a prayer for peace.

Om Bhadram Karnebhih Shrunuyaama Devaah |
Bhadram Pashyema-Akshabhir-Yajatraah |
Sthirair-Angaih-Tussttuvaamsas-Tanuubhih |
Vyashema Devahitam Yad-Aayuh |
Om Shantih, Shanthih, Shanthih

(May we hear good news, may we see good things, may we work together with devotion, steady mind and strong bodies and spend our lives in pursuit of goodness)

Jai Hind!""

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has advised the Indian diaspora not to forget their spiritual and cultural roots and contribute their mite towards building a new and resurgent India. He was addressing the members of 21 Telugu Associations based in USA, in Chicago, USA today. The Ambassador of India to USA, Shri Navtej Sarna and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President asked them to uphold India’s core values and beliefs of sharing, caring and treating the entire world as ‘One Family’ - Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. Pointing out that India is the spiritual capital of the world, he said India was one of the oldest surviving civilizations and recalled the invaluable contribution made by Indians over the centuries in different fields from zero to Yoga.

The Vice President said that never forget or neglect your mother tongue, native village, motherland, parents and the Guru, who is responsible for your success, he told them. Those who want to move ahead in life should never forget their past, he added.

While complimenting the Telugu community for their contribution to the progress of America, the Vice President observed that it was a matter of pride that many Telugus are occupying high positions in different fields.

While accepting and assimilating the best practices from elsewhere in the world, he asked them to always remain rooted to India’s rich cultural heritage and traditions. We need to celebrate our festivals and uphold our customs, he said. At the same time, the Telugus and other Indians in the USA served as a bridge in strengthening the ties between India and America. People-to-people contacts were essential to strengthen the bonds of friendship, he added.

Referring to India’s emergence as the fastest growing economy, he said the world was looking towards India which is moving on the trajectory to become one of the top global economies in the next 10-15 years. “I would like all of you to join in fast-tracking India’s growth story,” he said.

Observing that about 32 million Indians and Persons of Indian Origin were living across the globe, he told the overseas Telugus to always strive to enhance the image of India and Indians. He also appealed to them to adopt villages in their native districts and help in developing them into model villages.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that we should salute the constitution-framers for giving us a constitution that strengthened parliamentary democracy and stood the test of times, even as it evolved through several amendments. He was addressing the gathering after releasing the Book ‘Constitutionalizing India: an Ideational Project’ authored by Shri Bidyut Chakrabarty, here today.

The Vice President said that the providing a glimpse of the fierce debates that took place between liberalism, enlightenment and the Gandhian idea of Swaraj, the author challenges the notion that it is merely a mindless borrowing of constitutional provisions and practices prevalent elsewhere. The book reveals how the ideas with completely different socio-economic roots competed with each other in the making of a Constitution which was acceptable to all, he added.

The Vice President said that even 68 years after it came into force, the Constitution continues to be the guiding light on all matters connected with governance and jurisprudence. He further said that Sardar Patel, who played a key role in drafting the Constitution, wanted a strong centre and a robust, homogenous administration to maintain the unity and integrity of India. He had presented reports on rights of minorities, tribals and Directive principles, among others, to the Constituent Assembly.

The Vice President said that ehe architect of the Indian Constitution Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in his address to the constituent assembly described how magnificently the framers of the constitution accomplished the formidable task in less than three years. Dr. Ambedkar pointed out that constitutions of America, Canada, South Africa and Australia were much smaller than our constitution, he added.

The Vice President recalled the sagacious words of Dr. Ambedkar, which are as relevant today as when he had spoken: “However good a constitution may be, if those who are implementing it are not good, it will prove to be bad. However bad a constitution may be, if those implementing it are good, it will prove to be good”.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“I am delighted to release the book ‘Constitutionalizing India: an ideational project’ authored by Shri Bidyut Chakrabarty.

The 305-page book analyses how the 1950 Constitution of India was made. Contrary to widely held perception that it was a borrowed document, it underlines that Constitution was the culmination of a process in which contrasting ideas converged to evolve an acceptable set of principles for socio-culturally and economically diverse population. 

Providing a glimpse of the fierce debates that took place between liberalism, enlightenment and the Gandhian idea of Swaraj, the author challenges the notion that it is merely a mindless borrowing of constitutional provisions and practices prevalent elsewhere. The book reveals how the ideas with completely different socio-economic roots competed with each other in the making of a Constitution which was acceptable to all.

The book is about the processes and events leading to constitutionalize India in the wake of the British rule. This is also about a journey in which multiple politico-ideological viewpoints were articulated and hotly debated before they gained salience.

The author points out that the making of the Constitution by the Constituent Assembly over a period of less than three years was reflective of the efforts of the founding fathers to translate the nationalist and democratic aspirations of an independent polity following decolonization.

He also observes that there can be no greater evidence of the commitment to constitutionalism and rule of law on the part of the founding fathers than the Constitution that they framed despite serious difficulties due to partition. The commitment to liberal democratic values, as the Constitution Assembly proceedings suggest, remained paramount in the making of the Constitution.

Our founding fathers, undoubtedly gave us, one of the best Constitutions in the world, although it had adopted principles from different countries, including France, USSR and Ireland. Displaying foresight, vision and a flexible approach, they accommodated various viewpoints and made it adaptable to Indian situation.

The author says “The founding fathers practiced, as it has been appropriately suggested, ‘the art of the possible and never allowed (their ideological cause) to blind them to reality’. Being most pragmatic, the framers thus prepared a constitution to act as a guardian on the basis of their understanding of the fundamental ethos of liberal constitutionalism. In articulating their choice, they made a simple and yet radical choice. They decided to trust the people”.

In view of the claim that the Constitution was a culmination of long-drawn processes of socio-economic and political churning over almost two centuries, the book offers a conceptual point by suggesting that three major ideological forces—colonialism, nationalism and democracy seem to have been critical in the shaping of constitutionalism in India.

Even 68 years after it came into force, the Constitution continues to be the guiding light on all matters connected with governance and jurisprudence. We should salute the constitution-framers for giving us a constitution that strengthened parliamentary democracy and stood the test of times, even as it evolved through several amendments.

Sardar Patel, who played a key role in drafting the Constitution, wanted a strong centre and a robust, homogenous administration to maintain the unity and integrity of India. He had presented reports on rights of minorities, tribals and Directive principles, among others, to the Constituent Assembly.

The architect of the Indian Constitution Dr B R Ambedkar in his address to the constituent assembly described how magnificently the framers of the constitution accomplished the formidable task in less than three years. He pointed out that constitutions of America, Canada, South Africa and Australia were much smaller than our constitution.

He had said, our constitution contains 395 articles while the American has just seven articles, the Canadian had 147, Australian 128 and South African 153 sections. He had also mentioned that while the makers of the Constitutions of America, Canada, Australia and South Africa did not face problems of amendments, the Constituent Assembly had to deal with as many as 2,473 amendments.

In his eloquent and erudite speech, Dr. Ambedkar touched upon various aspects and observed that to maintain democracy we must hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives. He had said that there was no justification for unconstitutional methods where constitutional methods were open.

The sanctity of our Constitution, a living document, should be upheld by everybody, especially those occupying constitutional posts. Otherwise, we will be doing a disservice to the people and the country and betraying the trust and faith of the founding fathers.

Before I conclude, I would like to recall the sagacious words of Dr. Ambedkar, which are as relevant today as when he had spoken: “ However good a constitution may be, if those who are implementing it are not good, it will prove to be bad. However bad a constitution may be, if those implementing it are good, it will prove to be good”.

JAI HIND!”

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Teachers are the key Architects of National Development and the basic education must be in mother tongue. He was addressing the gathering after presenting the Presents National Awards to Teachers 2017 on the occasion of Teachers Day, here today. The Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Prakash Javadekar, the Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Shri Upendra Kushwaha and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

The Vice President said that it is because of teachers like you that our system of education is moving steadily towards greater heights of excellence. In recognising your outstanding contribution the government has not only recognised you as individuals but has also show cased what can be actually achieved with competence, commitment and collaboration, he added.

The Vice President said that the countries of the world had recognized India as a world teacher or Vishwa Guru.  He further said that in many ways this stream of intellectual pursuits and knowledge creation has continued over the last two millennia. However, there are persistent challenges in providing good quality education for all children, youth and adults, he added.

The Vice President said that the societal mind set and attitude must change. He further said that we have to create an ethos that values learning, an ethos that gives respect to teachers. It has been said that “values are caught and  that they can rarely be taught” which means the teachers must ensure through their behaviour, through their communication with students and in the way the classes are organised that values of equality, democracy, peace and  working together become an integral part of the school ethos, he added.  

The Vice President said that in international studies of effective schooling, it has been found that an important contributory factor for creating high performing systems, like in countries like Finland for instance, is the respect that the society accords to its teachers. He further said that all these principles emanate from our ancient Indian heritage which views education as integrated development of all faculties. As Swami Vivekananda said, “We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded and by which one can stand on one’s own feet”, he added.

The Vice President said that the teachers must make their instruction learner-friendly and this essentially implies that if we have to universalise quality education the teachers must individualise learning. They must know each child well and respond to the learning needs of each and every child in the classroom, he added.

The Vice President said that experiential learning or learning by doing is one the most effective methods. As Confucius had said, “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand”. He further said that the teachers should make students learn through activities and this is the basic principle which has been detailed by educationists like Gurudev Tagore, Shri Aurobindo and Mahatma Gandhiji. Gandhiji had evolved a comprehensive, integrated vision of education called ‘Nayee Taaleem’ which relied on learning by doing, he added.

The Vice President presented National Awards for Teachers 2017 to 45 teachers selected from all over the country.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address:

“It gives me immense pleasure to be with all of you today to celebrate the teachers day by acknowledging the outstanding work of a number of teachers across the country who are shaping the destiny of our nation.

I congratulate the 45 teachers selected to receive the National Awards.  I commend each one of the award winners for their for their dedication, commitment and extraordinary initiatives taken to improve the quality of education in our classrooms.

I am really pleased to go through the citations of these teachers who have made dramatic improvements in their respective schools by involving the community, improving the infrastructure, making learning a joyful experience for children and innovating through development of new teaching learning materials. I was very happy to note that many of the award winners have developed mobile apps and videos to make instruction joyful and child-friendly.

Many of the award winners have ensured that the dropouts from the school system come back to schools and create a congenial learning environment for each child. 

Dear award winners,

Some of you have also taken a lead in mobilising the parents and the communities to support your efforts for national programmes like Swachh Bharat.  In my view each one of you stands as a shining beacon of hope and tireless quest for excellence.

It is because of teachers like you that our system of education is moving steadily towards greater heights of excellence. In recognising your outstanding contribution the government has not only recognised you as individuals but has also show cased what can be actually achieved with competence, commitment and collaboration.

India today is at an interesting point in its history. Over 65% of its population is under 35 years of age.  Ours is a young India- an India that is dreaming of a new future.  It’s an India that has more than a billion dreams. And those dreams can be realized only if we can educate and empower children and youth. The transition from dreams to achievement can made only if we transform our society into a learning society and a knowledge economy. The key architects of this vital leap forward are the teachers.

Sisters and brothers,

In our country we have valued learning and teaching from time immemorial. We have a grand heritage of pioneering thinkers, philosophers, mathematicians, scientists, astronomers, metallurgists and a host of path breaking innovators.

The countries of the world had recognized India as a world teacher or Vishwa Guru.  In many ways this stream of intellectual pursuits and knowledge creation has continued over the last two millennia.

However, there are persistent challenges in providing good quality education for all children, youth and adults.

There is a significant segment of our population, mainly comprising of girls and women, which cannot read and write.  One third of the total illiterate population in the world resides in our country.

While we have made rapid progress in enhancing access to education, we have still to make enough progress on equity and quality.

The National Achievement Surveys indicate that on an average only half of the children in schools are learning as well as they should.  Barring a few institutions like the Indian Institute of Science, IITs and IIMs and a few private institutions the general level of learning outcomes is quite low. While there are many factors which are responsible for this sub-optimal efficiency in the system, it is clear that that the only remedy is to upgrade the professional competence of teachers.

It is the teachers’ competence, confidence and commitment that can make a real difference.

I am aware of a number of programmes taken up by the Government including Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, BetiBachao-BetiPadhao, Khelo India, Swach Bharat-SwachVidyalaya, and Sabko Shiksha Achchi Shiksha.  All these initiatives are steps in the right direction. However, like all social sector programmes, ‘quality education for all’ must become a societal mission not a mere governmental programme.

Sisters and brothers,

The societal mind set and attitude must change. We have to create an ethos that values learning, an ethos that gives respect to teachers. In international studies of effective schooling, it has been found that an important contributory factor for creating high performing systems, like in countries like Finland for instance, is the respect that the society accords to its teachers. India has traditionally been giving the primacy of place to teachers. This societal norm needs further strengthening both in letter and spirit.

What is the type of education we want and how do we define and measure quality? These are important and crucial questions before the country. Answers have to be found through consultations and by drawing lessons from good practices within and outside the country. I recall what Dr. S. Radhakrishnan had said “Education should be imparted with a view to the type of society that we wish to build.  We are working for a modern democracy built on the values of human dignity and equality.  These are only ideals: we should make them living forces.  Our vision of the future should include these great principles”.

The teachers are the key architects of national development. They lay the foundations of a vibrant nation through their knowledge, attitude, behaviour and their ability to create the right conditions for learning.

What constitutes excellence in teaching?  We have a vision of some of our foremost educators who have given us some pointers.

As Dr. Radhakrishnan had said;“true teachers are those who help us think for ourselves”. In a similar vein, Shri Aurobindo has said “The teacher is not an instructor or task-master, he is a helper and a guide. His business is to suggest and not to impose. He does not actually train the pupil’s mind, he only shows him how to perfect his instruments of knowledge and helps and encourages him in the process. He does not impart knowledge to him, he shows him how to acquire knowledge for himself.” Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, a great pioneer of Indian education, had given four fundamental principles for good quality education:naturalism, humanism, internationalism and idealism. He felt that education should be imparted in natural surroundings and an educationalinstitution should not be “a dead cage in which living minds are fed with food that’s artificially prepared. Hand work and arts are the spontaneous over flow of our deeper nature and spiritual significance.” Education, according to these thinkers,  should be child or learner centred. It should be holistic giving equal importance to physical, mental and spiritual aspects of human personality.

Sisters and brothers,

All these principles emanate from our ancient Indian heritage which views education as integrated development of all faculties. As Swami Vivekananda said, “We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded and by whichone can stand on one’s own feet”.

The sages of ancient India saw education as a great liberating force that enlarges our vision, makes us more humane, tolerant, empathetic and peaceful. The teachers must aim at not only imparting of knowledge and skills at a high level of proficiency but ensure that values are embedded in the teaching learning process.  It has been said that “values are caught and  that they can rarely be taught” which means the teachers must ensure through their behaviour, through their communication with students and in the way the classes are organised that values of equality, democracy, peace and  working together become an integral part of the school ethos. 

The teachers must make their instruction learner-friendly. This essentially implies that if we have to universalise quality education the teachers must individualise learning. They must know each child well and  respond to the learning needs of each and every child in the classroom. Children have different learning styles and teachers have to adopt different teaching methods to maximize learning. Certainly, experiential learning or learning by doing is one the most effective methods. As Confucius had said, “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand” The teachers should make students learn through activities. This is the basic principle which has been detailed by educationists like Gurudev Tagore, Shri Aurobindo and Mahatma Gandhiji.  Gandhiji had,in fact, evolved a comprehensive, integrated vision of education called ‘Nayee Taaleem’ which relied on learning by doing.

If we have to transform our education system to a high performing one, the teachers must move on from being merely ‘teachers’ to become ‘instructional leaders’ and eventually don the mantle of the mentor, guide and facilitator-  a role expected of a Guru. To make this happen the teachers should become lifelong learners by drawing from best practices within and outside India. As Dr. Radhakrishnan said “when we think we know, we cease to learn.” In education there is probably no full stop. There are  only commas and semi colons. The teachers must constantly seek new ways of improving their own professional competencies.

We had institutions of learning that earned us the honour of being the world’s guru. We have a long illustrious list of gurus and eminent pace setters in diverse fields. You are all heirs to this rich Guru parampara or the lineage.

I do hope that today’s award winners will be able to carry forward this bright torch of knowledge and motivate many other teachers across the country to excel like you.  You have shown that change is possible.

Swami Vivekananda echoed the Upanishadic call when he said, “Rise up, wake up and keep learning till you reach the acme of perfection”.

All of you in this hall today and those teachers in all educational institutions spread across our country have a sacred mission- to transform our country’s classrooms into centres of instructional excellence. It is an opportunity that comes only to a select few. It is a mission that has a lasting impact on young minds and hearts which are going to shape our country’s destiny in the years to come.

I wish you all a very joyful, fulfilling professional life in the pursuit of this mission.

As the Vedic sages in one of the benedictory lines have said,

“Subhasthinahasantu” (May you take the path that is auspicious)

Jaihind!”

                The Vice President of India and Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today urged all the political parties to evolve a code of conduct for MPs and MLAs both within and outside the Houses for effective functioning of legislatures to restore the confidence of the people in parliamentary institutions. He also urged the parties to come together, transcending political considerations, on issues of national importance. 

Shri Naidu voiced concern about the functioning of legislators in the country after release of a book titled “Moving On…Moving Forward: A Year in Office” on his first year as Vice President, by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi here today. Shri Naidu described the book as a report to the people on his mission and it’s outcomes during the year since he was sworn in as Vice President on August 11 last year. 

Shri Naidu said “While there is cause for a great deal of celebration in the way Indian economy is shaping up and how India’s standing in the comity of nations has been steadily going up, I am a little unhappy that our Parliament Is not functioning as it should”. 

He suggested five reforms to improve the functioning of Parliament and State legislatures. These include; Code of conduct for legislators both within and outside the Houses, Legislators to resign before changing party and Anti-defection cases to be decided in three months time, Election petitions and criminal cases against political leaders to be decided quickly by special benches of higher courts, A national policy to ensure consistency in having upper houses in States and Cleansing of polity. 

Shri Naidu also urged political parties to consider issues concerning women dispassionately to ensure their safety and dignity and by ending discrimination against women on the basis of religion and other factors. He called for reservation for women in all spheres including in legislatures. 

Stressing that agriculture is the basic culture of the country, the Vice President called for a clear bias towards farmers in resource allocation to ensure remunerative farming and a robust food security. 

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi described Shri Naidu as a person ‘’ driven by a holistic vision aimed at improving the lot of common man”. He recalled that when former Prime Minister late Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee was keen to offer to Shri Naidu an important portfolio,  Shri Naidu,  unusually requested to be given the Ministry of Rural Development. Shri Modi noted that the Prime Minister’s Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) launched by Shri Naidu became hugely popular among the MPs, given the importance of rural roads.

Referring to the 50 years of public life of Shri Naidu, Prime Minister said Shri Naidu has set high standards of discipline, commitment and passion to do justice to any responsibility given to him which is the secret of Shri Naidu’s success. Shri Modi further said that while many compliment Shri Naidu for his energy and dynamism, he himself was surprised to see how Shri Naidu is restraining all that while presiding over the Upper House. Referring to Shri Naidu’s punctuality and discipline, Shri Modi said he used to be on alert whenever he was required to travel with Shri Naidu in the past. Prime Minister also said that Shri Naidu learned a lot during his long years of public life and also made others learn a lot. 

The Former Prime Minister, Shri H.D. Deve Gowda said that running the legislatures these days has become a lot more complicated and Shri Venkaiah Naidu was doing his best in running the Rajya Sabha by protecting the interests of all sections of the House. 

Another former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh said “Shri Naidu has enormous political and administrative experience and it was amply reflected during his first year in office”. He said that the four themes that Shri Naidu explored during his extensive travels during the last one year through extensive travels could become the national agenda to be pursued. These include; Untapped demographic dividend, An effective eco-system to ensure sustainable and remunerative agriculture, Orienting scientific and research gains to improve quality of life of people and Enhancing public awareness about the country’s rich cultural heritage and harmonious world view.

The Speaker, Lok Sabha, Smt. Sumitra Mahajan said that the book on the first year of Shri Naidu is a chronicle of how a person from humble origins could rise to an exalted position and give effective leadership. She further noted that the book was perhaps inspired by Shri Naidu’s quest for an honest introspection to find out if he was on the right course. 

Recalling his 45 year long association with Shri Naidu, Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitely said “The unique feature of Shri Naidu is he is 24 x 7 x 365 without even a day’s rest and is intensely committed to farmers. He is more guided by heart and so is emotional. His last one year has been an act of balancing protocol and natural tendency. Shri Naidu has been promoting consensus on issues of national importance”. 

Deputy Leader of Congress in Rajya Sabha Shri Anand Sharma was also on the dais at the book release. 

A large number of union Ministers, MPs, MLAs and Mayors, senior serving and retired government officials, diplomats from several countries, officials from armed forces, lawyers, farmers, students, scientists and others attended the event.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today said that lawyers have to play the role of change agents or social engineers to address the socio-economic under-currents and conflicts. 

Addressing the gathering after presenting Tenth Law Teachers Day Awards at a function organized by Society of Indian Law Firms & Menon Institute of Legal Advocacy Training (SILF-MILT), he asked legal practitioners to continuously update their knowledge to capture the subtle nuances of laws and regulations. He said that they have to address a variety of new crimes triggered by the technological advancements and liberalization. The Attorney General of India, Shri K.K. Venugopal, the former Attorney General of India, Shri Mukul Rohatgi, the Member, Law Commission of India, Prof. S. Sivakumar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Urging lawyers to play a much larger role than the conventional roles assigned to them, the Vice President asked them to make people aware of their rights and duties as well as remedies which are available to them. In today’s world, lawyers will have to undertake several roles in society and have to discharge several jobs directly or indirectly connected with law, he added.

Pointing out that new types of cases like anti-dumping and intellectual property violations need holistic knowledge of economics of pricing and market conditions, among others, he said that legal education has to be alive to these problems to address the changing roles of a legal practitioner.

Emphasizing the need to reform and impart quality legal education, the Vice President called for sharpening the competence of legal professionals, ensuring an enabling situation for research and creating legal awareness in the common man. He said that legal education has to instill the significance and relevance of fellow feeling, societal and democratic values in students, apart from ensuring a deep understanding of the Indian culture and ethos.

Observing that every citizen must have the basic understanding of law to carry out routine and ordinary things in life, the Vice President called for change in the quality, content and complexion of legal education.

The Vice President said “I believe that there can be a sort of corporate social responsibility that the legal fraternity can exercise. I am aware of a large segment of lawyers, who are socially committed despite their busy schedules in the courts and other avenues. Can their services be enlisted for giving legal aid to the needy people, who cannot afford to pay huge fees for availing of quality legal services?”, he asked.

Referring to the scant attention paid to Law of Torts in India, he said it protects people who become victims of negligence by another party. In many developed countries like the US, it is an important branch of law. “All of us are aware of how pharmaceutical and tobacco companies have to part with huge damages if negligence is proved in the court of law. May be the time has come for us to invoke such liabilities in the Indian context as well to protect the genuine interests of consumers”, the Vice President said.

 The Vice President gave away one SILF-MILT Best Teacher Award, one SILF-MILT Legal Education Innovation Award, one SILF-MILT Institutional Excellence Award 2018, two SILF-MILT Best Law Student Awards 2018 and five SILF-MILT South Asia Legal Education Excellence Awards 2018.

Following is the text of Vice President’s address: 

“I deem it a privilege to be in the midst of this august gathering of distinguished legal luminaries, legal faculty, practicing lawyers, researchers and law students. 

At the outset, let me compliment two leading legal luminaries who have conceived and instituted this award- Dr Lalit Bhasin, President, Society of Indian Legal Firms, who, I understand, is going to take over as the President, Society of World Law Firms shortly and Prof. NR Madhava Menon, who is a doyen in the field of legal education and the founder director of India’s first National Law School in Bangalore and National Judicial Academy, Bhopal. It is befitting that the SILF instituted the annual awards for law teachers in the name of Prof. N R Madhava Menon, who gave a new direction to legal education through the five year integrated LLB program and the successful establishment of the first ever law university at Bangalore in 1987 (NLSIU).My special compliments to both of them and wish they would continue to contribute immensely to the law and law education. 

Legal education has undergone dramatic transformation in recent times. At the same time, law is not limited to lawyers alone. Its stakeholders are ever increasing.

Basic understanding of law is a must for every citizen. Each one of us needs an understanding of the law to carry out routine and ordinary things in life. This calls for change in the quality, content and complexion of legal education. 

However, our primary focus is on lawyers, no matter how they groom up in life -  a jurist, law enforcer or a practicing lawyer. Legal education should produce lawyers with social vision and commitment. 

Education will have to instill the significance and relevance of fellow feeling, societal and democratic values in students, apart from ensuring a deep understanding of the Indian culture and ethos.

In today’s world, lawyers will have to undertake several roles in society and have to discharge several jobs directly or indirectly connected with law. As policy makers-every legislator has to have a good grounding in law and legal implications. So is the case with administrators, policemen etc. Legal practitioners have to continuously update their knowledge to capture the subtle nuances of laws and regulations, which are continuously unfolding. An equally challenging responsibility is cast on jurists/judges who have to absorb the changing paradigms dictated by technology and ever accumulating new knowledge.

An administrator will feel grossly handicapped without a better insight into the legal framework, in which he or she has to operate. A legal researcher will be hamstrung if his knowledge is not updated on a day to day basis.  Against this backdrop, we have to introspect whether our legal education is keeping pace with the challenges of a modern society? Could we afford a dispensation where quality legal education is accessed by a privileged few denying masses that advantage? 

Law education during the British days was aimed at creating lawyers who could help the lower courts and high courts in the administration of justice. Now, the lawyers have to play the role of change agents or social engineers addressing the socio-economic under currents and conflicts. They have to address a variety of new crimes triggered by the technological advancements and liberalization. New types of cases like anti-dumping, intellectual property violations relating to  patents, trademark etc need a holistic knowledge of economics of pricing, market conditions, how economic injury is inflicted by cheap imports into the host country, subsidy elements received by the exporters in other countries to undersell products in the importing countries etc. Legal education has to be alive to these problems to address the changing roles of a legal practitioner. 

Let me make it clear I am not a votary of filing of public interest litigations (PILs) at the fall of a hat. But PILs filed in the Supreme Court or High Court for enforcement of fundamental rights are important in ensuring civil rights. That would mean that the lawyers have to play a much larger role than the conventional roles assigned to them. They have to make the people aware of their rights and duties as well as remedies which are available to them when they are exploited. 

Legal education should expand and improve its scope. It is not merely study of law and legislation but study of various procedures of law. There can be three systems for imparting or reforming law education. One is sharpening the professional competence of legal professionals, who handle multitudes of litigations in the courts. The second is an extension of the first and that is creating an enabling situation for research, which is important to carry out course corrections in our legal systems and to evolve new legislations as warranted by time and situations. There are many laws and regulations, which are archaic and have lost the relevance in the modern world. Also, there may be many pieces of legislations that the present world demands such as strong cyber laws, which should ensure security and safety for all sections of people, while they are doing business, or carrying out jobs connected with the government or any other agencies. Their data has to be protected and safeguarded. It is the job of the researchers to study human behavior, comparative laws and regulations in other countries and suggest measures for making our laws address the emerging situations.

The third important aspect is the legal awareness and education that has to be imparted to the common man. We have to make each citizen aware of the laws, procedures and the importance of complying with them in letter and spirit.  This, I believe, should start from the school so that the younger generation gets to know both their rights and duties.

I believe that there can be a sort of corporate social responsibility that the legal fraternity can exercise. I am aware of a large segment of lawyers who are socially committed despite their busy schedules in the courts and in other avenues. Can their services be enlisted for giving legal aid to the needy people, who cannot afford to pay huge fees for availing quality legal services? Can we motivate the brilliant brains in the legal profession to devote a few hours in a week or a month to take up the issues of the common man to get him/her justice in time?

Legal education should be made holistic. In the present world, a lawyer has to handle cases of various nature and implications. For instance, cyber laws and intellectual property violations need a greater understanding of the technology, international laws, trade laws and a number of new areas and legislations. The introduction of five year integrated courses, to some extent, has addressed these issues, but I believe not adequately. It is not merely a base level knowledge that is required for handling such cases in a globalized world. There are many multinational corporations operating in our country. It is a common knowledge that some of them are asking for changing our laws. Our law graduates should have a good grasp of laws in other countries and be able to weigh the pros and cons in an analytical manner. 

The other important area that I want to flag is the wide variance in the quality of law education in India. We have to make serious efforts to impart good quality education. That is possible only when we have good teachers and researchers, whose services can be enlisted by these institutions.  Teaching as a profession should be promoted and made attractive, particularly in the legal domain. There is a feeling that there is reluctance on the part of people to join the teaching profession by abandoning the lucrative income, they get as a practicing professional or by joining law firms. Here, technology can be helpful. There should be facilities for conducting virtual classes, wherein colleges can rope in leading lawyers, jurists and subject specialists to give lectures through virtual media and can be beamed to class rooms. The role of moot courts and competitions among law schools can also greatly help in improving the education across the board. 

An area that has received scant attention in India is the Law of Torts. Law of Torts protects people who become victims of negligence by another party.  In many developed countries like the US, it is an important branch of law.  All of us are aware of how pharmaceutical and tobacco companies have to part with huge damages if negligence is proved in the court of law. May be the time has come for us to invoke such liabilities in Indian context as well to protect the genuine interest of consumers.

Before, I conclude let me congratulate award winners of this year and hope that this would motivate them to work harder and scale greater heights. We must continuously keep raising the bar and strive harder to achieve the ambitious goals we have collectively set for ourselves. 

 Jai Hind!”

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the Mahatma Gandhi Museum in Rajkot. The Museum has been set up at the Alfred High School, which was an important part of the formative years of Mahatma Gandhi. It will help spread awareness about Gandhian culture, values and philosophy. 

The Prime Minister also unveiled a plaque to mark the inauguration of a public housing project of 624 houses. He witnessed the e-Gruh Pravesh of 240 beneficiary families.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said there is so much to learn from Mahatma Gandhi. Gujarat is blessed that this is the land that is so closely associated with Bapu, he added. 

Noting that Bapu was concerned about the environment, the Prime Minister said that inspired by Gandhi Ji, we have to work for a cleaner and greener tomorrow. 

The Prime Minister recalled that Bapu always taught us to think of the last person in the queue, the poorest person, and serve the underprivileged. Inspired by this ideal we are serving the poor, the Prime Minister added. Through our initiatives we want to transform their lives; we want to build homes for the poor, the Prime Minister said. 

It has been over seventy years since Independence, but Bapu's dream of a Swachh Bharat remains unfulfilled, the Prime Minister said. Together, we have to fulfil this dream, the Prime Minister exhorted the people. 

In the last four years we have covered significant ground in the Swachh Bharat Mission but we must continue to do more, the Prime Minister said. 

The Prime Minister later visited the Mahatma Gandhi Museum.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today inaugurated the Mundra LNG terminal, the Anjar-Mundra Pipeline Project and the Palanpur-Pali-Barmer pipeline project, at Anjar. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that the affection he receives in Kutch is unparalleled. He appreciated the development work that has happened in the Kutch region over the last 20 years. 

He said that the inauguration of the LNG terminal is the highlight of today's programme. I am fortunate to have inaugurated three LNG terminals, he added. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that when Gujarat got its first LNG terminal, people were surprised. Now, the State is poised to make a fourth LNG terminal, he added. 

Gujarat is emerging as an LNG hub of India, the Prime Minister said, adding that this should make every Gujarati proud. Asserting that a strong energy sector is needed for the growth of any country, the Prime Minister said that we cannot alleviate poverty if we are energy poor. 

The Prime Minister said that the aspirations of people are rising, and they want i-ways, gas grids, water grids, and optical fibre networks in addition to conventional infrastructure. 

The Prime Minister said that there are ample opportunities in the tourism sector, and the world is keen to come to India. We have seen in Kutch too, how the White Rann has become the cynosure of all eyes from across the world, he added. He spoke of the steps taken by the Union Government to make the aviation sector more affordable and improve connectivity. 

The Prime Minister also spoke of the efforts made to ensure that all villages are electrified, and the work being done towards electrifying every single household in India. We want to bring qualitative changes in the lives of the common citizen of India, he added.

                All the dignitaries present on the stage and my dear brothers and sisters who are present here in large numbers.

How are you? I can see that even this vast pandal is unable to accommodate this overflowing crowd. Several people are standing outside the shade. We all are extremely grateful that you have come here in such large numbers to shower your blessings. Today you have given me the opportunity to inaugurate, launch or lay the foundation stone of projects worth nearly Rs. 1100 crore. I salute and thank all the families of the farmers who are associated with the cooperative movement for this respect and honour shown to me.

Today the identity of the Amul brand is etched in more than 40 countries around the world. I was really surprised when during some of my visits to the other countries, the delegates, the people of Indian origin, as well as some locals asked me to make arrangements for ensuring the supply of Amul products there. Whenever I heard this, I became inflated with pride that the cooperative movement of the farmers and seven decades of ceaseless efforts and hard work has established an identity for Amul within India as well as abroad. Amul has become an inspiration and a necessity. This is not a small achievement but a massive one. It is not only an industry generating products or a milk processing unit but also a model of an alternative economy.

On one hand, there is a socialist economic framework while on the other hand there is a capitalist economic framework; on one hand, the economy is dominated by the government while on the other hand, the economy is in the hands of the private players. The world is familiar with these two types of economy. Great men like Sardar Saheb had sown the seed of a third economic framework where neither the government nor the rich capitalist class will have the dominance over the economy; that is the cooperative movement and the economy will grow with the cooperation of the farmers, the citizens and the public. Everyone will be a part of it.

This is such a model of economy that provides a successful alternative to Socialism and Capitalism. We all are well aware of the fact that the formal form of Amul was ready almost a year before independence, but the cooperative movement was prevalent earlier too.

Probably very few people know that Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel became the Chairman of Ahmedabad Municipality. At that time there was no corporation but Nagarpalika or Municipality. So he won the election from Dariyapur where our Kaushik Bhai used to win. Sardar Saheb won by just one vote and later became the Chairman.

The concept of planning for urban development was introduced for the first time in Gujarat by Sardar Saheb when he was the Chairman of Ahmedabad Municipality. At that time his first experiment was with the Cooperative Housing Society. This was to provide houses to the middle class by constructing houses on the basis of cooperatives. At that time, Sardar Saheb had entrusted the work to one Pritam Rai Desai and the first housing society came up in Gujarat's Vardesh under the leadership and guidance of Sardar Saheb. And Sardar Saheb had inaugurated it on 28th January 1927. While inaugurating, he asked the people to keep in mind that it was a new model of development. Proud with the work done by Pritam Rai Desai, he had named the society Pritam Nagar.

Even today the memory of the first accomplishment of cooperative movement prevails in the form of Pritam Nagar in Ahmedabad. And gradually the trend of cooperatives diffused through every area, especially through Gujarat and Maharashtra. At that time Maharashtra was huge. In the entire area, cooperative was not merely a system, or a concept based on rules and regulations but a tradition etched in the public opinion and as a result of which the people associated with the cooperative movement of Gujarat have set a model for the entire nation.

Ahead of Amul, northern Gujarat made its way in it. Dugdh Sagar dairy and Banas dairy were created. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if we didn't have the people who led the cooperative movement here. Once Gujarat used to be in the grip of drought for 7 out of 10 years but today the scenario has changed. The frequency of drought has reduced. The farmers and the animal herders had to go through a lot of trouble. The milk producing group found a solution to this problem of farmers and subsequently the farmers are able to earn their livelihood by animal husbandry and selling milk even during the periods of drought. And thus their lives went on.

However, later there was a time when a few governments came to power in Gandhinagar who formulated laws that created hindrances to the cooperative movement and dairy industry. Running the dairy industry in Kutch-Saurashtra region became burdensome even as the prevalence of animal husbandry was greater in Kutch-Saurashtra region.

When we got the opportunity to serve the people, we completely transformed the scenario. We encouraged it everywhere. And today I can feel that in almost every district of Gujarat there lies a great opportunity for animal herders, farmers and milk producers. 

There are some people who consider them to be highly erudite and wise but when something that is out of their scope comes their way, their ego prevents them from accepting it. As they don't have the courage to oppose it, they start mocking it and making fun of it which is beyond our imagination.

Such people exist. I clearly remember when we were trying to revive the economy of Kutch after the earthquake and initiating several welfare schemes, inaugurating the White Desert Rannotsav I had said in my speech that – ‘As far as I know, the camel's milk is very nutritious. It will definitely help in our children's development’. I don't know what wrong had the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi had committed that wherever I went, people mocked at me and made indignant comments for talking about camel's milk. Today I am glad that Amul's chocolates made of Camel's milk is in great demand. Just now Ramsingh Bhai was telling me that the rate of camel's milk is double than that of the cow milk.

This is an example of what happens when people are ignorant. When a camel herder in a desert will get such a large market then he will have an assured livelihood. And I am glad that after so many years, Amul has fulfilled my dreams. We have felt the need to take several initiatives for nutrition in our country. 

When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I had taken several initiatives under the Poshan Mission. This is because it has been my conviction that India can be healthy only when our mothers and children are healthy. India can never fall ill.

I am happy that solar energy and the cooperative movement have been synergized here. If crops can grow in the fields, even electricity can be produced from the fields. I congratulate the 11 farmers who joined hands and produced electricity by forming a cooperative and used that electricity in the fields. The surplus electricity is being purchased as per the law of the state government. I was told that this cooperative will have an excess income of Rs.50, 000 annually. In the field of cooperative, the land of Charottar is always geared up to try new experiments. 

The central government has promoted 3 important schemes - one the Jan Dhan Yojana, secondly the Van Dhan Yojana and thirdly the Gobardhan Yojana. Jan Dhan, Van Dhan and Gobardhan. Wealth out of waste - it is possible to get wealth out of animal waste and to generate gas, electricity and fertilizer out of cow dung. I clearly remember that there was an enthusiastic worker close to Dakor Umreth who started with the project of collection of cow dung from 10-12 villages. A gobar gas plant was established and the gas generated was supplied to the nearby villages. Today, the 11 farmers are generating electricity for solar pumps and selling the surplus. Cultivation of crops and solar energy is going on hand in hand. Likewise, separate groups of 11 villages can come together to begin the work of Gobardhan on mission mode.

Today I am here on the soil of Charottar. With the penance of Sardar Saheb and several great personalities in the field of cooperatives, I hope that the work and tradition of this place will help Amul to guide everyone and the Gobardhan Yojana will be Swachh Bharat Mission in true sense. We will get wealth out of waste, clean energy and we will not have to be dependent upon foreign countries for certain products. It will open up a way for the service to the nation. I believe that in the coming days, if the job is taken up by the local people, then it will set a good example for the country.

Amul will complete 75 years after a couple of years and India will celebrate 75 years of independence in the year 2022. I have seen that Amul is unstoppable. Thinking in an innovative manner and doing things differently and with courage is the nature of Amul. I have been associated with the team, its work culture, the professionals, the leaders of the cooperative movement for several years. I have always tried to understand it. They are courageous and habituated to trying out new things. 

Today I have come here to make a request to all the professionals and the leaders of the cooperative movement of Amul. Can Amul set new targets keeping in mind both the years i.e. the year marking 75 years of Amul's foundation and 75 years of Indian independence? We have 2-3 years with us. So can we set new targets and can all of us together give something new to the country and the world?

We are ranked 10th in the world in milk processing. Can Amul set the target of increasing the rank from 10th to 3rd by 75 years of independence? I don't think it is a difficult task.

There was a time when our country was living in scarcity. We were dealing with the problems of scarcity. At that time the processes of decision-making, thinking and working were different. It was imperative for the country to come out of the situation at the earliest. Today the country is not facing the problem of scarcity. Today the challenge before the country is of abundance. Farmers produce such a large quantity of crops that sometimes the price falls; the farmers are at a loss because of abundance.

There was a time when production was very low and we had to import wheat even for consumption. Just like the white revolution, we had a green revolution. The warehouses of food grains had filled up.  Now some of the things we produce are surplus. Processing or value addition is one of the solutions. If the dairy industry was not expanded or new processed products of milk were not made, then probably the farmers would have left milk production; they would have left animal husbandry because it wouldn't have been possible to compete profitably in the market. However, due to this system, the farmer is still enthusiastically associated with milk production.

Similarly, value addition in agricultural products is equally important for us. When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I had attended the Krishi Mahotsav in Anand. So, I happened to meet one of my old friends. I too was surprised to see him. He was wearing coat, trousers and a tie. I asked him - brother, you have changed a lot! What are you doing these days? So he said - there were ‘Sarad’ or ‘Pandra’ here and I made powder of those and sold them; that's how my income grew. This is called value addition. Earlier the fruits used to fall on ground and no one was aware of its nutritional value. But someone identified its value and used it.  There is a lot of strength in agro-products. If tomatoes are produced in surplus, the prices fall and the market for tomatoes comes down. Tomatoes perish within 2-3 days. However, if those tomatoes are processed and ketchup is made and sealed in a nice bottle, it will not perish for several months. It will be sold in the world market. Our farmers too will not incur loss. Just as milk processing has empowered our farmers; we need to push the processing and value addition of agricultural products in the future. Therefore, the central government is working in this direction by strengthening agricultural production in the country under the Kisan Sampada Yojana. 

Once I had told something to the workers of Amreli and Banas Dairies and they had taken the work forward. Probably others too have followed it, but I am not aware of that. I had told them that just like the white revolution, we must start a sweet revolution. And our farmer brothers in the milk cooperative must be trained in beekeeping. Then we can purchase honey along with milk. We can use a similar packaging for honey. Both the Dairies in Amreli and Banas districts are making a huge contribution towards honey production. Honey production in India has increased manifold and is being exported to several countries. Even if a part of the honey is not sold and is consumed within the household, it will benefit the children in their nourishment. No extra effort is required. Even if the field is small, installing a solar panel will help them to earn extra money. Within the same field, if certain tools for beekeeping are installed, this will ensure even greater income. Therefore, in order to double the income of the farmers by 2022 that will mark 75 years of Indian independence, we are trying to add several new initiatives.

I hope that we associate ourselves with it. Earlier I had put forth one thought but was not successful with its implementation. But we can accomplish it. Just as a wonderful job has been done in the direction of take-home ration and the creation of Baal Amul for the nourishment of children, we can do a significant work in the direction of mid-day meals. A big cooking plant can be set up in the villages from where milk is fetched. Whenever a vehicle goes to fetch milk in the morning, it can carry good quality tiffin for mid-day meal for the school students in the nearby schools. The food will be hot cooked and the next day the empty tiffin boxes will be returned along with the containers of milk. This can be carried out without extra transportation cost. The government allocates funds for schools in the areas of milk cooperatives. We just need management.

I want to reassure you that just like the mid-day meal scheme got a shot in the arm by Iskon, our Dairies can also deliver food to these children in the best possible manner under this system. This is am example of multiple utility of a single system. If we formulate schemes keeping this in mind, I can confidently say that we will not remain limited to a few sectors and will create an impact on every area of life.

I have seen that throughout the country there is usually a conflict over pasture land. People encroach upon those lands. But our brothers of Dharmaj had formed cooperative society years ago and developed pastures based on the cooperative. They used to give home delivery of green grass on a daily basis. People would order on the basis of the requirement for their animals and they would make the delivery. And with that income they started the work of modernization and development of the pasture land.

In short, the thoughts of the people here comprise the essence and values of the cooperatives. How we can make the cooperative more broad-based? How can we link it to other things? How shall we work to take it forward?

Once again my best wishes to the Amul family, my progressive sons of the farmers who belong to Charottar while commemorating the great Sardar Vallabh bhai Patel who had developed this amazing tradition and also the people associated with the same tradition of the cooperatives. I dedicate these schemes to Gujarat and to India with a lot of pride. I reassure you on behalf of the Central government that it will never step back in carrying these projects forward. The central government will walk hand in hand and will be a partner in its progress. Thank you all! Say along with me loudly -

Victory to Mother India!

What happened? This is my Charottar. Voice should not be so meek. 

Victory to Mother India!

That's it! Well done!

Thank you!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, inaugurated modern food processing facilities, including Amul’s ultra-modern Chocolate Plant, at Anand today. He also visited the chocolate plant and was briefed on the various technologies used, and products being made there.

Speaking on the occasion, he thanked the people of Anand for turning out in such large numbers.

He said the development projects being inaugurated today augur well for the cooperative sector. He said the brand of Amul is known globally, and has become an inspiration worldwide. He said Amul is not only about milk processing, but an excellent model of empowerment. The Prime Minister said that through cooperatives, Sardar Patel showed a way where neither Government nor industrialists call the shots. He said it is a unique model, where the people matter. He said endeavours in the cooperative sector in Gujarat have helped the people, especially the farmers. He also recalled Sardar Patel's emphasis on urban development.

Referring to India's 75th anniversary of independence in 2022, the Prime Minister said India is doing well in milk processing but can do even better. He said the time has come to give importance to innovation and value addition. In this context he also spoke of the production of honey.

                My dear countrymen, Namaskar. There must be hardly any Indian who doesn’t feel proud of our Armed Forces, our army jawans, our soldiers. Every Indian, irrespective of region, caste, religion, sect or language, is ever eager to express joy and show solidarity with our soldiers. Yesterday, one hundred and twenty-five crore Indians celebrated the ParaakramParva, the festival of Valour. We remembered that surgical strike carried out in 2016, where our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the audacity of a proxy war under the garb of terrorism. At various places in the country, exhibitions have been organised by our Armed Forces in order to apprise the maximum number of citizens, especially the younger generation, of the might we possess; how capable we are and how our soldiers risk their lives to protect us citizens. A day such as ParaakaramPrava reminds our youth of the glorious heritage of our Army. It also inspires us to maintain the unity & integrity of the country. I too participated in a programme held at Jodhpur in the land of the valiant, Rajasthan. It has now been decided that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to whosoever makes an attempt to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our Nation. We staunchly believe in peace; we are committed to taking it forward… but NOT at the cost of compromising our self-respect and sovereignty of our Nation. India has always been resolutely committed to peace. In the two world-wars fought in the 20th century, over a lakh of our soldiers made the Supreme Sacrifice; that too in a war where we were not involved in any way. We have never eyed someone else’s territory maliciously. This in itself was our commitment & dedication towards peace. A few days ago, on the 23rd of September, on the occasion of the centenary of the Battle of Haifa in Israel, we remembered & paid tributes to our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad & Jodhpur Lancers who had freed Haifa from the clutches of oppressors. This too was an act of valour on part of our soldiers on the path to peace. Even today, India is one of the largest contributors to various United Nations Peace Keeping Forces in terms of sending forces personnel. For decades, our brave soldiers wearing blue helmets have played a stellar role in ensuring maintenance of World Peace.

        My dear countrymen, the sky offers the rarest of hues. It is not at all surprising that the Indian Air Force has proved itself to be the cynosure of every citizen’s eye, through the display of sheer might in the skies. It has bestowed upon us a sense of security. One of the notable features eagerly awaited by spectators during the Republic Day Parade is the Flypast comprising the magnificent display of the might of our Air Force through their breath taking aerobatic manoeuvres.

 

We celebrate Air Force Day on the 8th of October. Making a humble beginning in 1932 with six pilots and 19 Airmen, our Air Force has emerged as one of mightiest and the bravest Air Force of the 21st century today. From the core of my heart, I congratulate those Air Warriors and their families who rendered service to the nation. In 1947, when Pakistani attackers resorted to an unprecedented attack, it was indeed our Air Force which ensured that Indian Soldiers and armaments reached the battlefield promptly. The Air Force also retaliated befittingly in 1965 too. Who does not know about the Bangladesh Freedom Struggle of 1971? The Air Force played a very significant role in 1999 by pushing back the intruders and liberating Kargil from their clutches. The Air Force defeated the enemy at Tiger Hill by carrying out air sorties on their positions round the clock. Be it the relief and rescue work or disaster management, our country is indebted to our Air Force for the commendable efforts of our Air Warrior. They have always displayed a unique spirit in times of natural calamities like storms, cyclones, floods and forest fires to extend full assistance to our countrymen. The Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equality and has opened its doors for our daughters of India. Now, the Air Force is offering the option of Permanent Commission to Women besides the Short Service Commission, which I had announced on the 15th of August this year from the Red Fort. 

        Indian can proudly claim that in the armed forces,our Army not only man-power but woman-power too is contributing equally. Women are already empowered and now getting armed too. 

        My dear countrymen, a few days ago, Officer AbhilashTomy of our Navy was struggling between life and death. The whole country was concerned about saving Tomy. You know,  AbhilashTomy is a very courageous, brave soldier. He was the first Indian who set on a global voyage in a small boat without any modern technology. For the last 80 days, he was moving ahead in South Indian Ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race maintaining his speed but suddenly a severe cyclonic storm landed him in trouble. Yet, this brave heart from the Navy kept struggling for many days in mid-ocean. He fought to be afloat without food or drink. He did not accept defeat and continued to fight death. A rare example of courage, determination, strength and bravery – a few days ago I talked to Abhilash over the telephone after he was rescued and brought safely ground. I had met Tomy earlier too Despite having faced such a tough situation; his grit & spirit, his determination to make another similar attempt is an inspiration for our younger generation. I pray for Tomy’s sound health and I am sure that his courage, bravery and resolve to fight and emerge a winner will inspire our younger generation. 

        

        My dear countrymen, every child in our country knows the importance of the 2nd of October for our nation. The 2nd of October, this year, has a special significance. For two years from now on, we are going to organise various programmes throughout the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy has inspired the whole world. 

Everyone including great personalities like Dr. Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela derived strength from Gandhiji’s ideology to be able to fight a long battle to ensure right of equality and dignity for the people. In today’s Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk about another important work of revered Bapu which maximum countrymen should know. In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started penning down a few thoughts in the shape of a constructive Programme. Later, in 1945, when the Freedom Struggle gained momentum, he prepared an amended copy of those ideas. Revered Bapu, put forth his ideas on various subjects like Farmers, villages, securing of labour rights, cleanliness and promoting of education. This is also known as the Gandhi Charter. Revered Babu was a people’s person. Getting connected with people or connecting people with him was Bapu’s special quality, this was in his nature. Everyone has experienced this as a most unique part of his personality. He made everyone feel that he or she was very important and absolutely necessary for the country. His biggest contribution in the Freedom struggle was that he made it an expansive “Jan-Aandolan” (People’s Movement). During the Freedom Struggle people from all sections and all regions dedicated themselves at Mahatma Gandhi’s call. Bapu gave an inspirational mantra to all of us which is known as Gandhiji’s Talisman. In that, Gandhiji had said, “I give you one mantra, whenever you are in doubt or whenever your ego gets over your personality, undergo this test; remember the face of the poorest or the weakest person that you have seen, recall his looks and ask your inner self how useful your intended step would be for that person. Will this, in anyway, benefit him! Will he be able to get some control over his life and destiny through your step ! Meaning thereby that will your step help millions of those people in getting Swaraj who have an empty stomach and a dissatisfied soul! Then, you will see that your doubt is waning away and your ego is also getting quelled. 

My dear countrymen, one of Gandhiji’s mantras is very relevant event today. The swelling middle class of the country, its increasing economic power, increasing purchasing power; can we remember revered Bapu for a moment while going out for shopping! Can we remember that mantra of Bapu!” Can we spare a thought while purchasing anything as to who in my country will be benefitted by this purchase! Whose face will sport a smile! Who will be the fortunate one to get a direct or indirect benefit from your purchase! I will feel much happier if my purchase will benefit the poorest of the poor. Keeping this mantra of Gandhiji in mind while making any purchases during the 150th Anniversary of Gandhiji, we must make it a point to see that our purchase must benefit one of our countrymen and in that too, one who has put in physical labour, who has invested money, who has applied skill must get some benefit. This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I firmly believe that a small step of yours can surely bring about a very big benefit in the life of the poorest and the most underprivileged person.

My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji said that by maintaining cleanliness, freedom will be won then he probably was not aware how this would happen. But this did happen and India got freedom. In the same way today we may feel that even by making a tiny contribution I may be contributing in a big way to help in the economic upliftment and economic empowerment of my country and help fight a battle  against poverty by lending strength to the poor. I feel that this is true patriotism, and a perfect tribute to revered Bapu’s work. For example, think of purchasing Khadi and handloom products on special occasions; this will benefit many weavers. It is said that LalBahadurShastriji used to preserve old and worn out Khadi clothes because some one’s labour could be felt in the making of those clothes. He used to say that all these Khadi clothes have been woven after putting in a hard labour, every thread of these clothes must be utilized. This spirit of attachment towards the country and fellow countrymen was deeply imbibed in that great person of a very short physical stature. Two days later, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji along with respected Bapu’s birth anniversary. The very name of Shastriji evokes a feeling of eternal faith in the hearts of us, Indians. His mild persona always fills every Indian with a sense of pride. 

LalBahadurShastriji had a unique quality in that, he was very humble outwardly but he was rock solid from inside. His slogan “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” is the hall mark of his grand personality. It was the result of his selfless service to the nation that in a brief tenure of about one and a half years he gave to our jawans and farmers the mantra to reach the pinnacle of success.

My dear countrymen, while remembering revered Bapu today, it is quite natural not to skip talking of cleanliness. A movement “Swachhta Hi Sewa” was launched on the 15thof September. Crores of people got connected with this movement and luckily I also got a chance to participate in the voluntary cleanliness shramdaan with the children of Delhi’s Ambedkar School. I went to the school, the foundation of which had been laid by none other than respected Baba Saheb himself. On the 15th of September, people from all sections across the country connected themselves to this voluntary cleaning movement. Institutions also extended their contribution enthusiastically. School children, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organisations, media groups, the corporate world, all of them offered voluntary cleanliness service on a large scale. I heartily congratulate all these cleanliness-loving countrymen for their efforts. Come on, let us listen to a phone call.

Many many thanks, you’ve made a significant remark that cleanliness has a specific meaning in every one’s life and what could be a matter of immense joy for all of us than the fact that a toilet has been built in your house under the “Swachh Bharat Abhiyan” and that, all of you have the facility now. And possibly those connected with this movement may not be able to guess that you cannot see because of your visual challenge. But one understands the difficulties you were facing when there was no toilet and that the construction of this toilet has really proved to be a big boon for you. If you had not made a call about this aspect, perhaps those connected with this cleanliness movement might have also not thought about such a sensitive issue. I specially thank you for your phone call.

My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission or Clean India Mission has become a success story not only in our country but in the whole world and everyone is talking about this movement. This time India is hosting the biggest Sanitation Convention of the world so far, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention. Sanitation Ministers from countries across the world and experts on the subject of sanitation will converge and share their experiments and experiences. Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude on 2nd October, 2018 with the commencement of Bapu’s 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations.

         My dear countrymen, there is a Sanskrit quote-  ‘न्यायमूलं स्वराज्यं स्यात्’(NyayamoolamSwarajyamSyat) meaning justice lies at the root of swaraj and while discussing the subject of justice, the spirit of human rights is inherent in that. This is specially essential for the freedom and peace of the exploited, victimised and deprived people and to ensure justice for them.    

In the Constitution drafted by Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, many provisions were inserted to protect the fundamental rights of the poor. Inspired by his vision, the 'National Human Rights Commission' (NHRC) was formed on 12th October 1993. A few days later NHRC would complete 25 years of its existence.The NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also promoted respect for human dignity over the years. Our most beloved leader, ShriAtalBihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of our country, had clearly said that human rights are not analien concept for us.

In the emblem of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal mantra harking back to Vedic period- ""SarveBhavantuSukhinah"" is inscribed. NHRC has instilled widespread awareness of human rights and has played an important role in preventing their misuse. In its journey of 25 years, it has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence in the countrymen. For a healthy society, and for lofty democratic values I feel that, it is a very hope inspiring event. Today, with NHRC operating at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted. As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and inculcate them into practice - this is the very basis of Sab kaSaath–Sab kaVikas'.

        My dear countrymen, the month of October heralds, Jai Prakash Narayan ji's birth anniversary, the beginning of the birth centenary of RajmataVijayarajeScindiaji. These luminaries have been infusing inspiration in all of us and we offer our heartfelt tributes to them. 31 October happens to be the birth anniversary of Sardar sahib, I shall dwell upon his birth anniversary in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today I want to mention that for the past few years, the occasion of Sardar Sahib’s birth anniversary on October 31 is marked in every small town and district by organizing the 'Run for Unity' race.

Even this year, we should try to organize 'Run for Unity' in our village, town, city or metropolis. This is the best way to remember SardarSaheb, because he worked for the unity of our nation throughout his lifetime. I urge you all that on October 31, through 'Run for Unity', to strengthen our efforts and bind every section of the society as a unified unit. This will be a great tribute to Sardar Sahib.

My dear countrymen, be it Navratri, Durgapuja or Vijayadashmi, I offer all my heartfelt greetings to all of you on account of these holy festivals. Thank you

Today, all of you have gathered here for a meaningful discussion on Academic Leadership on Education for Resurgence. First of all I would like to congratulate all of you for raising these important issues. It is extremely important to discuss and brainstorm these issues for the future India or the New India and it is the need of the hour. When I think of the terms like 'resurgence', the first thing that comes to my mind is the image of Swami Vivekananda ji. Several decades back, it was Swami Vivekananda who had presented the power of India's philosophy before the resurgent world. This was the time when the world had forgotten or rather was made to forget our country's capabilities, contribution, hard work and power. I would like to begin with Swami Vivekananda ji's words. He had said something really important about education that I believe can be the guiding principle for today's summit. Vivekananda has said that we needed a perfect, comprehensive and holistic education that would make us complete human beings. Education is not just the information that has been injected into your minds. We must assimilate the thoughts or ideas in such a way so as to create life, spread humanity and build character. These are Vivekananda ji's ideas. And if I talk of resurgence today, there is nothing beyond this. With the passage of time, a few more things get added to this. But these three tenets are the basic idea. These three elements are the three pillars of education today - building lives, humanity and shaping the character. Inspired by Swami ji's ideas, I am attempting to add another pillar to it because it is the need of the hour; so the fourth one is 'innovation'. Life stops without innovation. No era, time period or system can work without innovation. One of the aims for life to move on is innovation. And life subsides without innovation. Then the systems, ideas, life and traditions - everything becomes burdensome. If we think about reviving our higher education by taking these four aspects into consideration, then we will be able to see the right direction; the direction that will benefit not only the lives of the people but also in nation building and will attend to the society's needs. Moreover, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had explained about this direction of education in that very time period but in a different way. Therefore, he had said that every person takes birth with a goal. Education plays a crucial role in achieving that goal. Extending this topic, I would say that just like the life of a person, an institution or an organization must be born with a definite goal and then there should be a formula in the instrument and practice.

 

Friends,

When it comes to knowledge, school and student, I would like to draw your attention to our nation's glorifying ancient traditions. The base of our culture is the Vedas. You all are aware of the fact that the word 'Veda' has originated from the Sanskrit root 'Vid' that literally means 'book of knowledge'. The word 'Vidya' or knowledge has been derived from 'Vid'. That is, we cannot imagine the society, our country or even our lives without knowledge.

 

Friends,

Knowledge and education cannot be limited to just books. The objective of education must be to ensure a balanced development of every dimension of each person. And you all know that innovation is mandatory for a balanced development. In our ancient universities like Takshashila, Nalanada and Vikramshila, innovation too was emphasized along with knowledge. That is why these universities had produced several great scholars like Acharya Chanakya, Aryabhatta, Panini, Dhanvantari, Charak and Sushruta. Had they been satisfied with only the bookish knowledge, would the world have received the political philosophy, astronomy, surgery, mathematics and grammar? I don't think so. Therefore, when it comes to 'Education for Resurgence', there has to be freshness to the thoughts and the ideas.

 

Brothers and sisters,

The three great personalities of our country had similar views on education and bookish knowledge viz. Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia. They had seen the reflection of character and welfare to the society in education. Baba Saheb Ambedkar had said - a characterless and an impolite educated person is more dangerous than a wild animal. If education of a well-educated person is against the welfare of the poor people, then that person becomes a curse to the society. Character is more significant than education. These are the words of Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Similarly, Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji, having associated social responsibilities to education had said that the society needed to educate each person properly, only then will he be able to fulfil his responsibilities towards the society. His thoughts were not limited to educational institutions; he also emphasized on the modern ideas of the role of society in education and the values imparted by one generation to the next generation. The country's seer Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia ji too used to say that education should be research based. He had said that education should be such that keeps the people, families, society and the nation together. We cannot imagine it this way that one circle is a person, the second circle is the family, the third circle is the society, the fourth circle is the state and the fifth circle is the nation. We are the people who link a person to the family and from the family it keeps on extending in the same stream of thread. We cannot think of a circle in isolation or that one circle is not connected with the other. If two circles are separate then it is impossible for the society to develop and expand ideologically. It is clear from the ideas of these three great thinkers of the country that if there is no objective of education then it is nothing more than a certificate hanging on a pole.

 

Friends,

We need to accept another reality that today no person, nation or society in this world can live in isolation. We need to think on the lines of global citizen and global village. This philosophy is prevalent in our culture since ancient times. When we talk of 'vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' and 'sarve bhavantu Sukhinaha', then this very concept of universal brotherhood or global village becomes a part of this philosophy. Following this vision, the government today is making relentless efforts and innovations to fulfil the objectives of education, connecting it to the society and resolving the issues related to the education sector.

 

Friends,

Today there are about 900 universities and higher educational institutions and also about 40,000 colleges in the country. You can imagine that we have the responsibility for such a great power. If we seek the support of these educational institutions in fighting against these challenges, then situations will completely change. What I mean is that we should work on the philosophy of 'interlink institutions to innovate and incubate'. The interlinking should be such that it connects the society with the institutions and also one institution with the other and overall it must associate with the dreams of the nation. Just imagine the kind of impact it will have, when a 20-22 year old student develops his thought process while studying for his degree keeping in mind the needs of the society. While working on his project, if he even thinks about its benefits for the society, then definitely its outcome will be positive. 

 

Friends,

In case of higher education, we have to provide best quality ideas, best quality ethics, high values ​​and the best behaviour as well as better solutions to the problems of the society. I urge the students while paying attention to their classrooms in colleges and universities; they should also connect with the country's expectations and aspirations. Walking on this path, the central government is striving to involve the educational institutions in fulfilling the needs of the country at every level. Like Javdekar ji was saying, with this vision, we had started Atal Tinkering Labs. Under this the focus is on increasing the inclination on innovation among the school children. So far more than 2000 schools of the country  are having Atal Tinkering Labs  and in the next few months we would increase their numbers to 5000. I, with the help of technology, video conferencing, had interacted with the students from different corners of the country working in these Atal Tinkering Labs. Those students were of 8th, 9th and 10th standards. I didn't feel like leaving that programme. I was supposed to attend many other events after that but I was amazed when these children were showing the experiments and telling me about what they did in the lab. That is, our children have tremendous potential. If they are given the opportunity and allowed to hone their inner strengths, the outcome will be beyond our imagination! We must not force them to do anything; that is the root of all the problems. 

 

Our government is also focusing upon investment in the education sector. For example, we have started the RISE scheme i.e. Revitalising of Infrastructure and Systems in Education on a massive scale. Through this scheme, by 2022 when we will complete 75 years of independence, we have planned to spend about Rs.1 lakh crores. We have also set up HEFA i.e. Higher Education Funding Agency that will provide financial assistance for the formation of higher education institutions. The government has also made a decision to increase the budget for the National Higher Education Campaign by three times. Now Prakash ji was quoting figures but I want to go beyond that. These can prove to be effective steps in strengthening the higher education sector in the states.

 

Brothers and sisters,

In the last four years, several new IITs, IIMs, IISERs and IIITs as well as new central universities have been approved. The government has also brought a new policy, wherein 20 Institutes of Eminence will be set up within the country. Among these, 10 will be from public sector and 10 from the private sector. The aim of this policy is to help these educational institutes find a place among the world's best institutes. We are not so prominent in the top 500 at the global level. We need to change this situation and therefore, the government will spend approximately Rs.1000 crores on every public institution in the next few years. You all must be aware of the scheme Global Initiative for Academic Network i.e. GIAN scheme under which we are inviting the best teachers from all over the world to teach in Indian institutions.

 

Friends,

Our government favours the open flow of ideas in educational institutions. We have initiated this by giving autonomy to institutions like IIMs. I'm surprised this aspect is not being discussed in the country. I don't know why the scholars too are silent. Reforms have been made in IIMs. There are people who have been advocating for reforms for the past 20-25 years. They might not have thought that we would successfully do it with such great vigour. However, after these reforms were made, they were afraid to write good things about it lest the credit goes to Modi.  So they have stopped writing about it. The reforms in IIMs have been such that they are allowed to decide their course, curriculum, appointment of teachers and board members and also decide their expansion. You have freedom to decide; show us what you can do; the government will not interfere; no bureaucrat will interfere. Now it's their responsibility to do it.

 

I believe this is an unprecedented experiment related to higher education in India and we need to extend this to the other institutes in the future. Recently, UGC has formulated Graded Autonomy Regulation whereby the universities and colleges have been granted autonomy. Its objective is not only to improve the level of education but also help them to emerge as the best institutions. Due to the regulation, 60 higher education institutions and universities have received grade autonomy. These also include many state universities. Amidst the efforts of the government, it is also your responsibility to take maximum possible advantage of this positive environment and the dreams must be fulfilled; let this time not be wasted. The most of you have tenure of 4-5 years. While working during these years, you must set some goals for yourselves. You need to think from day one of your tenure about your legacy after the end of your tenure. Several issues need attention that is essential for resurgence at higher education level. And you can make your contribution to develop new styles of teaching. Each day new technology emerges. Keeping pace with time, how can we further strengthen the teaching arrangements with the help of technology? How can we improve the hitherto neglected area of teachers’ training? We all will agree to this one thing that if you ask either the poorest of the poor, peons, drivers, labourers or the richest of the rich about what their dreams are; then one common dream will be to get best education for their children. The rich desires to have best teachers and school for their children; similarly the poorest of the poor desires best educational system for his children. Now this is not possible without a teacher and everyone looks for a good teacher. And therefore, our focus should also be on the fact that how our society can get the best teachers? And we need teachers with missionary zeal. Our institutions produce wonderful CEOs of big companies around the world. We feel extremely proud if someone from a particular institution of our country becomes the CEO of some big industry or business world in some other country. However, I will be happier if a teacher of an Indian institution produces 50 scientists or 50 doctors for the country. I feel this is the greatest need of the hour. If you meet a great writer or listen to a great poet, you will find that even though their thoughts, ideas and words might be personal with the blessings of goddess Saraswati; but one thing is common.  Their creation originates from their experience of life or their compassion towards the society and sometimes from their dreams. These are not merely a combination of words; the emotions and concepts take shapes into words and emerge as a poetic composition or literary piece. In this way, a creative piece of work is born. It might either be written with the pen or typed on a computer, but compassion towards the society is its base. There is an essence of life's experience and only after that the composition comes up. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to know how understanding the circumstances of the society can become a part of the educational system. This is possible only when education also extends beyond the classroom. In ancient times, under the Gurukul system, the students were asked to go and collect wood.  The sons of Kings and monarchs were also students of the Gurukul. It was not difficult for that institution to get wood but even the son of a king was asked to go and get wood so as to instill values and to help gain experience. The aim was to help the students get exposure, face and understand the challenges of the society. Similarly, it is indispensable to extend education beyond the classroom boundaries for the students. They can go to the nearby localities and observe or assess the issue of malnutrition in the nearby slums. Some children do not get sufficient vaccines. Sometimes drugs gradually enter the families of the poor. What are the reasons behind the dropping out of the children who later take the wrong way? Their familiarity with this image of the society is equally important.

 

Just think about it; if the college students visit their nearby slum areas and create awareness about just one thing, it will bring about a sea change. For example, they can tell the children repeatedly- children, don't eat food without washing your hands. This is a small action but will bring about a big change. I am not asking you all to prepare budget, do bidding or reforms or to fill forms. I am just asking you to connect. Awareness campaigns can be innovative and creative. Such campaigns will not only strengthen the lives of the students but also protect the lives of many poor children.

I was in Benares a few days back. It is my Lok Sabha constituency. And I met some youngsters from Kashi University. I am not sure if their Vice Chancellor has ever met them or not but I had got the opportunity to meet them. Those youngsters had started an organization named 'Try to Fight' about 4-5 years ago. It had started with 3-4 boys and now it has grown to a large group with several boys and girls.

These youngsters were concerned about the children who were engaged in rag picking and they felt that these children should be educated. They took time out from their studies and made an effort to take the children to school. They started teaching them working hard. Today in Benares this young institution is engaged in educating more than 1000 poor children. I met those children and those youngsters. Such children are born in the families where the mother is engrossed in her work, the father is busy with his work and the child has its own world. The children are into wrong things. They have managed to pull these children out of it. I saw a beautiful painting of a little girl. She was endowed with this talent by God. They gifted that painting to me and I asked the little girl if anyone from her family draws... But she said 'No,No. I used to do it just like that but when these people came, they brought paper and pens with them and now I am doing it on that’.

See, the students of that University could have formed Union and joined politics or movements but they chose this path and changed the lives of 1000 children. I believe that they not only changed the lives of those thousand children but their own lives changed in a major way as they understood compassion.

 

The more the youngsters associate with such organizations working for the welfare of the society and engage in innovative experiments, the more these poor and deprived children will benefit. Such kinds of work do not require huge budget or financial support but motivate both the college students and the slum children. Both the groups will connect with each other. However, our country is unfortunate in one way. Forgive me and please don't mind. When we were in school our teacher used to ask us to write a note on any social service done by us. Probably you too were asked to do the same. Write about any social service done by you today. And 90 out of the 100 students used to write, I helped a visually impaired person to cross the road. Now see, all the 90 students used to write the same story which means they were getting habituated to write lies and we never even stopped them from doing so. It's a small village, where will you find such heavy traffic and the need to cross a road? This has been the trend and probably is continuing even today.

 

What I mean is that this was a result of lack of innovation. This trend began because they wanted to impart values of social service but later it became a ritual and became lifeless. It was a compulsion to write, fill the page and the teacher didn't have time to read it. The content didn't matter as long as the page was filled.

 

I believe that there is a need for a change. I believe that most of you might be aware that after the formation of this government, I had made another effort. I have a rule that whenever I attend the convocation ceremony of any University, a letter goes from my office to that University saying that I will come but  my 50 special guests will also attend. There must be a special row in the front for accommodating them. This is my usual request. Those 50 guests are the students of the government schools living in the slums of that particular area. They are from classes 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th. I introduce all of them to the audience of that convocation. I want to impart values to those children, and, ‘seeing is believing’! That poor child is just used to seeing the environment of his slum but when he sees the huge campus of the University and the students dressed up like that with the hats and collect their certificates, the seed within him starts growing. He imagines that he too will go to that dais one day and he too will be given certificates. It helps in sowing the seeds of their dreams.

 

It's a small thing. It's not that change comes from a budget. Change comes from the intention; it begins with being associated with a cause and success comes from engaging with it. We must move ahead with this resolution. Therefore, whenever I am with the scholars of the educational sector, I, without fail, emphasize on one thing and that is 'city based excellent centres'. Every institution also has to take up the responsibility of developing an ecosystem of problem-solution to the education sector. And I would like to give you an example of the same.

 

The students can be entrusted with the work of making the people around them digitally literate. They can familiarize the people around them with schemes like Ayushman Bharat, UJALA, Swachh Bharat Mission. They can make their lives easier. The students can teach the people in their localities about water conservation, electricity and environment.

 

The educational institutions can make a list of all such work and can cooperate with each other. I suggest that along with teachers and students even the parents and the alumni can be involved in this work. When education gets linked to this work at every level of the society, you can imagine the level of increase in the youngsters' capabilities and understanding.

 

Brothers and sisters,

The country's youth have brought international recognition for Brand India by their capability. Students passed out of different universities, IITs, IIMs and medical colleges within the country have brought glory to the country abroad. Several of them are running big companies of the world. We all are well acquainted to the fact that the country's youth doesn't lack ideas. I have a belief that if there are millions and millions of problems, there are billions and billions of solutions to the problems.

 

This too is true that every big company of the world today was once a start-up. Keeping that in mind, the government is now running schemes like start-up India, Stand-up India and Skill India. I am also convinced that in the future, our youth will become world leaders in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G technology, block chain and big data analysis. We all know that our country is the largest pool of technical human resources. We are second largest in terms of start-up ecosystem in the world. We are ceaselessly progressing in innovative index.

 

All these conditions are favourable to both the youth and education institutions of our country, and therefore, we all need to work together to develop social sciences and innovative temperament in the youth of the country.

 

Friends,

 

Resurgence is possible only when we all take one step ahead. Moreover, even though there are efforts to eliminate flaws of resurgence through research, but at the same time, we must bring about a change in consistence with the new age.

 

It's not just about eliminating weaknesses. For example, we are sick so we want to be free from the disease. That should not be the case. We must also strive to be healthier. That should be our intention. I urge all the eminent personalities of the education sector to strengthen the foundation of the country for building a New India and to infuse better self-confidence in the country's youth. With this expectation, I once again congratulate you all for this important initiative. With all the debates, discussions and brainstorming, I believe, new things will emerge. I am sure you are those who are associated with the past. You are those who move towards the best future by working hard towards their dreams. Such a group always produces best results.

 

I believe that these thought processes and efforts will definitely produce significant results for the country in the future. With this expectation, I once again congratulate you all for this effort. My best wishes to you all.

 

Thank you!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed a Conference on Academic Leadership on Education for Resurgence, in New Delhi.

He said that when one thinks of resurgence or revival, the first image that comes to mind is of Swami Vivekananda, who presented before the world, the strength of Indian thought. 

The Prime Minister recalled Swami Vivekananda’s emphasis on self-reliance, character building, and human values, as elements of education. The Prime Minister said innovation is another vital element of education today. 

Recalling the ancient Indian texts, the Vedas, the Prime Minister said that we cannot imagine our society, our country, and even our lives, without knowledge. He said that our ancient universities such as Taxila, Nalanda and Vikramshila, gave importance to innovation, besides knowledge. The Prime Minister also recalled the views on education of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Deendayal Upadhyay, and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that today, no country or person can live in isolation. He mentioned the importance of thinking in terms of ‘global citizen’ or ‘global village.’ He said our Universities and Colleges should be leveraged to find solutions to the challenges facing us. We should “Interlink Institutions to Innovate and Incubate”, he added.He urged students to link their classroom learnings to the aspirations of the country. He also mentioned Atal Tinkering Labs which have been set up to encourage children to innovate. He mentioned the RISE – Revitalization of Infrastructure and Systems in Education -programme for improving education infrastructure.He mentioned the steps taken for higher education. 

The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of preparing good teachers for society. He also said that scholars and students can take responsibility for spreading digital literacy, and generating greater awareness of government programmes that can improve ease of living. 

The Prime Minister said that the youth has given “Brand India” a global identity. He mentioned schemes such as Start Up India, Stand Up India and Skill India, which are aimed at nurturing young talent.

This event is being organized jointly by UGC, AICTE, ICSSR, IGNCA, IGNOU, JNU and SGT University.

 

The theme of the Conference is to deliberate on the challenges facing the Indian education system and to work out a plan for a paradigm shift both in terms of achieving academic outcomes and also in regulation of education.

 

The Conference is being inaugurated by Hon’ble Prime Minister at 10.30 AM which will be followed by breakout sessions covering eight thematic areas namely:


	Improving pedagogy for learner centric education – use of artificial intelligence for customized learning
	From job seeking to job creating – improving innovation and entrepreneurship
	Improving quality of research – focus on requirements of India
	Bringing synergy among educational institutions – pooling of academic resources like sharing of libraries and exchange of knowledge
	Building inclusive and integrated campuses – taking up activities which could bring emotional attachments of students to the campus
	Participatory Governance models – facilitating participation of students in governance processes
	Building robust financial models – supplementing Government resources by getting funds from alumni and also from corporate (CSR)
	Promoting value education by building in universal values and life skills into education.


 

The valedictory session will be chaired by Shri Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Human Resource Development in which each of the eight groups will make presentation on the course of action that they have agreed upon. This will be debated further in the Plenary Session and it is expected that a comprehensive action plan would emerge for improving the higher education sector in the country.

                As part of their Valedictory Session as Assistant Secretaries, IAS officers of the 2016 batch today made presentations before the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.  

8 selected presentations were made by the officers, on themes such as raising farm incomes, soil health cards, grievance redressal, citizen-centric services, power sector reform, tourist facilitation, e-auctions, and smart urban development solutions.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister noted that the Assistant Secretaries programme offers the junior-most and senior-most officers the opportunity to interact with each other. The Prime Minister encouraged the young officers to imbibe the best from the experiences that they would have had, during their attachment to various Ministries as part of this programme. He exhorted the young officers to keep in mind the expectations that people have from Government, and to do their best to fulfil those expectations, in whatever positions they serve in, during their career.

The Prime Minister encouraged the officers to develop a connect, with the people around them, and with the people they serve, in course of their duties. He said that developing a close rapport with people, is one of the keys to achieving success in their tasks and objectives.

The Prime Minister appreciated the presentations made by the young officers.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his twenty-ninth interaction through PRAGATI - the ICT-based, multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation.

The Prime Minister reviewed the progress in resolution of grievances related to the telecommunications sector. He was briefed on the progress made in this regard, including the technology interventions made recently. The Prime Minister said that resolution of issues related to the telecom sector should be based on latest technological solutions. He emphasized that service providers must provide a high level of consumer satisfaction.

The 28 PRAGATI meetings so far have seen a cumulative review of projects with a total investment of over Rs. 11.75 lakh crore. Resolution of Public Grievances has also been reviewed across a range of sectors.

Today, in the twenty-ninth meeting, the Prime Minister reviewed the progress of eight important infrastructure projects in the railway, urban development, road, power, and coal sectors. These projects are spread over several states including Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal.

The Prime Minister reviewed the progress made in the working of the Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana, especially in the working of the District Mineral Foundations. Noting that significant resources are now available to several mineral bearing districts, he urged officials, both at the Centre and State level, to ensure that the funds are utilized to bring about a qualitative improvement in the quality of life, and “ease of living” of people in these districts. He also added that this is an opportunity to bring the aspirational districts among these districts, out of their chronic development deficit.

The Prime Minister also conveyed his good wishes for the strengthening of democracy, peace and prosperity in Maldives under the leadership of Mr Solih.

 

Mr Solih thanked the Prime Minister for his greetings and good wishes.

 

The two leaders agreed to work closely together to further strengthen the close, friendly and good neighbourly relations between the two countries.

S.Ahluwalia ji, Speaker of the State Assembly Mr. K. N. Rai ji, Minister in the State Government, Mr. Dorjee Tshering Lepcha ji, all the other dignitaries present here and my dear brothers and sisters.

Friends,

I have been touring East India for the last three days, and during this period, I have had the privilege of dedicating major projects to the nation that are related to the infrastructure and will serve the humanity.

After inaugurating the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) and launching the Ayushman Bharat Mission in Jharkhand yesterday, I arrived at Sikkim yesterday evening. This morning as I woke up to Sikkim's rising sun, cool air, beautiful mountains and the pristine natural beauty, I started clicking pictures. Who wouldn't love its beauty and elegance? Everyone will appreciate it. Nature has given you everything and everyone throngs this place to be a part of it.

Brothers and sisters,

You as well as the entire country are well aware of the significance of the Eastern direction in our traditions and culture. 

The Northeast is particularly of significance. My warm regards to the people of this beautiful Eastern state and I dedicate to you and Sikkim your first Airport - Pakyong Airport.

This day is not only a historic one for you all but also of immense significance for the nation. You will feel proud once the Pakyong airport becomes operational. 

Cricketers score century on the cricket ground and today India has scored a century. After the inauguration of this airport, there are 100 operational airports in the country. In that sense, India has scored a century today. Our country is transforming. Sikkim is known for football. Everyone plays football here but now they are also trying their hands at cricket.

I read in today's newspaper that Sikkim's captain Nilesh Lamichanay had scored a century yesterday. On one hand, Nilesh is the first Sikkimese to score century in cricket, while on the other hand, Sikkim marks the 100th airport of the country.

Brothers and sisters,

This airport will play a pivotal role in making your lives easier. Till today, someone from some other part of the country who wanted to visit Sikkim or other places via Sikkim had to face a lot of trouble. The people of Sikkim and the visitors of Sikkim are well aware of this situation.

Earlier people had to de-board at Bagdogra airport and had to cover a tiring distance of about 125 kilometres on a difficult terrain that took 5-6 hours. Only then, one could reach Gangtok. However, now this Pakyong airport will eliminate this exhausting journey and will reduce the distance to minutes.

Brothers and sisters,

It has definitely made the journey smoother and shorter; at the same time, the government has also tried to ensure that the common man too can commute easily to and fro from here. Therefore, this airport has been linked to the UDAN scheme. Under this scheme, one has to pay about Rs.2500-2600.

Due to the government's efforts and vision, journey by flights have become cheaper like that of the Air-conditioned railway journeys. There is a saying - Time is money. Travelling by flight saves time; therefore it saves money. This is the reason why the country's lakhs of middle class families are now able to travel by flights.

Friends,

The Airport has just been inaugurated. However, within a couple of weeks, regular flights to Guwahati and Kolkata will start. Efforts will also be made to connect it with other parts of the country and with the neighbouring countries as well.

Friends,

The Pakyong airport is not only a symbol of beauty but also of engineering skills. The people who are active on social media must have seen the photos of this airport and of flights landing on the lap of nature. You must have seen those photos. They have gone viral on social media. Even though it has been inaugurated today, but the people have already started hailing it.

This airport that has been constructed with a cost of Rs.550 crores depicts the pride and the ability of the engineers and workers. The hills were carved out, the debris was used to fill the gorges and they had to deal with the challenge of heavy rainfall. The streams passing through this area have been allowed to pass below the airport. Really, it is an extraordinary engineering technique.

Today on this occasion, I would like to congratulate all the engineers and workers associated with the planning and construction for this astounding work. You all have indeed done an incredible job.

Brothers and sisters,

Work for extending both the infrastructural and emotional connectivity to Sikkim and the Northeast is going on at a rapid pace. Over the last four years, I have often interacted with the people of the Northeastern states to seek their blessings and to know about the progress of development work.

Moreover, after every one or a couple of weeks, a Union minister visits one or the other Northeast state and monitors the progress of the work. Thus, you all can clearly see the results of this system on ground today.

 

Several initiatives in the northeastern states like Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Tripura or Mizoram have been taken for the first time since independence. Flights and rail connectivity have reached there for the first time; and even electricity has reached for the first time in some places.

Wider National Highways as well as rural roads are being constructed. Vast bridges are being built over the rivers. Digital India is being expanded. Proceeding with the Mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', our government is working with zest and fervour to minimize regional imbalance and to make the Northeast and the East India the engines of India's growth story. We are committed to it.

With this vision, we expedited the work of handing over the airport to Sikkim. We crossed all the hurdles and now your dream has come true. You are well aware of the fact that about six decades ago, a small flight had taken off from here. Thereafter, for six decades, you had to keep waiting for the airport.

Friends,

Airports have been set up not only in Sikkim but also in other states including Arunachal Pradesh. As I was saying, 100 airports have been operationalized. And you will be surprised to know that 35 of these airports have been constructed only in the last four years.

What is the meaning of working at a fast pace? What does it mean to work in all directions? What does it mean to work with vision? You will understand it with an example. Up to 2014 since independence, that is, in 67 years only 65 airports existed. This means that on an average, 1 airport was constructed every year. Do you understand? 1 airport per year was their speed. This was their way of thinking. During the last four years, 9 airports per year were constructed. The work has been going on at 9 times better speed. They would have taken 40 more years to complete the task that we have done in four years.

Brothers and sisters,

Today India has become the third largest market for domestic flights in the world. The airline companies are short of aircrafts. Orders are being placed for new aircrafts. I want to put forth some more statistics that will again surprise you. In 70 years of Independence, barely 400 aircrafts were operational. Now the airline companies have placed order for 1000 new aircrafts in the last one year; 400 aircrafts in 70 years and 1000 new ones in just one year. This depicts that our dream of enabling the common man to travel by air is getting fulfilled at a rapid pace.

Brothers and sisters,

This airport will not only facilitate you to commute to different parts of the country but will also help to increase your income. Sikkim has always been the hub for domestic and international tourists. The tourist population is greater than its population. I was told that despite not having an airport, the tourist population was 1.5 times the population of the state.

Now that this airport is operational, you will see that the number of tourists will not be limited to this. You will see the rise in the number of tourists in this Diwali and Durga Puja season itself.

The airport will prove to be a gateway of employment for the youngsters of Sikkim. As a result, several opportunities in the form of hotels, motels, guesthouses, camping sites, homestay, tourist guides, restaurants and suchlike will open up. In tourism sector, even the poorest of the poor will earn; small vendors like tea sellers, groundnut sellers and florists will get the opportunity to earn; auto rickshaw drivers and guesthouse owners will also earn. 

Friends,

The government has made transportation and tourism as a medium of transformation. The focus is on religious places and tribal belts. Facilities are being developed in these places for the devotees and tourists. This region is home to the highest peak Kanchenjunga as well as the Nathu La pass that has been opened up by our government for Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.

More than Rs.40 crores has been approved to develop all the facilities for the devotees here. Efforts are being made by collaborating with the state government to keep Sikkim's environment safe and green.

Under the National River Conservation Plan, the central government has approved more than Rs.350 crores. Under this, 8 out of 9 projects are for Gangtok and Singtham. Projects worth approximately Rs. 150 crores are for protecting Rani chu river from getting polluted. Besides, for protecting the environment of the entire Northeast, about Rs.125 crores have been approved of which more than Rs.50 crores have already been released.

Friends,

There is a close connection between environment, transport and tourism. Therefore, the emphasis is not just on air connectivity, but also on the other means that are being strengthened. Work on the National Highway project worth more than Rs.1500 crores is also underway. Besides, small roads are being constructed and widened at a cost of Rs.250 crores.

Along with the roads, the railway of Sikkim is also being strengthened. The work of connecting Gangtok with broad-gauge line is going on at a rapid pace.

Aid of more than Rs.1500 crores has been given to the state government to improve the electricity supply system and repairing the transmission lines. I was told that efforts are going on to finish this work by December this year.

Besides, we are also moving towards including Sikkim among the country's leading states in terms of electricity generation. Work on 6 hydroelectric power projects at a cost of about Rs. 14 thousand crores is underway.

Brothers and sisters,

I would like to congratulate the people of Sikkim, the government of Sikkim and especially the farmers here for setting an example for the country by adopting organic farming. Sikkim is the first state to become 100% organic farming state.

The government is making several efforts to promote organic farming across the country. Work is in progress under the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana. Not only organic farming but value addition and market system is also being developed. Today this airport has been started for the passengers but the day is not far when fruits and flowers from here will reach the markets of Delhi within hours.

Flowers produced by the farmers of Sikkim will reach at the feet of several gods and goddess in India. The governments in the northeastern states have also started a special scheme named Mission Organic Value Development for Northeastern Region. A provision of Rs.400 crores has been made for this.

Friends,

Organic products are not only safe for our environment and the earth but also keep us away from diseases. The government's topmost priority is ensuring good health of the citizens. The Chief Minister was telling me that there has been a discernable result in the last 10 years due to the success of organic farming and products; the life expectancy of the people has been increasing. The life expectancy of the people has been increasing rapidly and the life expectancy of women is increasing more than that of men. I believe that the others will also learn from Sikkim, get rid of chemical fertilizers and lead a healthy and happy life.

As per the information that I have, the people of Sikkim have embraced and promoted the objectives of 'Swachhta Hi Seva'. In 2016, Sikkim was the first state to be declared Open Defecation Free due to the efforts and awareness of all of you. Moreover, you all have done a commendable job in elimination of plastic wastes. 

Brothers and sisters,

As I was saying, yesterday, the largest healthcare scheme in the country was started in the form of Ayushman Bharat and Sikkim too is associated with it. Now, the government will spend up to Rs.5 lakhs per poor family of Sikkim per year for the treatment of serious diseases. If a person here visits any part of the country and requires treatment from hospital, he will receive the money even at that place. The protective cover of Ayushman Bharat will follow the patient everywhere he goes.

Friends,

The government has been running several schemes over the last four years to elevate the standard of living of the people and Sikkim too is deriving benefits out of it. Under Jan Dhan Yojana, bank accounts of about 1 lakh people have been opened in Sikkim. Nearly 80 thousand brothers and sisters here have been covered under the insurance schemes with a premium of Re.1 per month and 90 paise daily.

Under the Ujjwala scheme, about 38 thousand poor families were given free gas connections for their kitchens.

Friends,

The NDA government is moving ahead with commitment of making the lives of the people of East India and Northeast India easier and to ensure ease of living. We wish to connect this area with the new era of development and want to build a new pivot of New India.

This Airport will help in development of several new facilities that will take Sikkim to new heights. I once again congratulate you all from the bottom of my heart for your first airport.

The Chief Minister has mentioned about several issues and both of us keep discussing about these issues. Therefore, I feel it is not necessary to publicly talk about those. However, I want to reassure you that if we want to take our nation to greater heights, it is pertinent to carry Sikkim forward. Hence, every kind of effort will be made to fulfil the dreams of every community, individual and youngster of Sikkim.

With this belief, once again I offer my best wishes and congratulations to you all.

Thank you!

                Governor of Jharkhand Smt. Draupadi Murmu Ji, the zealous and popular Chief Minister of the state, Mr. Raghubar Das, my Cabinet colleague Mr. Jagat Prasad Nadda ji, my cabinet colleague and the son of the soil Mr. Sudarshan Bhagat Ji, my colleague in the central government Mr. Jayant Sinha ji, member of the NITI Ayog, Dr. V.K. Paul, Minister in the State Government Ramchandra Chandravanshi, my colleague in Parliament Mr. Ram Tahal Choudhary ji, MLA Mr.Ram Kumar Pahan ji, all the dignitaries present here and my dear brothers and sisters of Jharkhand who are present here in large numbers.

Friends,

Today, we all are witnessing this special occasion that will prove to be a great service to humanity in the future. Today I have come here to not only give impetus to Jharkhand's development but also to fulfil the age-old dreams of the sages of India and of every family in India - 'Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinaha Sarve Santu Niramayaha'. We need to fulfil this age-old resolution in this century and we are giving it a valuable start.

Today this important step of accomplishing the dream of ensuring better medical facilities and treatment to the poorest of the poor is being taken from the land of Birsa Munda.

Today the entire country is watching Ranchi. Similar events have been organized in more than 400 districts of the country and from there everyone is watching this grand ceremony of Ranchi. Thereafter, they will carry this programme forward in their respective districts.

Today I also got the opportunity to inaugurate two new medical colleges here. Our Chief Minister was telling me that there were only 3 medical colleges with 350 students in 70 years since Independence; while 8 medical colleges with 1200 students came up in just 4 years. I don’t think we need to look for a better example of how work is done at a wide scale and at an unprecedented speed. 

Brothers and sisters,

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana - PMJAY with the resolution of Ayushman Bharat will be implemented from today. Every person is naming this scheme according to his imagination. Some people are calling it 'Modicare' while others are calling it a pro-poor scheme. People are naming it in different ways but for me it is a great opportunity to serve the poor people of our country. I believe that there cannot be a greater scheme or a campaign than this one to serve the poor.

It is the world's largest scheme that aims at providing health assurance of up to five lakh rupees to more than 50 crore brothers and sisters of the country. Such a huge government scheme is not operating in any country of the world.

It is difficult to imagine the number of beneficiaries of this scheme right now. The beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat are equivalent to the population of entire European Union comprising 27-28 countries.

Ayushman Bharat will take care of health of the number of people more than the combined population of America, Canada and Mexico.

Therefore, our health minister Nadda ji was saying that the world's most popular health magazine has extensively talked about this scheme and lauded it as a 'game changer' and an ambitious scheme.

I believe that in the near future, the people associated with the medical sector, or those concerned with health schemes, those associated with economics or modern treatment techniques, or those thinking of bringing about a transformation in the lives of the common man like social scientists, medical scientists, economists will have to study and think on the lines of India's scheme of Ayushman Bharat. And sooner or later, based on it, they will have to devise future models for the world.

The work accomplished by all my friends who have worked as a team to give this plan a shape is not a miniscule one. Such a Herculean task has been accomplished from it's inception to its implementation within a short span of 6 months. Those who talk about good governance, must realize that forming  a team and working with a vision and a roadmap in a time-bound manner and associating 13000 hospitals with 50 crore people within 6 months in itself is a unique feat. 

 

Therefore, today I would like to congratulate my entire team publicly in front of the 125 crore Indians from the bottom of my heart. And I believe that now the team will work with more enthusiasm and dedication; because earlier the Prime Ministers kept nagging them but now they have the blessings of 50 crore poor people. I believe that with the blessings of the 50 crore poor people, even the ASHA workers in villages will work zealously and make it a success.

Friends,

While dedicating this protective cover of health to the poor I pray to God for its success. The scheme is a good for everyone but during the inauguration of a hospital can we ever wish that the hospital remains full? No one can! When I will be going to inaugurate a hospital, I will say that may their hospital always remains empty.

Today while launching the Ayushman Bharat Mission, I would pray that no poor person of my country faces such an adversary that he has to knock the doors of a hospital to avail the scheme. Such adversaries must not strike anyone. So, I also pray to God for everyone’s good health. If some adversary befalls anyone, Ayushman Bharat is there to take care of it.

If unfortunately the vicious cycle of diseases enters your life, my country's poor will also be able to avail the same health care facilities that the rich avails.

Brothers and sisters,

This scheme is being implemented from today. However, it was necessary to run trials for it's a mega scheme. For the last few days, trials were going on in different districts to ensure that the technology and the Arogya  Mitras are functioning properly and to see if the existing hospitals need to be changed or upgraded. And I believe that this mission will successfully accomplish its objective of giving health rights in true terms. It will further strengthen the sector of healthcare services.

Friends,

A special occasion is also associated with Ayushman Bharat Mission. When I had started the first phase and the work of the wellness center on April 14 from the jungles of Chhattisgarh, it was on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Today, while starting the second phase, birth anniversary of Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji which is on 25th September has been kept in mind. So, this event has been organized two days prior to his birth anniversary as it is a Sunday and it is also convenient for me. However, this day also marks another important occasion. It is also the birth anniversary of our national poet Dinkar, the name that triggers a feeling of vigour and whose words had the power to awaken anyone.

Therefore today, we are devoting this scheme to the country with the blessings of the great personalities who had made ceaseless efforts to eliminate the prevalent discrimination in the society and had worked for the pride of the poor throughout their lives.

This scheme is being dedicated to the country with the objective that best quality treatment is available to all and is not limited to few people.

Brothers and sisters,

Whenever we look at the health sector of our country, it has been observed that if Rs.100 is spent on an individual for treatment, of that the burden of more than Rs.60 is borne by the family or that individual. The entire savings is spent on medical expenses. As most part of their income is spent on medical expenses, every year lakhs of families that are on the verge of coming out of poverty are again pushed back into poverty due to some or the other disease. We have thus, taken this responsibility of changing this scenario.

Brothers and sisters,

We have been hearing the slogan of 'Garibi Hatao' since independence. If the people who deceived the poor over the past 30,40 and 50 years had emphasized on empowering the poor instead of playing dirty politics in the name of poor, then India wouldn't have been what it is today. They had an erroneous perception about the poor. They thought that poor always demands something or the other. The basic mistake on their part was to believe that the poor needs to be given things for free. But the extent of dignity and self-respect that the poor possess cannot ever be measured. 

I have lived in poverty. I have experienced the dignity and the self-respect of the poor. This feeling of self-respect gives the strength to deal with poverty. However, no effort was made to understand this feeling of the poor's self-respect or to understand their intensions to fulfil their dreams. Therefore, before every election they used to indulge in dole politics to gain political brownie points. They used to follow this ploy. 

We, on the other hand, have identified the root cause of the problem. The country is moving ahead at a rapid pace towards poverty eradication. Recently, an international organization has said that within last 2-3 years, almost 5 crore families in India have come out of extreme poverty.

Brothers and sisters,

This has been possible because we have emphasized upon empowerment of the poor. Therefore, when a poor person gets a house, his mindset and perception changes and when a poor mother gets a gas connection, she is confident and feels equal to the others.

The poor feel dignified when they have a bank account. They decide to save money. The poor move towards empowerment when they are vaccinated and avail the benefits of Poshan Mission.

You must have watched the recently concluded Asian Games. Who were the award winners of the Asian Games? Who won the gold medals? Who were the people who brought such great honours to India? Most of these children, both sons and daughters, belong to small villages and poor families. Their childhood was spent in malnutrition but when they got the opportunity, they brought accolades to the country.

That power also lies in the poor and we need to identify it. Therefore, all our schemes are for empowerment of the poor. There has been another transformation in our country. Earlier all the laws were formulated on the basis of vote bank politics. They were concerned with the community, caste and areas that will be politically beneficial or that will help them in winning elections. Even if there were possibilities of regional development, societal change or removing community tensions, the government's money was used to strengthen the political parties rather than strengthening the society. The government's treasury was looted recklessly.

We didn't take that path. We don't want the country to ever return to that path. Our mantra has been - 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. Ayushman Bharat will not be based upon community, caste or class discriminations. 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' doesn't discriminate between caste, community, region, religion or theists and atheists. It is immaterial whether the person goes to temple or mosque or gurdwara or church.  Everyone will get the benefit of Ayushman Bharat. This is what is 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.

Friends,

It is such a massive scheme and it can be estimated from the fact that treatment for more than 1300 diseases including cancer, heart diseases, kidney and liver diseases and diabetes are included in the scheme. The treatment for 1300 serious diseases will be available not only in government hospitals but also in private hospitals of the country.

Apart from getting admitted to the hospital, up to 5 lakh rupees can be used for check-up, medicines, expenditure prior to getting admitted to the hospital till the completion of the treatment. If someone has already been ill, he can make use of the scheme to pay for his medical expenses.

Moreover, proper arrangements have been made so that the beneficiaries across the country are able to avail the benefits of the scheme. We have made arrangements so that you don't have to run from pillar to post for treatment. Efforts are being made so that everything is done via technology. We are trying to ensure that no beneficiary or needy person is left out.

You don't have to get registered for this scheme. This e-card is all that you need. E-card will have all the required information related to you. You won't be entangled in any kind of paper verification.

Besides, you all must remember this telephone number. I urge all the poor families to remember this one telephone number - 14555. You can call and confirm if your and your family's name has been included in the scheme or not. You can also enquire about the facilities that you can avail for your problems and about the nearest common service centres. Today, there are 3 lakh common Service centres in the country. No one has to travel more than 2-3km to reach the common service centre. You can go and seek information from these common service centres.

Friends,

Besides these facilities, you will also have two more helping hands: First, ASHA and ANM sisters of your village; and secondly, Pradhan Mantri Arogya Mitras, who will be present in every hospital for your help. These Pradhan Mantri Arogya Mitras will cooperate with you so that you can avail the benefits of this scheme right from the time prior to getting admitted to the hospital till post treatment period. These friends who are dedicated to make the country healthy will provide you the right information.

Friends,

The Ayushman Bharat Mission strengthens the environment of ‘One India, One treatment’ in true sense. The people of one state that have joined the Ayushman Bharat Mission can also avail the benefits of the scheme in some other state in case of emergency.

Till date, more than 13000 hospitals across the country have joined this mission. In the near future, more hospitals will be part of this mission. Moreover, the well performing hospitals, especially the rural hospitals will get incentives from the government.

Brothers and sisters,

The aim of Ayushman Bharat Mission is not only to provide financial aid but also to develop a system that will ensure best treatment facilities just close to your house.

Friends,

Today, 10 wellness centres have also been inaugurated here. Now Jharkhand has 40 such centres and the country has about 2000 - 2500 centres. We have set a target of establishing 1.5 lakh wellness centres across the country in the next four years.

Brothers and sisters,

The health and wellness centres are important part of Ayushman Bharat Mission. These centres will not only have treatment and medicines for common diseases but will also have facilities for conducting several free tests. This will help in early detection of serious diseases.

Friends,

The government is working holistically instead of working in bits and pieces. Every decision and law is interlinked. The government is focusing on both affordable healthcare and preventive healthcare. Yoga, campaigns like Swachh Bharat Mission, making villages Open Defecation Free etc. are aimed at eradicating the root cause of serious diseases. You must have read recently that the possibility of saving the lives of 3 lakh children have increased because of Swachh Bharat Mission.  Whether it is the statistics pertaining to saving the lives of newborn babies or the lives of pregnant mothers, the country is striding ahead at a rapid pace to make India healthy. 

The government has started schemes like Poshan Mission so that malnutrition can be prevented right at the nascent stage of development of the body. At the same time, relentless efforts are being made to increase the human resources in the medical field. According to an estimate, there will be about 2500 good quality and modern hospitals due to Ayushman Bharat in the coming 3 years. Most of these hospitals will be concentrated in tier-2, tier-3 cities and small towns. As a result, new employment opportunities and opportunities for new profession will open up for middle class families.

Moreover, employment opportunities will also come up in the form of technical expertise, call centre jobs, management, pharmaceutical production, equipment manufacturing along with medical services. There will be a huge demand for paramedical staff and trained doctors. Simultaneously, there will also be new opportunities for start-ups related to the medical field. Lakhs of doctors, nurses and people associated with hospital management will get the opportunity to be associated with it. This means that a great opportunity awaits the country's middle class and lower middle class.

The government is working relentlessly to strengthen the health infrastructure in the country's villages, towns, and tier-1 and tier-2 cities. In the last four years, 14 new AIIMS have been approved across the country. Under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana, work is underway to establish at least 1 AIIMS in every state. Also, 82 new government medical colleges are being constructed throughout the country. The government is trying to emphasize that there should be at least one medical college in every three or four Parliamentary constituencies.

Under this effort, today the foundation-stone of two medical colleges have been laid that will be constructed at a cost of more than Rs.600 crores. A new facility of about 400 beds will be added to these medical colleges that are coming up in Koderma and Chaibasa.

Brothers and sisters,

In the last four years, about 25000 new undergraduate and post-graduate seats have been added to the medical colleges in the country. The government is targeting to develop a capacity to produce 1 lakh new doctors in the country in the coming 4-5 years. That is, keeping in mind the requirements of the future, emphasis is being given on developing both infrastructure and human resources. 

Friends,

Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji used to rightly say that just like education, the expenditure on health is not expenditure but an investment. Development of the country and the society is not possible without good quality education and skills. Similarly, sick citizens cannot build an empowered nation.

Friends,

I am confident that with the help of every person associated with this scheme, with the efforts of Arogya Mitras, ASHA and ANM sisters, doctors, nurses, workers and service providers, we can make this scheme successful and build a healthy nation. I wish that the New India is healthy and empowered and you all are healthy.

With this expectation, I dedicate the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana to 125 crore Indians from the soil of Ranchi and the land of Bhagwan Birsa Munda today.

Thanks a lot!

Victory to Mother India!

Victory to Mother India!

Victory to Mother India!

I will say Ayushman; you will say Bharat.

Ayushman-Bharat

Ayushman-Bharat

Ayushman-Bharat

Ayushman-Bharat

Thank you so much!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched the health assurance scheme: Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana - at Ranchi, Jharkhand. 

The Prime Minister visited an exhibition on the scheme, before arriving on the dais to launch PMJAY at a huge public gathering. 

At the same event, the Prime Minister unveiled plaques to lay the Foundation Stone for medical colleges at Chaibasa and Koderma. He also inaugurated 10 Health and Wellness Centres. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that this launch has been done with a vision to provide the poorest of the poor, and the underprivileged sections of society, with better healthcare and treatment. He said this scheme, which envisions health assurance of 5 lakh rupees per family per year, will benefit over 50 crore people, and is the world's biggest health assurance scheme. He said the number of beneficiaries of this scheme is roughly equal to the population of the European Union, or the population of America, Canada and Mexico, taken together. 

He said the first part of Ayushman Bharat - the health and wellness centres, was launched on BabasahebAmbedkar's birth anniversary, and the second part - the health assurance scheme, is being launched two days before DeendayalUpadhyay's birth anniversary.

                Governor of Odisha Shriman Professor Ganeshi Lal Ji, Chief Minister of the State Shriman Naveen Patnaik Ji, my colleagues in the Union Council of Ministers Shriman Jual Oram Ji, Dharmendra Pradhan Ji and all the dignitaries present here, 

I came here from Talcher today where we had started revival the defunct fertiliser plant at a cost of nearly Rs. 13,000 crores. In a way, it will become the hub of economic activity in that region. A modern Odisha, a modern India should have modern infra-structure. So, I took  the opportunity to inaugurate Veer Surendra Sain Airport here. It is natural that when the travelers who will come here and hear about Veer Surendra Sain will be attracted towards the bravery of Odisha, towards the sacrifice of Odisha and towards the stories of dedication of Odisha.

Today, I have got the opportunity to inaugurate several other big schemes from here.  This is the second biggest airport of Odisha. It is for you to find out why it has not been constructed for so many years. May be it was waiting for me. 

I belong to Gujarat where there is a district called Kutch. It’s a desert and on the other side is Pakistan. In that district, there are five airports. Today the construction of the second airport of Odisha begins after so many years. Suresh Ji said just a while ago about the kind of progress that is taking place in the aviation sector of the country. You will be surprised to know that the total number of planes flying so far in the country since independence is just about four hundred and fifty. This was the case so far since independence and in this year alone, the orders have been placed for nine hundred and fifty new aircraft. Could anybody imagine what we are about to achieve and how fast we are going ahead?I believe that Veer Surendra Sain Airport is to be built at a place which is the centre of three places Bhuvaneshwar, Ranchi and Raipur. You can imagine that it will provide wings to so many possibilities of development which will take a new flight of development because of it.  

Such facilities are extremely important for the industrialists who want to invest in Jharsuguda, Sambalpur and nearby areas of Chhattisgarh. If they are able to easily travel to this place they would like it from the business point of view. It has been our thinking that the meaning of Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas is that there should be balance between regions. This kind of imbalance where only Western India continues to develop and Eastern India continues to lack in terms of development creates crisis for the country. And that is why it is our constant effort that Eastern India should be developed. And development of Odisha is an important part of it. Be it Eastern Uttar Pradesh or Odisha or West Bengal or Assam or North-East, the development of the entire region is extremely important.

Today I am inaugurating an airport here, I am going to inaugurate an airport in Sikkim the day after tomorrow. You can imagine how much work is being done and at what speed. Today, I also got the opportunity to dedicate a coalmine to the nation. We are aware that energy is at the centre of activities and Odisha is fortunate that it has the treasure of black diamond. And today the work to extract coal from the mine starts. Also the work to produce energy fromthat coal begins and so the prospects of development brighten.

Today, a railway project can connect an airport ; connectivity is playing a big role furthering development. Be it a highway or railway or airways or waterway. The work of connecting all places by  internet is speedily increasing. 

This tribal area is being connected by railways today: this in itself is an important step. I believe that in future connectivity will be a game changer for all round development of Odisha.  I am proud to dedicate Veer Surendra Sain Airport to the people of the area. 

Thank you very much.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, visited Chhattisgarh today. At Janjgir-Champa, he visited an exhibition on traditional handloom and agriculture. He laid the foundation stone for national highway projects, and the Pendra-Anuppur 3rd railway line. The Prime Minister also handed over certificates etc to select beneficiaries of various welfare schemes of the Union and State Governments.

Addressing a large Kisan Sammelan, the Prime Minister recalled former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who, he said, had created three new States - Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. It is due to his vision of development that all these states are progressing rapidly, the Prime Minister said.

The Prime Minister asserted that the Union Government is devoted to development and wants to fulfil the aspirations of people. We want to enhance ease of living for the people, the Prime Minister said.

Shri Narendra Modi said that the Government does not believe in making schemes for a vote-bank, or schemes to win elections. He said that the aim is to create a new, modern Chhattisgarh.

We are moving ahead with the mission of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, the Prime Minister said, adding that the Union Government is working hard to ensure that farmers benefit through value addition. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana is helping farmers in this mission, the Prime Minister said. Through technological interventions, the welfare of farmers is being ensured, the Prime Minister said, adding that measures like Soil Health Cards and Fasal Bima Yojana are benefiting the farmers immensely.

The Prime Minister recalled that there was once a time when only a select few got the benefits of welfare schemes, and corruption had ruined the governance system. We are committed to development for all, the Prime Minister asserted, noting that the Union Government wants to ensure a roof over every head by 2022.

The Prime Minister said that the task of constructing toilets was undertaken in mission mode. Cooking gas connections were given to the poor under Ujjwala Yojana, and now, through Saubhagya Yojana, electricity connections are being ensured in every home, he added.

The Prime Minister said India's aviation sector is being transformed rapidly, and this augurs well for 125 crore Indians.

This airport in Jharsuguda is well located to serve the needs of the people of Odisha, the Prime Minister said. He said that connectivity is at the core of all round development. The Union Government has devoted significant efforts to enhance connectivity all over the nation, the Prime Minister added.

                Present here on the dais, Governor of Odisha Professor GaneshiLalJi, Chief Minister of the State and my friend Shriman Naveen PatnaikJi, my colleague in the Union council of Ministers ShrimanJualOramJi, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan Ji, my colleague in the Parliament Shri SatpatiJi and Member of Legislative Assembly of this area Braj Kishore Pradhan Ji and my dear brothers and sisters;

Since I am going to address a huge public gathering after this programme therefore I would not like to speak in detail about this plant and would briefly express my happiness on this auspicious occasion. I covey my best widhes to all those who worked to compleate this task in tiem. 

In a way, I am fortunate to get the opportunity to revive this fetiliser plant. The people area dreamed a dream several decades ago which did not materialise for some reasons.  They gave up hope that the plant will ever be revived. 

However, we made a solemn pledge to take the country to new heights of development with new energy and new momentum.  As such, we took up many big  projects and schemes and took many initiatives to materialise which new  energy, new momentum and strong resolve were needed. And the result is before you here today the revival this plant at a cost of nearly Rs. 13,000 crore. 

It is a completely new technology for India. Not only this region but the entire country is going to get a new direction through this technology of gasification of coal available in this region. With the use of this technology the country will be free from importing gas and fertiliser from abroad and it will also save money. 

The revival of the plant will generate huge employment opportunities for the youth of this region. Nearly 4,500 people will be associated with this project and there will be additional benefits due to creation of a lot of facilities that will be developed in the surroundings of this project. 

How the direction of development can be changed- if the policy is clear and the intention is good only then sound decisions can be taken. We keep hearing about Navratnas, Maharatnas and Ratnas. Some times there are good news and some times there are bad news also. When all such jewels come together to take the responsibility  this project will go ahead. The expertise of each one of them, funding from each one of them will go into the revival of this project and it will meet not only the needs of of the people of Odisha but also of farmers of the whole country. 

I am told that it will take 36 months to start  production in this plant. I keep visiting to this kind of projects and I ask for the date of production so I was told that it would be 36 months from now. I assure you that I will again come here after 36 months to inaugurate this project. With this confidence, I conclude my speech while once again expressing my heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Chief Minister. 

Thank you very much.

                My cabinet colleagues  Shri Suresh Prabhu, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Shri C.R. Chaudhary, Secretary DIPP, Shri Ramesh Abhishek  and my brothers and sisters associated with trade and business who are present here today.

The entire country is busy with Ganpati festival celebrations. Lord Ganesha has arrived in every household. Let us seek the blessings of Lord Ganesha for every auspicious work to be successful and proceed further. It is an appropriate occasion to start the construction of this important centre that is a grand and glorious symbol of New India.

We can very well experience the country's economic development, cultural richness and our sensitivity towards nature in ‘India International Convention and Expo Centre’ i.e. IICC. This Service exhibits the feelings and expressions of 125 crore Indians. This is in accordance with India's image and place in the comity of nations today.

This centre that will be built at a cost of approximately Rs.26 thousand crores will prove to be a centre of attitude and energy of the country's 80 crore youth. This is part of the government's vision that focuses on world class infrastructure and ease of doing business. Just now we have been extensively told through the film and the 3D model that this will not only be a single Convention Centre or Expo Centre but a lively and vibrant centre for the country and the world's business.

In a way, this will be a mini city within Delhi. Innumerable facilities like the Convention Hall, Expo Hall, Meeting Hall, Hotels, Market, Office, and Recreation will be developed in one place.

 

So, we will come out of the confusion over whether we should organize international level events in the country's capital or not; whether we should invite people from all over the world? There will no longer be two thoughts about it. This Convention Hall is being built in a place that can accommodate 10,000 people. It will be among top 5 Conventional Halls in the world and top 3 in Asia in terms of seating capacity.

Most importantly, it is going to extend the work culture of accomplishing big tasks that has developed in the last four years. This is going to be India's largest Convention and Expo Centre.

Friends,

This government has started work on its unprecedented schemes for the development of the country such as building the longest tunnel, the longest gas pipeline, the longest bridge over the sea, the largest mobile manufacturing unit or providing broadband connectivity and electricity to every village, or the greatest financial inclusion movement, the largest banking network in the rural areas, setting up of India Post Payment Bank, indirect tax in the form of GST, running the greatest mass movement in the form of Swachh Bharat Mission and now the country and the world's greatest healthcare scheme i.e. Ayushman Bharat.

These are some examples of physical and social infrastructure that symbolize not only of providing a new direction but also of the 21st century India and the speed, scale and skill of New India.

Friends,

Today, the name of IICC will also be included among the world class facilities that are being developed in different parts of the country. Laced with modern technology, the complex will have myriad facilities that is expected from the world's 6th largest economy for the business leaders from around the world; the economy that is growing at a rate of 8% that is rapidly progressing with the target of turning into a 5trillion dollar economy in the next 5-7 years and 10 trillion dollar economy in the next one to one-and-a-half decade.

I am glad to know that this complex will be well connected to modern transportation facilities. This will be directly connected to the Airport by high-speed metro. All the facilities and arrangements for meetings or business Incubation Centres, event management service, entertainment, shopping or tourism related facilities will be available, under one roof.

This project is a part of the Government's resolution, in which every infrastructure related to India's growth story is being strengthened.

 

Brothers and sisters,

Wherever we go, we find that even the small countries are capable of organizing big conferences. By developing modern arrangements, many countries have become the hubs of Conference Tourism. However, we have never thought in this direction for years. All our major conferences or trade fair are limited to just one place i.e. Pragati Maidan. That place too has lost its glory. Now that idea has changed and today's programme is the result of that change.

IICC centres will be set up not only in the country's capital Delhi but also in other states to strengthen business culture. In our country, an ecosystem of Conference Tourism will be developed.

International level summits, Annual General Meetings of major companies, events of different government departments etc. can be easily organized in such centres. This modern Convention Centre will, in a way, promote ease of living. There will not be any issue of erecting tents, supply of water and electricity or any threat of weather conditions. There will be a 'ready-to-use' system that will be available for use by maximum number of people. 

When there are centres for such activities like business activities or cultural activities, the entire city gets benefitted. These Convention centres will become the identity of these cities. 

Friends,

IICC will become a good medium of highlighting India's credible story globally. I hope that after it is ready, then Conference Tourism will enhance the identity of India in the form of MIC i.e. Meeting Incentive Conferences and Exhibition. 

IICC will help the country's businessmen and industrialists to showcase and establish their products in the international market. The small and medium entrepreneurs often find it difficult to advertise and market their products due to financial constraints. This will prove to be effective for them. They will be able to directly interact with international buyers and sellers. They will be able to know about international level technologies and will operate their business accordingly.

This facility will give impetus to government's those efforts that will empower MSME i.e. Medium and Small Scale industries. Moreover, an important facility will also come up for start-ups. The most daunting challenge of a start-up is to deliver their ideas to investors. This will prove to be a major platform for the country's innovative youth. Here, discussions will pertain to ideas, innovation, funding, branding and marketing.

This is important because today India is the second largest ecosystem in the world in the field of Start-ups.

Today our youth is working on more than 10,000 start-ups. In such a scenario, the modern facilities will benefit every class and every level of the society. The fact that this centre will provide employment opportunities to the country's 5 lakh youngsters is noteworthy. This project is not only the face of India's economic and cultural power but also a new direction for lakhs of poor and middle class families. This has the strength to change the aspirations of the youngsters from the country's training institutes, skill centres or schools and colleges.

Brothers and sisters,

IICC is the extension of those major infrastructure projects that have been placed on ground over the last four years. Such projects have opened up new employment opportunities for lakhs of youngsters. Job opportunities are being created in every sector such as service, agriculture or manufacturing sector. As per the reports, job creation in the IT sector has shown a dramatic increase.

There are unprecedented opportunities in the retail sector. The E-commerce sector alone is generating more than $ 50 billion in revenue. The more this sector becomes widespread, the more jobs it can provide.

Friends,

Today, along with the service sector, the manufacturing sector too is increasing the power of 'Make in India'. Today India is becoming the manufacturing hub of mobile phones which has brought the country's 4-4.5 lakh youngsters in the employment network in the last four years. Now according to the current scenario, we are not only exporting mobile phones but also manufacturing 80% of the mobiles within the country. This has saved us Rs.3 lakh crores of foreign exchange.

Friends,

In the last four years, an environment of transparent and merit-based business has been created. The country's telecom sector has come out of the darkness that prevailed 5-6 years ago. Today this sector is among the fastest growing sectors of the country. The country is now moving towards establishing the infrastructure of 5G. Transparent tendering system and Digital India Mission have further pushed it. Today voice call is almost free and the price of 1GB 4G data has reduced from Rs.250-300 to only Rs.19-20. Now the common man can savour the strength of internet as the industry has got new opportunities for business. Along with the Telecom sector, the Tourism sector too is building a new record of sustainable development and creating lakhs of job opportunities in the country.

Friends,

A country is run by a system and by its institutions. A nation cannot be built in 2 or 4 months or years. It is the result of several years of sustained development. Therefore, timely decision making and implementation of the schemes are pertinent for this.

Take for example the decision of the merger of the small banks. There was no need of dozens of public sector banks. We have been hearing debates on this issue for years. About two and a half decades ago, this issue was raised. However, even after a lot of discussion, no one had the courage to work in this direction. The last 50 months are the witness to the fact that the government formed by the NDA is never afraid of taking bold decisions.  The decisions that were in limbo for years together have now been put on ground. Initially, the smaller banks were merged with State Bank of India and now three more banks will be merged with one bank. I clearly remember that about 3-4 years back, whenever there used to be talk on reform, some people used to challenge and write ‘if Modi can accomplish the task of merger of banks, we will accept that Modi is really doing something great’.   Now that this task has been accomplished, their pens are in a peaceful slumber. They are now silent.

All the decisions like the ones related to GST, demonetization, Benami property, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, or absconders after committing financial frauds, or cancelling the registration of more than 3 lakh suspicious companies, are shining examples of the government's commitment towards creating an honest and transparent business environment.

Friends,

In the last four years, all-round development was possible and the government could perform better with the same available resources because it had prioritized the welfare of the nation above everything else. It had ensured that the arrangements were done properly.

Friends,

I want to reassure you that this system of taking bold decisions for the welfare of the people will continue. Today, despite the challenges faced by the country, India's economic foundation is strengthening day by day. The fundamentals are strong; exports are being encouraged. Work is underway on an extensive scheme to make global trade 40% of the GDP. Efforts are going on to achieve the target of turning the country's GDP to 5trillion dollars by 2025, of which 1 trillion dollars should be formed by the manufacturing and agriculture sectors.

 

As a result of the government's efforts, the rankings in ‘Ease of Doing Business’ have improved by 42 points in the last four years. Now even the states are competing among themselves to improve their rankings. This competition in ‘Ease of Doing Business’ is also improving the people's ease of living.

We are striving to take this journey of reforms to district and Tehsil levels. Today we are focusing upon the aspects of ‘Ease of Doing Business’ even at district level. We are working on an Excel Plan to achieve the same. The government is trying to increase the GDP of the districts by 2-3 % in the future. It is looking for the methods, the initiatives and the priorities. The government's idea has always been show results on ground to leave the imprints of sustainable reforms.

Friends,

Our vast country has a huge population of youngsters who have the right to dream big and fulfill those dreams. They have the right to give a physical form to those dreams. It is the responsibility of the business world along with the government to help them to fulfill those dreams. It is also the responsibility of all of you.

I believe that we all will work together with all our efforts to give impetus to the dreams of youngsters of New India. Efforts are going on to complete the first phase of IICC within 1-1.5 years. My best wishes to the people who are associated with its construction. I was told that almost 2500 workers have already started working in this complex. This means that full-fledged work has already begun even before laying the foundation stone.

 

I believe that the dreams with which we have started, India must move forward by projecting herself as not only relevant but also a leader in this ever-changing world and global economy. We must stride ahead for these dreams. Once again, my best wishes to the entire team for accomplishing this task on time in the best possible manner and at a best possible pace.

Thanks a lot!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today laid the foundation stone for India International Convention and Expo Centre (IICC) at Dwarka, New Delhi.

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that this Centre would reflect India’s economic progress, rich cultural heritage, and our consciousness towards environment protection. He also said it is a part of the Government’s vision which gives importance to world class infrastructure, and ease of doing business.

The Prime Minister recounted how the Union Government has begun a series of unprecedented projects for the nation’s development. In this context, he mentioned the longest tunnel, the longest gas pipeline, the largest mobile manufacturing unit, and electricity to every household among many others. He said these are illustrations of the skill, scale and speed of New India.

The Prime Minister said that several countries across the world have developed elaborate capacities to hold conferences. He said this had not been thought of in India for a quite a while. Now this is changing, he added.

The Prime Minister said that a country progresses through strong organizational and institutional capacities, which are the result of years of effort. He said that for this, it is important to take decisions at the right time, and implement them without delay.

In this context, the Prime Minister mentioned the recent decision on merger of Public Sector Banks. He said this had been thought about for nearly two and a half decades, but not implemented. However, he asserted that this Government does not shy away from taking tough decisions in national interest. He said that all round progress has happened in the last four years only because national interest has been kept supreme. He asserted that this process of taking tough decisions in the best interest of the people, will continue. He said that despite challenges, the economy is on a firm footing. Mentioning “ease of doing business”, he said the Government is now working towards taking this effort to the district level as well.

The Prime Minister recalled his recent interaction with the ASHA and Anganwadi workers across the country, via video conference. He appreciated the experiences and personal accounts that had been shared by ASHA representatives that day, and said that these will surely prove inspirational for many.

Today, ASHA activists shared some more accounts of how they had been instrumental in saving lives of poor mothers and children through timely intervention.

The Prime Minister appreciated the skill and dedication of ASHA workers, and recalled that even Bill and Melinda Gates had praised the efforts of ASHAs towards eradication of diseases such as Kala Azar.

He encouraged them to devote their energies to work in coordination with other government agencies to improve the quality of life in their villages. He also explained how Government schemes and initiatives are all aimed at empowering the poor to fight poverty.

Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare Sh. J.P. Nadda was also present on the occasion.

                My young friends from Kashi, who are present here in large numbers and my brothers, sisters and friends of Kashi! My greetings to you all!

 

I am overwhelmed with the love and affection bestowed upon me by the people of Kashi. I feel like taking time out and visiting Kashi again and again.

Brothers and sisters,

HarHarMahadev!

It is really fortunate for me that I am beginning another year for serving the country with the blessings of Baba Vishwanath and Mother Ganga. Your affection and blessings inspire me every moment and strengthens the resolution of serving the countrymen.

Friends,

In order to take this expression of service forward, projects worth more than Rs.550 crore have either been launched or foundation-stones have been laid.

These development projects are associated not only with Varanasi but also with the surrounding villages. It includes projects of basic necessities such as electricity and water as well as projects that promise new opportunities to farmers, weavers and artisans.

Moreover, new projects have been started to make the Benares Hindu University an important knowledge centre for the 21st century. I congratulate the people of Varanasi for these projects and offer my best wishes.

 

Friends,

Whenever I am amidst you, I tend to always remind you that all our efforts at bringing about a transformation are being done keeping the culture and heritage of Kashi intact. Modern facilities and infrastructures are being assimilated with the city by preserving its age-old identity.

The difference between now and four-four- and-a -half years ago when the people of Kashi had made a resolution of change is explicit. Isn't it? Can you make out the difference or not? Can you see the change? Thank you!

Well, you are a witness to the situation where Kashi's condition was left completely to Lord Bholenath. Today I am extremely satisfied that with the blessings of Baba Vishwanath, we have successfully provided a new direction to the development of Varanasi.

Several years ago, every visitor of Kashi used to be pained by the deteriorating facilities and infrastructure of the city. Just like the dangling electricity transmission wires, Kashi too was entangled in its chaos. At that time, I had decided to transform the all-round chaos to all-round development.

Today we can see all-round transformation in Kashi. I vividly remember; before becoming a Parliamentarian, whenever I used to visit Kashi, I used to wonder looking at the dangling electricity wires that when Varanasi would be freed from this? You can see for yourself that those wires are not there anymore in most part of the city. Work is underway at a rapid pace in the remaining areas to lay down the wires underground.

The 5 major projects related to electrification that have been launched today also include making Old Kashi free from dangling electric wires. These projects will strengthen the objective of supplying sufficient electricity to several surrounding villages along with Varanasi. Besides, the foundation stone of another electricity sub-centre has been laid. After it gets ready, the nearby areas will be able to get rid of the issue of low voltage.

Friends,

A lot of effort is being put to develop Varanasi as a gateway to the Eastern India. Therefore, the government's priority is to provide Varanasi with world class infrastructure. As per the needs of 21st century, facilities such as transport facilities, medical facilities and education facilities etc. are being developed.

Today Kashi is shimmering under the illumination of LED. The flow of mother Ganga is easily visible at night too from across the city. LED bulbs have not only illuminated your lives but also reduced the electricity bill. Varanasi Nagar Nigam has saved a lot of money after LED bulbs were installed.

Friends,

Anyone who had visited Kashi four years back will now see expansion of new roads. For several years, discussion upon constructing a Ring road in Varanasi was going on but the plan was just on file. After 2014 elections, the Ring road file was taken up. The previous state government of UP at that time didn't allow this plan to progress because they were afraid that Modi would be hailed for its success. So, they tried to put the file in the cold storage. 

However, as soon as you elected Yogi ji's government, the work is being completed at a rapid pace. A 4-lane road from Harhua to Ghazipur is almost done. Work on a new circuit from Harhua to Raja Talab and Chandauli is rapidly progressing. On this route, a bridge will be constructed over Ganga which will reduce the number of trucks entering Varanasi.

Friends,

The construction of Kashi Ring road will benefit not only Kashi but also the surrounding districts. The roads emanating from here are extremely significant to reach Bihar, Nepal, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh. This is the reason why the roads connecting the city of Varanasi within and with other states are being broaden and extended further. Crores of rupees have been spent on National Highway No. 7, that is, Varanasi-Sultanpur road, Varanasi-Gorakhpur section and Varanasi- Handiaroad link. 

Brothers and sisters,

Work on several road projects worth thousands of crores rupees is underway within Varanasi. Earlier people had to face a lot of trouble while travelling between Mahmoorganj and Manduadih; the school students had to suffer a lot; I need not remind you of it. After ages, the work on Manduadih flyover is complete. Similarly, after the completion of Samnegat bridge over the river Ganga has made travelling to and fro from Ramnagar easy. The demand to broaden the AndhuraBridge was as old as the bridge itself. The work to broaden the AndhuraBridge was suspended for several decades. That work has also been completed. Work is underway in different parts of the city including broadening of Bojuvid-Sindhora road, making Shivpur-Phulwaria road into a 4-lane one and broadening the road between Raja Talab Police station and Jakhini. The work on development of important Panchkosi passage in terms of religious beliefs and tourism is also progressing at a rapid pace.

Approximately Rs.750 crores has been allocated for the construction of roads between BhagwatBridge and Court Road. You are already aware of the fact that earlier it was such a difficult road! A journey that should take a few minutes used to take hours. Often people used to miss their flights and trains due to heavy traffic jam. All these issues will definitely be eliminated after the completion of this road.

Friends,

The people visiting the airports are witnesses to the fact that Varanasi is developing. The number of tourists coming to Varanasi by flight is increasing. Four years ago, about 8lakh people used to come to the Babatpur airport. This figure has shot up to 21 lakhs now. 

The transportation system in Varanasi is being modernized in every possible way to bring about a Smart transformation in Smart Varanasi. Traffic system is being integrated so that a single mode of transport is not over-burdened. The integrated command and control center being built here is going to control the entire city's administration and public facilities.

Once the work of the fast-moving multi-modal terminal in Varanasi is completed, the city is going to emerge as a major hub for transport and logistics. This will increase the connectivity of roads, railways and water transport, which will benefit the businesses and industries here.

Work on developing a Ferry service is underway to help the Kashi visitors to reduce their travel time. Work on National Waterway No.1 between Varanasi and Haldia is underway. Work on turning the vehicles into CNG vehicles is going on at a rapid pace.

Brothers and sisters,

My happiness doubles when I see people posting photos of Varanasi Cantonment Station joyously on social media. Development work on stations like the Cantonment Station, Manduadih or city station has been expedited. Those are being modernized. The people travelling to Kashi by train can see pictures of New Kashi at the station only.

Friends,

Besides, work of doubling the track connecting Varanasi with Allahabad and Chhapra is in progress. Electrificationwork from Varanasi to Baliya has been completed. The work of doubling and electrification of Varanasi-Allahabad City section is in progress.

Along with the infrastructure, the connectivity of Varanasi to the rest of the country via rail has also increased manifold. Many new trains have been started from Varanasi in the last four years. Trains like Varanasi-Delhi, Vadodara, Patna Mahamana expresses, Varanasi- Patna Janashatabdi express with modern facilities have also drawn the attention of the people. Railway connectivity of Varanasi with other cities like Hubli, Mysore or Guwahati has strengthened.

Friends,

Now commuting to the city of Kashi has not only been made easy, but it is also being beautified. Now our ghats welcome the guests not by garbage but by lights. It is now possible to ride both by a boat as well as by cruise in the waters of Maa Ganga. Arrangements have been made so that devotees can easily reach temples. This campaign of transformation through tourism has been going on relentlessly.

Brothers and sisters,

For the past four years, work is underway to protect the legacy of Kashi and to beautify our heritage. Mahatma Gandhi had begun his freedom movement from Maidagin Town Hall. Efforts have been made to revive the pride of the Heritage Bhawan. It has again turned into its original form.

Big and important parks of Varanasi have also been restored, developed and beautified. Light and sound show has been arranged for tourists in Sarnath. In order to promote tourism, religious centres like Budhha theme park, Sarangnath pond, Gurudham temple, MarkandeyaMahadev temple have already been beautified.

Beautification of Bhairavkund, Sagarnathkund, Lakshmikund and Durganathkund has already been done. In the last four years, the people of Kashi have welcomed several leaders of different countries in a spectacular manner. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, France's President Macron and Germany's President Frank Walter have always praised and talked about the hospitality of the people of Kashi. Japan has, in fact, gifted aconvention centre to Kashi.

Friends,

Everyone will have his eyes on the hospitality of Kashi in the beginning of the next year. In January, Kashi will organize Kumbh of Indians settled across the globe. Therefore, the government is working at its level for this. However, your cooperation is indispensable. Every resident of Kashi has to come forward. Varanasi's essence, hue and heritage must reflect in every corner and street. We need to set such an example of cleanliness and hospitality that our Indian diaspora remember it throughout their lives. And I wish that the people who come here during Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas have such a brilliant experience that they end up becoming tourism ambassadors of Kashi; so that wherever they go, they say fascinating things about Kashi.

 

Brothers and sisters,

Kashi has witnessed a change also in terms of cleanliness. Today, cleanliness is the new normal in the ghats, streets and every corner of Kashi. Robust solutions to not only cleanliness but also garbage disposal have been found. Fertilizer is being manufactured out of garbage by using modern techniques.

A huge factory has been established in Karsara to turn waste into fertilizer. Everyday several metric tons of waste are produced. That waste is then turned into compost. A waste to energy plant has been set up in Karsara itself. Electricity is produced by this plant. Besides, biofuel plants have been set up in Bhavaniya, Pokhari, PahariyaMandi and IDA complex.

Friends,

Simultaneous efforts are going on to clean up mother Ganga from Gangotri to Gangasagar. Arrangements are being made to not only clean the river but also to inhibit the flow of garbage from the nearby villages and cities into the river. Thus, more than 200 projects worth approximately Rs.21, 000 crorehave already been approved.

In Varanasi, projects worth more than Rs.600 crores have been started with this motive. The Sewagetreatment plant in Dinapur and Ramana is progressing at a rapid pace. Work is also underway to create the infrastructure related to sewer plant. Along with the construction of thousands of new sewer chambers, more than 150 community toilets have also been constructed. Along with sewer work, efforts are going on to improve the drinking water supply system. In thousands of households the work of providing water connections and installing water metres is underway.

Friends,

Facilities like road, electricity and water supply have been delivered to not only Varanasi but also to the surrounding villages. As a Parliamentarian, I have the responsibility of developing certain villages and Nagepur is one such village where a major water project has been launched. All the villages like Nagepur, Jayapur, Kakariya, Domri etc. are now being linked to facilities like roads, water and electricity. Several other arrangements like playground, self-employment centres, better facilities for farmers and health care facilities are also being provided. 

Friends,

Kashi is now emerging as a health hub for eastern India because of your active cooperation. Hospitals in different regions will turn Varanasi into a major medical centre of east India in the coming days. The new and modern trauma centre of BHU is saving the lives of thousands of people. New cancer hospital and super- speciality hospital of Varanasi which is under-construction will be playing a crucial role in providing modern facilities for treatment.

Recently, BHU has signed an agreement with AIIMS to develop a World Class Health Institute.

Friends,

Today a Regional Ophthalmology Institute has also been inaugurated in BHU. About 54 years ago, LalBahadur Shastri ji had inaugurated the Ophthalmology department here. I have got the opportunity to extend this in the form of a regional centre. After this facility is completely developed, crores of people from Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Nepal will be benefitted.

Moreover, the people of Kashi would no longer be required to travel to bigger cities for eye treatment. From cataract to serious eye diseases - all can be treated at a very low cost. Also, this institute will produce high quality doctors and will help in excelling in research.

Friends,

Apart from setting up new hospitals, the existing ones have also been upgraded in Varanasi. The ESI hospital of Pandepur has been modernized at a cost of Rs.150 crore. Besides, the number of beds in the existing hospitals has also been increased. Private hospitals are also being encouraged. Besides, several healthcare centres and hospitals are being set up at Tehsil and Block levels.

Friends,

After Yogiji of BJP has been elected in UP, all the work has been progressing at an unprecedented speed. I congratulate Yogiji and his team for joining the Ayushman Bharat. The trial of this scheme that promises free treatment of up to Rs.5 lakh to 50 crore poor brothers and sisters in the country is going on in several parts of the country including UP. This scheme will be implemented across the country from 23 September onwards. 

Brothers and sisters,

The government has also emphasized upon strengthening education along with health. Malviya ji had dreamt of providing Modern Education alongside traditional education. In order to fulfill his dream and to expand BHU, several centres have been launched.

Vedic knowledge has been linked to 21st century science and future technological solutions. The Vedic age has been linked to the contemporary period. On one hand, foundation stone for Vedic Science Center has been laid, whileon the other hand,Atal Incubation centre too has been inaugurated. 

Young friends,

We have attraction towards the future technology as much as pride in our ancient culture and traditions. This country with the strength of more than 80 crore youngsters is leaving an impression on the transient technological landscape. The Atal Incubation Centre was started in BHU by walking the path of future technology. This Incubation Centre of BHU will provide a new energy to the start-ups in the near future.

I was informed that 80 start-ups across the country want to join it and 20 start-ups have already joined it. I congratulate the youngsters of Varanasi for this centre and specially those who have the courage and this mind-set.

Friends, 

The work for giving a fillip to the rural economy and farmers has gained momentum over the past four years. The Perishable Cargo Centre in Raja Talab was launched in July. This cargo centre is not only saving the crops from getting damaged but also helping the farmers of Varanasi and surrounding areas in increasing their incomes by value addition. It not only stores vegetables like potatoes and tomatoes but is also very close to the railway station. This will facilitate the transportation of fruits and vegetables to other cities.

Besides, the work on the International Rice Research Centre is nearing completion. This means that Kashi is going to play a leading role in storing high quality paddy variety in the future. We are making arrangements so that the farmer brothers and sisters of Varanasi get an alternative source of income as well. We are encouraging the farmer brothers and sisters to take up animal husbandry and apiculture along with agriculture.

A little while ago, farmers were given boxes of bees. Here the prototype photographs werepresented, but the boxes have already been presented to them. This is the motive behind it. Bees not only help in increasing the yield but also are a medium of increasing income by honey production. You will be glad to know that the country is producing recordquantity of honey along with record yield of food grains.

Brothers and sisters,

Varanasi and the Eastern India is a land of the weavers, artisans and the people who turn soil into gold. Trade Facilitation centres have been set up to provide technical support to the handicrafts industry and the artisans and craftsmen of Varanasi and connecting them to the new markets. Besides, Common Facilitation centres have also been set up at 9 places to provide better production facilities to the weavers. Warp machines are being handed-over to weaver brothers and sisters to make their work easier.

Moreover, the potter brothers and sisters and those craftsmen using mud and clay are also being provided technical support. Electric charge has been given to many brothers and sisters in this programme today. Besides, modern machines for pressing and drying the clay or mud are being handed-over to them. This will save your labour and also reduce the time of making vessels and decorative items.

Friends,

Ceaseless efforts are being made to elevate the standard of living of every class of people in Varanasi. Kashi is now among the few cities where households have cooking gas pipelines. For this, pipelines have been laid from Allahabad to Varanasi. Till date, the gas pipeline connection has reached more than 8000 households in Varanasi. Work is underway to deliver this to more than 40 thousand households in the coming days. Besides, the UjjwalaYojana has made the lives of the women easier by providing more than 60 thousand gas connections in Varanasi and its surrounding villages.

Friends,

Kashi is creating its future with a new zeal by walking on the path of SabkaSaathSabkaVikas. Work is going on for projects worth thousands of crores of rupees. Out of those infrastructure projects, several are on the verge of completion in just a few months. The development of this city will touch a new height after the completion of some of the major projects like the ring road from Airport to the court, the rice research institute, Binapur-Goytha sewer treatment plant, multi-modal terminal, a cancer hospital of international standard, etc.

Friends,

These projects are opening up unlimited employment opportunities in Varanasi. The development of Varanasi has also opened up new possibilities for entrepreneurs. Come; let us together strengthen the resolution of this transformation in Varanasi with dedication. Let us contribute towards the construction of New Kashi and New India.

I once again congratulate you all for the new projects that have been started. I hope you will keep inspiring me with your love and blessings. Brothers and sisters, even though you have chosen me as your Prime Minister but I am responsible and accountable to you as a Parliamentarian. And today, I have shown you a glimpse of the work that I have done as a Parliamentarian in the past four years. I believe that as a representative of the people, as your servant; you are my boss or High Command. Therefore, it is my responsibility to give you the account of every penny spent and time utilized.

As a Parliamentarian, I am glad that I have got the opportunity to present before you the development and the work that have been done. Once again, I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your affection and blessings.

Say along with me - Victory to Mother India!

Victory to Mother India!

Victory to Mother India!

Thanks a lot!

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, and the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, today jointly unveiled e-plaques for the ground-breaking ceremony of two projects, via video conference. External Affairs Minister of India, Ms. Sushma Swaraj, and Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, also joined the proceedings.

The projects include: (a) India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline (b) Dhaka-Tongi-Joydebpur Railway Project

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister described the cooperation between the two countries as an example for the world. He said that the two countries are neighbours, geographically; and family, emotionally. He said the proposed pipeline will further energize, not just Bangladesh’s economy, but also the relationship between the two countries. He expressed confidence that the proposed railway project will contribute to the process of strengthening national and urban transport in Bangladesh.

 

Following is the full text of the Prime Minister’s address:

 

 

बांग्लादेश की प्रधानमंत्री, Your Excellency शेख हसीना जी,

भारत और बांग्लादेश के मंत्रीगण,

और इस सीधे प्रसारण से जुड़े सभी भारत और बांग्लादेश के साथियों,

नमस्कार।

कुछ ही दिनों के अंतराल में यह हमारी दूसरी video conference है।

हमारे संपर्क की सहजता का कारण technology नहीं है। इसके पीछे भारत-बांग्लादेश संबंधों की अबाध गति और निर्बाध प्रगति है।

भौगोलिक रूप से हम पड़ौसी देश हैं। लेकिन भावनात्मक रूप से हम परिवार हैं। एक दूसरे के सुख-दुःख में साथ देना, एक दूसरे के विकास में हाथ बंटाना, यह हमारे पारिवारिक मूल्यों की ही देन है।

पिछले कुछ वर्षों में हमारे सहयोग ने विश्व को दिखाया है कि यदि दो पड़ौसी देश ठान लें, तो क्या कुछ किया जा सकता है।

चाहे दशकों पुराने सीमा विवाद हों, या विकास सहयोग के projects, हमने सभी विषयों पर अभूतपूर्व प्रगति की है। 

इस प्रगति का श्रेय, Your Excellency,  मैं आपके कुशल नेतृत्व को देता हूँ। और इसके लिए आपका हार्दिक अभिनंदन भी करता हूँ।

Friends,

आज जिस भारत-बांग्लादेश मैत्री pipeline पर काम शुरू हुआ है, वह विकास के लिए आपसी सहयोग के महाकाव्य में एक नया अध्याय जोड़ेगी। 

किसी भी देश के विकास के लिए ऊर्जा एक आधारभूत आवश्यकता है। और मुझे विश्वास है कि यह pipeline बांग्लादेश के महत्वाकांक्षी विकास लक्ष्यों की प्राप्ति के लिए संबल बनेगी।

ख़ास तौर पर बांग्लादेश के उत्तरी हिस्से में यह pipeline सस्ते दाम पर ऊर्जा उपलब्ध कराएगी।

बांग्लादेश की अर्थव्यवस्था के साथ, हमारे संबंधों को भी यह pipeline ऊर्जावान बनाएगी।

हालांकि यह pipeline भारत की grant financing से बनाई जा रही है, लेकिन हमारे लिए हर्ष का विषय है कि काम पूरा होने पर इसे बांग्लादेश की सरकार और लोगों को समर्पित कर दिया जाएगा।

इसी प्रकार आज हमने जिस railway project पर काम शुरू किया है, वह न सिर्फ़ ढाका के जन साधारण को और road traffic को राहत देगा, बल्कि freight revenue भी बढ़ाएगा। 

मुझे विश्वास है कि इस railway project से बांग्लादेश के राष्ट्रीय और शहरी transport को सुधारने की मुहिम में भी सहायता मिलेगी।

Your Excellency, 

आपका vision है कि हमारे बीच 1965 के पहले की connectivity बहाल हो। इससे हमें प्रेरणा मिलती है। 

मुझे ख़ुशी है कि ढाका – टोंगी – जॉयदेबपुर जैसे projects हमारी connectivity को 21वीं सदी की ज़रूरतों के मुताबिक़ आकार दे रहे हैं। 

     मात्र 10 दिनों में हमने video conference के माध्यम से 5 projects का लोकार्पण किया है। यह गति, यह momentum, आपके मजबूत और कुशल नेतृत्व के बिना संभव नहीं था।

     मुझे विश्वास है कि आने वाले समय में भारत और बांग्लादेश के लोगों के उज्ज्वल भविष्य के लिए हम इसी भावना से काम करते रहेंगे।

Excellency,

     अपनी बात समाप्त करने से पहले मैं आपको 28 सितम्बर पर आपके जन्मदिवस के लिए हार्दिक बधाई देना चाहता हूँ। 

भारत में हम सभी लोग आपकी दीर्घायु, स्वास्थ्य और सफ़लता के लिए प्रार्थना करते हैं, और आशा करते हैं कि बांग्लादेश की विकास यात्रा में और भारत-बांग्लादेश मैत्री के लिए आपका मार्गदर्शन बना रहेगा।

धन्यवाद।

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today participated in the Swachhata Hi Seva movement by performing Shramdaan at a school in Delhi.

Shortly after launching the movement through a video conference interaction with a cross-section of people from 17 locations across the country, the Prime Minister travelled to the Babasaheb Ambedkar Higher Secondary School, at Rani Jhansi Road in central Delhi. He offered floral tributes to a statue of Babasahed Ambedkar, and participated in the cleanliness drive. He also interacted with young students at the school, and exhorted them towards the cause of Swachhata. 

The Prime Minister travelled to, and from the school, in normal traffic, and without customary protocol. No special traffic arrangements were made for his visit. 

This school campus had been bought by Dr. Ambedkar himself in 1946, with an aim to advance the educational, social and economic well-being of Scheduled Castes.

                I welcome and congratulate all the 'Swachhagrahis' from the bottom of my heart, who have come from different corners of the country. This day, 15th September, is pretty historic in itself. It is historic because this morning has brought a new determination, enthusiasm and hope. Today you, me and the 125 crore Indians are about to reiterate the resolution of 'Swachhta Hi Seva' or 'Cleanliness is indeed service'. All of us will perform 'shramdaan' and make our contribution with a new zeal and enthusiasm to keep India clean, beginning from today up to 2nd October which is the birth anniversary of Respected Bapuji.

We have seen that even though houses are not properly cleaned up on other days, efforts are made to clean every corner of the house right before the festival of Diwali. Similarly, we should also strive to clean every corner of the country and this behavior must persist for every month and every year.

The cleanliness campaign or the movement that had started four years ago has now reached a crucial stage. I can proudly claim that every section of the nation, every sect, every caste,my friends of different age groups are pushing this great campaign forward. Not a single village, street or city is untouched by this movement.

India's coverage of cleanliness in 2014 was just 40%. It has increased to more than 90% as a result of your hard work and determination. Perhaps no one would have thought that we could make such strides in coverage of cleaning in just four years; something that couldn't be done in the last 60-65 years. Would anyone have ever thought that nearly 9 crore toilets could be built in India in the last four years? Had anyone ever imagined that approximately 4.5 lakh villages would become Open Defecation Free in the last four years? Had anyone ever thought that more than 450 districts would be Open Defecation Free in the last four years? Had anyone ever thought that 20 states and Union Territories would become Open Defecation Free in the last four years?

This is the strength of India and the Indians, the Swachhagrahis. The government alone cannot bring about a transformation to such an extent. Cleanliness is playing a crucial role in improving the lives of the people in terms of both health and wealth.

According to one of the estimates of the World Health Organization (WHO), cleanliness will play a significant role in saving the lives of 3 lakh people and accordingly to a study, cleanliness will reduce the instances of Diarhhoea by 30%.

However brothers and sisters, merely constructing toilets will not ensure cleanliness of India. Providing facilities such as toilets, dustbins and garbage disposal is just a medium. Cleanliness is a habit that needs to be inculcated. This is a Yajna of behavioral change in which every citizen of the country is making his/her positive contribution.

I am putting efforts to listen to your experiences related to 'Swachh Bharat Mission', learn from you and then all of us together will perform 'shramdaan'. Today we will get the opportunity to visit every corner of the country. We will also get the opportunity to know about the ongoing efforts there.

Once again I would like to tell my countrymen that the dedication, contribution, experience and cooperation of Swachhagrahis is commendable! The way the country's noted personalities have participated in this movement, allotted 2 hours of their day for this purpose and shared their experiences, depicts the manner in which the country's 125 crore Indians have projected this movement in front of the entire world.

In the future, whenever anything is read or written about this movement, the names of all the Swachhagrahis will be inscribed in Golden letters. I believe that just as the martyrs of the freedom struggle are respected and honored today, your contribution will also be remembered with the same respect and honor; you will be viewed as true heirs of Respected Bapu. This is because you have become a warrior of nation building, a savior of the poor and the weak and the credit of establishing the country's pride in front of the world also goes to you. The strength of the 125 crore Indians is unbridled and limitless. Our enthusiasm is on the rise. Our belief is at its peak. Our resolutions are ready for accomplishment and you all are ready to perform 'shramdaan'. My best wishes to you all. I bid my farewell to you as even I have to join you somewhere for 'Shramdaan'.

I once again congratulate you all from the bottom of my heart for your inspiration and hard work. I end my speech by saluting all the great personalities. Thanks a lot!

                His Holiness, Dr. SyednaMufaddalSaifuddin, the popular Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan ji, and my family of Dawoodi Bohra society who are present here today.

It is an inspirational occasion for me to be present amidst you all and it is a new experience for me.

I am extremely grateful to you for giving me this opportunity to attend this holy occasion of Ashara Mubaraka.

I was told that with the help of technology, people of our society from different countries and centers are connected to us. I bow down to those who are connected with us from far-off places through technology.

Friends,

You have followed the holy message of Imam Hussain in your lives and have delivered his message to the country and the world for centuries. Imam Hussain had sacrificed his life for peace and justice. He had raised his voice against injustice and arrogance. His teachings are more important today than it was before. There is a crying need to spread these traditions with a lot of assertion. And I am glad that Syedna Saheb and every person of the Bohra community is associated with this mission.

Friends,

We believe in ""Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam""; we consider the entire world as one family. We are those who walk hand-in-hand with everyone else. This very strength of our society and heritage creates a separate identity for us compared to the other countries.

I am glad that the Bohra community is acquainting the world with this strength of India. Whenever I visit any part of the world, they ask me how I am.

We are proud of our past, have faith in our present and have a resolution for a bright future. Wherever I go, I always tell the people there about our society's contribution towards peace and development.

The role of Bohra community towards peace, harmony, Satyagraha and patriotism has always been significant. Syedna Saheb himself has been teaching love and dedication towards our country and motherland through his discourse. While he was speaking now, he taught us how one should live for the country, the society, the rules and the laws.

Earlier too, the respected Syedna Tahir Saifuddin saheb along with Mahatma Gandhi had played a crucial role in establishing these values.

I had read somewhere that the two great personalities had met on a train journey. Thereafter, both of them were in constant touch and they used to consult each other or debate with each other on every important event or movement.

We are all aware that the Dandi March was a golden chapter in the history of our freedom movement. During the Dandi March, respected Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi, had stayed in Saifi Villa, i.e. Syedna Saheb's residence. Honoring his friendship with Mahatma Gandhi and his values, Syedna Tahir Saifuddin saheb had donated his Saifi Villa to the nation after independence. The same Saifi Villa is now inspiring the country's younger generation.

Friends,

My relationship with Bohra community is very old and after the description given by Syedna Saheb, I feel that I have indeed, in a way, become a member of the family. I always feel oneness with and closely tied to you all. Even today, my doors are always open for you. I am fortunate to have your affection and your entire family's affection towards me. 

There is still time for my birthday, but you have blessed me on this sacred platform to give me strength for the welfare of the nation. This really is a big deal. Therefore, I am extremely grateful to you all.

Probably there is hardly any village that doesn't have a representative from the Bohra business community. While I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Bohra community had supported me at every step. These close ties have drawn me today to you all.

I clearly remember, once Syedna Saheb was returning from Patan; he was supposed to go to Surat. He didn't have time so I rushed to the airport to meet him because I couldn't let him go without meeting. If you couldn't come, I would. So, we were sitting inside the airport, and he showered love on me just like one does to a small child. While chatting, I had discussed about the water scarcity problem of Gujarat and building check dams. He was about 97-98 at that time, i.e. 95+. Even today I can satisfactorily say that at that age, just on the basis of that casual conversation, he started the work on Mission Mode and with his efforts, he erected check dams in several villages of Gujarat to collect and store water. This campaign was successfully run and the villages started receiving water.

 

Moreover, a few years back, I did seek the help of the Bohra community for one of the programs to fight against malnutrition. I had requested them carry out a public awareness campaign. The Bohra community immediately took to their heels and helped Gujarat to tackle this serious issue.

Just observe the connection; while the Dawoodi Bohra community is engaged with the holy occasion of Ashara Mubaraka, the country is celebrating Nutrition month under Nutrition Mission. This campaign is being implemented across the country to ensure safety of every child and mother.

Every initiative taken by you towards education, health and nutrition of children have helped in empowering the society. I was informed that you are providing nutritious meal to children in different parts of the country including Maharashtra under Project Rise. This initiative of yours will definitely help to empower the nation's future.

You all are aware of the fact that for the first time the government has prioritized and put so much emphasis on healthcare. Affordable healthcare and preventive healthcare are being promoted. A network of good quality hospitals and health and wellness centers is being laid. Medicines at affordable rates are being offered at Jan Aushadhi stores. Free dialysis facilities are being provided and the prices of the equipment required for heart and knee surgeries have been drastically reduced. The Ayushman Bharat has become a savior for almost 50 crore poor brothers and sisters of the country.

This is not a small program. This program of Ayushman Bharat will cater to a population of India larger than the combined population of America, Canada and Mexico. This Program will cater to a population of India equivalent to the population of the entire Europe. You can imagine that this is a massive program for the welfare of such a large population.

Every year, free treatment up to Rs.5 lakh will be provided to every family. It is not a small decision. Every family of those 50 crore people will receive Rs.5 lakh every year. Trials of Ayushman Bharat that will take care of treatment are already running. It will be implemented across the country on 25 September on the birth anniversary of Pt. DeenDayalUpadhyayji.

Friends,

Your efforts towards providing houses to the needy along with nutrition and health services are commendable. I was told that about 11000 people have received houses due to your efforts. The government too had set the target of providing houses to the poor and homeless brothers and sisters by 2022.

You will be overjoyed to know that keys of the houses have been handed over to more than 1 crore brothers and sisters. This is not an announcement. They have actually received their house keys. Work is underway for the completion of other houses at a rapid pace. Besides, your efforts in the field of education and skill development are strengthening the efforts of the government and the results will multiply. It not only doubles but the result is several times better. We are constantly striving and moving ahead to make the lives of the common man easier and to uplift their standard of living.

Friends,

The government has emphasized upon another aspect related to the poor and the middle class. The issue is related to cleanliness. The government might have started the mission, but today it is being carried forward by the 125 crore Indians. A unique interest has developed in every village and street towards cleanliness.

Till 4 years ago, before I became the Prime Minister, only 40% of the houses in India had toilets. In such a short span of time, this figure has shot up to 90%. And I believe that very soon the country will successfully move towards declaring itself as Open Defecation Free.

This Indore city is leading and has constantly been on top in the country in terms of cleanliness. Therefore, I would like to heartily congratulate the people of Indore, the elected representatives, members of the corporation, the state government, the Chief Minister Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan and his entire team.

Not only Indore but Bhopal too has done a wonderful job! In a way, all my young friends and every individual of Madhya Pradesh is giving an impetus to this movement. We are well aware of your community's contribution to ensure cleanliness and purity of the environment. Syedna Saheb was himself a crusader of cleanliness and environmental protection. I remember that I was invited to the program marking the birth centenary of Bade Syedna Saheb.

I don't know how others celebrate birth centenaries, but you might remember how that day a movement had started to protect sparrows. Everyone was given a box in which the sparrows could make their nests. What else is environmental protection, if not this? These are our values and they have linked the purity of our minds to cleanliness of the environment.

I was told that just now Syedna Saheb has said that cleanliness should also be of heart and mind. I was told that keeping the prestige of Indore in mind, Ashara Mubaraka was organized by associating it with the message of environment and cleanliness.

Here, Plastic bags have been completely banned. It was made a zero-waste or waste-free event. Daily almost 10 tons of waste is recycled and converted to fertilizer here and then delivered to the farmers for free.

In the process, you are not only doing a service to the environment but also emphasizing upon government's vision of 'waste to energy'. This step will also be beneficial for farmer brothers and sisters. I appeal to the Swachhagrahis across the country to take lessons from such arrangements and associate with cleanliness. In our upcoming programs, emphasize will be laid on 'waste to energy'. Swachhta Hi Seva movement will begin tomorrow i.e. 15 September onwards and continue till 2nd October which is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi ji.

Tomorrow at 9.30 A.M., I will interact over video conference with Swachhagrahis, the religious gurus who create awareness regarding cleanliness, the artists, players, industrialists and all the eminent personalities of the society. Thereafter, a world record will be created. Crores of people will be engaged in the work of cleanliness tomorrow at the same time.

Moreover, from 2nd October, programs related to 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will begin. Syedna Saheb has given us a message regarding 150th birth anniversary of the respected Bapu. During the next two years while the programs will go on, he will encourage the country and the world to walk on the path shown by Bapu along with the message of cleanliness.

Today here in Indore, I have come to invite the Dawoodi Bohra community and my brothers and sisters of Madhya Pradesh to join this campaign of cleanliness.

Friends,

On this occasion, I would like to praise you all for another thing. Most of you are associated with trade and business. You have set an example for how work is done systematically and under rules. And how business can be expanded under discipline. Syedna Saheb has taught us the same thing time and again. It is not a small thing. The Dawoodi Bohra community has created its separate identity and respect with these values, wherever they are settled around the world.

You have re-established the example of how business can be carried out with honesty and integrity through your behavior. A businessman of the country is the backbone of its economy. He is extremely important in creating employment opportunities in the country. We are trying to encourage him as much as possible. This is our priority.

However, this too is true that all the fingers of a hand are not equal in size. There are people among us who believe that deceiving is business. In the last four years, the government has successfully sent out the message that everyone must be under law. Honest businessmen are encouraged through several laws like GST and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. And my Bohra community is deriving the maximum advantage out of it. 

This is one of the major reasons that within the last four years, the confidence of the investors within the country and across the world has increased. As per the current situation, under Make in India, we are having record production of mobile phones, cars and other things. Investments are at record level. As a result, we had more than 8% growth rate in the last quarter. This could be achieved due to your efforts and the hard work of 125 Crore Indians. Ours is the fastest growing economy in the world.

Now the country is looking forward to double-digit growth rate. The rate at which we are progressing, I believe that despite myriad challenges, the country can reach the target due to its strength.

Friends,

All of you are playing a crucial role in creating a benign image of India before the world. Just as the ancient India had a shimmering place in the world, we have got the opportunity to bestow the same honor to our 'New India'.

We will relentlessly move forward to rebuild our country. With this belief, I end my speech. I once again thank you all. I offer my heartfelt gratitude to Syedna Saheb and his family. You have always showered your love, affection and blessings on me. Your blessings are my asset and strength. This strength is not for me but for 125 crore Indians. I dedicate these blessings, strength and abundance to my countrymen and once again congratulate you from the bottom of my heart.

Thank you!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will launch the Swachhata Hi Seva movement from September 15th.

As part of an elaborate launch event for this fortnight long movement, the Prime Minister will interact with a cross-section of people from 18 locations across the country, via video conferencing. The people with whom PM will interact include school-children, jawans, spiritual leaders, members of milk and agricultural cooperatives, media persons, local government representatives, railway employees, Self Help Groups, and Swachhagrahis, among others.

The Swachhata Hi Seva movement, which aims at generating greater public participation towards Swachhta, is being organized in the run up to the fourth anniversary of the Swachh Bharat Mission, on October 2nd, 2018, which will also mark the commencement of the 150th year celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.

Earlier, describing this movement as “a great way to pay tributes to Bapu,” the Prime Minister, in a video message to the people, had exhorted people to be “part of this movement and strengthen the efforts to create a Swachh Bharat.”

The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has called upon everyone to become a part of ‘Swachhata Hi Seva Movement’.

The Prime Minister said, “On 2nd October we mark the start of Gandhi Ji’s 150th birth anniversary. It is also the day Swachh Bharat Mission completes 4 years of being a historic mass movement aimed at fulfilling Bapu’s dream of a Clean India.

I salute all those working towards a Swachh Bharat!

The ‘Swachhata Hi Seva Movement’ commences on 15th September. This is a great way to pay tributes to Bapu.

Come, be a part of this movement and strengthen the efforts to create a Swachh Bharat!

At 9:30 AM on 15th, we shall come together and mark the commencement of the ‘Swachhata Hi Seva Movement.’ I look forward to interacting with those who have worked assiduously on the ground to strengthen the Swachh Bharat Mission after which Swachhata activities will begin”.

                This is the first effort on my part to directly interact with all of you. I was told that from almost every block of the country you would be directly interacting with me. ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers as well as ANM are all front line soldiers for nation building. It is extremely difficult to imagine healthy maternity without you. I am glad that you are playing a crucial role in strengthening the foundation stone and the future of the country. You have taken the responsibility of strengthening the safety circle of every mother and child on your shoulders. There are three aspects of this safety circle. First is nutrition that is proper diet, the second is vaccination and the third is cleanliness. It will be wrong to say that people didn't know about these before or schemes pertaining to these aspects were non-existent. Several initiatives have been taken related to these aspects over the years after independence but with little success. Countries with lesser resources are also way ahead of us in these respects. They are doing much better than us. In order to come out of this scenario, we started working on a new strategy in 2014.

All of you are familiar with Mission Indradhanush. Under it, a goal has been set for vaccinating little children in remote and backward areas of the country. You have taken this mission forward at a rapid pace and have helped more than 85 lakh pregnant women to get immunized. The workers of Eastern India and Eastern Uttar Pradesh know that children are exposed to threat of Encephalitis. In order to fight such diseases, 5 new vaccines have been introduced including the one for Japanese Encephalitis under Universal Immunization Programme. Two years back, Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan was launched. Your contribution has been significant in its implementation. You are my companions. Earlier it was said that only God has a thousand arms. Of course, thousand arms cannot be added. It meant that there were 500 people in his team who were the helping hands of God to solve all the problems. Today, the country's Prime Minister can say that he has lakhs of arms instead of a thousand. And you all are my arms, friends.

Friends,

 Health is directly linked to nutrition. Moreover, nutrition is not restricted to only 'what one should eat or how one should eat?' cleaning and immunization are also essential. You might be surprised to know that marriage at a young age is also one of the major reasons of this problem. Marriage and pregnancy should be at the right age. Pregnancy before the right age can threaten the health of both the mother and child.

How the hands must be washed before meal? Several such things are linked to nutrition. Keeping this in mind, National Nutrition Mission was launched across the country from Rajasthan's Jhunjhunu this year. It is an ambitious mission. It is a big challenge but I have not accepted this challenge just for me. Acceptance of this challenge reflects my trust in you. You have proved your worth and you will again do so. We have taken this challenge just because of this trust. If we succeed in delivering these objectives of Poshan Mission to every mother and child then lakhs of lives will be saved. It will give a new impetus to the country's development.

Sometimes we hear that someone saved a drowning person. That person becomes famous in his village. Sometimes we hear that a person has saved the life of another person from getting crushed by a train. All television channels and newspapers start flashing this news. However, you are those people who save the lives of the small and innocent children everyday with your hard work, sacrifice and penance. A doctor saves the lives of innumerable people throughout his life. Sometimes I feel that the ASHA workers and the Anganwadi workers save more lives.

 I salute the 24 lakh+ workers who are striving hard to make this nutrition month successful, for their contribution and for saving the lives of the people day in and day out. Today I have got the opportunity to salute you. I am eager to listen to your challenges, suggestions and experiences during the mission because those inputs will help us to get over the shortcomings of the schemes. The people like us, who are always in Air-conditioned rooms cannot resolve issues that you daily face on the ground. When the entire nation hears you, lakhs of other sisters and workers will also learn from yoour experiences. That is why I want to listen to you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed via Video Conference, the Valedictory Function of the 125th Anniversary of Swami Vivekanand’s Chicago speech, organized by Sri Ramakrishna Math at Coimbatore.

In his address, the Prime Minister said that this celebration, “shows the impact of Swami ji's address - how it changed the way the west saw India and how Indian thought and philosophy found its rightful place.”

The Prime Minister said that Swami Vivekanand introduced the world to the grandeur of Vedic philosophy.“In Chicago, he taught the world about the Vedic philosophy, but he also reminded the country of its rich past and immense potential.He gave us back our confidence, our pride, our roots,” the Prime Minister said. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that with this vision of Swami Vivekanand, “India is going forward with full self-confidence.” He also spoke of various initiatives and schemes of the Government of India.

Following is the text of Prime Minister’s address:

“I consider myself fortunate to be present at this celebration of the 125th anniversary of the address by Swami Vivekanand in Chicago. I am told that there are about four thousand friends, young and old, present here.

Incidentally, 125 years ago, when Swami Vivekanandji spoke at the World Congress of Religions in Chicago, there were about four thousand people in the audience.

I do not know if there is any other example of celebrating the anniversary of a great, inspiring address.

Perhaps not.

This celebration, therefore, shows the impact of Swami ji's address - how it changed the way the west saw India and how Indian thought and philosophy found its rightful place.

The event you have organised makes the anniversary of the Chicago address even more special.

Congrats to everybody associated with the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, the Government of Tamil Nadu, thousands of my young friends assembled here today for being part of the commemoration of the historic address.

This combination of the unique satvik qualities of Saints, and the energy and enthusiasm of the young people assembled here is a symbol of the real strength of India.

I may be far away from you but I can still feel this unique energy.

I have been told that you will not limit this day to just speeches.There are a number of initiatives that the Math has taken up. Competitions have been held in schools and colleges to spread the word of Swami ji.Our young people will debate on important issues and try to find solutions to challenges that confront India today.This spirit of people’s participation, this determination to confront, together, the challenges that face the country, this philosophy of Ek Bharat, Shreshta Bharat - This is the essence of Swami ji’s message.

Friends, through his address Swami Vivekanandshone the light of Indian culture, philosophy and ancient traditions for the entire world.

Many people have written about the address in Chicago. You have, during your deliberations today, also talked about the key points of his address. We will keep going back to Swami Ji's words and learn new things from them.

I will use Swami ji’s own words to describe the effect of his address.In response to a question he was asked in Chennai, he said, “Chicago Parliament was a tremendous success for India and Indian thoughts.It helped on the tide of Vedanta which is flooding the world”.

Friends.

The scale of Swami ji’s achievement looks much greater if you remember the times in which he lived.

Our country was under the shackles of foreign rule.We were poor, our society was looked down upon as backward and indeed, there were many social evils that were part of our social fabric.

The foreign rulers, their judges, their preachers,lost no opportunity to look down upon our thousand years of knowledge and cultural heritage.

Our own people were taught to look down upon their own heritage.They were being cut off from their roots.Swami ji challenged this mindset.He took on the task of clearing the dust of centuries that had accumulated on the knowledge of Indian culture and philosophical thought.

He introduced the world to the grandeur of Vedic philosophy.In Chicago, he taught the world about the Vedic philosophy, but he also reminded the country of its rich past and immense potential.He gave us back our confidence, our pride, our roots.

Swamiji reminded us all that “this is the land from whence, like the tidal waves, spirituality and philosophy have again and again rushed out and deluged the world; and this is the land from whence more such tides proceed in order to bring life and vigour to the decaying races of man-kind”.

Swami Vivekanandji, not only left his mark on the world, but also gave new energy and a new confidence to the freedom movement of the country.

We can do, we are able -with this feeling he awakened the people of the country.This is self-confidence, the confidence that was in every drop of blood of that young Sanyasi.He brought back this self-confidence to the country.His mantra was “believe in yourself, love the country”.

Friends.

With this vision of Swami Vivekanandji, India is going forward with full self-confidence.What can we not achieve if we believe in ourselves and are willing to work hard?

The world has recognised that India has age old traditions like Yoga and Ayurveda for health and wellness;it is also, at the same time, harnessing the power of modern technology.

 Today, when India launches hundred satellites at one go, when the world discusses Mangalyaan and Gaganyaan, when other countries try to replicate our digital apps like BHIM, then it increases the self-confidence of the country further.We are working hard to increase the self-confidence of the poor, the deprived and the under-privileged.The impact of this can be seen in the confidence of our young people and our daughters.

Recently, in the Asian games, our players have shown that no matter how poor you are, no matter what kind of a family you come from, with confidence and hard work, you can make your country proud of you.

The record crop production in the country today shows the same attitude in our farmers.Business-persons of the country, our labourers are accelerating industrial production.Young engineers, entrepreneurs, scientists like you are taking the country towards a new revolution of startups.

Friends.

Swami Ji firmly believed that the future of India depends on the youth.Quoting from Vedas he said, “It is the young, the strong and healthy, of a sharp intellect, that will reach the Lord.”

I am happy to see that today’s youth is marching ahead with a sense of mission.Keeping in mind the aspirations of the youth, the Government is bringing a new work culture and a new approach.Friends, even after 70 years of freedom, while literacy may have increased, many of our young people lack the skills to make them employable.Sadly our Educational System has not given enough emphasis to skills.

Recognizing the importance of skill development for youth, the Government has created a dedicated Ministry for Skill Devlopment.

Besides, our government has opened the doors of the banks for youth who want to achieve their dreams on their own.

Under the Mudra scheme more than 13 crore loans have been given so far. This scheme is playing a significant role in enhancing self-employment in the villages and towns of the country.

The Government is also providing an encouraging platform for Innovative Ideas under the Start Up India Campaign.

 As a result, 8000 Start Ups received Recognition Certificate last year alone as compared to around 800 in 2016.It means a ten foldincrease in one year.

Also, to create an atmosphere of innovation in schools, “Atal Innovation Mission” has been launched.Under this scheme we are working towards establishing 5000 Atal Tinkering Labs across the country in the next 5 years.

To bring forth Innovative Ideas, programmes like Smart India Hackathon are also being implemented.

Friends.

Swami Vivekananda also spoke of our socio-economic problems.He said, there will be equality in the society, when we uplift the poorest of the poor at par with the ones sitting at the top.We have been working in this direction for last four years.Banks are being taken to the doorsteps of the poor through Jan Dhan Accounts and the India Post Payments Bank.Many schemes such as Housing for Houseless Poor, Gas and Electricity Connection, Health & Life Insurance Schemes have been started for upliftment of the poorest of the poor.

On 25th of this month, we are launching Ayushman Bharat Scheme through out the country.Under this scheme free medical treatment of serious diseases upto Rupees five lakh will be ensured to more than 10 crore poor families.I congratulate the Tamil Nadu government and its people for joining this scheme.

Our approach is not only to eradicate poverty but also to root out the causes of poverty in the country.

I must remind you that this day is also the anniversary of a very different kind of event – the terrorist attacks of 9/11 that echoed through the world. The community of nations is trying to find solutions to this problem, but truly, the solution lies in the path that Swamiji showed the world in Chicago – tolerance and acceptance.

Swami ji said “I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance.”

Friends.

We are a country of free ideas.For centuries, this land has been home to diverse ideas and cultures. We have a tradition of ‘discuss’ and ‘decide.’ Democracy and Debate are our eternal values.

But Friends, it is not that our society has got rid of all the evils.In such a large country with unique diversity there are great challenges.

Vivekanand used to say, “There have been devils everywhere more or less in all ages.”We have to be cautious of such evils in our society, and defeat them. We have to remember that, despite all the resources at our disposal, whenever Indian society has been divided, whenever there have been internal conflicts, external enemies have taken advantage.

And during these periods of struggle, our saints, social reformers have shown us the right path – the path that brings us back together.

We have to build a new India with the inspiration of Swami Vivekanand.

I conclude my address with many thanks to all of you.You have given me an opportunity to attend this historic event. Congrats to all those thousands of friends in schools and colleges who read and understood the messages of Swamiji, took part in competitions and won prizes.

Thanks again to all of you.”

                The Prime Minister interacted with the team of three As- the ASHA worker, Anganwadi worker and ANM (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife) from across the country through video conferencing. He appreciated their effort to work together, to use innovative means and technology, to improve the delivery of health and nutrition services and achieve the goal of POSHAN Abhiyan- reduction of malnutrition in the country.

Prime Minister recognised the contribution of grass-root health workers and thanked them for their efforts in building strong and healthy nation. The interaction was organised as part “poshan Maah”,   being observed this month. The programme is aimed towards taking the message of nutrition to every household.

Highlighting the National Nutrition Mission, PM said that ‘Poshan Abhiyaan’ launched from Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan, targets reduction in incidence of stunting, anaemia, malnutrition and low birth weight. He added that it is essential to involve maximum women and children with this movement.

PM said that the Government has focussed on aspects relating to nutrition and quality healthcare. Vaccination efforts are progressing at a quick pace, helping women and children in particular.

The health workers and beneficiaries across the country shared their experiences with PM. Prime Minister appreciated the efforts and dedication of the team three ‘A’ - ASHA, ANM and Anganwadi workers for effective implementation of the Mission Indradhanush and for providing vaccination cover to more than 3 lakh pregnant women and 85 crore children.

During the interaction, Prime Minister urged to spread further information about Surakshit Matritva Abhiyaan.

PM also acclaimed the success of Newborn care, which benefits 1.25 million children of the country every year. It has been renamed as Home based child care under which the Asha worker will visit 11 times in first 15 month in place of earlier 6 visits in first 42 days of birth.

PM highlighted the link between the health and the growth of the nation; he said if the children of the country are weak then its growth would also slow down. For any infant first thousand days of life is very crucial. Nutritious food, dietary habits during this time, decide how its body will become, how it will be in reading and writing and how strong it will be mentally. If a citizen of the country is healthy, no one can stop the development of the country. So, in the initial thousand days, efforts are being made for developing a strong mechanism to secure the future of the country.

It is also noteworthy that according to WHO report, use of toilets under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has potential to save 3 lakh innocent life. PM once again congratulated the fellow citizen for their dedication towards cleanliness.

Prime Minister also mentioned about the first beneficiary of Ayushman Bharat, baby Karishma also famous as Ayushman baby. He added that she has become the symbol of hope for more than 10 crore families who are going to benefit by launch of Ayushman Bharat from Ranchi on 23rd of this month.  

The Prime Minister announced the doubling of routine incentives given by the Union Government to ASHA workers. In addition, all ASHA workers and their helpers would be provided free insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Prime Minister Suraksha Bima Yojana. 

Prime Minister also announced significant increase in the honorarium given to Anganwadi workers. Those receiving Rs. 3000 so far, would  now receive Rs. 4500. Similarly those receiving Rs. 2200, would now get Rs. 3500. The honorarium for Anganwadi helpers has also been increased from Rs. 1500 to Rs. 2250.

Similarly those receiving Rs. 2200, would now get Rs. 3500. The honorarium for Anganwadi helpers has also been increased from Rs. 1500 to Rs. 2250.

 

Prime Minister also announced that Anganwadi workers and helpers using techniques such as Common Application Software (ICDS-CAS), would get additional incentives. The incentives ranging from Rs. 250 to Rs. 500, would be based on performance.

The mission aims to reduce the level of stunting, under-nutrition, anemia and low birth weight babies. Under POSHAN Abhiyaan, the Government has fixed targets to reduce stunting, under-nutrition, anemia (among young children, women and adolescent girls) and reduce low birth weight by 2%, 2%, 3% and 2% per annum respectively.

Towards this end, the Prime Minister’s interaction will bring together various stakeholders involved in the mission. It will also become a platform for sharing and dissemination of success stories in the area of nutrition.

                Your Excellency Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh,

Foreign Minister of India and Bangladesh,

Ms. Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal,

Shri Biplab Kumar Deb, Chief Minister of Tripura,

A few days ago, I met Sheikh Hasinaji at the BIMSTEC Summit in Kathmandu. Before that, we also met at Shantiniketan in May and in London during the Commonwealth Summit in April.

I am glad that today once again I have got the opportunity to interact with you through this video conference.

I have stressed upon the fact several times before that the relationship with the neighboring countries must be like that of close neighbors. We may talk or visit one another whenever we feel like. We must not be tied to protocols for these things.

I can clearly see this intimacy in the relationship with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinaji. Apart from the several meetings, this is our fourth video conference and one more video conference will be organized in the near future.

The most important thing about these video conferences is that the inaugurations of the joint projects of the two countries do not require VIP visits.

Excellency, whenever we talk of connectivity, I always feel like restoring your vision of connectivity prior to 1965. I am extremely delighted to say that we have been taking steps in this direction since the last few years.

Today we have enhanced our power connectivity and we have started two projects to deepen the railway connectivity.

When I visited Bangladesh in 2015, we decided to supply 500 megawatt of additional power to Bangladesh. Thus, the transmission link from Bangladesh is being used in West Bengal for this. I congratulate the Chief Minister Ms. Mamata Banerjee for supporting this work.

With the completion of this project, 1.16 gigawatts power is being supplied to Bangladesh from India. I believe that this quantum leap to gigawatt from megawatt is a symbol of the golden chapter of our relationships.

Our connectivity is also improving in the field of railways. The key aspects of our cooperation include internal connectivity of Bangladesh and connectivity with India.

Once the connectivity of Akhaura-Agartala is completed, another link will be added to our cross-border connectivity. I congratulate Chief Minister Mr. Biplab Kumar Deb for his cooperation in this project.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinaji has set ambitious targets for the development of Bangladesh i.e. becoming a Middle Income country by 2021 and a developed country by 2041. It a matter of great pride for us to support and help them to realize this vision.

I have complete faith that as we enhance our relations and strengthen relationships between people, we will touch new heights of growth and prosperity.

I express my heartfelt gratitude to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and the Chief Ministers of West Bengal and Tripura for supporting this work and attending today's programme.

Thank you.

                Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, Chief Minister of West Bengal - Ms. Mamata Banerjee, and the Chief Minister of Tripura - Shri Biplab Kumar Deb, today jointly inaugurated three projects in Bangladesh, via video conference.External Affairs Minister of India, Ms. Sushma Swaraj, and the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, also joined the video conference from Delhi and Dhaka respectively. 

These include: (a) 500 MW additional power supply from India to Bangladesh, through the existing Bheramara (Bangladesh) - Baharampur (India) interconnection. (b) Akhaura – Agartala Rail Link (c) Rehabilitation of the Kulaura-Shahbazpur section of Bangladesh Railways.  

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister began by recalling that he had met Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina several times in the recent past, including at the BIMSTEC meeting in Kathmandu, in Shanti Niketan, and during the Commonwealth Summit in London. 

He reiterated his view that leaders of neighbouring countries should have a relationship like neighbours, talking and visiting frequently, without getting bogged down by protocol. He said this closeness is evident in the frequent interactions between him and the Bangladesh Prime Minister. 

Prime Minister Modi recalled Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina’s vision of restoring connectivity to the way it was before 1965. He said that he is happy that in the last few years, there has been steady progress towards this goal. He said that today, we have increased our power connectivity, and started two projects to increase our railway connectivity. He recalled that during his visit to Bangladesh in 2015, it had been decided to supply an additional 500 MW power to Bangladesh. He said this is being done using the transmission link between West Bengal and Bangladesh, and thanked the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Ms. Mamata Banerjee for her facilitation in completion of this work. He said that with the completion of this project, 1.16 Gigawatts of power is now being supplied from India to Bangladesh. He said this journey from Megawatts to Gigawatts is symbolic of a golden era in the relations between India and Bangladesh. 

The Prime Minister said that Akhaura-Agartala rail connectivity will provide another link in the cross-border connectivity between the two countries. He thanked the Chief Minister of Tripura, Shri Biplab Kumar Deb, for his facilitation in completion of this work.

Prime Minister Modi appreciated Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s development goals of transforming Bangladesh into a middle income country by 2021, and a developed country by 2041. He said that closer relations and people to people links between the two countries would take our development and prosperity to new heights.

                The Prime Minister, Shri. Narendra Modi, today, inaugurated the Global Mobility Summit in New Delhi.  

Addressing the summit, Prime Minister said that India is on the move, in terms of its economy, infrastructure, youth and many other areas. He said that mobility is a key driver of the economy; it can boost economic growth and create employment opportunities. 

Prime Minister also outlined the vision for the future of mobility in India based on 7 C’s. The 7 C’s are Common, Connected, Convenient, Congestion-free, Charged, Clean and Cutting-edge. 

 

Following is the full text of PM’s address: 

“Excellencies, 

Distinguished Delegates from across the World, 

Ladies and Gentlemen. 

 I welcome you all to the Global Mobility Summit.  

Move - The name of this Summit captures the spirit of India today. Indeed, India is on the Move: 

Our economy is on the Move. We are the world’s fastest growing major economy. 

Our cities and towns are on the Move. We are building one hundred smart cities. 

Our infrastructure is on the Move. We are building roads, airports, rail lines and ports at a quick pace. 

Our goods are on the Move. The Goods and Services Tax has helped us rationalize supply chains and warehouse networks. 

 Our reforms are on the Move. We have made India an easier place to do business.  

Our lives are on the Move. Families are getting homes, toilets, smoke-free LPG cylinders, bank accounts and loans. 

Our youth are on the Move. We are fast emerging as the start-up hub of the world. India is moving ahead with new energy, urgency and purpose   

 

Friends, 

 

We all know that, mobility has been key to the progress of humanity. 

The world is now in the middle of a new mobility revolution. It is, therefore, important to understand mobility as a wider construct.  

Mobility is a key driver of the economy. Better mobility reduces the burden of travel and transportation and can boost economic growth.  It is already a major employer and can create the next generation of jobs.  

 Mobility is central to urbanization. Motorized personal vehicles require ever-growing road, parking, and traffic infrastructure.  

Mobility is a key element of ‘ease of living’. It occupies the minds of virtually every person: in time spent to get to school and work, in frustration with traffic, in the cost of visiting family or moving goods, in access to public transport, in the quality of air our children breathe in concerns around the safety of travel.  

Mobility is critical to preserving our planet. Road transport accounts for one fifth of global Carbon dioxide emissions. This threatens to choke cities and raise global temperatures.  

Creating a mobility eco-system that is in sync with nature is the need of the hour.  

Mobility is the next frontier in our fight against Climate Change. Better mobility can provide for better jobs, smarter infrastructure, and improve the quality of life. It can also reduce costs, expand economic activity and protect the planet. Thus, the mobility sector impacts larger public outcomes.  

 Mobility, especially the digitization of mobility, is disruptive. It has big potential for innovation and it has been setting a searing pace! 

Already, people are calling taxis on their phones, sharing bicycles in cities; buses are running on clean energy, cars are going electric. 

 In India, we have been laying emphasis on mobility. We have doubled our pace of construction of highways.  

We have re-energized our rural road-building programme. We are promoting fuel efficient and cleaner fuel vehicles. We have developed low-cost air connectivity in under-served regions. We are also starting operations on hundreds of new air routes. 

We are pushing waterways in addition to traditional modes like rail and road. 

We are reducing travel distances in our cities by efficient location of homes, schools and offices.  

We have also started data-driven interventions such as intelligent traffic management systems. 

However, we also need to encourage pedestrians and cycling by taking steps ensure their safety and priority. 

 

Friends, 

 

 In a rapidly transforming mobility paradigm, India has some inherent strengths and comparative advantages. Our starting point is fresh. We have little of the legacy of resource-blind mobility.  

We have fewer vehicles per capita than other major economies. Thus, we do not carry much of the baggage of other economies that were built on the back of private car ownership! This gives us the window of opportunity to create an all-new, seamless mobility eco-system. 

On the technology front, our strengths lie in information technology, big data, digital payments, and the internet-enabled shared economy. These elements are increasingly becoming the drivers of the global future of mobility. 

 Our unique identity program, Aadhaar, and its India-stack eco-system, has laid down a comprehensive public digital infrastructure. It has digitally empowered 850 million of our citizens. India can demonstrate how such digital infrastructure can be combined with new mobility business models. 

Our renewable energy push will ensure that the environmental benefits of electric mobility can be fully realized. We plan to draw 175 GigaWatts of energy from renewables by 2022. We are already the fifth largest producer of solar energy in the world. We are also the sixth largest producer of renewable energy. We have also championed the cause of solar energy globally through the International Solar Alliance.  

We have a fast growing manufacturing base, especially in the automotive sector.  

We also have a large, digitally literate, young population. This provides millions of educated minds, skilled hands and aspirational dreams for powering the future.  

Therefore, I am convinced that India is best placed globally, to be an early mover in the ‘Mobility Economy’.  

My vision for the future of mobility in India is based on 7 C’s – Common, Connected, Convenient, Congestion-free, Charged, Clean and Cutting-edge. 

1.     Common: Public Transport must be the cornerstone of our mobility initiatives. New business models driven by digitization, are re-inventing the current paradigm. Big Data is enabling smarter decision-making by better understanding our patterns and needs.  

Our focus must also go beyond cars, to other vehicles such as scooters and rickshaws. Large segments of the developing world depend on these vehicles for mobility. 

2.     Connected mobility implies integration of geographies as well as modes of transport. The internet-enabled Connected Sharing Economy is emerging as the fulcrum of mobility.  

We must leverage the full potential for vehicle pooling and other innovative technical solutions to improve private vehicle utilization. People from villages should be able to bring their produce to the cities with ease and efficiency.  

3.     Convenient mobility means safe, affordable and accessible for all sections of the society. This includes the elderly, the women and the specially abled. We need to ensure that public transport is preferred to private modes of travel. 

4.     Congestion free mobility is critical to check the economic and environment costs of congestion. Hence, there should be emphasis on ending bottlenecks of networks. This would result in fewer traffic jams and lower levels of stress for people travelling.   It would also lead to greater efficiency in logistics and freight. 

5.     Charged mobility is the way forward. We want to drive investments across the value chain from batteries to smart charging to Electric Vehicle manufacturing. India’s business leaders and manufacturers are now poised to develop and deploy break-through battery technology.  

The India Space Research Organization uses one of the best battery systems to run satellites in space. Other institutions can partner with ISRO to develop cost effective and efficient battery systems for electric cars. We want to build India as a driver in Electric Vehicles.  

We will soon put in place a stable policy-regime around electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Policies will be designed as a win-win for all, and enable huge opportunities in the automotive sector.   

6.     Clean Mobility powered by Clean Energy is our most powerful weapon in our fight against Climate Change! This means a pollution-free clean drive, leading to clean air and better living standards for our people.  

We should champion the idea of ‘clean kilometres’. This could be achieved through bio-fuels electric or solar charging. Electric Vehicles in particular can complement our investments in renewable energy.  

We will do whatever it takes, because this is our commitment to our heritage, and our promise to future generations. 

7.     Cutting-edge: Mobility is like the Internet in its early days. It is Cutting-edge.  It is the next big innovation sector. The ‘Move Hack’ and ‘Pitch to Move’ events organized over the past week show how young minds are coming up with creative solutions. 

 Entrepreneurs should see mobility as a sector with immense opportunity for innovation and growth. It is a sector where innovation can help solve problems for public good.

Friends, 

 

I am convinced that the ‘Mobility Revolution’ is an enabler of our growth and development. When India transforms mobility, it benefits one fifth of mankind. It also becomes a scaled success story, for others to replicate. 

Let us build a template, for the world to adopt. 

 In conclusion, let me particularly appeal to the youth of India.  

My young, dynamic friends, this is your opportunity to lead a new era of innovation.  This is the future. This is the sector that will absorb everything from those with doctors to engineers to drivers to mechanics. We should embrace this revolution early, and leverage our strengths to lead the mobility innovation ecosystem both for ourselves and for others.  

The Talent and Technology assembled here today, has the capability of making a transformative mobility shift for India and the World.  

This shift will be based on ‘Caring for our World’, and ‘Sharing with Others’.  

 To quote from our ancient scriptures: 

 

 ॐ सह नाववतु

सह नौ भुनक्तु

सह वीर्यं करवावहै

तेजस्वि ना वधीतमस्तु मा विद्विषावहै

 

Which means: 

May we all be Protected.

May we all be Nourished 

May we work together with great energy

May our intellect be Sharpened 

 

Friends! 

 

 I look forward to see what we can do together.  

This summit is just the beginning. Let us Move ahead. 

Thank you.

Thank You Very Much!

                Greeting the Teachers' community, and paying tribute to Dr. S. Radhakrishnan on Teachers' Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that teachers inspire as well as inform, educate and enlighten. 

In an email sent to lakhs of teachers, the Prime Minister mentioned their tremendous influence on the lives of children, and added that the values inculcated by teachers stay with the students for a lifetime.

The Prime Minister quoted former President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, who had said: ""Teaching is a very noble profession that shapes the character, calibre and future of an individual.""

Shri Narendra Modi said that the 21st century will be shaped by societies that accord topmost importance to education, research, and innovation. ""Needless to say, this makes the role of our teachers extremely vital,"" he added. 

""I am sure you are keeping up-to-date with the latest advances in technology and further connecting your students with the technological trends,"" the Prime Minister wrote in his letter to teachers. He also mentioned some of the efforts that the Government of India is undertaking to bring about a paradigm shift in the education sector. 

""Thanks to the monumental efforts of teachers like you, the focus has successfully shifted from outlays to outcomes, from teaching to learning. The emphasis on skill development has received a significant push due to the Atal Tinkering Labs. Numerous universities are being set up across India so that no youngster is denied the joys of quality education,"" the Prime Minister said. 

Noting that on 2nd October, we mark the start of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi, the Prime Minister exhorted the teaching community to take the lead in furthering the thoughts and noble ideals of Bapu in an innovative manner, among the students. He appreciated the ""stupendous role of the teaching community in strengthening the Swachh Bharat Mission."" 

Reiterating his vision of a New India by 2022, when we mark 75 years of freedom, the Prime Minister urged the teaching community to devote the coming four years towards fulfilling the dreams and vision of those who gave their lives for our freedom. 

""I urge you to focus on any issue close to your heart, mobilise local communities and make a positive difference in the lives of those around you. This would be a fitting tribute to our freedom fighters and further the resolve to build a New India,"" the Prime Minister said.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the awardees of National Teachers’ Awards, 2017 at Lok Kalyan Marg, on the eve of Teachers' Day. The Union Minister for Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar, was also present on the occasion. 

Prime Minister congratulated the awardees for their efforts towards improving the quality of education in the country. He commended their dedication towards education and for making it their life mantra. He said that a teacher remains a teacher throughout life.

During the interaction, Prime Minister urged the awardees to mobilize the community and to make them an integral part of school development. He also exhorted the teachers to work towards bringing out the inherent strength of students, especially those from poor and rural background.

Prime Minister said that the educators should work towards removing the disconnect between the teachers and the students, so that teachers are remembered by the students throughout their life. He also encouraged the teachers to digitally transform their schools and its neighbourhood.

Interacting with the Prime Minister, the awardees narrated their inspirational stories in transforming their schools into centres of learning and excellence. They also thanked the Prime Minister for the new online nomination process and for schemes like Digital India, which is bringing a big qualitative change in school education throughout the country.

This year, the Ministry of Human Resource Development had revised the guidelines for the selection of Teachers for National Awards. The new scheme envisages self-nomination and was inspired by recent innovations in major national awards. The scheme is transparent, fair, and rewards demonstrated excellence and performance.

“As the Asian Games 2018 come to a close, I once again congratulate the Indian contingent for their excellent performance. The 2018 Games have been the best for India in the history of the Asian Games. Every athlete who took part in the Games is India’s pride. 

During the Asian Games 2018, we consolidated our position in events where we have historically been strong and won laurels in those games in which we have not won much previously. This is an extremely positive sign and it augurs well for Indian sports. 

I salute the coaches, support staff, parents, family and friends of the athletes. Thank you for constantly supporting our champions. My best wishes to all our athletes for their future endeavours. 

Congratulations to President Joko Widodo and the people of Indonesia for hosting such a memorable Asian Games 2018. These games witnessed great performances by the athletes and wonderfully manifested the spirit of sportsmanship”, the Prime Minister said in a series of tweets.

                Some people have been congratulating Venkaiah Ji for some reasons.  I am congratulating him for changing his habits. Because when I see Venkaiah Ji in the House I see how much effort he makes to restrain himself. I believe that the effort one is required to make to restrain himself and succeeding in that, is in itself a big thing.If the House functions in an orderly manner, no one pays attention to who is the presiding officer. People don’t pay much attention to what are his or her capabilities and what is special  about the person. And mostly the things that remain at the forefront are what are the capabilities of the members, what are their views.However, when the house doesn’t function the focus is solely on the presiding officer; how he is enforcing discipline; how he is restraining the members. That is why the country was fortunate to get the opportunity to take a close look at Venkaiah Ji in the last year. If the House had worked in an orderly manner then perhaps that opportunity would not been there. I had the opportunity to work with Venkaiah Ji for many years and  we have been groomed in the same political culture. When Venkaiah Ji was Party secretary of Andhra Pradesh I was National secretary. And when he was the Party’s National president I was assisting him in the capacity of a Party General secretary.   So in a way we worked as a team. For Venkaiah Ji responsibilities are more important than the office. 

It has been informed just a while ago that Venkaiah Ji has visited all the states in one year except one state. However, that state was left out not because no programme was chalked out for it. It was left out because helicopter could not reach there; bad weather created troubles otherwise that state too would have been covered. 

We work in the House; sometimes after coming out of a meeting when we think of contacting him we get to know that he had already left; that he had reached Kerala; Tamil Nadu or Andhra. So whatever responsibilities were given to him, he always discharged them fully; put necessary hard work for that and made himself fit for discharging those responsibilities and  that is why he continued to succeed and also made that sector a successful. Fifty years in public life is not a small thing. Ten years in public life as a student and that too as an activist and forty years long political life straight away. And during the 50 years long tenure he  learnt a lot and taught a lot of things to his colleagues. Sometimes  we work with someone so closely; in such a close manner that it becomes difficult to recognize him, to know him. If you are standing ten feet apart from somebody then only you get to know him; however, if you have embraced somebody then it’s difficult to know him. This means that it is very difficult to realisethat we have been very close; but when we hear it from others that our colleague is capable of this thing; that he has these qualities then it gives us immense pride and pleasure that we had the opportunity to work with such a stalwart as a worker. 

Venkiah Ji lays a lot of emphasis on discipline and the situation of our country is like this that it’s very easy to call discipline as undemocratic. If someone insists on discipline a little bit then he is gone. People call him autocrat and what not; people use the entire dictionary against him. However, Venkaiah Ji himself follows the discipline which he expects from others. If someone is required to go on a tour with Venkaiah Ji he must remain very alert. First, he never keeps a watch and he does not keep a pen or money with him either. If you are required to travel with him you should understand that you must keep all these things with you. The good thing is that he never keeps a watch with him but he is so disciplined that he arrives at the programme at the right time which is praiseworthy. Arriving at the programme at the right time and if the programme is not concluded within the allotted time then you will see how uneasy he feels and you would feel like concluding the programme very soon. So discipline is a part of his nature and because of this thing whatever responsibility is given to him, he always works with a vision, he has a holistic view to prepare a roadmap, formulate an action plan and strategy and then making it a success by arranging the resources and by roping in capable people for it. 

First time when he was appointed a Minister, Atal Ji had a plan to assign him a high profile ministry. He was comfortable with English too and he was representing South so Atal Ji thought of inducting him into council of ministers. I was a General secretary then and when he got a hint of this plan he asked me, “Why you people are putting this burden on me?” When I asked him, “What happened!” Then he replied that it was not his work. I asked him, “What will you do then?” He replied, “I will inform Atal Ji about it.” I told him, “Please, you must meet him and share your views.” And you will be surprised to know that he went to Atal Ji and urged not to assign such high profile ministries to him. He asked Atal Ji for Rural Development ministry saying that he would like to dedicate his life to this thing. So by not accepting the high profile ministries which are considered having some value,  he said he wanted rural development. By his very nature he is a farmer. He is a farmer by vocation and inclination. Doing something for farmers, representing farmers, this thing is so deeply embedded in his mind that he has lived his life like this and because of this he takes interest in rural development. And as Arun Ji had said that Prime Minister’s Rural Road Progamme has always been the most effective programme of all the governments. All MPs want Prime Minister Rural Road Scheme for their area. The credit for putting this into minds of MPs goes to  ShrimanVenkaiah Ji. Similarly, water, water in the rural lives, drinking water, it is one of the tasks for which he has dedicated himself. He used to dedicate his time and energy for this. Even today if the discussion on such topics is being postponed in the House he is the one who gets disturbed the most. When it comes to issues like  villages and farmers then his views are like this: “At least have a discussion in the House that what is happening there.” So the uneasiness that is there in him that is for the welfare of the common man, it is for the aspirations of the common man. 

Those who would have heard him speaking in Telugu you just can’t match his speed in speech. He speaks so fast that you would feel as if you are sitting in a local train and he is running it like a superfast train. He speaks so fast! And it is a thing to watch the way he articulates the most impactful thing in his speech. And his rhyming is very natural. And it’s not like that it only happens in public speeches. He talks in such a manner even if someone is sitting next to him. In the House everybody is benefitting from this.I congratulate the entire team that has made this small effort to provide account of his first year in office to the entire country. And I believe that it makes you realise that how to utilise this institution for the welfare of the society, how to bring newness and momentum in it through this office. And this book has outlined  how this institution itself has been moving ahead and cooperating in discharging other tasks of the country. 

In a way it seems like that it is the account of one year in office of Mr. Vice President but when you look at it we find that we also figure at some or other place in this family album. You spot some MP or some vice chancellor or some chief minister or some governor so this thing can also be seen how efforts have been made to remain in touch with work in far flung areas. 

I convey my best wishes to Venkaiah Ji. And the desire which he has in his mind that the House should function in the proper manner that there should be a full discussion in the House and such issues should be raised in the house that are useful for the country. I believe that his dream about this will be realized through his constant efforts. I convey my best wishes to Venkaiah Ji. Thank you very much!

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today released the book “Moving On, Moving Forward – A Year in Office” to mark one year in office of Vice President Venkaiah Naidu. He also presented the first copy of the book to the Vice President of India. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that he had the opportunity to work with Shri Venkaiah Naidu for several years. He said that Shri Naidu laid emphasis on responsibility (Karyabhaar), above all else.

The Prime Minister said that Shri Venkaiah Naidu always performed whatever duty he had, with utmost diligence, and adapted into that role with ease. He has been in public life for 50 years- 10 years in student politics and 40 years in state as well as national politics, the Prime Minister added. 

Shri Narendra Modi said that Shri Venkaiah Naidu has the ability to endear himself to people across all sections, while also being a disciplinarian.He provides visionary leadership whenever he gets a responsibility. He gets the best experts to ensure justice is done to the work assigned, the Prime Minister added. 

The Prime Minister recalled that when former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee wanted to include Shri Venkaiah Naidu in his Cabinet, then Venkaiahji had requested for the Rural Development portfolio. Venkaiah Ji is a farmer at heart, and is passionate about the welfare of farmers and agriculture. 

The Prime Minister said that the Pradhan Mantri Gram SadakYojana came into being due to the efforts of Shri Venkaiah Naidu. In a time when political discourse was centredaround train stoppages only, Naidu ji ensured that leaders began to think more about roads and other forms of connectivity, the Prime Minister added. 

The Prime Minister praised the Vice President for his oratory and his way with words, be it English or Telugu. He said that it is commendable that the Vice President has presented a report card of sorts about his first year in office, containing the rich work he has done both inside and outside Parliament.

                My colleague in the council of ministers present here on the dais  Mr. Manoj Sinha Ji, CEO of the India Post Payments Bank, Secretary of Postal Department, all other colleagues from IPPB, all the dignitaries present here and ladies and gentlemen,

As Manoj Ji has informed us that at this point of time several thousand employees of the department of post and other citizens who are present there, nearly some 20 lakh people have joined us in this program through technology. Several governors and chief ministers, our colleagues in the council of ministers and ministers of the state governments, members of parliament and legislatures they all are also present there. I also welcome all of them in this event and I also bow down to all of them on this important occasion. 

Our minister Mr. Manoj Sinha Ji is an IITian and because of his education at IIT he naturally connects everything with the technology that is why this program is also completely technology driven too and this initiative is also technology driven. Manoj Ji took personal interest in taking forward this thing. He received valuable inputs in this task because of his own background in technology. And it is the result of all these things that the country is getting a generous reward today. And today’s date, the first September, will be remembered in the country for beginning of a novel and unprecedented facility. 

In a way the path for fulfilling our pledge of providing banking services to every poor person of the country, to every nook and corner of the country, to our tribal people living in dense forests, to people inhabiting remote islands, in a way to every Indian at their doorsteps, has been opened today through this beginning. I congratulate to the people of the country for this new service. 

Brothers and sisters, 

India Post Payments Bank is going to bring about a massive change in the economic and social system of the country. Our government has earlier linked millions and millions of poor families to the banks through Jan-Dhan accounts. And today we are starting the task of taking the banks to the doorsteps of villages and poor through this initiative.  ‘Your Bank at Your Doorstep’, this is not just a slogan. It is our commitment, it is our dream. And steps have been taken constantly, one after another to realise this dream. Today, the branches of India Post Payments have been starting in 650 districts of the country and our postmen distributing the letters have now become mobile banks too. 

On my way to the program, I visited an exhibition just a while ago, I have been told in detail about how the work will be executed and it is possible that you people too would have seen it on the screen. And when I was visiting the exhibition then the experts those who were present there, explained me all these things, at that time I had a kind of self confidence that by working with this kind of colleagues, given their dedication to the work, this novel initiative by them will certainly produce results. 

And I still remember that there was a time, and as far as a postman is concerned then I believe that several things are said in our country, people’s faith in the government might have wavered but the faith in the postman has always been unwavering. Very few people would be aware about this thing. Perhaps, those who are familiar with the rural life they would be aware about this thing that when a postman was visiting one village from another then he used to carry a spear in one hand and ankle-bells were fastened to spear, and when he used to move around then the ankle-bells would ring. And when he used to move from one village to another then when the ankle-bells tied on the spear used to ring then it used to announce that he was a postman and no thief or robber would bother him no matter how difficult terrain or remote the area may be, no one would bother him no matter how risky the area may be and even if it was infested by dacoits or inhabited by thieves and robbers. Even those thieves and robbers were aware that that postman was on his way to deliver a money order for some poor mother. 

Now you will find a watch in some corner in every house, however, you might be aware that there was a time when there were no watches in villages except in those few villages where perhaps some tower was located. And I have come here after leading that life so I know that earlier those old people who used to sit outside their homes they certainly used to ask, “Whether the postman has come?”

There would be hardly any old person who would not ask this thing three four times a day that whether the postman had come or not. People might think that whether they were expecting some letter, but the letter was not to come, and they did not ask for the letters, they knew that if the postman had come then this would be the time in the clock, it means the punctuality of time. Things in our social life were decided on the basis of whether the postman had come or not. Therefore in a way, the postman was linked emotionally to every family through letters and that is why the postman also had a special acceptability and respect in the society. 

Today, technology has changed a lot of things in this era but the postman still has the same feeling and credibility with regard to letters as earlier. In a way, postman and post office have been an important part of our lives, our society, our films, our literature and our folklores. All of us have watched the advertisement that was screened just a while ago – Dakia Dak Laya (Postman has brought letters), this kind of songs have been seen by the people as part of their lives for decades. And from now on the postman has also brought bank along with letters.   

I have been to Canada several decades ago and I watched a film in Canada and I still remember name of the film – Air Mail and it was truly a hair raising film, it’s based on the postal system. And the basis of the film was the importance of letters in our lives. The film depicted an aircraft, letters were carried through the aircraft but unfortunately it crashed. However, the movie tells the entire story of collection and delivery of all the letters from the crashed aircraft after this accident. How the efforts were made to retrieve those letters, and the postmen were trying to protect those letters as efforts are being made to save a person’s life. Perhaps, this movie might still be available on YouTube, if it is there then you people must watch it. And what kind of affection, message, concerns and complaints were there in those letters. The sense of belongingness and affinity in the letters is their soul. I receive hundreds of letters even today. The workload of postal department has gone up since the time I have assumed office here. Somebody only writes a letter when he has faith in you. And thousands of letters are received every month in response to my program–Mann Ki Baat. These letters establish my direct dialogue with the people. When I read those letters then I feel that the sender of the letter is before me and he is conveying his thoughts straight away to me. 

Friends, the approach of our government is in tune with the time. Necessary changes have been made in the systems as per the requirement of the future. We are not those people who are stuck in the past, we are the people who adapt with the time. We are the people who accept technology. We are in favor of developing the systems according to the needs of the country, society and time. Now India Post Payments Bank has also joined in the series of several similar efforts like GST, Aadhaar and Digital India. Our government is not like that that will leave old systems as it is but it has been doing the job of reforming, performing and transforming them. And with the help of a changing technology, and mediums too have changed, even if they have changed but the objective of both of them is still the same. It’s true that email has replaced the inland letter but objective of both are still the same. And therefore the technology which had challenged the post offices, because people were apprehensive that now whether the department of post will survive or not? Whether postmen will survive or not? Whether their jobs will be safe or not? All these issues were discussed and the challenge which was posed by the technology, we have been moving ahead by making the same technology as the basis of converting that challenge into an opportunity. 

India’s department of post has the kind of system in the country which has more than 1.5 lakh post offices and 1.25 lakh out of the total are located in village areas. More than three lakh postmen and rural post volunteers have been connected to the people of the country. Our government has taken upon itself to connect such a vast network with technology to convert it into the most powerful system for service delivery in the 21st century. Now the postman has a smart phone in one hand and he has a digital device in his bag.

Friends, 

This post payments bank that is symbol of unity, equity, inclusion, service and trust, now has the capacity to strengthen not only the banking system of the country but also to strengthen the system of digital payments. Even the most ordinary businessman can open its current account to run its business in addition to opening a saving account. The workers of UP and Bihar who have been working in Mumbai or Bengaluru could now easily send money to their families. He will not have to go anywhere to pay his electricity and phone bills. Not only this, the Post Payments Bank will be able to offer loans by entering into partnership with other banks and financial institutions. It will also offer services like investment and insurance to its customers. The most important feature is that all the services will be provided by the postman at your doorstep in addition to bank counters. 

The postman will also be able to resolve the issues in the difficulties faced by the customers in communicating with the bank or while doing digital transactions with the bank. How much money you had deposited, how much interest you have earned, what’s the balance in your account, now all these things will be told to you at your home by the postman. This is not just a bank but it is going to turn out to be a trusted partner of the village, and of the poor and middle class people. 

Now you need not remember your bank account or account number or to tell the password to anyone. All the procedures of this bank have been made very simple given the rural circumstances. That is why your account will be opened in the new bank in a few minutes. And our minister informed that it would take one minute at maximum. And a QR card will also be given to the account holder, it has been given to me just now because my account has also been opened. The one who does not siphon off that person too keeps a bank account. 

You people would be surprised to know that in my life I never had a bank account. However, when I was studying in a school then Dena Bank had a scheme, they used to provide a piggy bank to children and used to open an account. So they also gave it to me but mine remain empty always. However, later I left the village but the bank account continued to exist and bank staff was required to carry it forward every year. Bank people were looking for me to close down my account but my whereabouts were not certain. After nearly 32 years they came to know that I was about to visit some place that day so they came there and asked me to sign on the paper so that they can close the account. However, when I was elected an MLA in Gujarat then the salary was paid so I had to open a bank account. Prior to that I had no relations with them and today Post Bank people have opened one more account. 

See, it’s not like that the postman only delivers the mail. And those families were not educated then the postman used to open the letter and read them the entire content. And then that old mother used to ask that she wanted to write back to her son and she will ask the postman to bring a post card the next day so that she can communicate her reply to the postman. And the next day the postman used to bring a postcard, the mother used to narrate her reply and he used to write. It means what an affectionate system. Now my postman will again do the same thing through technology. It means a QR Card, impression of your finger and the statement of the postman, they are going to make banking easier and allay any apprehension. 

Friends,  

IPPB is also going to turn out to be a big facility for the farmers because of the strongest network that it has in villages. Several schemes like Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana will be specially strengthened because of it. Whether we need to settle the claim in time or we need to link farmers with the scheme, this bank is certainly going to be beneficial. Now with the start of Post Payments Bank the claim amount under the schemes will be disbursed at the doorsteps. In addition to this, this bank will also provide momentum to the movement of saving money in the name of daughters under Sukanya Sammriddhi Yojana. 

Brothers and sisters,

Our government has brought the banks of the country to the doorsteps of the poor. Otherwise, there was such a situation until four-five years ago that most of the funds of these banks were reserved for the select few people who were close to one family. You just think that, after independence and till 2008, it means from 1947 to 2008, all the banks of our country advanced loans worth Rs. 18 lakh crore. Total Rs. 18 lakh crore during this entire period but after 2008, in just six years, it means what happened in sixty years and what happened in six years! Rs. 18 lakh crore in sixty years and then within next six years this amount swelled to Rs. 52 lakh crore. It was like, “Please take it. Later Modi will come. He will protest, please take it away.” 

It means the amount of loan that was disbursed by the banks of the country after independence, the same amount of loan was given during the six years of previous government. It was like, “You are happy, I am happy. And how these loans were given.” This technology has just come to our country. At that time there was a special tradition. The tradition of ‘Phone Banking’. 

 

And that kind of phone banking was prevalent at that time. If ‘Naamdars’ (individuals with powerful names) made a call then the banking sector and those people who sanctioned the loans, sanctioned them due to those phone calls…loans were eventually sanctioned. Those rich…big businessmen needed a loan…they used to arrange a phone call to bank from powerful people. And the banking people will sanction loans worth billions and trillions of rupees to that individual or company in no time. Those phone calls from ‘Naamdars’ (individuals with powerful names) powerful names were above all the rules and regulation. The ‘Phone Banking’ practiced by Congress and their ‘Naamdars’ (individuals with powerful names) have caused a lot of damage to the country. Now this question also arises that why banks did not refuse to entertain this kind of ‘Phone Banking’. 

Friends, 

You people are aware that at that time the most of appointments in banks were made because of the blessings of those ‘powerful individuals’. It was because of influence of ‘Naamdars’ (individuals with powerful names) that even the top officials of the banking sector were not able to refuse to give loans. This was the biggest reason behind advancing twice the loan in the six years. Despite banks being aware about this thing that the recovery of loans advanced by them will be difficult, they knew that they must give loans to some ‘privileged people’. 

They knew that it will not be recovered but they were forced to comply. It was not only this, when this kind of people started defaulting in repayments of loan then again pressure was mounted on banks to advance ‘fresh loans’ to them. And all these irregularities were carried out in the names of restructuring of the loans. 

It means if a loan has been obtained then the due amount was passed on to the certain people. And now since that person has been seeking another loan so give him another loan, so the response was: ‘I will do that.’

That person gives loan, this person gives loan, this and that person give loan, and this was the cycle which was constantly followed. And those people who have been involved in this kind of irregularities, they knew it very well that they will be eventually exposed some day so they resorted to one more irregularity, one more conspiracy was hatched from that time itself to conceal the correct data from the country about the amount of loans given by the banks that was not being repaid. The country was kept in the dark. It means those lakhs and crores of rupees that were stuck, that amount was not properly declared in an appropriate manner on papers. It was concealed. A falsehood was committed on the country that the amount of loans which is to be recovered is just two lakh crore rupees and it was not made clear whether it will be repaid or not. At the time when large scams were getting exposed in the country, then the previous government had put its entire effort in concealing this biggest scam committed by them. And certain people in the banks were helping these ‘Naamdars’ (individuals with powerful names) in this thing too.

When our government was formed in 2014 then the complete picture started to emerge. Then the banks were sternly told to provide the complete information about the amount of money given by them which was stuck, this kind of dealings, and the amount which was yet to be recovered through a proper assessment. They were told to provide complete information. The money which was given in those six years, the truth about them is that the correct amount which was claimed to be Rs. 2 or 2.5 lakh crore was actually Rs. 9 lakh crore. 

Today, the country will be surprised to hear about this thing that what a big fraud was committed on it. How many lies were spread before the country? This amount is constantly going up day by day because of the levy of interest on daily basis. In the coming days, this amount will further go up because interest will be levied in any case, the banks will complete their paper work in any case. 

Friends, 

We have realized this thing soon after formation of our government in 2014 that this ‘Naamdar’ (individual with powerful name) has left by leaving such a landmine for the economy that if the truth about this thing was told to the country and the world at that time then it would have caused such an explosion that perhaps it would have become difficult to manage the economy. 

That is why we had been working day and night to work in an extremely careful manner, in a very detailed manner to bring the country out of this crisis. 

Brothers and sisters,

Our government has brought the truth about NPA, has brought about the scams of the previous government before the country. Not only we have diagnosed the problem but we have also searched the reasons behind it and we have also taken several steps to cure the disease. In the last years, every loans worth more than Rs. 50 crore has been reviewed. It has been ensured that all the conditions of the loans are strictly adhered to. 

We have amended the laws. We have decided to merge banks. We encouraged professional approach in the banking sector. Reforms have been carried out constantly to improve the public sector banks. Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill; the process to seize the properties of absconders have been started. Arrangements have also been made so that these absconders cannot take away a part of their properties. Government has decided to keep the details of the passports of big borrowers in its custody so that it is not easy for them to run away from the country. 

The recovery of NPAs has started through bankruptcy code and NCLT. Action has been taken at a fast speed against those twelve large defaulters who were given loans before 2014, the amount of NPA in these cases is nearly Rs. 1.75 lakh crore. Now the results are also becoming visible of these steps. Similarly, in addition to these 12, there are 27 others, they too have big loan accounts that have NPAs of nearly Rs. 1 lakh crore. The arrangements are being made in a very strong manner to recover this amount. And those who were under the impression that because of the cooperation and grace of those ‘Naamdars’ (individuals with powerful names) that they will always be able to keep the lakhs and crores of rupees with them, those who thought that it will always be incoming, now the money has also started to go out from those people’s accounts. 

There is a new change in the country, a new culture is there, and the culture is changing. Earlier the bank used to run after them. Now we have created such a web of laws that they themselves are running to repay the loans. It's like, “Brother, please do something, please accept part payment, I will pay some more the next month. Somebody, please save me.” Now these people themselves are running after the bank. They have been forced to return the money. 

In addition to the banking system that is made stronger with each passing day, now the grip of enforcement agencies is being further tightened on these people. And I would like to assure the country once again that out of all these big loans there is not a single loan which is being sanctioned during this government. We have constantly changed the situation of the banks and directions given to them after assuming the office. And today’s program is also an important step in that direction. Earlier loans were given to the big people with the blessings of ‘Naamdars’ (individuals with powerful names), now the job of giving bank loans to the poor people has been shifted into the hands of our postman. 

In the last four years, the loans worth more than Rs. 13 lakh crore has been given to the poor and middle class youth under the Mudra scheme for self-employment. Jan-Dhan accounts of more than 32 crore poor people have been opened. Our government has provided the safety cover of insurance and pension to more than 21 crore poor people on payment of only one rupee per month and 90 paise per day premium. 

Brothers and sisters,

Our government has diffused the landmine on which our country’s economy was placed by the ‘Naamdars’ (individuals with powerful names).Today the country is full of a new confidence. On the one hand, India and our players, have given their best ever performance, on the other the country has got a new medal as per the newly released data of economic growth. The new data which have been released, they are a proof of strengthening of the country’s economy, they are a proof of confidence being instilled in it. Development taking place at a rate of 8.2% reflects the growing strength of Indian economy.  This presents a brighter image of a New India. Not only these numbers are good but they are much more than the numbers anticipated by the experts. 

When the country moves in the right direction, when the intent is right then we get to see this kind of positive results.

Friends, 

It has become possible due to the hard work, dedication and commitment of 1.25 billion people.  Our youth, our women, our farmers, our entrepreneurs, our workers, this is the result of the hard work by all of us, this is the result of the hard work by all of them that the country is developing at a rapid pace today. 

Today, not only India is the world’s fastest growing economy but it has also become the fastest country for eradicating poverty. GDP numbers are a testimony to the fact that India has been moving forward on its own strength due the dedication and struggle by 1.25 billion Indians. 

I once again would like to tell the country that whatever amount of the banks have been stuck because of ‘Naamdars’ (individuals with powerful names) we are going to get it back in any case. It will be used for empowering the poorest of the poor person of the country. India Post Payments Bank will play an important role in this thing. 

Banking, Social Safety Schemes, Direct Benefit Transfer, Passport Seva, Online Shopping and several other such schemes to reach to every village and every household in an effective way will be done through IPPB and Post Office. 

It means that our postman, India Post Payments Bank are going to present themselves in a new form before the country to further strengthen the path of Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas. And I am happy that more than three lakh Dak Sevaks are fully ready to take this huge mission to every village, to every house, to farmers and to small traders. Dak Sevaks will not only help people in carrying out digital transactions but they will also provide them training so that they themselves can carry out banking and digital transactions from their phones. So in this manner, our Dak Babus will not only become bankers but they are going to become digital teachers too. 

Government has also taken several important decisions given the role played by these people in service to the nation. Government has fulfilled the old demand related to wages and perks of rural Dak Sevaks in this July. It has been ensured that it will benefit more than 2.5 lakh rural Dak Sevaks of the country. Earlier, there were a dozen slabs in the time related perks that were paid to them. Now they have been reduced to three. In addition to this, the perks which were paid to them they were in the range of Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 4,000, now they have been enhanced to Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 14,000. Given the difficult situation that they have been working in, a new perk has been started. It is for women rural Dak Sevaks, it is the provision for a maternity leave of 180 days, it means six months, with full payment has been provided for. 

Average wages of rural Dak Sevaks have gone up by more than 50% due to the efforts made by the government. I have been told that online recruitment process has already been started to fill the vacant posts of Dak Sevaks. These decisions will be helpful in further strengthening of our strongest representative of India Post Payments Bank. 

Friends,

Today, this service is taking off in more than three thousand places in our country. And as Manoj Sinha Ji informed that in the next few months more than 1.5 lakh post offices will be linked to this service. 

This new system of a New India will also get support from the strong telecom infrastructure of the country. I conclude my speech by conveying my best wishes to the people of the country for this new system, for a new bank, and for a new facility and also by once again expressing my respect and regard for all our colleagues in the postal service. 

Once again I convey my best wishes to every employee of the postal department and to the every person connected with this bank and I sincerely thank them. 

And I also convey my best wishes to Manoj Sinha Ji as his IIT background helped me a lot in this thing, technology has helped me a lot and I also thank Mr. Minister for providing leadership to this project. 

Thank you.

                The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched the India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) at Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi. The function was witnessed at over 3000 locations across the country, which were connected to the main event in Delhi. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that through the India Post Payments Bank, banking services will conveniently reach the remotest places in the country, and the people living there. 

He recalled that the Union Government had earlier rolled out the Jan Dhan Yojana to establish financial inclusion. He said that today’s launch of IPPB is one more step to achieve this objective. He said IPPB branches have opened across 650 districts today. 

The Prime Minister said that the postman has long been a respected and accepted person in the villages. He said the trust on the postman remains, despite the advent of modern technology. He said that the Government’s approach is to reform existing frameworks and structures, and hence, transform them in accordance with the changing times. He said that there are over 1.5 lakh post offices and over three lakh postmen or “grameen dak sevaks” who are connected to the people of the country. Now they shall be empowered with smartphones and digital devices to provide financial services. 

Enumerating the benefits of IPPB, he said it will enable money transfer, transfer of government benefits, bill payments and other services such as investment and insurance. He added that postmen would deliver these services at the doorstep. He said that IPPB will also facilitate digital transactions, and help deliver the benefits of schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which provide assistance to farmers. 

The Prime Minister said that since 2014, the Union Government has been dealing firmly with the distortions and problems that had arisen in India’s banking sector due to indiscriminate loan advances. He said existing loans have been reviewed and a professional approach has been taken with regard to the banking sector. He mentioned other measures such as the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, which have been taken to ensure that the guilty are punished. 

The Prime Minister said that now Mudra loans worth over 13 lakh crore rupees have been given to the poor and middle class, for creating self-employment opportunities. He said that today, as India achieves its best ever Asian Games performance, and the economy shows excellent growth numbers, the entire country is full of new self-confidence. He said this is the result of the collective efforts of the people. He said today India is not just the fastest growing economy in the world, but also the country that is eradicating poverty the fastest.

The Prime Minister said that 3 lakh “dak sevaks” would be the key to provide financial services to every home, every farmer and every small enterprise in the villages. He mentioned that in recent months, several steps have been taken for the welfare of “dak sevaks” and to meet their long pending demand. These have led to a substantial increase in their salary, he added. He expressed confidence that IPPB shall reach over 1.5 lakh post offices across the country within the next few months.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has  given its approval for signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK).  It will help to establish mutual co-operation and collaboration in the areas of knowledge sharing through joint research, quality support, capability and capacity building, trainee accountant exchange programmes and conducting Continuous Professional Development (CPD) Courses, workshops and conferences.

 

Details:

 


	ICAI and ICPAK will provide opportunities to key members of the reciprocal body's staff to learn from their knowledge and experience through informal work placements to be agreed through a work schedule.


 


	Jointly promote activities to raise awareness and the overall visibility of the ICAI/ ICPAK strategic partnership and the collaboration outlined in this MoU with members.


 


	ICAI and ICPAK will collaborate on benchmarking initiatives and trainee accountant exchange programmes.


 

Major impact:

 

India is Kenya's sixth largest trading partner and the largest exporter to Kenya.  As per a report on African counties.  The Kenyan economy is expected to be amongst the top performers in Africa in 2017 in terms of growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  Kenya has a largely diversified economic base and aims to seek increased access to the Indian market for Kenyan goods, while India is interested in exploring ways to become Kenya's top foreign trading partner.

 

Considering that Kenya's economy is one of the top amongst the African countries and the kind of investments and trusts entrusted by the two counties in the recent past, India's Chartered Accountants have already been playing a significant role in the economic growth of the country; there is a lot of scope for professional opportunities for Indian Chartered Accountants in Kenya.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has  approved providing Central Assistance of Rs. 620.42 Cr. and Rs. 205.758 Cr. for implementation of relining of Rajasthan Feeder Canal and Sirhind Feeder Canal respectively over five years (2018-19 to 2022-23) for Relining of Sirhind Feeder from RD 119700 to 447927 and relining of Rajasthan Feeder from RD  179000to 496000 of Punjab. 

 

Impact:

 


	Implementation of these twin projects would help in addressing the problem of water-logging in 84800 Ha of land in Muktsar, Faridkot and Ferozpur districts in South-West Punjab.


 


	Implementation of these projects would address the problem of water logging in South-West Punjab and enhance the flows/ water availability in the two canals.


 


	Farmers in the area would be benefitted due to stabilisation / improved irrigation  in   98,739 Ha of land due to relining  of   Rajasthan Feeder and 69,086 Ha due to relining of Sirhind Feeder.


 

Expenditure:


	Funding for CA to the Rajasthan Feeder and Sirhind feeder shall be made through NABARD under existing system for funding of 99 PMKSY-AIBP projects under LTIF.


 


	In addition to existing monitoring mechanism for projects by Central Water Commission, an Expert Project Review Committee may be constituted to oversee the overall implementation of these projects.
	The approved cost of relining of Sirhind Feeder Canal is Rs. 671.478 Cr and that of relining of Rajasthan Feeder Canal is Rs. 1305.267 Cr, at 2015 PL. Of the total estimated cost, Rs. 826.168 Cr would be provided as Central Assistance (Rs. 205.758 Cr for Sirhind Feeder and Rs. 620.41 Cr for Rajasthan Feeder).


 


	Investment Clearance of Revised Cost Estimates amounting to Rs.671.478 crore and Rs.1305.267 crore for Relining of Sirhind Feeder and Relining of Rajasthan Feeder respectively have been accorded on 6th April, 2016.


 


	The projects were visited by a team under Chairman CWC during 2016 and by another team under Sh. A. B.   Pandya, former Chairman, CWC during 2017.  They recommended remedial works to be taken up. The Punjab Government also    conveyed    its    financial concurrence on 26.04.2018.


 

Background

 

Sirhind and Rajasthan Feeders take off upstream of Harike Head works and flow through Punjab before crossing over to Rajasthan. The twin canals have a common bank and were constructed in the 1960s as lined (brick) channels to convey water to command  areas in Punjab and Rajasthan.

 

The Government of Punjab has reported considerable seepage loss due to damages in the lining of both Sirhind and Rajasthan Feeders. As a result, apart from reduced flows in these canals, the adjacent areas have been affected by water logging causing huge agricultural losses.

 

The project would mitigate water logging problem and enhance the flows/ water availability in the two canals.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the extension of timeline for implementation of the Special Package under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) for Jammu & Kashmir for another period of one year during 2018-19.  

 

The Cabinet also approved allocation of funds to the State under DAY-NRLM on a need basis for implementation of the Special Package without linking it with poverty ratio. There is no additional financial implication as the approval is to extend the time line to cover two thirds of the vulnerable households in the State within in the originally approved financial outlay of Rs. 755.32 crore.  An amount of Rs.143.604 crore will be required for the period of one year during 2018-19.

 

Impact:


	This will help in covering all the vulnerable rural households in the State (estimated at two thirds of the total number of households) within a definite time frame. 
	It will ensure mobilization of households under the auto inclusion category and households with at least one deprivation category listed in the Socio Economic Caste Census – 2011.
	It will also ensure coverage of all the blocks in Jammu & Kashmir under DAY-NRLM and ensures social inclusion, social development, promotion of livelihoods leading to poverty alleviation in the State.


 

Background:

 

Due to unavoidable reasons and disturbed conditions in the State, the Special Package as approved in May 2013 could not be fully implemented. Now, the State Government has requested Government of India to consider extension of the earlier approved implementation schedule of the Special Package and continued funding of DAY-NRLM in Jammu and Kashmir on a demand driven basis without linking allocation with poverty ratio during this extended period.  Hence the approval by the Cabinet which will give a boost to the vulnerable rural families in Jammu & Kashmir.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Policy framework to promote and incentivize Enhanced Recovery (ER)/ Improved Recovery (IR)/ Unconventional Hydrocarbon (UHC) production Methods/techniques to improve recovery factor of existing hydrocarbons reserves for augmenting domestic production of oil and gas. The ER includes Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR), Unconventional Hydrocarbon (UHC) production methods include Shale oil and gas production, tight oil and gas production, production from oil shale, gas hydrates and heavy oil. Enhanced Recovery, Improved Recovery and exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons are capital intensive, technologically complex and challenging in nature. It calls for supporting infrastructure, logistic support, fiscal incentives and enabling environment. 

The strategic objective of the Policy is to build a supportive ecosystem through academic and research institutes, industry- academia collaboration and to support and encourage Exploration and Production (E&P) Contractors to deploy ER/IR/UHC Methods/ techniques. The Policy will be applicable to all contractual regimes and Nomination fields. This policy initiative is expected to spur new investment, provide impetus to economic activities and generate additional employment opportunities. The Policy is expected to facilitate induction of new,innovative and cutting-edge technology and forging technological collaboration to improve productivity of existing fields.

The Policy envisages systemic assessment of every field for its ER potential, appraisal of appropriate ER techniques and fiscal incentives to de-risk the cost involved in ER Projects to make the investment financially viable. Mandatory Screening of fields through designated institutions, to be notified by Government, and conducting Pilot before actual implementation of ER Project on commercial level, are other prominent features of the Policy. An Enhanced Recovery (ER) Committee comprising of representatives of Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), experts from upstream sector, and academia would monitor and implement the Policy. The Policy, having a sunset clause, will be effective for 10 years from the date of its notification. However, the fiscal incentives will be available for a period of 120 months from the date of commencement of production in ER/UHC projects. In case of IR Projects, the incentives will be available from the date of achievement of the prescribed benchmark. Defined timelines have been prescribed to complete the various processes under the Policy. The fiscal incentives are extended in form of partial waiver of applicable Cess/Royalty on incremental production resulting from the adoption of ER methods on designated wells.

Technological interventions have significant potential in stimulating the recovery of hydrocarbon reserves from the matured/aging fields. An increase by 5% in recovery rate of original in-place volume in oil production is envisaged producing 120 MMT additional oil in next 20 years. In case of gas, an increase of 3% recovery rate on original in- place volume is envisaged, leading to additionalproduction of 52 BCM of gas in next 20 years.

                Giving a major boost to the pro-farmer initiatives of the Government and in keeping with its commitment and dedication for the Annadata, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved a new Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan’ (PM-AASHA).  The Scheme is aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce as announced in the Union Budget for 2018. 

 

This is an unprecedented step taken by Govt. of India to protect the farmers’ income which is expected to go a long way towards the welfare of farmers.  Government has already increased the MSP of kharif crops by following the principle of 1.5 times the cost of production. It is expected that the increase in MSP will be translated to farmer’s income by way of robust procurement mechanism in coordination with the State Governments. 

 

Components of PM-AASHA:

 

The new Umbrella Scheme includes the mechanism of ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers and is comprised of


	Price Support Scheme (PSS),
	Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS)
	Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPPS).


 

The other existing schemes of Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) for procurement of paddy, wheat and nutri-cereals/coarse grains and of Ministry of Textile for cotton and jute will be continued for providing MSP to farmers for these crops.

 

Cabinet has also decided that participation of private sector in procurement operation needs to piloted so that on the basis of learnings the ambit of private participation in procurement operations may be increased. Therefore in addition to PDPS.

 

It has been decided that for oilseeds, states have the option to roll out Private Procurement Stockist Scheme (PPSS) on pilot basis in selected district/APMC(s) of district involving the participation of private stockiest. The pilot district/selected APMC(s) of district will cover one or more crop of oilseeds for which MSP is notified. Since this is akin to PSS, in that in involves physical procurement of the notified commodity, it shall substitute PSS/PDPS in the pilot districts. 

 

The selected private agency shall procure the commodity at MSP in the notified markets during the notified period from the registered farmers in consonance with the PPSS Guidelines, whenever the prices in the market fall below the notified MSP and whenever authorized by the state/UT government to enter the market and maximum service charges up to 15% of the notified MSP will be payable.

 

Expenditure:

 

The Cabinet has decided to give additional government guarantee of Rs.16,550 crore making it Rs. 45,550 crore in total.

 

In addition to this, budget provision for procurement operations has also been increased and Rs. 15,053 crore is sanctioned for PM-AASHA implementation. The scheme henceforth is a reflection of Government’s commitment and dedication to our ‘Annadata’.

 

Procurement over the years:

 

During financial years 2010-14 total procurement was Rs. 3500 crore only whereas during financial years 2014-18, it has risen 10 times and reached to Rs. 34,000 crore. For procurement of these agri-commodities during 2010-14, Government Guarantee of Rs. 2500 crore was provided with expenditure of only Rs. 300 crore; while during 2014-18, Guarantee  amount has been increased to Rs. 29,000 crore  with expenditure of Rs. 1,000 crore.

 

Details:

 

Government of India is working with the holistic approach of solving any issue rather than in fragments. Increasing MSP is not adequate and it is more important that farmers should get full benefit of the announced MSP. For this, government realizes that it is essential that if price of the agriculture produce market is less than MSP, then in that case State Government and Central Government should purchase either at MSP or work in a manner to provide MSP for the farmers through some other mechanism. With this approach, Cabinet has approved the Umbrella Scheme of PM-AASHA with three sub-schemes i.e. Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PDPS).

 

In Price Support Scheme (PSS), physical procurement of pulses, oilseeds and Copra will be done by Central Nodal Agencies with proactive role of State governments. It is also decided that in addition to NAFED, Food Cooperation of India (FCI) will take up PSS operations in states /districts. The procurement expenditure and losses due to procurement will be borne by Central Government as per norms.

 

Under Price Deficiency Payment Scheme this scheme (PDPS), it is proposed to cover all oilseeds for which MSP is notified. In this direct payment of the difference between the MSP and the selling/modal price will be made to pre-registered farmers selling his produce in the notified market yard through a transparent auction process. All payment will be done directly into registered bank account of the farmer. This scheme does not involve any physical procurement of crops as farmers are paid the difference between the MSP price and Sale/modal price on disposal in notified market. The support of central government for PDPS will be given as per norms.

 

Pro-farmer initiatives of the Government:

 

The Government is committed to realizing the vision of doubling farmers’ income by 2022.  The emphasis is on enhancing productivity, reducing cost of cultivation and strengthening post-harvesting management, including market structure.  Several market reforms have been initiated.  These include Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing Act, 2017 and Model Contract Farming and Services Act, 2018.  Many States have taken steps to adopt these through legislation. 

 

Efforts are on for a new market architecture, so as to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices on their produce. These include setting up of Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) so as to promote 22,000 number of retail markets in close proximity of farm gate; competitive and transparent wholesale trade at APMC through eNAM and a robust and pro-farmer export policy.

 

Besides, several other pro-farmers’ initiatives such as implementation of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri KrishiSinchai Yojana, ParamparagatKrishi Vikas Yojana and distribution of Soil Health Cards have been undertaken.  The commitment for farmer welfare is also reflected by unprecedented decision of announcing minimum support price based on the formula of 1.5 times the cost of cultivation.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for introduction of Bill in Parliament for amendment of NID Act, 2014 to include the four new National Institutes of Design (NID) viz. National Institute of Design, Amaravati/Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh; National Institute of Design, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh; National Institute of Design, Jorhat, Assam and National Institute of Design, Kurukshetra, Haryana within the ambit of the National Institute of Design Act, 2014 and to declare them as Institutions of National Importance (INIs) at par with the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. Some minor amendments to the Act including consequential amendments considered necessary namely, to re-name NID Vijayawada as NID Amaravati and nomenclature of Principal Designer as equivalent to Professor are also proposed in the Bill.

Establishing new NIDs as Institutions of National Importance in different geographical regions of the country will help produce highly skilled manpower in design which, in turn, will create job opportunities, both direct and indirect, by providing sustainable design interventions for crafts, handloom, rural technology, small, medium and large scale enterprises; and outreach programmes for capacity, capability and institution building.

	There will not be any conditions attached for OD upto Rs 2,000.


 


	Age limit for availing OD facility to be revised from 18-60 years to 18-65 years.


 


	Under the expanded coverage from ""every household to every adult"", accidental insurance cover for new RuPay card holders to be raised from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh to new PMJDY accounts opened after 28.8.18.


 

Impact:

 

          The continuation of the Mission would enable all adults/households of the country to have atleast a basic bank account with access to other financial services, social security schemes and overdraft upto Rs. 10,000.  It will, thus, bring them into the mainstream of financial services and will facilitate transfer of benefits of various subsidy schemes of the Government more efficiently.

 

Achievements under PMJDY:

 


	Approx. 32.41 crore Jan Dhan accounts have been opened with more than Rs 81,200 crore of deposit balance. 


 


	53% women Jan Dhan account holders and 59% Jan Dhan accounts are in rural and semi urban areas. More than 83% operative Jan Dhan accounts (except states of Assam,Meghalaya, J&K) are Aadhaar seeded, with issuance of approx 24.4 crore RuPay cards to these account holders.


 


	More than 7.5 crore JanDhan accounts receiving DBTs. 


 


	Banking Correspondents (BCs) have been deployed in 1.26 lakh Sub Service Areas (rural areas), each catering to 1000-1500 households.  Nearly 13.16 crore Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) transactions have taken place through BCs during the month of July, 2018.


 


	13.98 crore subscribers under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) with 19,436 claims, involving an amount of Rs, 388.72 crore settled so far. 


 


	Similarly, 5.47 crore subscribers under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) with 1.10 lakh claims, involving an amount of Rs. 2206.28 crore settled so far.


 


	1.11 crore persons have subscribed for Atal Pension Yojana (APY).


 

A pipeline has been created for the implementation of PMJDY through which JanDhan accounts and mobile banking have been linked to Aadhaar (JAM). This pipeline is not only facilitating savings, disbursal of credit, social security, etc. but more importantly channelizing direct benefits of various government schemes to poor people of the country through DBT.

 

It has been decided to continue the flagship financial inclusion program (PMJDY), with focus on opening accounts from ""every household to every adult"". The pipeline of JanDhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) will continue to provide the necessary backbone for coverage of these activities and thereby accelerating the pace of digitized, financially included & insured society.

 

Background:

 

          With a view to increase banking penetration, promote financial inclusion and to provide at least one bank account per household across the country, a National Mission on Financial Inclusion known as Pradhan Mantri JanDhan Yojana (PMJDY) was announced by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in his Independence Day Speech on 15th August, 2014.  The scheme was formally launched on 28th August, 2014 at National level by the Prime Minister

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the following:-

 


	The New Broad Gauge Electrified Line of 294.53 route Kms from Katghora to Dongargarh will provide rail connectivity to unserved areas of Chhattishgarh, opening them up for industrial development through movement of freight to the busy Jharsuguda-Nagpur section of Howrah Mumbai route by avoiding busy yards of Bilaspur, Champa and Durg stations. 
	The Korba, Bilaspur, Mungeli, Kabirdham and Rajnandgaon districts of Chhattisgarh will be benefitted by this new rail line. 
	Estimated cost of this project is Rs. 5950.47 crore to be implemented by a Project SPV namely Chhattisgarh Katghora-Dongarhgarh Railway Limited with equity participation of Ministry of Railways and Government of Chhattisgarh through Chhattisgarh Railway Corporation Ltd (CRCL) and private stakeholders. 


 

With opening up of Raigarh District (Raigarh-Mand) to coal mining, it is expected that South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. and various end use miners will increase coal mining in Chhattisgarh State from the present 150MTPA to 250MTPA in near future. This project will reduce congestion on the existing Jharsuguda-Nagpur route which has more than 135% average utilization as on 2014-15. This will add nearly 30-35 MTPA capacity to system of Indian Railways which is nearly 3% of its present output. This project will also provide a faster dedicated route to west bound traffic of SECR, serve unserved areas of the State of Chhattisgarh and facilitate setting up of industry along the route. This is the first project of its kind and magnitude to be undertaken through the State Joint Venture route.

 

Background:

 

Chhattisgarh Railway Corporation Ltd. (CRCL) is a Joint Venture between Ministry of Railways (MoR) and Chhattisgarh Government on 49:51 basis in the form of a company under the Companies Act 2013 for jointly identifying, mobilizing resources and monitoring of the Railway Projects in various States.  Accordingly, CRCL has prepared a Detailed Project Report for a new single electrified railway line between existing Dongargarh Station on Nagpur-Raipur route and Katghora, a station on the under execution section from Gevra Road-Pendra Road.

                Due to excess carryover stocks and indication of similar excess production in the ensuing sugar season 2018-19, the liquidity problem of the sugar mills is likely to persist in the coming sugar season too. As a result, cane price arrears of sugarcane farmers may also peak at unprecedented high level. 

In order to mitigate the situation, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved following measures involving total assistance of over Rs.  5500 crore to support the sugar sector by way of offsetting cost of cane and to facilitate export of sugar from the country thereby improving liquidity of the industry enabling them to clear cane price arrears of farmers:

Details:


	To provide assistance to sugar mills by defraying expenditure towards internal transport, freight, handling and other charges to facilitate export during the sugar season 2018-19 @ Rs. 1000/MT for the mills located within 100 kms from the ports, @ Rs. 2500/MT for the mills located beyond 100 kms from the port in the coastal states and @ Rs. 3000/MT for mills located in other than coastal states or actual expenditure, whichever is lower. The total expenditure on this account would be about Rs.1375 crore which will be borne by Government.


b)   In order to help sugar mills to clear cane dues of farmers, the Government has decided to provide financial assistance @ of Rs. 13.88 per quintal of cane crushed in sugar season 2018-19 to sugar mills to offset the cost of cane. The assistance shall be provided to only those mills which fulfil the conditions as stipulated by Department of Food & Public Distribution.  The total expenditure on this account would be about Rs.4163 crore which will be borne by Government.

c)   To ensure payment of sugarcane dues of farmers, both the assistance would be credited directly into the accounts of farmers on behalf of sugar mills against cane price dues payable to farmers against FRP including arrears relating to previous years and subsequent balance, if any, would be credited to mill’s account. Assistance shall be provided to those mills which will fulfil the eligibility conditions as decided by the Government.

Background: 

            Due to depressed market sentiments and crash in sugar prices, the liquidity position of sugar mills was adversely affected in the sugar season 2017-18 leading to accumulation of cane price dues of sugarcane farmers which reached  an alarming level of about Rs. 23,232 crores in the last week of May, 2018. 

          In order to stabilize sugar prices at reasonable level and to improve the liquidity position of the mills thereby enabling them to clear the cane price arrears of farmers, for the current sugar season 2017-18, Central Government took the following measures in past six months:

(i)    Increased custom duty on import of sugar from 50% to 100% to check any import in the country.

(ii)    Withdrew custom duty on export of sugar to encourage sugar industry to start exploring possibility of export of sugar. 

(iii)   Allocated mill-wise Minimum Indicative Export Quotas (MIEQ) of 20 LMT of sugar for export during Sugar Season 2017-18.

(iv)   Re-introduced Duty Free Import Authorization (DFIA) Scheme in respect of sugar to facilitate and incentivize export of surplus sugar by sugar mills.

(v)   Extended financial assistance to sugar mills @ Rs.5.50/qtl of cane crushed during 2017-18 Sugar Season to offset the cost of cane.

(vi)   Notified Sugar Price (Control) Order, 2018 directing that no producer of sugar shall sell white/refined sugar at factory gate at a rate below Rs. 29/kg; along with imposition of stock holding limits on mills.

(vii)  Created buffer stock of 30LMT of sugar w.e.f01.07.2018, to be maintained by sugar mills for one year for which Government will bear a carrying cost of about Rs. 1175 crore.

(viii) In order to augment ethanol production capacity and thereby also allow divergence of sugar for production of ethanol, approval has already been granted for extension of soft loan of Rs. 4440 crore through banks to the mills for setting up new distilleries/ expansion of existing distilleries and installation of incineration boilers or installation of any method as approved by Central Pollution Control Board for Zero Liquid Discharge for which Government will bear interest subvention of Rs. 1332 crore.

As a result of above measures, all India average ex mill prices of sugar increased from the range of Rs. 24-27/kg to Rs. 30-33/kg; and all India cane price arrears of farmers have also come down to Rs. 12988 crore from the peak arrears of about Rs. 23232 crore on State Advised Price (SAP) basis for sugar season 2017-18. On FRP basis, all India cane price arrears of farmers have come down to Rs. 5312 crore from the peak arrears of about Rs. 14538 crore.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved to construct new line between Budni to Indore (Mangaliyagaon) with approximate length of 205.5 Km. Total estimated cost of this project is Rs. 3261.82 crore. 

The main purpose of this project is the development of backward area and reduction in travel time from Indore to Jabalpur as well as from Indore to Mumbai and towards southern side also, as this will reduce distance by 68 Kms compared to present available route via Bhopal. It will provide better transport facilities for public and industries in this area. It will also help to provide/generate employment opportunities in the project area. The project will generate direct employment during construction for about 49.32 Lakhs man-days.

The proposed line will take off from existing yard of Budni and will connect at Mangaliyagaon existing station of Western Railway near Indore. 10 New crossing stations and 7 new halt stations are proposed to be constructed enroute. The new line will serve Sehore, Dewas and Indore districts and will provide direct link from Budni to Indore bypassing the congested route of Bhopal-Itarsi including Ghat section from Budni to Berkheda.

The new line will provide basic infrastructure support for industrial development of the surrounding area having large socio-economic ramifications. 

This project is meant for development of backward area of this region and to provide connectivity to various towns/villages like Nasrullaganj, Khategoan and Kannod, where presently there is no railway connectivity.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the Revised Cost Estimate of Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) at the revised cost of Rs 3466 crore with the financial assistance of the World Bank to improve safety and operational performance of 198 Dams, along with institutional strengthening with system wide management approach.  Out of Rs.3,466 crore, Rs.2,628 crore will be funded by the World Bank and Rs.747 crore will be funded by DRIP States / Implementing Agencies (IAs) and balance Rs.91 crore to be funded by Central Water Commission (CWC).

 

 The CCEA also gave its ex-post facto approval for two-year time extension from 1st July, 2018 to 30th  June, 2020 

Impact:

          The project will improve the safety and operational performance of selected existing dams and mitigate risks to ensure safety of downstream population and property.  The primary beneficiaries are both urban and rural communities dependent on reservoir and downstream communities, who are prone to risk associated with dam failure or operational failure.  Further, through institutional strengthening component, effectiveness of Dam Safety Organisations will be increased to take the lead to make dams safe from structural and operational point of view through capacity building of staff and officials. 

Details:

DRIP envisages following objectives: -

 

a)   Component-I: - Rehabilitation of Dam and its Appurtenant Structures,

b)   Component-II: - Institutional Strengthening and

c)   Component-Ill: - Project Management.

The Scheme envisages comprehensive rehabilitation of 198 existing dam projects located in seven states of India namely, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Jharkhand (Damodar Valley Corporation) and Uttarakhand (Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited).

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to revise / fix the price of ethanol derived from B heavy molasses / partial sugarcane juice and fix a higher price for 100% sugarcane juice based ethanol for the forthcoming sugar season 2018-19 during ethanol supply year from 1st December 2018 to 30th November 2019 as under:

 


	To fix the ex-mill price of ethanol derived out of B heavy molasses / partial sugarcane juice to Rs.52.43 per litre (from prevailing price of Rs.47.13 per litre).
	To fix the ex-mill price of ethanol derived from 100% sugarcane juice at Rs.59.13 per litre (from prevailing price of Rs.47.13 per litre) for those mills who will divert 100% sugarcane juice for production of ethanol thereby not producing any sugar.
	Additionally, GST and transportation charges will also be payable. OMCs have been advised to fix realistic transportation charges so that long distance transportation of ethanol is not disincentivised.
	OMCs are advised to prioritise ethanol from 1) 100 % sugarcane juice, 2) B heavy molasses / partial sugarcane juice, 3) C heavy molasses and 4) Damaged Food grains/other sources, in that order.


 

Impact:


	The decision will serve multiple purposes of reducing excess sugar in the country, increasing liquidity with the sugar mills for settling cane farmer's dues and making higher ethanol available for Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme. 
	All distilleries will be able to take benefit of the scheme and large number of them are expected to supply ethanol for the EBP programme. Remunerative price to ethanol suppliers will help in reduction of cane farmer's arrears, in the process contributing to minimizing difficulty of sugarcane farmers.
	Ethanol availability for EBP Programme is expected to increase significantly due to higher price being offered for procurement of ethanol from B heavy molasses / partial sugarcane juice and 100% sugarcane juice for first time. 
	Increased ethanol blending in petrol has many benefits including reduction in import dependency, support to agricultural sector, more environmental friendly fuel, lesser pollution and additional income to farmers.


 

Background:

 

Ethanol Blended Petrol Programme was launched by the Government in 2003 on pilot basis which has been subsequently extended to the Notified 21 States and 4 Union-Territories to promote the use of alternative and environment friendly fuels. This intervention also seeks to reduce import dependence for energy requirements and give boost to agriculture sector.

 

Government has notified administered price of, ethanol since 2014. This decision has significantly improved the supply of ethanol during the past four years. The ethanol procured by Public Sector OMCs has increased from 38 crore litre in ethanol supply year 2013-14 to estimated 140 crore litre in 2017-18.

 

Consistent surplus of sugar production is depressing sugar price. Consequently, sugarcane farmer's dues have increased due to lower capability of sugar industry to pay the farmers. Government has taken many decisions for reduction of cane farmer's dues.

 

With a view to limit sugar production in the Country, Government has taken multiple steps including, allowing diversion of B heavy molasses / sugarcane juice for production of ethanol. As the ex-mill price of sugar has increased from the earlier estimated price, there is a need to revise price of B heavy molasses / partial sugarcane juice and 100% sugarcane juice for production of ethanol.

 

It is worth noting that as compared to ethanol derived from C heavy molasses route, diversion of B heavy molasses reduces the sugar by about 20% and increases ethanol availability by about 100%. On the other hand, diversion of sugarcane juice reduces sugar by 100% and increases ethanol availability by about 600%.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved continuation of the Capacity Development Scheme for the period 2017-18 to 2019-20 with an outlay of Rs 2,250 crore.

The Capacity Development Scheme is an Ongoing Central Sector Scheme of MoSPI. The overall objective of the scheme is to augment infrastructural, technical as well as manpower resources for making available credible and timely Official Statistics for policy makers and public at large.

The major ongoing activities under the Capacity Development Scheme, include augmenting resources for bringing out important statistical products, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Index of Industrial Production (IIP), Statistical classifications, etc.; conducting various Socio-Economic surveys, capacity building and strengthening statistical coordination, and improving IT infrastructure. Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), a continuous survey to assess quarterly labour data in urban areas and annual labour data for the whole country (urban and rural areas), was launched in April, 2017 under the scheme.

The Capacity Development Scheme has two Sub-schemes, Economic Census and Support for Statistical Strengthening (SSS). Under Economic Census, listing of all non-agricultural establishments is undertaken periodically, which forms the basis for conducting detailed socio-economic surveys. The last (6l) Economic Census was conducted during January, 2013 to April, 2014 and the Government now aims to conduct the Census once every three years in future. The SSS Sub-scheme is to strengthen State/ Sub-State level statistical systems/ infrastructure to facilitate development of a robust national system. Funds are released to States/ UTs for this purpose after detailed examination of their proposals.

In view of the requirement for better statistical coverage of sectors/areas, in addition to the regular ongoing activities, the Ministry proposes to also take up three new surveys under the Capacity Development Scheme, namely, Time Use Survey (TUS), Annual Survey of Service Sector Enterprises (ASSSE), and Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE).

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the proposal for electrification of balance un-electrified BG routes of Indian Railways (IR) comprising of 108 sections covering 13,675 route kilometers (16,540 track kilometers) at a cost of Rs.12,134.50 crore. This electrification is likely to be completed by 2021-22.

 

The major trunk routes on IR network have already been electrified and are operational. Considering the requirement for seamless operation of rail traffic across the network, it is necessary that the bottlenecks created by the need to change traction are done away with. The proposed electrification, which is mainly for missing links and last mile connectivity will increase the operational efficiency, enhance the line capacity and improve the average speed of trains.

 

The approved electrification will reduce the use of imported fossil fuels thereby improve energy security to the Nation. After the planned electrification, there would be reduction in the consumption of high speed diesel oil by about 2.83 billion litres per annum and a reduction in GHG emissions. This will also reduce environmental impact of Railways.

 

Currently, around two thirds of freight and more than half of passenger traffic in Indian Railways moves on electric traction. However, electric traction accounts for just 37% of the total energy expenses of Indian Railways. Due to this advantage, post electrification, Indian Railways is likely to save Rs 13,510 crore per annum in fuel bill and the same will improve its finances.

 

The approved electrification will generate direct employment of about 20.4 crore man days during the period of construction.

 

The benefits from this decision are listed below:

 

Capacity & Speed


	100% electrification will provide seamless train operation by eliminating detention of trains due to change in traction from diesel to electric and vice versa. 
	It will help Railways in enhancing line capacity due to higher speed & higher haulage capacity of electric locomotives


 

Safety


	Improved signalling system will lead to enhanced safety in train operation


 

Energy Security


	In line with the new Auto Fuel Policy of the Government, total shift to electric traction will reduce fossil fuel consumption of about 2.83 billion liters per annum
	Reduced dependence on imported petroleum based fuels will ensure energy security to the nation 


 

Energy bill savings


	Overall savings in fuel bill to the extent of Rs. 13,510 cr per annum. Electrification of sections covered under this decision will result in net savings of Rs. 3,793 cr per annum
	Reduced expenditure on maintenance of locomotive as electric locomotive  maintenance cost is Rs. 16.45 per thousand GTKM compared to diesel locomotive  maintenance cost which is Rs. 32.84 per thousand GTKM
	Regeneration facility of electric locomotives will save 15-20% energy
	Reduced overall requirement of electric loco due to higher horse power


 

 

Sustainability


	Reduced carbon footprint as environmental cost per Tonne Km for Electric Traction is 1.5 Paisa and for Diesel Traction 5.1 paisa 
	In line with commitment made by India in COP21, total shift to electric traction will reduce CO2 emission of Railways by 24% till 2027-28
	Green house gas emission for electric traction will fall below diesel traction by 2019-20 making it environmentally friendly option.


 

Employment Generation


	Direct employment during construction phase for about 20.4 crore Man days.


 

The complete electrification of railway is poised to continue the growth story of Indian Railways. Through the aforementioned benefits, complete electrification will act as a catalyst for the modernisation process and deliver greater economic benefits. It will help Indian Railways become the growth engine of India as envisaged by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved continuation of the Centrally Sponsored Umbrella Scheme of Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (CSS-IDWH)beyond the 12thPlan period from 2017-18 to 2019-20.  The Scheme consists of  Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Project Tiger (CSS-PT), Development of Wildlife Habitats (CSS-DWH) and Project Elephant (CSS-PE). The total outlay is Rs. 1731.72 crore as central share (Rs. 1143 crore for Project Tiger, Rs. 496.50 crore for Development of Wildlife Habitats and Rs.92.22 crore for Project Elephant) from 2017-18 to 2019-20.

A total of 18 tiger range States, distributed in five landscapes of the country would be benefitted under the Project Tiger scheme. Similarly, for other two schemes, the coverage is entire country in case of Development of Wildlife Habitats (DWH) and 23 elephant range States for Project Elephant. It  would foster wildlife conservation in general with specific inputs for tiger in Project Tiger area and elephant in Project Elephant area.

Besides immense environmental benefits and effective implementation of tiger conservation inputs in and around tiger reserves under Project Tiger, wildlife conservation inputs in Protected Areas & nearby areas under Development of Wildlife Habitats and Elephant conservation inputs in Project Elephant areas, the schemes would result in overall strengthening/ consolidation of tiger, elephant and wildlife conservation in the country.

The schemes would address the human wildlife conflict effectively. Besides, the communities opting for voluntary relocation from the Core/Critical Tiger Habitat (6900 families) would be benefitted under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Project Tiger (CSS-PT) and 800 families under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Development of Wildlife Habitat.

These schemes would generate employment opportunities resulting in economic upliftment of people in and around tiger reserves/ Protected Areas besides leading to reduction in natural resource dependency with substitution by clean energy use. It will generate direct employment of about 30 lakh mandays annually which shall include many local tribes besides non-tribal local workforce. People living in vicinity would also get indirect benefits. Local populace would get opportunities to serve as guides, driver, hospitality personnel and in other ancillary jobs. These schemes would foster imparting various skills towards making people self-dependent through various eco-development projects, thereby enabling them to go for self-employment.

These schemes would result in resource generation through tourist visits, thereby fostering in securing tiger source areas and other areas important for wildlife conservation, besides being helpful in sustaining life support systems as well as ensuring the food, water and livelihood security.

The implementation of the schemes would be done through the respective States in designated Tiger Reserves, Protected Areas and Elephant Reserves.

                The Ministry of AYUSH, Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences and other research councils have taken several initiatives to realise the mainstreaming of AYUSH services through an integrated approach and also generating scientific evidence on feasibility, quality, Safety, efficacy, accessibility and rational use of AYUSH based practices and drugs. 

To realize the functional integration of AYUSH in public health, it is pertinent to brainstorm   on various dimensions of AYUSH in public health so that a socially and ecologically sustainable health care system with a vision, attitude and orientation for a holistic health and wellness perspective may be developed.

The Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha. Director General CCRAS Prof. K.S. Dhiman and Deputy Director General CCRAS Dr. N Srikanth inaugurated ‘Brainstorming session on AYUSH in Public Health: Strategy & Frame Work’ on 25th September 2018 at Lucknow. The core objective of the brainstorming session was to crystallise a framework for mainstreaming of AYUSH through a sustainable delivery of AYUSH services in Public Health Care System, across the nation through a consultative process of stake holders in this sector.

The main objectives of the Brainstorming session are: formulate a National strategy and framework for introduction of AYUSH in national health care system within the provision of National Health Policy 2017,  identify specific areas of AYUSH based on their strength and available scientific evidence, designing and developing specific programmes for mainstreaming of AYUSH interventions in areas such as Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Reproductive & Child Health care (RCH) , Geriatric health and capacity building of AYUSH professionals for integrated health care.

The workshop drew a future roadmap for integration of AYUSH in public health.  

The National Health Policy 2017 and other Health Policies emphasize on mainstreaming the AYUSH practices and approaches for health promotion, prevention and management of different diseases and conditions through integrating and co-locating the services.

During the event two books ‘Background Note on AYUSH in public health: Strategy and Framework’ and ‘Research Oriented Health Care Services of CCRAS’ were also released.

                Two-day Training Programme on Documentation of Information into National AYUSH Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Portal (NAMSTP) organised by the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), Ministry of AYUSH commenced here today. The Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH Shri Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha inaugurated the training programme and addressed the gathering that included 74 nominated AYUSH professionals from across the country. 

 

The Secretary AYUSH, during his address, emphasized on taking forward the documentation of  Morbidity Statistics across all healthcare setups in the country in a sustainable manner. He further stressed upon the mandatory requirements of AYUSH colleges and institutions funded by the Ministry of AYUSH under various schemes such as Centre of Excellence, Extra Mural Research, and Public Health Institutes etc. He said that it would certainly facilitate in mass documentation of AYUSH morbidity statistics in an effective manner. He also recommended that the Master Trainers, who are undergoing training, must take initiative to disseminate the capacity building in an effective manner across the stakeholders in different states. 

 

 It is noted that the Ministry of AYUSH has initiated efforts for centralized collection of data regarding the number of patients being treated by the various institutions of AYUSH systems located  across the country. The centralized portal, developed for this purpose is recognized as National AYUSH Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Portal (NAMSTP). On this occasion research publication of the Central Council was also launched. 

 

Ministry of AYUSH has initiated efforts for centralized collection of morbidity statistics pertaining to various systems of medicine under the Ministry viz. Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy. In this regard, the Ministry in association with Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani research councils has developed Morbidity Codes and Standard Terminologies of Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha systems of medicine. For Homeopathy and Yoga & Naturopathy systems the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10/11 Codes) of World Health Organisation has been adopted for this purpose. 

 

This portal has the potential to revolutionize morbidity statistics data collection and may have a huge impact on the future policy making decision by bringing to light the contributions of various AYUSH systems in the healthcare delivery system of the country. The key features of the portal includes the Morbidity Codes and Standardized Terminologies of all the AYUSH systems for unambiguous reporting, electronic data submission through individual institution login IDs and also an integrated Electronic Health Records (E.H.R.) system for detailed data collection for individual institutions.  

In this regard, first training program entitled “Training workshop to initiate centralized collection of AYUSH morbidity statistics through National AYUSH Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Portal (NAMSTP)” for selected AYUSH professionals of research councils, national institutes and academic institutions was conducted on 06th October 2017.

 

Four training sessions will be conducted in the two day training programme covering topics such as Introduction to Medical Coding (ICD 10, 11), Introduction to International Standardized Medical Terminologies (SNOMED-CT, Chinese Medicine etc.), Morbidity Coding Systems and applications in AYUSH domain, General introduction to Ayurveda-Siddha-Unani Standardized Terminologies and A-S-U National Morbidity Codes and also system wise hands on training.

                The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C42) of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched two satellites -- NovaSAR and S1-4-- from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota today.

The PSLV-C42 lifted off from the First Launch Pad of SHAR at 10.08 pm (IST). Both satellites were injected into the Sun Synchronous Orbit, about 17 minutes later, at an altitude of 583 km.

The satellites belong to UK-based Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL), which has a contract with Antrix Corporation Ltd, the commercial arm of ISRO. NovaSAR carries S-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and an Automatic Identification Receiver payloads. The satellite applications include forestry mapping, land use and ice cover monitoring, flood and disaster monitoring and maritime missions. It will be operated from SSTL’s Spacecraft Operations Centre in Guildford, UK.

S1-4 is a high resolution earth observation satellite meant for surveying resources, environment monitoring, urban management and disaster monitoring.

This was the 44th flight of PSLV and the 12th flight of the Core Alone version of the vehicle. Core Alone is its lightest version without the six strap-on motors. It is used for launching smaller payloads.

The PSLV launch vehicle consists of four stages, each of which is a self-contained vehicle capable of functioning independently with own propulsion systems.

During the previous launch (PSLV-C41, April 12, 2018), the ‘XL’ version of PSLV with six strap-on motors was used. The vehicle successfully launched the IRNSS-1I navigation satellite to a Sub-Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit.

Preparations for the PSLV-C42 began at Sriharikota in mid-July with the process of vehicle integration setting the tone for the launch. Many centres of ISRO contributed to this mission with the vehicle being designed and developed by Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram. The second and fourth stage liquid engines came from Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, Thiruvananthapuram and ISRO Propulsion Complex, Mahendragiri, Tamil Nadu.

The vehicle’s guidance system is from ISRO’s Inertial Systems Unit, Thiruvananthapuram, while SDSC SHAR was responsible for solid motor preparation, vehicle integration and launch infrastructure. ISRO’s Telemetry Tracking and Command Network provided tracking support.

ISRO Chairman Dr K. Sivan congratulated the team soon after the successful mission.

“I am extremely happy that the PSLV-C42 precisely launched two of our customer satellites at 583 km orbit. This was unique night mission executed for the first time by us. The PSLV has proven yet again as a user-friendly vehicle in all aspects. The credit goes to the entire ISRO team and industries. This success will give added energy for industries to make PSLV by themselves. We are going to have 18 missions in the next six months, virtually one launch every two weeks,” Dr Sivan said.

Thousands of skilled personnel from ISRO and industries, including many youngsters, played a crucial role in this mission. The Project Director of PSLV is Shri R. Hutton, who was also the Mission Director.

“The PSLV-C42 marks the latest technology and commercial collaboration between India and the UK with the launch of the combination of high resolution optical and radar (SAR) satellites from us,” says Sir Martin Sweeting, Group Executive Chairman, SSTL.

As on date, ISRO has launched 239 foreign satellites of 28 countries.

                Following is the statement made by Dr. Sekhar Basu, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission and Secretary, Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India and Head of the Indian delegation, at the 62nd General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in Vienna, Austria today: 

“I take this opportunity to convey on behalf of the people of India and the Government of India the warmest greetings to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Member States on the occasion of the 62nd General Conference.

Let me congratulate you Madam President on your election as President of 62nd General Conference. I am sure that under your able leadership the current General Conference will accomplish successfully all the tasks laid before it.

India reiterates its assigning primacy to IAEA in its central role in promotion of atomic energy for peaceful uses and prosperity of the mankind while maintaining its due support in safeguards.

As in earlier years, India’s interaction with IAEA remained intense. This year, we miss DG Amano’s presence. We wish him early recovery. 

I was privileged to participate in the International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Power in the 21st Century, held at Abu Dhabi last year.

We have placed, two Russian designed Pressurised Light Water Reactor and two Pressurised Heavy Reactors being built with Indian technology under IAEA Safeguards. Thus, in all 26 Indian nuclear facilities are placed under IAEA Safeguards.

The 27th IAEA Fusion Energy Conference (FEC 2018) aiming to provide a forum for the discussion on key physics and technology issues is being held in India in October 2018.

Nuclear power and its applications has always been well integrated globally. Keeping up with the pace of enhancing our international cooperation, we have signed:

 


	Industrial way forward agreement between NPCIL, India and EDF of France in March 2018 for the establishment of six nuclear power reactors of EPR technology;


 


	Agreement with the Department of Natural Resources of Canada on Science & Technology and Innovation


 


	Cooperation agreement with VINATOM of Vietnam on training and capacity building. 


 

I am glad to inform that in the field of Neutrino Physics we signed inter-governmental collaboration agreement with Fermilab during the visit of US Secretary of Energy to India in April this year.

On the multilateral front India has assumed chairmanship of ITER Council since 1st January 2018 for a period of two years. Government of India also approved cost escalation for the in kind contribution part of the project.

During the last General Conference we informed about our plans to build 21 reactors by 2030. I am glad to inform that the implementation of this programme is well on track. In addition our discussions with foreign partners for bringing different technology is on.

In the power sector our notable achievement was one of the longest run of reactor UNIT 1 of Kaiga plant site. By reaching 859 days of continuous operation, it has become 3rd longest running plant in the world; four others reactors also continue to operate for 450 days and above. These achievements establishes the soundness of the technology and efficiency in operation and maintenance.

Unit one and two at Karapar Power Station experienced pressure tube leaks. Following in depth study of the root cause of the events and after detailed evaluation by AERB these units have been permitted to restart. This Monday Unit 2 was restarted after coolant channel replacement.

Our indigenously developed prototype fast breeder reactor of 500 MWe is now undergoing sodium commissioning. We expect criticality next year.

I am happy to inform that APSARA (U) an upgraded swimming pool type rector became operational this month at Trombay. Reactor is designed to produce a large variety of Isotope and serve the nuclear physicists, material scientists and reactor designers providing state of art facilities. I may add that we can share this technology with the new-comers in nuclear field.

With an understanding that the burden of cancer is increasing especially in developing countries, Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), has played a significant role in enhancing the capacity of trained manpower to deal with the problem of cancer by short term and long term training to IAEA fellows. Over 150 personnel, from Africa and Asia have been trained in the field of cancer care.

I would also like to inform that Cyclone-30, a medical cyclotron, the largest in India, delivered 30 MeV beam for the first time this month. This cyclotron is capable of meeting radioisotope needs for entire Eastern India and will also meet the requirements of Paladium 103 and Germanium 68 for the entire country. The facility will also have dedicated beam lines for research in material science and nuclear physics.

Development of cost effective drug for cancer care has been a priority for us. 21 Nos. radiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis and therapy and two radionuclide generators have been developed in the recent past. Nuclear waste has always been considered as a resource in India. Clinical grade Yttrium 90 in 90Y Acetate form has been extracted from high level waste and was introduced for patient care.

Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership (GCNEP), established in 2010, has started gaining popularity. Since last September we have organised 10 international programmes on a variety of subjects including the areas of nuclear safety, security and safeguards; physical protection of nuclear facilities,

emergency response to radioactive disperse devices etc. Interested member countries are welcome to join us either as faculty or choose relevant training programmes and we can have them scheduled in consultation with IAEA.

We thank the city of Vienna, and the people and the Government of Austria, for hosting the IAEA, with the commitment of a gracious host. We also thank the IAEA Secretariat for the excellent logistics and meeting related support.

India looks forward to IAEA’s continued leadership for fostering safe, secure and sustainable use of nuclear energy in the future. India will continue to support IAEA in all its endeavour.

 

We wish the 62nd General Conference a grand success.

                Cyclotrons are used to produce radioisotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic use for cancer care. Cyclone-30, the biggest cyclotron in India for medical application became operational this month when 30 MeV beam reached the Faraday Cup for the first time last week. Subsequently, beam from this facility was used to produce 18F (Fluorine-18 isotope) for the preparation of [18 FlFluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a radio-pharmaceutical used by Board of Radiation & Isotope Technology (BRIT). The facility will start regular production by the middle of the next year after the commissioning of the supporting nuclear systems and regulatory clearances. Cyclone-30 facility at VECC, Kolkata, a Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) unit, will have many unique features, under various stages of implementation, which are first of its kind in many ways. After the commissioning of liquid target (for FDG production) and solid targets (production of Germanium-68, Palladium-103 and other isotopes), work on studies related to installation of Iodine isotope [1-123] production target, material study target and Accelerator Driven System target will also be taken up.

This facility will provide for affordable radio isotopes and related radiopharmaceuticals for the entire country especially, for Eastern India and also have export potential for Germanium-68/Gallium-68 generator for in-situ production of Gallium-68 and Palladium-103 isotopes, used for breast cancer diagnosis and prostate cancer treatment, respectively.

Cyclone-30 commissioning re-emphasises the capability of Indian scientists and engineers to deliver at the highest level of science and technology.

                The second Unit of Kakrapar Atomic Power Station (KAPS-2 — 220 MW) attained Criticality (initiation of controlled self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction in the reactor) today (Monday) at 02:22 hrs, after completion of Renovation & Modernisation (R&M) works, encompassing En-Masse Coolant Channel Replacement (EMCCR), En Masse Feeder Replacement (EMFR) and other safety upgrades. This task was completed about three and half months ahead of schedule. In this endeavor, Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), Nuclear Fuel Complex (manufacturer of coolant channels), Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and various vendors/contractors rose to the occasion for this achievement. 

The approach to criticality was undertaken after meeting all the stipulated regulatory requirements. This will be followed by conduct of various tests, connection to the grid and increase in power level to full power as per laid down procedures and regulatory clearances.

KAPS located in Surat district of Gujarat comprises of two units of indigenous 220 MW PHWRs (KAPS-1&2) which commenced commercial operation in 1993 and 1995 respectively. Two more units of 700 MW PHWRs (KAPP-3&4) are under construction at this site. 

NPCIL operates twenty two nuclear power reactors (including RAPS-1 of 100 MW owned by DAE) with a capacity of 6780 MW and has eight reactors with a capacity of 6200 MW under construction. Work has also been initiated on twelve more reactors (9000 MW) accorded administrative approval and financial sanction by the Government.

                “Research reactors are the back bone of Nuclear Programme” said Dr. Homi J. Bhabha, the father of Indian Nuclear programme, in early fifties.  Subsequently “Apsara”, the first research reactor in Asia became operational in Trombay campus of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in August 1956.  After providing more than five decades of dedicated service to the researchers, the reactor was shut down in 2009.

 

Nearly sixty-two years after Apsara came into existence, a swimming pool type research reactor “Apsara-upgraded”, of higher capacity was born at Trombay on 10th September 2018 at 18:41 hrs. The reactor, made indigenously, uses plate type dispersion fuel elements made of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU).  By virtue of higher neutron flux, this reactor will increase indigenous production or radio-isotopes for medical application by about fifty percent and would also be extensively used for research in nuclear physics, material science and radiation shielding.

 

This development has re-emphasised the capability of Indian scientists and Engineers to build, complex facilities for health care, science education and research.

                The Election Commission of India would like to allay any unfounded apprehensions regarding the supply of VVPATs for the Lok Sabha Election in 2019. The Commission is committed to 100% deployment of VVPATs at all polling stations in future General, as well as bye elections to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.

In order to meet the requirement of 100% VVPATs for all polling stations for the upcoming Lok Sabha Election in 2019, the Commission placed an order of 17.45 lakh VVPATs to Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Bangalore and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Hyderabad. Till date, 9.45 lakh units have been produced by the PSUs. Both PSUs have assured the Commission that the remaining VVPAT units (8 lakh) will be manufactured and supplied to the various States/UTs comfortably before end of Nov 2018. 

The Commission has been consistently and periodically reviewing the status of production and supply of VVPATs with the CMDs of PSUs, as well as the Technical Expert Committee (TEC), to ensure that the design, production and supply activities of all the units of EVMs and VVPATs is streamlined and completed in a time-bound manner after incorporating the features suggested by the TEC which is carrying out a rigorous supervision of the production process and product performance. The officers of the Commission are monitoring the manufacturing and supply of machines on a daily basis in order to ensure timely delivery and pre poll preparedness.

The Commission has indeed enhanced the requirement of additional VVPATs from 125% to 135% considering the trend of failure rate of VVPATs in past elections. The Commission has estimated 171% Ballot Units, 125% Control Units and 135% VVPATs requirements for upcoming Lok Sabha Elections. It may be noted that in case of any error in VVPAT, only VVPAT is replaced with the reserve one, whereas, in case of any error in Ballot Unit or Control Unit of the EVM, entire set of Ballot Unit(s), Control Unit and VVPAT is changed, resulting in an increase in requirement of  VVPATs than the requirement of Control Units of EVMs. 

It is pertinent to mention that learning from experience of Kairana and Bhandara-Gondiya bye-polls held in May, 2018 where the errors were mainly caused by excessive exposure to illumination in the polling stations, the Commission has adopted the hardware improvement recommended by the Technical Expert Committee to prevent auto shutdown of VVPATs due to excessive light. 

It is also pertinent to note that comprehensive and systematic preparatory activities for the Lok Sabha Elections, including the detailed First Level Checking of EVMs and VVPATs have already commenced across various States/UTs and will be completed in an efficient, effective and timely manner. First Level Checks workshops and trainings of polling officials are being regularly conducted by the Commission to minimize EVM/VVPAT failures due to human errors. 

It may be appreciated that over the last twenty years, the Election Commission of India has successfully conducted 113 State Legislative Assembly Elections and 03 Lok Sabha Elections using EVMs. Since, June 2017, Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines have also been used successfully along with EVMs in General as well as Bye elections in all State Assembly and Parliamentary constituencies for enhanced voter verifiability. The Commission is fully geared to use VVPATs in all forthcoming elections. 

The Election Commission of India is mandated under Article 324 to 329 of the Constitution of India to provide superintendence, direction and control for conduct of elections in accordance with the law in force.

                Certain complaints of alleged tampering of EVMs during the recently held elections held by different organizations/institutions elsewhere also generated wrong perception about EVMs of Election Commission of India. It was noted that confusion exists in the minds of many about the jurisdiction of ECI. We would like to clarify once again on this occasion that ECI is not responsible for the conduct of local body elections (Municipalities, Panchayats etc.) that are conducted by the State Election Commissions and elections held by various organisations/institutions in the country and consequently about various protocols and procedures adopted by them.

The Commission is confident and has firm conviction about the integrity, non-tamperability and credibility of ECI-EVMs. The basis of confidence of the Commission flows from a wide range of technical and administrative protocols and procedural safeguards that protects our EVMs and VVPATs against any sort of tampering during manufacture, transportation, storage, polling and counting process.

Till 2017, M/s Bharat Electronics Limited, Bangalore and M/s Electronics Corporation of India Limited, Hyderabad were allowed by the Commission to supply EVMs to State Election Commissions and other organisations (The permission letter issued in August, 2006 is enclosed). However, since May 2017, BEL and ECIL were directed to seek Commission’s prior approval and supply only EVMs that are different from ECI-EVMs to SECs or to other foreign countries, that too only after the current ordered quantities to ECI are fully supplied.

Old EVMs are sent to BEL/ECIL for destruction and destroyed as per strict protocol prescribed by the Commission.

Election Commission of India uses only single post EVMs (i.e. vote can be cast only for one post). In the elections at DUSU, it is told that multi-post EVMs (i.e. vote can be cast for more than one post for instance President/Vice-President/General Secretary), which are technically completely different from ECI’s single post EVMs, have been used.

The Commission would like to state that the important technical and administrative safeguards available in ECI-EVMs might not be available in EVMs being used by other organisations/institutions.

The training was conducted by experts from ISLRTC (Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre)wherein the officers were acquainted with basic as well as election related sign languages symbols such as Election, Identity Card, Address and Polling Booth etc. Besides, information related to basic etiquette while conversing with persons with disabilities was also shared with the Officials of the Commission and they were sensitised regarding the needs of Deaf persons. The session saw enthusiastic participation of the officials. A sensitisation activity was conducted through a live demonstration of a mock poll to understand the frequently asked questions/ issues of the deaf voters.

The aim of the workshop was to sensitise election officials to the needs of persons with disabilitiesso as to be better able to respond to their needs & facilitate them during the election process. 

In July 2018, Election Commission of India had organised a two day National Consultation on Accessible Elections in New Delhi where the Commission declared a series of facilitation measures for Persons with Disabilities, including training and sensitisation ofElection Officials.

Twenty Embryo Transfer Technology Centres are being established in the country and a proposal of 19 centres has been approved so far .This was stated by the Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh at the foundation laying ceremony of Embryo transfer Technology ceremony of Embryo Transfer Technology (ETT) centre in the Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation (BALF), Uruilikanchan, Pune. The Minister further stated that 3000 high genetic merit bulls of indigenous bovine breeds are being produced from these centres. Two of these centres are to be set up in Nagpur and Pune in Maharashtra.

The Minister also said that there is a huge demand of semen from high genetic merit bulls of indigenous bovine breeds. At the same time, the number of certain breeds has decreased considerably and so, ETT can prove to be extremely effective in enhancing productivity and breed improvement. Keeping this in mind, an ETT centre is being set up in BAIF, Urulikanchan and Rs 5.07 crore has been released for this. This centre will produce high genetic merit bovines of Gir, Sahiwal, Lal Kandhari, Dangi, Deoni and Gaolao.

The Minister observed that agriculture and dairy business complement each other for the social and economic upliftment of cattle farmers. To achieve this objective, it is essential to have good quality livestock breed in order to increase production. Under the Rashtriya Gokul Mission, 10 semen centres have been identified for the production of Sex Sorted Semen for the production of more female animals. Proposals for two centres, in Uttarakhand and Maharashtra, have been approved. The foundation stone of sex sorted semen centre in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand was laid in June 2018. Besides, INDUSCHIP has been developed for genomic selection of indigenous breeds and 6000 dairy animals have been genetically evaluated using INDUSCHIP. The Minister informed that under the flagship scheme Rashtriya Gokul Mission, the current government till March 2018 has approved projects worth Rs 1600 crore in 29 states out of which Rs 686 crore has been released. 20 Gokul Grams are also being established under this scheme. Apart from this, Under the Pashu Sanjivni component of the scheme, 9 crore milch animals are being identified using UID (Unique Identification Device). 

In a separate function, while addressing the inauguration ceremony of National Level Workshop on Nutri-cereals (Millet), the Minister said that nutri-cereals (jowar, bajra, ragi and other small millets) as compared to wheat, paddy, maize etc. have special significance because of their nutritional value. These are used for foodgrain, animal feed and fuel.

                The 20th Livestock Census will be conducted in all districts of the Indian Union in participation with all States and Union Territories. States/UTs have been requested to start the census operations from 1st October, 2018. The success of this novel initiative is dependent on full cooperation and commitment from all States/UTs Governments. The enumeration will be done in all villages and urban wards. Various species of animals (Cattle, Buffalo, Mithun, Yak, Sheep, Goat, Pig, Horse, Pony, Mule, Donkey Camel, Dog, Rabbit and Elephant)/poultry birds (Fowl, Duck, Emu, Turkeys, Quail and other poultry birds) possessed by the households, household enterprises/non-household enterprises and institutions will be counted at their site.

The major thrust of 20th Livestock Census would be data collection through tablets /computers which aims to fulfil the objective of Digital India Programme of Hon’ble Prime Minister. The tablets procured under NMBP Scheme will be used for data collections of 20th Livestock Census for which necessary support has been provided to States under that scheme. A mobile Application software has already been developed by National Informatics Centre (NIC) for collecting transferring the data online. It is expected that the data collection through Tablets will be of great help in reducing the time gap in data collection, data processing and report generation. 

The initiatives on collection of breed-wise reliable information of various species will give vital information for determination of threatened indigenous breeds and to take initiatives for their conservation. Considering this aspect, the 20th Livestock Census would be a breed-wise Livestock Census which will be helpful for framing policies or programmes for breed improvement. Breed-wise information of livestock and poultry will be collected from every survey unit. The breeds of various major species including poultry as registered by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) will be covered in the Livestock Census.

Further, the latest data on fishermen folk are available as per Livestock Census 2003 only. Therefore, the fishery part is a very important component so as to capture the information of fishermen families and infrastructure available for both inland and marine sector.

The Livestock Census has been conducted in the country periodically since 19191-20. The Livestock Census usually covers all domesticated animals and headcounts of those animals will be carried out during a specific time period. So far 19 such census have been conducted in participation with State Governments and UT Administrations.

Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh has said that a developed agri food value chain in the country can not only enhance the farm income of farmers but also make available quality food to the consumers. It will also help in substantially reducing the harvest and post-harvest losses occurring at various stages of the agri food value chain. He stated this while addressing the gathering at the inauguration ceremony of the ASSOCHAM’s 2-day Exhibitions, Conferences & Roundtables on Agri Food Value Chain Partnerships - End to End Approach. 

The Minister said that Modi Government is committed to promoting Agri Food Value Chain related activities at local, regional, national and also International level. e-NAM was launched by the government to reduce the supply chain by integrating the value chain participants. So far, 585 mandis have already been added to the e-NAM portal and within the next two years, 415 additional mandis will be added. He informed that in order to address the problem of fluctuations in the prices of tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP), ""Operation Green"" was launched with an outlay of Rs 500 crore in this year’s budget. Under this scheme, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), agricultural logistics, processing facilities and professional management will be promoted.

Shri Singh also informed that under the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), the Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region was approved on January 2016 with a total outlay of Rs 400 crore. Besides this, the government has approved a new Central Sector Scheme – Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro-Processing Clusters) for the period 2016-20 co-terminous with the 14th Finance Commission cycle. PM Kisan SAMPADA Yojana is a comprehensive package which will result in creation of modern infrastructure with efficient supply chain management from farm gate to retail outlet.

                The Government has decided to incorporate the provision of penalties for States and Insurance Companies for the delay in settlement of insurance claims under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal BimaYojana (PMFBY). This crucial provision is part of the new operational guidelines issued by the Govt for the implementation of PMFBY.The farmers will be paid 12% interest by insurance companies for the delay in settlement claims beyond two months of prescribed cut-off date. State Governments will have to pay 12% interest for the delay in release of State share of subsidy beyond three months of prescribed cut-off date submission of requisition by insurance companies. The new operational guidelines come at the onset of the rabi season, which starts from 1st of October. 

The new operational guidelines also detail a Standard Operating Procedure for evaluation of insurance companies and remove them from the scheme if found ineffective in providing services. The Government has also decided to include perennial horticultural crops under the ambit of PMFBY on a pilot basis. The scheme, as per the new operational guidelines provides add on coverage for crop loss due to attack of wild animals, which will be implemented on a pilot basis. Aadhaar number will be mandatorily captured to avoid duplication of beneficiaries. 

In order to ensure that more non-loanee farmers are insured under the scheme, apart from various awareness activities being scheduled, the insurance companies are given a target of enrolling 10% more non-loanee farmers than the previous corresponding season. The insurance companies will have to mandatorily spend 0.5% of gross premium per company per season for publicity and awareness of the scheme.

The new operational guidelines address the current challenges faced while implementing the scheme by putting forth effective solutions. The much demanded rationalization of premium release process has been incorporated in the new guidelines. As per this, the insurance companies need not provide any projections for the advance subsidy. Release of upfront premium subsidy will be made at the beginning of the season based on 50% of 80% of total share of subsidy of corresponding season of previous year as GOI/State subsidy. Balance premium will be paid as a second instalment based on the specific approved business statistics on the portal for settlement of claims. Final installment will be paid after reconciliation of entire coverage data on portal based on final business statistics. This will reduce the delay in settling the claims of farmers.

Vast opportunities exist today for dairy entrepreneurs and in order to concretize these opportunities and help double the income of dairy farmers, Rs 51,077 crore is needed to operationalize the National Action Plan (Vision-2024), Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh said at the inauguration ceremony of Dairy Processing & Infrastructure Development Fund (DIDF) in New Delhi today. Shri Singh said that as a result of the announcement of Union Budget 2017-18, the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries (DADF) started the Dairy Processing & Infrastructure Development Fund (DIDF) with an outlay of Rs 10881 crore. Under this, the first installment of Rs 440 crore is being given to the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) today.

 

The Union Agriculture Minister said that with this scheme, 95,00,000 farmers in about 50,000 villages will be benefitted. In addition to this, many skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers will get employment, directly and indirectly. Additional milk processing capacity of 126 lakh litre per day, milk drying capacity of 210 MT per day, milk chilling capacity of 140 lakh litre per day shall be created. Under this scheme, milk cooperatives will be provided financial assistance of Rs 8004 crore in the form of a loan at 6.5% interest, which will be reimbursed over a period of 10 years. The government has also given a provision of interest subsidy on loans. Till now, 15 sub-projects with total approved outlay of Rs 1148.61 crore pertaining to States namely, Karnataka (Rs. 776.39 crore - 5 sub-projects), Punjab (Rs.318.01 crores - 4 sub-projects) and Haryana (Rs. 54.21 crore - 6 sub-projects) have been sanctioned so far.

Shri Singh informed that implementation of the World Bank-funded National Dairy Plan Phase-I scheme is also being done by the NDDB through the state government’s cooperative milk organizations/milk federations. The government is now implementing this scheme in 18 states from the earlier 14 states. On the other hand, the implementation of the National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD) is being done by the state's cooperative/milk federations. Under this scheme, an assistance of Rs 560.46 crore in 2014-18 was given for the development of cooperative milk committees, incentives to increase the number of milk producers and increase processing and refrigeration capacity.

Union Agriculture Minister further said that in order to increase production, under the Rashtriya Gokul Mission, 10 semen centers have been identified for the production of Sex Sorted Semen for the production of more female animals. Also, 20 Embryo Transfer Technology (ETT) centers are being set up for the production of high genetic merit bulls of indigenous bovine breeds. Besides, INDUSCHIP has been developed for genomic selection of indigenous breeds and 6000 dairy animals have been genetically evaluated using INDUSCHIP. 

The Minister also informed that under the flagship scheme Rashtriya Gokul Mission, the current government till March 2018 has approved projects worth Rs 1600 crore in 29 states out of which Rs 686 crores has been released. 20 Gokul Grams are also being established under this scheme. Apart from this, for the conservation of indigenous breeds, two National Kamdhenu Breeding Centres, one in Andhra Pradesh at Chintaladevi and other in Madhya Pradesh at Itarsi are being established. Shri Singh also asserted that the e-Pashuhaat portal is a landmark initiative, launched in 2016. It is playing an important role in connecting breeders and farmers. The Minister appealed to the members present to speed up efforts to achieve the goal by 2022.

                Giving a major boost to the pro-farmer initiatives of the Government and in keeping with its commitment and dedication for the Annadata, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved a new Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan’ (PM-AASHA).  The Scheme is aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce as announced in the Union Budget for 2018. 

 

This is an unprecedented step taken by Govt. of India to protect the farmers’ income which is expected to go a long way towards the welfare of farmers.  Government has already increased the MSP of kharif crops by following the principle of 1.5 times the cost of production. It is expected that the increase in MSP will be translated to farmer’s income by way of robust procurement mechanism in coordination with the State Governments. 

 

Components of PM-AASHA:

 

The new Umbrella Scheme includes the mechanism of ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers and is comprised of


	Price Support Scheme (PSS),
	Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS)
	Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPPS).


 

The other existing schemes of Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) for procurement of paddy, wheat and nutri-cereals/coarse grains and of Ministry of Textile for cotton and jute will be continued for providing MSP to farmers for these crops.

 

Cabinet has also decided that participation of private sector in procurement operation needs to piloted so that on the basis of learnings the ambit of private participation in procurement operations may be increased. Therefore in addition to PDPS.

 

It has been decided that for oilseeds, states have the option to roll out Private Procurement Stockist Scheme (PPSS) on pilot basis in selected district/APMC(s) of district involving the participation of private stockiest. The pilot district/selected APMC(s) of district will cover one or more crop of oilseeds for which MSP is notified. Since this is akin to PSS, in that in involves physical procurement of the notified commodity, it shall substitute PSS/PDPS in the pilot districts. 

 

The selected private agency shall procure the commodity at MSP in the notified markets during the notified period from the registered farmers in consonance with the PPSS Guidelines, whenever the prices in the market fall below the notified MSP and whenever authorized by the state/UT government to enter the market and maximum service charges up to 15% of the notified MSP will be payable.

 

Expenditure:

 

The Cabinet has decided to give additional government guarantee of Rs.16,550 crore making it Rs. 45,550 crore in total.

 

In addition to this, budget provision for procurement operations has also been increased and Rs. 15,053 crore is sanctioned for PM-AASHA implementation. The scheme henceforth is a reflection of Government’s commitment and dedication to our ‘Annadata’.

 

Procurement over the years:

 

During financial years 2010-14 total procurement was Rs. 3500 crore only whereas during financial years 2014-18, it has risen 10 times and reached to Rs. 34,000 crore. For procurement of these agri-commodities during 2010-14, Government Guarantee of Rs. 2500 crore was provided with expenditure of only Rs. 300 crore; while during 2014-18, Guarantee  amount has been increased to Rs. 29,000 crore  with expenditure of Rs. 1,000 crore.

 

Details:

 

Government of India is working with the holistic approach of solving any issue rather than in fragments. Increasing MSP is not adequate and it is more important that farmers should get full benefit of the announced MSP. For this, government realizes that it is essential that if price of the agriculture produce market is less than MSP, then in that case State Government and Central Government should purchase either at MSP or work in a manner to provide MSP for the farmers through some other mechanism. With this approach, Cabinet has approved the Umbrella Scheme of PM-AASHA with three sub-schemes i.e. Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PDPS).

 

In Price Support Scheme (PSS), physical procurement of pulses, oilseeds and Copra will be done by Central Nodal Agencies with proactive role of State governments. It is also decided that in addition to NAFED, Food Cooperation of India (FCI) will take up PSS operations in states /districts. The procurement expenditure and losses due to procurement will be borne by Central Government as per norms.

 

Under Price Deficiency Payment Scheme this scheme (PDPS), it is proposed to cover all oilseeds for which MSP is notified. In this direct payment of the difference between the MSP and the selling/modal price will be made to pre-registered farmers selling his produce in the notified market yard through a transparent auction process. All payment will be done directly into registered bank account of the farmer. This scheme does not involve any physical procurement of crops as farmers are paid the difference between the MSP price and Sale/modal price on disposal in notified market. The support of central government for PDPS will be given as per norms.

 

Pro-farmer initiatives of the Government:

 

The Government is committed to realizing the vision of doubling farmers’ income by 2022.  The emphasis is on enhancing productivity, reducing cost of cultivation and strengthening post-harvesting management, including market structure.  Several market reforms have been initiated.  These include Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing Act, 2017 and Model Contract Farming and Services Act, 2018.  Many States have taken steps to adopt these through legislation. 

 

Efforts are on for a new market architecture, so as to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices on their produce. These include setting up of Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) so as to promote 22,000 number of retail markets in close proximity of farm gate; competitive and transparent wholesale trade at APMC through eNAM and a robust and pro-farmer export policy.

 

Besides, several other pro-farmers’ initiatives such as implementation of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri KrishiSinchai Yojana, ParamparagatKrishi Vikas Yojana and distribution of Soil Health Cards have been undertaken.  The commitment for farmer welfare is also reflected by unprecedented decision of announcing minimum support price based on the formula of 1.5 times the cost of cultivation.

                Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh has said hundreds of millions of waste produced in India comes from agriculture and agricultural enterprises. According to statistics, 70% of the waste is used in industrial sector and as domestic fuel. The remaining waste can be converted into bio-components and bio fuels and can also be used in the generation of energy. While addressing National Conference on “Potential of Waste in Energy Generation and its Challenges” organized by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare and Indian Federation of Green Energy (IFGE) today he emphasized the need to eliminate pollution caused by the burning of crop residues and said that the poisonous gas generated by it affects human health and destroys soil nutrients. He informed that the government is providing subsidy @50-80% for crop residue management machinery. These machines help farmers in mixing crop residue with soil to make it more productive. Farmer groups are being provided financial assistance @80% of the project cost for establishing Farm Machinery Banks for Custom Hiring of crop residue management machinery. A provision of Rs 1151.80 crores for two years has been made under this scheme for states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCR.

He further informed that the management of crop residue in the field will help the soil become more fertile thereby resulting in savings of Rs 2000 per hectare from the farmer’s manure cost. By making palette from crop residue, it can be used for power generation. Under the sub mission on agricultural mechanization, 40% subsidy is given on straw rake, straw baler, loader etc. Through this, crop residue is collected and bales are made out of it so that it’s easy to carry to crop residue palette to power generation plants.

The Minister said that the Agricultural Engineering Division of the ICAR has done remarkable works in the area of bio-energy for biogas production from paddy straw biomass. 

He appealed to the farmers not to burn crop residue thereby helping protect human health and environment.

                The goal of agricultural development planning and investment in India needs to go beyond the production, productivity and acreage. Important as they are but these three are merely output indicators so far as the farmers as producers are concerned. The outcome from their perspective is to be seen in their gains in terms of profit and prosperity. Addressing second “India Agricultural outlook forum 2018” today, secretary , Agriculture and Farmers welfare Dr. S.K. Pattanayak said that as per the Fourth Advance Estimate a record production of 284.83 million tonnes during 2017-18 was achieved; which means an increase in production continuously for a second year. Horticulture output is also estimated to be a record level of 306.8 million tonnes in 2017-18.

Food inflation based on Wholesale Price Index has remained benign during 2017-18 and 2018-19 (Apr-Jun) at 1.9 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively due to record food grain production. Inflation in Cereals remained low at 0.3 per cent and 1.5 per cent during the above mentioned period and for pulses it remained negative since 2017-18. In order to incentivize pulses production and encourage farmers to grow pulses, Government significantly increased MSPs of pulses in 2017-18 and 2018-19 (Kharif). National Food Security Mission (NFSM) had a target for additional pulses production of 4 million tonnes by end 2017 which has been successfully achieved, thus significantly reducing the country’s dependence on imports.”

Dr. Pattanayak said bright agriculture outlook doesn’t mean a relaxed life for the Ministry of A&FW. The challenge that such a situation of abundance puts up before us is that of maintaining food prices at levels that ensure farmers get their due profits, while not letting the general consumers remain deprived of the gains of bumper harvest. For tackling such issues, the Secretary said that we have the policy instruments of Minimum Support Price, followed by procurement for Public Distribution System and through both Price Support Scheme and Market Intervention Scheme to modulate the supply in the market. He addressed that in food management the levels of procurement and off-take of food grains under the Public Distribution System and stock positions point to a very comfortable picture. 

The Secretary further said that the farmers face numerous problems in both managing agricultural production with the minimum possible cost and selling their produce at the maximum feasible agricultural produce prices because of serious market imperfections. The farmer faces farm input market imperfections which are handiworks of the business and industry involved in the production and distribution of these inputs. Similarly, when it comes to realizing maximum prices the agricultural produce market ground realities disable and deprive the farmers of their due prices. This shows in terms of non-availability of markets as such, and the exploitative nature of functioning of farm business and industry handling in agricultural markets. 

Dr. Pattanayak stated that the other factors that enable farmers to profit and prosper by ideal use of their land, animal, water, and forestry resources are related to their ability to maximize their income with a focus on maximizing revenue; and earn more by enhancing their farm business acumen. This requires serious attention to use innovative farm technology and management to increase both produce and earning on the one hand and reducing uncertainties related to crop, prices, and supporting services on the other hand.

                The development of dairy sector is imperative for the prosperity of farmers. Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh, at the inauguration ceremony of the seminar “Role of Technology in Doubling Dairy Farmers’ Income” in Anand, Gujarat, today praised the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) for playing a crucial role in the implementation of National Dairy Plan (NDP) and Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund (DIDF). Since the beginning, the NDDB has implemented several major dairy development programs including 'Operation Flood'. As a result, India has become self-sufficient to meet the demand of milk.

The Minister emphasized the role of technology for improvement in productivity and reduction in cost of production. In the wake of this, under the Rashtriya Gokul Mission, for the production of more female animals, 10 semen centers have been identified for the production of Sex Sorted Semen. Proposal for two centers (Uttarakhand and Maharashtra) have also been approved. Also, 20 Embryo Transfer Technology (ETT) centers are being set up for the production of high genetic merit bulls of indigenous bovine breeds, of which proposal of 19 centers have been approved. Besides, INDUSCHIP has been developed for genomic selection of indigenous breeds and 6000 dairy animals have been genetically evaluated using INDUSCHIP. 

According to the Minister, indigenous breeds are being promoted to reduce risks in production. For improving the breed of milch cattle, especially indigenous breeds, 1831 bulls have been produced so far against the target of 2200. Similarly, 6500 MAITRIs have been trained and deployed at the village level to provide doorstep AI services. Apart from this, for the conservation of indigenous breeds, two National Kamdhenu Breeding Centres, one in Andhra Pradesh at Chintaladevi and other in Madhya Pradesh at Itarsi are being established under which 41 cow and buffalo breeds are being conserved. The centre in AP has been completed and work is under progress at Itarsi, MP.

 

He also informed that the e-Pashuhaat portal is a landmark initiative, launched in 2016 in Animal Husbandry sector. It is playing an important role in connecting breeders and farmers. So far, the portal has information on 104570 animals, 8.32 crore semen doses and 364 embryos.

                Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that coconut palm the ‘Kalpavriksha’ is Nature's great boon for the healthy and wealthy life of mankind. Coconut is known to have been cultivated for thousands of years in our country and is an inevitable part of our culture and tradition, religious and social practices, folklore, food and drink. In folklore, coconut is the fruit which provides nutrition and is our heritage and legacy. The tree is mankind's true friend and a symbol of national integration.

Every year September 2 is celebrated as World Coconut Day to commemorate the formation day of Asian Pacific Coconut Community (APCC). APCC is an intergovernmental organization of 18 member countries mandated to promote, coordinate and harmonize coconut developmental activities of the Asian Pacific region to achieve maximum economic development.

The Minister said that India is one of the founder members of APCC. In India, under the leadership of the Central Government, the Coconut Development Board is celebrating World Coconut Day every year in various coconut producing states across the country. The theme announced by APCC for this year’s World Coconut Day is Coconut for Good Health, Wealth & Wellness.

 

India stands first in global coconut production and productivity. The annual coconut production of India is 2437.80 crore and the productivity is 11616 coconuts per hectare. The crop is cultivated in 20.98 lakh hectare. The crop contributes Rs 34,100 crore to GDP. More than one crore people depend on this crop for their livelihood.

The Minister informed that the National Horticulture Mission is implementing various aspirational schemes for the integrated development of coconut in the country and through these schemes farmers throughout the country get updated on scientific coconut cultivation, product processing, marketing and export.

The Coconut Development Board has made significant contribution for the remarkable achievements made in the coconut industry in the country. Coconut farmers can be led to prosperity only through value addition of coconut. For this, the Coconut Development Board is implementing the Technology Mission on Coconut programme under which 480 coconut processing units have been established with a capacity to process 274 crore nuts per year.

 

He said that after the Modi Government was sworn in, the Board has taken up many new initiatives for the development of coconut in the country and I have got the opportunity to be closely associated with this. It is worth mentioning that 9633 Coconut Producer Societies, 740 Coconut Producer Federations and 67 Coconut Producer Companies have been established in the country. I hope that all the schemes of the Board will be implemented through these farmer collectives and the farmers will assert their right over the processing, marketing and import of coconut products. 

 

The Coconut Development Board has made laudable achievements under its skill development in coconut sector viz. Friends of Coconut Tree (FOCT) Training Programme and the Neera Technician training programme and has given training to more than 60998 youths and 2637 Neera Technicians.

 


	Board through its various sponsored research programmes has brought before the world the goodness of not only coconut oil but also tender coconut and other coconut products. Now we know that coconut oil has medium chain fatty acids which is disease resistant and heart friendly and virgin coconut oil can prevent premature ageing. Research has shown that virgin coconut oil is effective in curing diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer diseases. The Minister appealed to the people to take up this sacred fruit, which is the identity of our tradition and culture, and enjoy the innumerable benefits of this fruit for the wellness of our families.


 

The government has increased the Minimum Support Price of Milling Copra from Rs 6500 per Quintal to Rs 7511 per Quintal and for Ball copra from Rs 6785 per Quintal to Rs 7757 per Quintal. Not only this, the government has declared up to 5% incentive in the export value (FOB) in its new Foreign Trade Policy for 2015-20 for the promotion of coconut product export. A quantum leap in the export of coconut products is expected in the near future as the price of coconut products is increasingly becoming highly competitive.

Income earned from export of coconut products was Rs 3975 crore during 2004-14, which increased to Rs 6448 crore during 2014-18. With the efforts of Modi Government, India has started exporting coconut oil to Malaysia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Till last year, India used to import coconut oil from these countries. Besides, for the first time, India is exporting large quantities of dry coconut to US and European countries.

The Minister said that he is confident that the farmers will avail the benefits of the schemes implemented by the Board and will take forward the coconut cultivation and industry for their better Health, Wealth and Wellness. The Coconut Development Board with its whole hearted efforts will leave no stone unturned to fulfil the dreams of the farmers and beneficiaries. India will become the global leader in not only the production and productivity of coconut but also in processing and export, and the innumerable qualities of coconut will emerge.

Background:

RCF is a leading fertilizer and chemical manufacturing company in India in the Public Sector. It was established on 6th March, 1978 on the reorganization of erstwhile Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. Presently, the authorized share capital of RCF is Rs.800 Crore and paid up capital of Rs. 551.69 Crore. Company has been accorded coveted ""Miniratna"" status in 1997. MMRDA acquired 48,849.74 sq.mtrs.

RCF received TDR certificate of 16530 sq. mtrs. on 1.11.2017 issued by MMRDA against 8265 sq. mlrs. ofunencitmbered/free land as an interim relief. The claim of RCF for TDR/compensation against encumbered land admeasuring 40584.74 sq. mtrs.is being decided by the Arbitrator.

RCF was demanding from MCGM to delete the internal roads of RCF colony from their Development Plan of Mumbai for a long time.

The interiors of the building depict local handicrafts, artwork and tourist destinations of the state highlighting rich ethos and culture of the region. The city side is being aesthetically landscaped with lush green areas connecting passengers to the nature. 

With a 2390 metre-long runway, the airport will be able to park A-320 type aircraft. The Terminal Building has five check-in counters and one arrival carousel with peak hour handling capacity of 300 passengers. Apart from the New Terminal Building, the airport infrastructure also includes Isolation Bay, New Technical Block-cum-Control Tower, Fire Station Category-VII, MT Workshop and essential Navigational & Visual Aids.

An efficient sewage treatment plant, reuse of treated water for horticulture and air-conditioning purposes, rain-water harvesting system to recharge groundwater, sewage treatment plant, solar power system, energy-efficient chillers and a green belt along the approach road of the airport are few other green features of the airport development project.  

The new airport at Jharsuguda will play a significant role in the development of Western Odisha and will give impetus to the growing tourism industry in the region.

                India and Morocco signed the revised Air Services Agreement between the two countries enabling greater connectivity through a modernized agreement.  The delegation of the two countries have met three times in the past years wherein they have worked towards liberalization of markets between the two countries and updating of the existing Air Services Agreement. The two sides cleared the legal and technical difficulties and agreed to a modern new text for the Air Services Agreement.  Thereafter, both sides took approval for the agreed text of the Air Services Agreement from the respective governments and after approval, this document has been formally signed during the visit of  Shri Mohammed Sajid, Minister of Tourism, Air Transport, Handicraft and Social Economy who signed for the Moroccan side and the Union Minister of Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviation, Shri Suresh Prabhu signed for the Indian side.

This milestone is enabler for greater air connectivity between India and Morocco and will enable the airlines of each side to enter into code share with airlines of other party, as well as provide greater freedom in mounting direct flights.  These developments in the Civil Aviation sector will enable the people of each country to travel to the other country leading to better economic and cultural ties.

                A familiarization flight from Mumbai to Sindhudurg landed today at Parule Chipi Greenfield airport in Sindhudurg district of the Konkan region of Maharashtra. With this successful test flight access to the Konkan coast of Maharashtra will become easier and some of Maharashtra’s top tourist attractions will become accessible to visitors from all over India. Commercial flights will become operational from December this year.

The airport is located between Malvan and Vengurla, the Tarkarli beach and Sindhudurg fort are 20 kms away. The commissioning of this airport also improves accessibility to North Goa. The beaches of Tiracol, Arambol and Mandrem are equidistant from Goa’s Dabolim airport.

The 2,500 meters runway will be able to handle aircrafts like the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. The terminal building has the capacity to handle 400 passengers at its peak.

Civil Aviation Minister, Suresh Prabhu, has asked the airport management company and Maharashtra State Government to resolve the pending issues related to ILS installation and VOR installation so that regular operations may begin on schedule.

The co-pilot of the flight was a local girl from Devgad in Sindhudurg district.

                The Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, said that India is committed for a strong economic partnership with Uzbekistan. Speaking at India – Uzbekistan Business forum in New Delhi today he said that India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and will become the third largest in a decade.

Trade relations between India and Uzbekistan are governed by the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation signed in May 1993. This agreement provides for mutual MFN treatment, promotion of economic, industrial, scientific and technical cooperation, including active participation of small and medium sized enterprises in bilateral economic cooperation.

India’s exports to Uzbekistan includes pharmaceutical products, mechanical equipment, vehicles and optical instruments. India imports fruits and vegetables, services, fertilizers and lubricants from Uzbekistan. According to the State Statistics Committee, India’s share, during the period January-June 2016, in the total volume of exports of Uzbekistan was just 0.4% and stood at 20th place among countries that are trading partners of Uzbekistan, and imports were 2.9%.

                Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation Minister, Suresh Prabhu, emphasized the need for scrapping unnecessary and unproductive regulations which are coming in the way of India’s capacity to become a ten trillion dollar economy.  He was addressing the Annual Session of PHD Chambers in New Delhi today. The Minister said that a standing committee, chaired by the Secretary, DIPP, has been set up to identify regulations that may be scrapped. He also urged the industry chamber to identify such regulations at the earliest.

The Commerce Minister said that although India has made significant progress in ease of doing business but it still has a long way to go. Suresh Prabhu also spoke about improving ease of doing business at the district level. He informed that 6 districts have been selected in five states of the country as a pilot project in order to implement mechanism on enhancing growth in these districts by 3%.  Growth at the district level will lead to increase in the GDP at the national level. The Minister said that this will not only earn more revenue for the Government but will also create more jobs in the districts. Suresh Prabhu however cautioned that environmental protection should never be compromised at any cost. The Minister also gave away PHD annual awards for excellence for the year 2018.

Suresh Prabhu launching World Bank report on regional trade in South Asia

Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, launched the World Bank Group’s regional trade report “A Glass Half Full-The Promise of Regional Trade in South Asia” at a seminar organised by FICCI in New Delhi today.

Speaking on this occasion the Minister said that the potential for intra-trade growth in South Asia region has not been fully tapped as yet. The Minister further stated that during his recent trip to Bangladesh talks on boosting trade between the two countries were discussed and Bangladesh Trade Minister along with a delegation has been invited to India to discuss trade and investment potential between the two countries and India and Bangladesh are already working on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). During the Minister’s recent visit to Bangladesh it has been decided to set up seven border haats some of which will start immediately. The Minister further added that the potential of services sector is yet to be explored in this region.

India’s top three trading partners in South Asia are Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. India’s trade with South Asia is only 3% of its global trade. Today India’s trade with the world stands at 637.4 billion USD but with South Asia it stands at only 19.1billion USD.          

   Deeper regional trade and connectivity can reduce the isolation of northeast India, give India better access to markets in East Asia, and allow it to substitute fossil fuels by cleaner hydropower from Nepal and Bhutan. Trade between India and Pakistan is a paltry USD 2 billion. The book shows that without artificial barriers, this should be USD 37 billion. 

 The book is written by Sanjay Kathuria and a team of South Asian researchers and it advocates an approach of open regionalism, using intra-regional trade as complementary to, and as a stepping stone for, deeper global integration.

                The Minister of Commerce & Industry, Suresh Prabhu, has approved the constitution of a High Level Advisory Group (HLAG) to make recommendations for identifying and pursuing opportunities and for addressing challenges in order to find a way forward in the contemporary global trade scenario.  

The HLAG will consider ways for boosting India’s share and importance in global merchandise and services trade, managing pressing bilateral trade relations and mainstreaming new age policy making.

The terms of reference (ToR) of the HLAG are to examine the prevailing international trade dynamics, including, but not confined to, the rising protectionist tendencies, especially on the part of major economies, non-engagement by some countries on outstanding trade negotiation issues and commitments, including the Doha Development Agenda, and their insistence on pursuing negotiating mandates, in many cases prematurely and without efforts, to build consensus and common understanding.

On new issuesand in light of this examination,the HLAG will suggest a way forward for India, taking into account its interests and sensitivities, and provide options for a balanced approach for the global community to build on achievements thus far, in creating a conducive global trade framework and move forward in a harmonious and consensual manner that is acceptable to the larger global community. 

The Group may consider possible approaches and suggest a pragmatic framework for India’s future engagement in international trade, and the manner in which it can play a proactive and constructive role in working with the community of Nations in exploring and building consensus on resolving emergent trade related issues.

Dr. Surjit S. Bhalla, Director of Oxus Research and Investments will chair the HLAG. The other members of the Group are S.Jaishankar, former Foreign Secretary, Rajeev Kher, former Commerce Secretary and Member, Competition Appellate Tribunal, Sanjeev Sanyal, Principal Economic Advisor, Government of India,AdilZainulbhai, Chairman, Quality Council of India,Dr.HarshaVardhana Singh, former DDG, WTO,Dr.Shekhar Shah,DG, NCAER,Dr.Vijay Chauthaiwale, Foreign Policy Advisor,Dr.Pulok Ghosh, IIM Bangalore, Jayant Dasgupta, former Ambassador of India to the WTO, Rajiv K Luthra of Luthra&Luthra and Chandrajit Banerjee, DG, CII.

The HLAG will meet regularly over the next two months and make specific implementable recommendations in light of the ToR, including on each of the areas, to facilitate the formulation of future trade policies. The HLAG may invite special invitees whose inputs may be considered necessary.Centre for WTO Studies (CWTOS), New Delhi shall provide the secretariat to the HLAG.

The consignment will be received by China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) which is one of China's state-owned food processing holding companies. After concerted efforts of the Government of India, 19 rice mills and processing units have been registered for export of non-basmati rice from India to China. 

The protocol between General Administration of Customs of the People’s Republic of China and the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare of the Republic of India on phyto-sanitary requirements for exporting rice from India to China was signed on June 9, 2018 at Qingdao, China, during the visit of the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. This amended the earlier protocol on phyto-sanitary requirements for exporting rice from India to China to include the export of non-basmati varieties of rice from India.

                A bilateral meeting was held in Dhaka today between Commerce Minister of Bangladesh, Tofail Ahmed, MP and Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation Minister of India, Suresh Prabhu.

Both Ministers noted the significant progress made in the bilateral relationship under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They reiterated their commitment to further strengthen the bilateral relations on the basis of friendship, trust and understanding for the mutual benefit of the people of Bangladesh and India.

The two Ministers discussed a number of trade, investment and connectivity related matters of interest. These include a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, Border Haats, improvement of infrastructure and operations of Land Customs Stations on the Bangladesh - India border, recognition of test certificates, anti-dumping measures and port restrictions.

Considering the vision of Bangladesh to become a middle income country by 2021 and a developed country by 2041, both Ministers agreed that a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) covering goods, services and investment would provide a sound basis for substantial enhancement of trade and commercial partnership. They directed their officials to undertake a joint study on the prospects of entering into a bilateral CEPA.

Both Ministers agreed to expedite the constitution of a Bangladesh - India CEO Forum for providing policy level inputs relating to trade and investment issues under different sectors of interest such as jute, textiles, energy, pharmaceuticals, information technology, etc. The Forum could convene sectoral sub groups to deliberate on specific issues concerning each sector. Minister Prabhu invited Bangladesh’s participation in the Partnership Summit, to be organised by India in January 2019, as a Partner Country. Minister Prabhu also offered to organize a joint investment summit in India in October - November 2018, focused on bilateral investments and invited Minister Ahmed to participate in the summit, along with a business delegation drawn from identified sectors of interest. Minister Ahmed agreed to consider the visit. Minister Ahmed also requested that Indian investors be encouraged to utilise the facilities being offered by the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA).

In the context of a number of new initiatives being taken by both India and Bangladesh in various sectors, both Ministers agreed to establish a mechanism such as a joint multi-disciplinary group for sharing of best practices for mutual benefit.

Minister Ahmed requested to address the issue of anti-dumping duty levied on import of jute goods and other products from Bangladesh to India. In response Suresh Prabhu conveyed that the concerns of the relevant exporters would be taken into consideration during the investigations. He also suggested that a meeting between the Jute industry of the two countries could be organized to find the way forward on resolving the issue. Both sides agreed for early finalization of MoU under consideration, aimed at capacity building of Bangladesh officials in issues related to trade remedies. Both sides also agreed to consider an MoU between Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute (BFTI) and Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) for capacity building of trade officials and stakeholders, including joint training in either country.

Both sides agreed to arrange industry-specific interactions among the respective stakeholders to enhance business to business cooperation and utilize inherent advantages of both countries towards a larger share of the global value chains relating to pharmaceuticals, leather, jute and textiles sectors.

Both Ministers agreed to fast-track the completion of six new Border Haats which are under construction and identification of locations for six additional Border Haats, including Dalu-Nakugaon in Sherpur district proposed by Bangladesh in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including Government of Meghalaya by the Indian side. Both Ministers expressed their intention to inaugurate the first additional Border Haat at the earliest.

Recognizing the importance of Petrapole-Benapole land border trading point, the two Ministers agreed to remove impediments affecting smooth clearance of cargo at this location. In this regard, they agreed for a one-time push to remove congestion of cargo trucks, with effect from 15th October 2018, for a period of two months. Minister Prabhu also reiterated India’s offer to support improvement of infrastructure of Land Customs Stations (LCS) in Bangladesh, adjoining Tripura border.

Minister Ahmed raised the issue relating to recognition by Indian authorities of test certificates issued by the Bangladesh Standard and Testing Institution (BSTI). Minister Prabhu assured that expeditious resolution would be carried out for acceptance of BSTI test certificates for export of cement and steel products from Bangladesh. On the request of recognition of BSTI test certificates for 6 additional food products, Minister Prabhu assured that it would be recognized once BSTI receives the accreditation from NABL or equivalent institution for these products. Minister Ahmed also raised the issue of acceptance of BSTI certificates for caustic soda. Minister Prabhu mentioned that the issue is being examined for expeditious resolution, including issue of license to Bangladesh exporters, as an interim measure.

Minister Prabhu raised the issue of sudden increase in imports of refined edible palm and soybean oil from Bangladesh and the possibility of routing of third country origin oils into India, through Bangladesh under SAFTA. It was requested that the concerned Certificates of Origin are issued with due diligence and regularly shared with the Indian authorities, if possible through online mode. Minister Ahmed mentioned that the Certificates of Origin under SAFTA are issued carefully after considering the requisite evidence. He, however, agreed to examine the issue for resolution keeping in view the interest of bonafide exporters.

Minister Prabhu appreciated the recent relaxation in port restrictions allowed by Bangladesh but requested that as per issue taken up by Tripura and other State Governments, more products may be allowed to be exported through the Land Customs Stations on the border.

Minister Prabhu highlighted that many international tenders issued by various agencies and Ministries of Government of Bangladesh preclude participation of Indian companies by restricting the country of origin of goods or services to be supplied. He requested that this issue may be addressed expeditiously. Minister Ahmed agreed to have the issue examined by the concerned authorities for early resolution.

Both Ministers expressed appreciation on the recent developments in the field of connectivity between the two countries, including rail connectivity. Noting the need to restore pre-1965 railway connectivity between two countries, Bangladesh side proposed to start a new end-to-end train service between Dhaka and Siliguri with customs and immigration checks at the starting points at both ends. Bangladesh side mentioned the need to establish seamless dual gauge rail connectivity between western and eastern part of Bangladesh for which Indian side offered its support to Bangladesh.

The Ministers expressed concern that the global trade and economic situation is at a critical stage due to the ongoing trade tensions in which developing countries and LDCs suffer consequential collateral damage. Keeping this in view, they reiterated their commitment to the rule-based multilateral trading system that ensures free, fair and open global trade for achieving sustainable economic growth and development. Recalling the successful WTO Mini Ministerial Meeting held in New Delhi in March 2018, the Ministers called for collective action for revitalizing WTO without undermining its core principles of Special and Differential Treatment, Consensus Building, Inclusiveness and Transparency.

                The National Mission on Government e Marketplace (GeM),waslaunched by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Suresh Prabhu, on 5th of September 2018. This was followed by the launch of the Mission in 19 States and Union Territories. 

The Government of India decided to launch a six week long National Mission on GeM from 6th Sept. to 17thOct 2018in order to increase awareness, accelerate the use of GeM andto further augment the proven benefits of procurement through GeM for all government departments and organisations.

It covers all central government departments, states and public sector undertakings in a mission mode by organising workshops, roadshow, trainings, events and other information, education and communication activities, including buyer and seller registration.

During the awareness period, a buyer registration drive has been launched for on-boarding and increasing procurement by Central, State and local agencies on GeM. A vendor registration drive has also been initiated for on-boarding additional categories and populating the available ones on GeM with more vendors. Central Ministries, States and their agencies, including local offices, have been tasked with sharing a list of key vendors for on-boarding on GeM. 

 

Widespread training initiatives are being undertaken across the country, ensuring on-boarded buyers and sellers are aware of all GeM features, thereby fully utilising the offerings for achieving greater efficiency. Moreover, GeM has committed to work with all entities in providing operational support for facilitating seamless transactions on GeM and resolving any issues in online procurement. 

 

In two years of its operations, GeM has recorded till date more than 8 lakh transactions worth over Rs.12,239crore.GeM has established itself as an open, transparent, efficient and inclusive platform providing huge savings to the Government. GeM has nearly 27.9 thousand buyer organisations registered and about 1.43 lakh sellers and service providers offering more than 4.86 lakh products and services for online purchase. GeM contributes to approximately 20-25% average overall savings to the Government. 

 

Government e Marketplace is the National Public Procurement Portal offering an online, end-to-end solution for procurement of common use goods and services by government departments. It is used by Central and State Government Ministries and Departments, Central and State Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs & SPSUs), autonomous institutions and local bodies.

                A five member delegation of Australian Superfunds called on Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu here today. During the meeting, the Minister   highlighted  the potential of Indian growth story and  assured them of stability and certainty of business in long term. He said India provides abundant opportunities for Australian Superfunds and our priority is to engage them to explore investing in India.

Australia’s superannuation funds valued at 2.6 trillion Australian dollar  is one of the world’s largest in terms of volume. The funds have exposure including in various international markets. However, their exposure to Indian markets is still very limited, despite continued greater than average market returns in India. India has emerged as the fastest growing major economy in the world, with growth rates averging over 7% annually.

Australia- India bilateral investment cooperation has received a renewed focus from the highest authorities in both the countries. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his meeting with his Australian counterpart,  on the side-lines of Commonwealth Head of Governments Meeting in April 2018, had discussed  the opportunities for Australian Superfunds to invest in the   Indian economy. Australians have also commissioned and launched recenlty an India Economic Strategy which recommends that Australian companies should strive by 2035 to lift India into their top three export markets and to bring India into the inner circle of Australia’s strategic partnerships, among others.

                Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu led the Indian delegation for the G-20 Trade Ministers Meeting (TMM) held at Mar del Plata, Argentina on 14 September 2018. The G-20 TMM was represented by Ministers/Vice Ministers of G20 countries, 8 guest countries and 7 Heads/Deputy Heads of International Organisations such as WTO, ITC, OECD, World Bank, IMF, CAF and IADB. As Argentina is the President of G-20 this year, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina, Mr. Jorge Faurie and Minister for Production and Labour, Mr. Dante Sica jointly chaired the Sessions. The overall objective of the Argentine Presidency of G-20 is ‘Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development’. 

The programme of the G-20 TMM included a breakfast meeting to facilitate free exchange of views on the current global trade developments and three plenary sessions on specific topics of the agenda on current international trade developments, trade and investment aspects of Agro Food Global Value Chains (GVCs) and trade and investment aspects of the New Industrial Revolution (NIR). 

Suresh Prabhu participated in all the sessions including the breakfast meeting. The Ministers held a shared view that the global trade and economic situation was at a critical stage due to the ongoing trade tensions, driven largely by protectionist and unilateral measures by some countries and resolved to collectively work towards enhancing confidence in international trade through dialogue and collaborations.  Indian Commerce and Industry Minister underlined that as developing countries and LDCs suffer consequential collateral damage due to trade conflicts, resolution of differences through dialogue between the parties should be promoted. He urged G-20 to change the narrative on trade by focusing on the potential of Services for enhancing the global trade, keeping in view that Services contribute more than 50% to the World GDP. Endorsing India's commitment to the rule-based multilateral trading system, Suresh Prabhu called for collective action for revitalising WTO without undermining its core principles of special and differential treatment, consensus building, inclusiveness and transparency. Most members recalled the successful WTO Mini Ministerial meeting held in New Delhi in March 2018 as India’s significant contribution to the revitalisation of WTO. 

The Ministers recognised the importance of Agro Food GVCs for enhancing global food security. Suresh Prabhu underlined the relevance of keeping in focus realisation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 targets relating to removal of hunger, alleviation of poverty, empowerment of women, employment generation, without losing sight of the plight of millions of small and marginal farmers in developing countries and LDCs. He further drew attention to the need for tackling non-tariff barriers in the form of SPS measures that are more trade distorting than tariffs. He urged G-20 to support transfer of technology, research, promote agri services and responsible investment in agri businesses with an aim to encouraging greater value addition for MSMEs. 

On the New Industrial Revolution, Ministers acknowledged the central role of digital technologies. Commerce & Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu  drew attention to the need for minimising technology disruptions and promoting distributive gains for the collective good of all countries and, in this regard, he  urged G-20 to work towards closing gaps in the digital divide within and across nations through capacity building measures, technology adaptation and meaningful investments to give primacy to protection and promotion of domestic entrepreneurs with an aim to job creation for millions of youth. He underlined the need for a holistic approach to the NIR, one that is inclusive and development oriented. 

Suresh Prabhu held 24 bilateral meetings with his counterpart Ministers and Heads of delegation on the sidelines of the G-20 TMM with whom he exchanged views on ways to reform WTO and strengthen bilateral relations.

The G-20 TMM deliberations will feed into the G-20 Leaders Declaration which will be adopted at the G-20 Summit on 30 November – 1 December 2018 in Buenos Aires in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to participate.

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, will participate in the G-20, Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting, being held in Mar del Plata in Argentina on 14th – 15th September 2018. The meeting will provide an opportunity for a dialogue on current developments in international trade and its implications for the global economy. The Ministerial Meeting will discuss about building an inclusive trade system that contributes to sustainable and shared growth. Trade and investment must benefit all and countries must jointly address both the opportunities and challenges of globalization, innovation and technological advancements. The Ministerial Meeting will examine the inter relationship between trade and development with a special emphasis on the need to promote further integration of small and medium sized companies into international trade, and the opportunities posed by the digital economy and new technologies.   

Ahead of the meeting, the Commerce Minister said that India will work along with other countries to reform WTO and ensure that it continues to be an engine for global trade. The Minister further said that India looks forward to working with all member countries for an agreeable, forward looking, reform agenda. Through the G-20 forum India will take this idea forward in mission mode. Further, the key issues that will be discussed in the Ministerial Meeting include global value chains, the new industrial revolution and the international trade outlook. The multilateral trading system is facing unprecedented challenges in the wake of protectionist measures by some countries, which is not compatible with the WTO. 

G-20 is made up of 19 countries and the EU. The countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. The other invited members are Chile, Netherlands, Spain and representatives of regional groups of Jamaica, Rwanda, Singapore and Senegal.

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, recently visited the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok in Russia. The visit began with a tour of the diamond cutting and polishing factory set up by the KGK Group of India in Vladivostok.

The Commerce Minister also had an interaction with Dmitry Kobylkin, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation. Issues of mutual cooperation in areas of conservation of environment like saving the tiger and elephant population, water cooperation and environmental sustainability were discussed.

Suresh Prabhu met with Maxim Oreshkin, Minister for Economic Development of the Russian Federation. The two sides held talks about further strengthening economic ties between India and Russia and the way forward in developing synergies for mutual growth. The Commerce Minister addressed top CEOs at a reception of the All-Russia Business Association ""Delovaya Rossiya"" (Business Russia), which is a Union of next-generation Russian entrepreneurs operating mainly in the non-commodity and processing sectors. Suresh Prabhu spoke about the immense growth potential in the business ties of the two countries and the way to forge new partnerships between Indian and Russian businesses.

          On the last day of the three-day visit, the Commerce Minister participated in the session of “Timber in the Russian Far East: Increasing the Industries Economic Returns”. Discussions were held on how to explore possibilities of working together for mutual benefit through this resource in a sustainable manner. India is one of the world’s largest importers of timber having imported over 3 mn cubic meters of topical logs in 2016 and 346,000 cubic meters of tropical veneer. Although bulk of imports have come from countries like Malaysia, Myanmar, Ghana and Ecuador it is now facing difficulties in securing raw material from these countries. This opens up opportunities for suppliers in the Far East Region of Russia which enjoys an abundance of timber resources.

Suresh Prabhu also met Rustam Minnikhanov, Governor of Tatarstan, Russia and talks centred around cooperation between India and Russia in sectors like pharma, automobiles, logistics and agriculture.

The Commerce Minister participated in the session on “Digital Transport: The future of Greater Eurasia at the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia”. The Minister said that sustainable mobility solutions are emerging as an important industry across the world and India is looking to working with partners like Russia in the green mobility space. 

Commerce Minister, Suresh Prabhu, ended his tour to Vladivostok with a visit to Radio Sputnik and spoke about India’s investment potential, opportunities for Russian businesses and future avenues for economic cooperation between India and Russia.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for introduction of Bill in Parliament for amendment of NID Act, 2014 to include the four new National Institutes of Design (NID) viz. National Institute of Design, Amaravati/Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh; National Institute of Design, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh; National Institute of Design, Jorhat, Assam and National Institute of Design, Kurukshetra, Haryana within the ambit of the National Institute of Design Act, 2014 and to declare them as Institutions of National Importance (INIs) at par with the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. Some minor amendments to the Act including consequential amendments considered necessary namely, to re-name NID Vijayawada as NID Amaravati and nomenclature of Principal Designer as equivalent to Professor are also proposed in the Bill.

Establishing new NIDs as Institutions of National Importance in different geographical regions of the country will help produce highly skilled manpower in design which, in turn, will create job opportunities, both direct and indirect, by providing sustainable design interventions for crafts, handloom, rural technology, small, medium and large scale enterprises; and outreach programmes for capacity, capability and institution building.

Suresh Prabhu and Russian Federation Minister, Dmitry Kobylkin, releasing a book on tiger conservation at Vladivostok

Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, had a meeting with Dmitry Kobylkin, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment of Russian Federation. Both sides discussed issues of mutual cooperation in areas of common concern like conservation of environment, saving the tiger, water cooperation and environmental sustainability. Suresh Prabhu is in Vladivostok, Russia, to attend the Far Eastern Economic Forum being held from 11th – 13th September 2018.

 

During the meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, Yury Trutnev, the Commerce Minister discussed issues of mutual cooperation in sectors like mining and geological exploration in gold and diamond, water cooperation, forestry, timber and agriculture.

 

Suresh Prabhu met with the Governors, Vice Governors and representatives of regions of the Far-East: Primorye, Yakutia, Sakhalin, Amur, Magadan, Kamchatka, and Khabarovsk. Discussions were held on possibilities of mutual co-operation in sectors like mining, agriculture and tourism. Possibilities of co-operation between India's states and Russia's regions were also discussed. The Commerce Minister invited Regional Governors of the Far East to visit India with business delegations in order to explore areas of co-operation.

 

The Commerce Minister also participated in a session on “Timber in the Far East-Increasing Industry’s Economic Return”. He spoke about strengthening economic ties and forging new partnerships between India and Russia at a reception organized by “Delovaya Russia” (Business Russia).

 

New initiatives from the Russian Federation and changing neighbourhood dynamics have increased the need for India to evaluate the opportunities available in the Far East of Russia.

 

India was the first country to establish a resident consulate in Vladivostok in 1992. However, India’s existing engagement with the region is limited to isolated pockets. In order to bolster the trade ties it is imperative that connectivity between India and Vladivostok have to be simplified, affordable and time efficient. Ease of connectivity will not only provide access to the resource rich, unexplored Far East but will also strengthen India’s geo-political stature.

Sanjay Bhattacharyya,India’s Ambassador to Turkey, at Source India pavilion 

 

The Trade Promotion Council of India (TPCI) led a75-member Indian delegation for the ongoing 87th Izmir International Trade Show in Turkey. The delegation had several B2B meetings and business tie-ups with members of the Turkish business community.India is the Focus Country in the trade show with a standalone pavilion named ‘Source India’. The India Pavilion is a multi-product pavilion, including companies displaying products like ceramics, cereals and mechanical appliances.

The ‘Source India’ Pavilion was inaugurated by Sanjay Bhattacharyya, India’s Ambassador to Ankara, Turkey. Speaking on the occasion, Bhattacharrya spoke about the strong commercial and economic relations shared by India and Turkey. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $7 billion in 2017, an increase of 8% over the previous year. He said that there is a huge potential for tie-ups between Indian and Turkish agriculture and food processing sectors. The collaborations may range from farming technology, high yielding varieties, farm machinery, food processing and cold storage.

A business collaboration has been worked out by TPCI and BIM, a Turkish supermarket chain,having 6500 stores in Turkey, 600 in Morocco and 400 in Egypt. BIM is looking to open a store in India as well. Another similar partnership agreement has been worked out with MIGROS, owners of Ram stores, a prominent brand in Kazakhstan and Macedonia.

With a similar structure in demand and supply India and Turkey can co-operate in sectors like automotive components, construction machinery, agri products and food processing, consumer electronics, jewellery, natural stones, cosmetics, furniture, textiles machinery, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. There is also great potential for co-operation between the two countries in the services sectors like construction, tourism and health care.

TPCI, a trade and investment promotion organization of Department of Commerce, has organized similar pavilions in countries like Nigeria and South Africa. These events serve the purpose of opening new areas for co-operation in trade and investment between India and the rest of the world.

India and Turkey had set a bilateral trade target of $10 billion during a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in May 2017.

                India is the Partner Country in the 87th Izmir International tradeshow which begins in Turkey from Friday, September 7, 2018. In this tradeshow India will also be launching a mega business pavilion ‘Source India’ hosting 75 Indian companieswith the aim of tie-ups in order to increase India’s exports to Turkey and other neighbouring countries. 

This is part of a series of Source India pavilions that the Trade Promotion Council of India (TPCI) is hosting in important tradeshows across the world for boosting India’s exports. TPCI is the trade and investment promotion organization of the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce &Industry, Government of India, and works to open new areas for co-operation in trade and investment between India and rest of the world. 

The 87th Izmir International tradeshow will be held in Izmir – the third most populous city in Turkey, after Istanbul and Ankara – from 7th to 11th September, 2018. Owing to India’s participation as Focus Country status, India’s National Anthem will be played and the National Flag displayed on the screens put up in the show. Special signage will be erected to lead buyers and visitors to the ‘Source India’ pavilion.

Source India, with 75 Indian participating companies, is a multi-product pavilion though some of the key potential areas for increasing trade with Turkey are ceramics, cereals and machinery or mechanical appliances. 

Turkey’s ceramic imports from the world is USD 339.8 million and only USD 16.6 million from India and India exportsmore than USD1.2 billion worth of ceramic products to the world. 

India exports cereals worth USD 91.6 million to Turkey compared to Turkey’s import of USD 1.7 billion worth of cereals from the world. India has the capacity to increase its export in this sector as it is currently exporting USD7.3 billion worth of cereals to the world.

India’s Ambassador to Ankara, Sanjay Bhattacharyya, hassaid that there is great potential for tie-ups between Indian and Turkish agriculture and food processing sectors. Collaborationsmay range from farming technology, high yielding varieties, farm machinery, food processing and cold storage. The large Turkish market and preferential access to European markets will provide great opportunities for Indian entrepreneurs to set up joint ventures in Turkey.

                Union Minister of Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu said that demand for energy will increase due to rapid development taking place in India and fossil fuel is not going to last forever and therefore there is need for renewable energy. He was speaking at afunction of International Solar Alliance (ISA) Innovation and Investment Forum in New Delhi today. Suresh Prabhu said that fossil fuel is not going to last for ever even if its resources are managed in the best possible manner. He said that the use of shale gas and oil is limited and it adversely impacts the environment. The threat of climate change has become a reality and it has affected bio-diversity of the planet. Imbalanced use of energy is the root cause of many environmental problems in different parts of the world. It is causing unprecedented heat wave conditions in Europe, intensity and frequency of typhoons have also increased. 

Referring to variations in Monsoon rainfall in India, the Minister said that India is in no way responsible for what is happening in the atmosphere over Indian Ocean, but it has to bear the consequences of ocean warming. He said that the time has come when we will have to switch over to the clean form of energy like solar power.

The Minister stated that the idea of solar alliance was conceived by Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, in 2015 as a treaty based international intergovernmental organization. ISA stands for co-operation among 121 solar rich countries lying fully or partially between the tropics in order to promote massive deployment of solar energy and make solar energy affordable. 

He said ISA provides an opportunity to all countries to bring prosperity, energy security and sustainable development to their peoples. He said that once the generation of solar energy goes up, its prices will come down. Suresh Prabhu stressed on joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and technology for massive production of solar energy. He said many firms of Australia and Japan are keen to invest in India in solar energy sector. The Minister emphasized on the need for sending market signals so that more funds are invested in R&D in solar energy. India has set a target to generate100 GW solar energy by 2022 for increasing share of carbon free energy in the energy mix.

                In the 6th Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Ministerial Meeting held on 30-31 August, 2018, in Singapore, Union Minister of Commerce and Industry, Suresh Prabhu, led the Indian delegation. The Ministers attending the meeting took stock of the state of negotiations across the various negotiating Groups and Sub-Working Groups. The Chair of the Trade Negotiating Committee, Mr. Pak Iman Pambagyo, made a detailed presentation on the state of play of RCEP negotiations and sought ministerial guidance and direction on pending issues. The Ministers acknowledged the good progress made in the negotiations so far with successful conclusion of 4 chapters, namely (i) Economic and Technical Cooperation; (ii) Small and Medium Enterprises; (iii) Customs Procedures and Trade Facilitation; and (iv) Government Procurement. The Ministers endorsed ‘The Package of Year End Deliverables’ and urged the negotiators to intensify their work with a view to narrowing gaps and finding balanced outcomes in the negotiations as it moves forward. On key pillars of the negotiations, the Commerce Minister defended India’s interests effectively and secured maximum flexibilities.

 

In Goods, the negotiators have been tasked to work on the ASEAN’s Non-Paper on Trade in Goods Market Access Negotiations, which is to be considered as the working assumption paper. Commerce Minister reiterated the need for providing adequate flexibilities on various elements of the Non-Paper, such as exclusion, reduction, staging and deviations. Accordingly, it was agreed that member countries will intensify bilateral pairing process on requests and offers basis on these elements and determine the ambition level of each country to the mutual satisfaction. 

 

In Services, Suresh Prabhu emphasised on the importance of maintaining quality and commercially meaningful offers across all Modes. In a significant development, all member countries agreed to establish the linkage between Mode 4/ MoNP and the Services text. While welcoming this linkage, Union Commerce Minister urged member countries to make quality offers by 5th October 2018. 

 

In Investment, the Commerce Minister underlined the importance of negotiations focussing on the application of Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) and mentioned that clarity on its application would lead to further movement in the Investment Chapter. At India’s behest, it was agreed that ISDS will not apply to MFN and PPR. All member countries are expected to submit their revised Reservation Lists without broad sectoral carve outs. 

 

The Ministers directed that the negotiations on all these issues be intensified during the 24th RCEP Auckland Round from 17-24th October 2018.

 

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is a mega regional free trade agreement being negotiated amongst 16 countries, comprising 10 ASEAN countries (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) and six ASEAN FTA partners, namely Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea and New Zealand. So far 6 Ministerial Meetings, 5 Inter-sessional Ministerial Meetings and 23 Rounds of the Trade Negotiating Committee at the technical level have been held.

                Minister of State for Communications (Independent Charge) Shri Manoj Sinha today released the First Edition of Compendium of Circulars on Compliance, Technology, Security, Administration and Rural Matters. Shri Sinha said that the telecom industry has grown leaps and bounds over the last decade. With a large number of Licensees in the country, a need was felt for bringing in uniformity of the understanding, and clarity and consistency in the interpretation of License conditions. He emphasized that this compilation of important circulars will be very useful for the officers of the DoT field units for a uniform understanding of the procedural rules and will bring them and the service providers on the same page.

Shri Sinha further said that the DOT field units under DG Telecom are playing a vital role in planning, monitoring and implementation of DoT policies and projects across the country. He expressed the hope that the compendium will become an indispensable document for all the stake holders and practitioners in the field of Telecom.  

Shri Sinha informed that DoT has issued a number of guidelines in respect of License agreement, CAF verification, EMF related and other licensing related issues. As the arms of DoT have reached every state, there is a challenge of establishing co-ordination between the various units and verticals of DoT. A need of comprehensive compilation of the guidelines was felt to bridge the gap between various DoT units and also with the Telecom Service providers. He further added that this compendium will help in this co-ordination by enabling consistency in the interpretation of rules and circulars.  

On this occasion, Shri Sunil Kumar, DG (Telecom) said that the compendiums will be helpful not only for all the field officers posted under different verticals of the 22 LSAs. It will provide transparency in decision making by field units as well as other units of DoT. The various service providers governed by these circulars are also likely be benefitted. He further added that these compendiums not only will facilitate handy reference to guidelines and circulars issued by various units of DoT HQ but also it will act as a repository in understanding the mechanism being followed by DoT in dealing with field issues.

                Minister of State for Communications (Independent Charge) and Minister of State for Railways, Shri Manoj Sinha presided over the Inaugural Session of the one-day seminar on “FDI in Telecom Sector: The Way Ahead” at New Delhi today. The seminar was well attended by representatives from various Ministries/Departments, regulatory bodies, industry, academia etc. On the occasion, Shri Sinha also released a publication titled “Telecom Sector Growth & FDI: A Way Ahead”, which is a compilation put together by FIPP Wing of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) together with the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT). The compendium aims at providing relevant information relating to the FDI policy and the telecommunications sector in India at one place to facilitate the stakeholders.

 

The seminar included technical sessions and a panel discussion, which sensitized the various stakeholders of the Telecom sector, particularly those from the industry, on the various steps taken by the government to attract investment and ease the process of FDI approvals in the sector. Speakers for the seminar, coming from the government, academia, industry, legal firms, equity research firms etc., drew from their rich experiences in the diverse sectors & contributed immensely.

 

Addressing the participants in the inaugural session, Shri Sinha highlighted the fact that today India is the second largest telecommunications market in the world with around 1.18 billion customers. This transformation is moving India towards becoming a ‘knowledge society’ in the true sense, because growth of Internet data services and the widespread use of mobile phones have also changed the way in which public services like education, transportation and healthcare are being delivered. Telecom Sector is also playing an important role in agriculture, poverty eradication, disaster preparedness and financial inclusion. As we get the blue-print ready for transition to newer, emerging technologies like 5G, M2M, and AI etc, there would be need for investments. Therefore, in addition to domestic investments in the sector, FDI an important component of economic growth can play an important role in the sector as it has been doing. “It is a matter of pride for us that FDI in the telecom sector has grown nearly five times over the last three years – from $1.3 billion in 2015-16 to $ 6.2 billion in 2017-18 and we look forward to continuous inflow of FDI in the sector”, the Minister noted.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Ms. Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary (Telecom) emphasized the fact that foreign investment is necessary not only to supplement domestic capital but also to secure scientific, technical and industrial knowledge. 

 

Ms. Anuradha Mitra, Member (Finance), Telecom Commission, Department of Telecommunications reiterated that pursuant to the decision taken to abolish FIPB last year, Department of Telecommunications is the nodal department for clearing FDI proposals relating to the telecommunications sector. She also highlighted that necessary processes/systems have been put in place to undertake this work with responsiveness.

 

Dignitaries present on the occasion also included Shri N. Sivasailam, Special Secretary, DoT and Shri Atul Chaturvedi, Additional Secretary, Department of Investment Policy and Promotion.

                The ITU South Asia Area Office and Technology Innovation Centre will be established in New Delhi. This was announced by Mr. Houlin Zhao, Secretary General (SG) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), during the 4th BRICS Communications Ministers Meeting held in Durban, South Africa recently. ITU is a United Nations specialized agency for Information and Communication Technologies, with membership of 193 countries and nearly 800 private sector entities and academic institutions.

Commenting on this announcement, Minister of State for Communications (Independent Charge), Shri Manoj Sinha, who was present when the announcement was made, said –  “The establishment of this ITU local area office will be an important milestone for us, as it signifies global recognition of the progress we have made in the field of ICT. It also places on us the responsibility to work with our neighbouring countries to take the benefits of the rapid developments in this technology-driven industry to our people in the South Asia region.’

As a member of the ITU since 1869, India has traditionally played a harmonising role in the deliberations and exchanges of the body, always respecting the core principles of equality and consensus-building. The country has also been a regular member of the ITU Council since 1952. The ITU South Asia Office will serve nine countries – Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Iran, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, in addition to the host country – which together account for nearly 24% of the global population.

In this connection, Secretary (Telecom), Ms. Aruna Sundararajan added – “This local area office will play a key role in organising capacity and capability building programmes for the region, and in accelerating the structured implementation of ITU’s development programs with focus on Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Land-Locked Developed Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and other similarly placed nations in the region.

The ITU Local Area Office will also impart a significant boost to technological reach and benefits for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) which act as catalysts in the inclusive growth of a region’s economy and employment. “We are thankful to our neighbouring countries for supporting the establishment of this office in India, and look forward to further strengthening our partnership with them”, concluded Shri Sinha.

                The Department of Posts today clarified that it is mandatory to produce an Identity Proof acceptable for important transactions like booking an International Parcel or International EMS (Merchandise) for safety and security reasons. One of the accepted Identity Proof is Aadhaar, along with others like driving license, Passport, Voter ID etc which are also acceptable. Aadhaar, as per the prevailing norms in the country, is not a mandatory document to be produced at the time of booking. Moreover, all such documents are only required for office record and are NOT required to be pasted on the consignments.

The clarification comes in the wake of a news report published in The Times of India, Bengaluru edition dated 10.09.2018 with the heading “India Post asks for display of Aadhaar number on parcels”. The department said that it appears that the confusion was created by an erroneous message generated from the twitter account of the office of the Chief Postmaster General, Delhi Circle wherein it was mentioned that pasting of ID proof on consignments is in accordance with international guidelines.

 Instructions are being reiterated to the post offices to ensure smooth booking of articles taking the convenience and regulatory requirements into account together. The Department of Posts said that a copy of any ID proof including Aadhaar is required for booking of International Parcel and International EMS (Merchandise) for security purpose based on requests received from organizations like Narcotics Control Bureau and Wild Life Crime Control Bureau. India Post is committed to ensuring safety and security in its operations.

                Due to excess carryover stocks and indication of similar excess production in the ensuing sugar season 2018-19, the liquidity problem of the sugar mills is likely to persist in the coming sugar season too. As a result, cane price arrears of sugarcane farmers may also peak at unprecedented high level. 

In order to mitigate the situation, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved following measures involving total assistance of over Rs.  5500 crore to support the sugar sector by way of offsetting cost of cane and to facilitate export of sugar from the country thereby improving liquidity of the industry enabling them to clear cane price arrears of farmers:

Details:


	To provide assistance to sugar mills by defraying expenditure towards internal transport, freight, handling and other charges to facilitate export during the sugar season 2018-19 @ Rs. 1000/MT for the mills located within 100 kms from the ports, @ Rs. 2500/MT for the mills located beyond 100 kms from the port in the coastal states and @ Rs. 3000/MT for mills located in other than coastal states or actual expenditure, whichever is lower. The total expenditure on this account would be about Rs.1375 crore which will be borne by Government.


b)   In order to help sugar mills to clear cane dues of farmers, the Government has decided to provide financial assistance @ of Rs. 13.88 per quintal of cane crushed in sugar season 2018-19 to sugar mills to offset the cost of cane. The assistance shall be provided to only those mills which fulfil the conditions as stipulated by Department of Food & Public Distribution.  The total expenditure on this account would be about Rs.4163 crore which will be borne by Government.

c)   To ensure payment of sugarcane dues of farmers, both the assistance would be credited directly into the accounts of farmers on behalf of sugar mills against cane price dues payable to farmers against FRP including arrears relating to previous years and subsequent balance, if any, would be credited to mill’s account. Assistance shall be provided to those mills which will fulfil the eligibility conditions as decided by the Government.

Background: 

            Due to depressed market sentiments and crash in sugar prices, the liquidity position of sugar mills was adversely affected in the sugar season 2017-18 leading to accumulation of cane price dues of sugarcane farmers which reached  an alarming level of about Rs. 23,232 crores in the last week of May, 2018. 

          In order to stabilize sugar prices at reasonable level and to improve the liquidity position of the mills thereby enabling them to clear the cane price arrears of farmers, for the current sugar season 2017-18, Central Government took the following measures in past six months:

(i)    Increased custom duty on import of sugar from 50% to 100% to check any import in the country.

(ii)    Withdrew custom duty on export of sugar to encourage sugar industry to start exploring possibility of export of sugar. 

(iii)   Allocated mill-wise Minimum Indicative Export Quotas (MIEQ) of 20 LMT of sugar for export during Sugar Season 2017-18.

(iv)   Re-introduced Duty Free Import Authorization (DFIA) Scheme in respect of sugar to facilitate and incentivize export of surplus sugar by sugar mills.

(v)   Extended financial assistance to sugar mills @ Rs.5.50/qtl of cane crushed during 2017-18 Sugar Season to offset the cost of cane.

(vi)   Notified Sugar Price (Control) Order, 2018 directing that no producer of sugar shall sell white/refined sugar at factory gate at a rate below Rs. 29/kg; along with imposition of stock holding limits on mills.

(vii)  Created buffer stock of 30LMT of sugar w.e.f01.07.2018, to be maintained by sugar mills for one year for which Government will bear a carrying cost of about Rs. 1175 crore.

(viii) In order to augment ethanol production capacity and thereby also allow divergence of sugar for production of ethanol, approval has already been granted for extension of soft loan of Rs. 4440 crore through banks to the mills for setting up new distilleries/ expansion of existing distilleries and installation of incineration boilers or installation of any method as approved by Central Pollution Control Board for Zero Liquid Discharge for which Government will bear interest subvention of Rs. 1332 crore.

As a result of above measures, all India average ex mill prices of sugar increased from the range of Rs. 24-27/kg to Rs. 30-33/kg; and all India cane price arrears of farmers have also come down to Rs. 12988 crore from the peak arrears of about Rs. 23232 crore on State Advised Price (SAP) basis for sugar season 2017-18. On FRP basis, all India cane price arrears of farmers have come down to Rs. 5312 crore from the peak arrears of about Rs. 14538 crore.

                A High Level Committee on Corporate Social Responsibility – 2018 (HLC-2018) has been constituted under the Chairmanship of Shri. Injeti Srinivas, Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) to review the existing framework and guide and formulate the roadmap for a coherent policy on Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR).

The Committee is expected to review the existing CSR framework as per Act, Rules and Circulars issued from time to time and recommend guidelines for better enforcement of CSR provisions. It will analyze outcomes of CSR activities/programmes/projects and suggest measures for effective monitoring and evaluation of CSR by companies. Suggestions are also expected on innovative solutions, use of technology, platform to connect stakeholders, and social audit. 

The provisions of section 135 of Companies Act, 2013 (Act) pertaining to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) came into force on 01.04.2014 with a view to promoting responsible and sustainable business through inclusive growth. 

The four years of implementation have enabled compilation of data on the number of companies complying with CSR provisions, funds allocated and spent across various sectors, geographical spread of CSR spending, etc. Experience has also been gained on the quantum, outreach and impact of CSR (which is estimated to be around Rs. 38, 000 crore up to FY 2016-17) and immense feedback has been received on how CSR provisions can be leveraged to have larger and more impactful outcomes.

The existing provisions of in Companies Act, 2013 with respect to CSR fully empower the Board of a Company to decide on their CSR Policy, approve projects and oversee implementation. Many suggestions with respect to CSR such as local preference, earmarking CSR spend for backward areas, contribution to national/state funds, notifying priority areas, monitoring compliance, supplementing / complimenting government programmes, etc. have been received from various stakeholders. The Ministry had earlier set up a High Level Committee on CSR in 2015 which made several recommendations, including review of CSR framework after three years which is almost over. 

The composition of  High Level Committee  is as follows:

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has  given its approval for signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK).  It will help to establish mutual co-operation and collaboration in the areas of knowledge sharing through joint research, quality support, capability and capacity building, trainee accountant exchange programmes and conducting Continuous Professional Development (CPD) Courses, workshops and conferences.

 

Details:

 


	ICAI and ICPAK will provide opportunities to key members of the reciprocal body's staff to learn from their knowledge and experience through informal work placements to be agreed through a work schedule.


 


	Jointly promote activities to raise awareness and the overall visibility of the ICAI/ ICPAK strategic partnership and the collaboration outlined in this MoU with members.


 


	ICAI and ICPAK will collaborate on benchmarking initiatives and trainee accountant exchange programmes.


 

Major impact:

 

India is Kenya's sixth largest trading partner and the largest exporter to Kenya.  As per a report on African counties.  The Kenyan economy is expected to be amongst the top performers in Africa in 2017 in terms of growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  Kenya has a largely diversified economic base and aims to seek increased access to the Indian market for Kenyan goods, while India is interested in exploring ways to become Kenya's top foreign trading partner.

 

Considering that Kenya's economy is one of the top amongst the African countries and the kind of investments and trusts entrusted by the two counties in the recent past, India's Chartered Accountants have already been playing a significant role in the economic growth of the country; there is a lot of scope for professional opportunities for Indian Chartered Accountants in Kenya.

                Shri Injeti Srinivas Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and Chairman Investor Education Protection Fund (IEPF) Authority, unveiled the new logo of IEPF Authority here today and said that it is essential to use technology to provide time bound services. Technology overcomes the limitation of space, time and resources. We need a technology driven enforcement mechanism without exception.

The IEPF logo symbolises the values and mandate of the Authority i.e. Promoting Investor’s Awareness, Education and Protection. The logo pictorially depicts: People in the middle symbolises Investors, Outer Hands symbolises protection to investors, Pen Nib symbolises Education of Investors and Rupee symbol denotes Investments.

In another big leap towards promoting investor education and protection, IEPF Authority also signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the CSC E-Governance Services India Limited. The MoU formalises the mutual interaction and strengthens the existing relationship between the IEPF Authority and the CSC e-Governance Services at the strategic and working level. The objective of the MoU is to effectively implement the mandate of the Authority of educating and protecting investors.

Highlighting the need to synchronise the working of IEPF Authority with MCA, Shri Srinivas said that this whole transaction is part of the Companies Act 2013 and it will develop as part of MCA21, which is a robust platform created by Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

	Elimination of risks associated with physical certificates such as loss, theft, mutilation, fraud etc. 
	Improving the corporate governance system by increasing transparency and preventing mal-practices such as benami shareholding, back dated issuance of shares, etc. 
	Exemption from payment of stamp duty on transfer. 
	Ease in transfer, pledge etc. of securities.


 

Unlisted Public Companies are expected to facilitate the dematerialisation of their securities in coordination with Depositories and Share Transfer Agents. Any grievances arising out of such Dematerialization of securities will be handled by the IEPF Authority. The measure is expected to significantly enhance the Corporate Governance standards in the country.

                The Archaeological Survey of India (Delhi Circle) of Ministry of Culture has discovered a hoard of 254 Copper Coins in the premises of Khirki Mosque during the course of conservation of the monument. This mosque lies on the southern periphery of the village Khirki. The mosque was built by Khan-i-Jahan Junan Shah, the Prime Minister of Firoz Shah Tughluq (1351-88), and is believed to be one of the seven mosques built by him. 

 

Archaeological Survey of India had taken up the task of cleaning of the area to initiate conservation of Khirki Mosque and during the cleaning, a hoard of 254 Coins of medieval period were found near entrance of the monument. Immediately, a team of archaeologist, consternation assistant and photographers rushed to the site and took the hoard of coins under their possession.  Few coins got cleaned by the experts of Science of Branch of Archaeological Survey of India and on the basis of preliminary observation, it can be said that some of the coins belong to the reign of Shershah Suri and his successors. 

 

It is pertinent to mention that in the year 2003 a hoard of 63 Coins was found from the same premises during cleaning and conservation. Delhi Circle has started scientific clearance of the area under technical supervision of archaeologists. After cleaning of the coins process to decipher the same will be initiated with the help of experts. 

 

Built with rubble stone, and thickly plastered, the Khirki Mosque is double-storeyed,  The lower storey consisting only of a series of basement cells. Battered bastions occupy its four corners, imparting it the look of a fortified building. Gateways project from its three sides, except on the west, each flanked by tapering minarets, the main entrance being from the east. Corresponding with the openings of cells on the lower storey, the upper storey contains perforated windows (khirkis), which have given it its present name. The pillared courtyard is divided into twenty- five squares, five on each side, each square consisting of nine smaller squares. Among the larger squares, three on each side, two on the corners and one in the middle, together with the square in the centre of the courtyard, are each covered with a cluster of nine small low domes of Tughluq pattern. Among the remaining squares, four on the diagonals are left uncovered to admit light, while the others are covered with flat roofs. This ingenious way of covering the courtyard is repeated only in one other mosque erected by the same builder. These two are the only examples of closed mosques in northern India.

                Exercise Yudh Abhyas, a joint Indo-US Military exercise which witnessed participation of an Infantry Battalion of Indian Army and the 1st Battalion 23 Infantry Regiment of US Army concluded at Chaubatia, Uttarakhand on 29 Sep 2018.

The exercise was the 14th in the Yudh Abhyas series, which started in 2004 under US Army Pacific Partnership Programme. Exercise Yudh Abhyas strengthens and broadens interoperability and cooperation between the Indian and US armies. It is the fourth Indian US Army exercise at Chaubattia and complements number of other exchanges and exercise between the forces. Over the years the two countries have decided to progressively increase the scope and content of the combined exercise and Exercise Yudh Abhyas 2018 has witnessed a Division Headquarter  based command post exercise and one Infantry Battalion each carrying out field training exercise under a joint Brigade Headquarters and discussions on issues of mutual interest by experts of both countries. The exercise provided an ideal platform for the personnel of the two countries to share their experiences on counter terrorist operations, especially in mountainous terrain.

The commanders and staff officers of both sides were exercised to work in close coordination to receive and collate intelligence and to issue suitable operational orders to the combined field training components, who executed these orders on ground in simulated realistic situation. 

The training culminated in a 48 hours consolidation and validation exercise in which troops carried out a daring rescue and destroy mission in the general area of Pilkholi near Chaubattia. The final exercise was reviewed by senior officers from both sides.

Besides training, both the contingents also participated in a number of extracurricular activities including friendly football and basketball matches and a cultural programme during the 'Barakhana' on the final day. A magnificent parade and the customary exchange of mementoes marked the successful completion of Indo-US combined Army Exercise.

The combined exercise was undoubtedly, an unprecedented success. Besides promoting understanding and interoperability between the two armies, it further helped in strengthening ties between India and US.

He congratulated the girl cadets and their support staff for successful ascent to the peak on 19 September 2018. The Team Leader Lt Col Gulshan Chadha and Deputy Leader Maj Swati Basedia handed over the Expedition Flag to the DG during the ceremony.

This all girls expedition was the first expedition to climb the peak in the current year. The inclement weather hidden crevasses, steep gradients and glaciated approach had made the climb challenging and tough. 

In his address, the DG NCC congratulated the Cadets for their grit and perseverance. He said that their adventurous sojourn has set an example for others to emulate.

                Astra, the indigenously developed Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile (BVRAAM), was successfully test fired by the Indian Air Force from Su-30 aircraft, today from Air Force Station, Kalaikunda. The missile successfully engaged a manoeuvring target with high precision meeting the mission objectives. In the series of trials held to date, Astra has been launched in the complete Su-30 flight envelope. The flight test assumes significance as it was part of the series of final pre-induction trials. Astra is the best in class weapon system and has undergone more than twenty developmental trials.

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman lauded the efforts of Indian Air Force, DRDO and associated team members involved in the mission and said India has attained a high level of capability in the indigenous design and development of advanced weapon systems.

                 A contract was signed by the Indian Navy with M/s Hindustan Shipyard Limited, Vishakhapatnam, on 20 Sep 18 for construction of two Diving Support Vessels (DSV) to augment the Indian Navy’s submarine support operations on either coast. 

           

The first vessel to be built over a 36 month period would be followed by the second, six months later. The vessels to be based at Vishakhapatnam and Mumbai respectively, would be of 118 m in length and of approximately 7,650 T displacement.

 

In addition to operating submarines to secure our waters, the Indian Navy undertakes diving operations in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This necessitates extensive diving operations to facilitate various activities such as submarine rescue, under water inspection, testing or salvage, and recovery of objects/ship aircraft lost at sea. As these activities involve diving operations with divers remaining underwater for prolonged durations, it requires a suitable platform for their launch and recovery, as well as for carriage of related tools and equipment. The DSV is also equipped with a Deep Submergence Rescue Vessel (DSRV), which significantly enhances its Submarine Rescue Capabilities. Contract for procurement of two sets of non-tethered DSRV, capable of effecting submarine rescue upto depths of 650 meters has been concluded with M/s James Fisher Defence, UK in Mar 16. The first DSRV was delivered at Mumbai in Apr 18 and the second DSRV slated for Vishakhapatnam is expected by end Dec 18. 

 

While a submarine is a significant strategic asset, it is also vulnerable to action damage, requiring extensive diving for undertaking Search and Rescue (SAR) operations that demand the availability of a credible and suitably equipped platform. Induction of DSVs equipped with DSRV, would go a long way in enhancing the Indian Navy’s capability and reach of submarine rescue operations in the IOR.

                Early snowfall in higher reaches, cloud burst and heavy rain devastated large parts of Himachal Pradesh from22 to 24 Sep 2018. Kullu district and Lahaul-Spiti were worst affected.  Also due to heavy snowfall on Rohtang Pass, Lahaul and Spiti Valley have been cut off, which affected large number of tourist who have gone to Leh and Lahaul Valley in Himachal Pradesh. They have been stranded at number of isolated locations.

Border Roads Organisation (BRO) on war footing started clearing various axes. Today from Project Rohtang Tunnel, team under Maj Shashi Chauhan and CaptAashishSinglaalongwith machinery were deployed to clear road axis upto Shishu and Koksar in Lahaul Valley to supplement efforts of 70 RCC of 38 BRTF .  By evening approx. 300 people from Shishu and Koksarhave been rescued out from Lahaul Valley to Solang in Manali through Rohtang Tunnel. The rescued people include faculty and students from IITMandi, IITsRoorkee, Guwahati and Mumbai and some foreigners on trekking besides locals from Himachal Pradesh.

BRO also provided medical aid and refreshment to rescued people at Project Rohtang Tunnel.  Co-ordination has been done with civil administration to safely take the rescued individuals to Manali and further to their destination.

Rohtang Tunnel which is under construction by BRO contributed immensely to evacuate and rescue stranded persons from Lahaul Valley to Manali.

Rescue efforts will continue for next few days until all stranded persons are evacuated and safely taken out from Lahaul & Spiti Valley.

                Raksha Mantri chaired the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC),which met here today.

In furtherance of efforts to reduce timelines in defence procurements and streamline Defence Procurement Procedures, the DAC discussed and approved several amendment to DPP-16, the manual governing the defence procurements. The significant changes inter-alia include limiting the time period for executing Repeat Order to five years after date of completion of warranty of final delivery in the previous contract. Repeat Order provisions have also been extended to procurements by other services like the Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) andBorder Roads Organisation (BRO). The amendments also include permissions to commence with benchmarking of cost for equipment immediately on receipt of the trial report in the Service headquarter, legislating provisions for Exchange Rate Variations when pursuing procurement with an ‘Option Clause’, providing clarity on guidelines for easing the provisions for imposition of LD Clause in upgradation/ alteration cases, automatic incorporation of applicability of the latest legislation or changes or amendment of any act or law, rules or regulations.The  DAC also accorded approval for doing away with Bank Guarantee for Essential Parameters ‘B’ if the same are trial evaluated during the field evaluations trials. Direction were also given to include the names of Independent Monitors (IMs) in the RFP for Defence Capital Acquisitions.

These measures will go a long way in obviating under procedural delays and will hasten activities besides shrinking the procurement timelines giving due preference to indigenization.

The DAC also accorded approval for procurement of 1000 engines of 1000 BHP for fitment in T-72 tanks of the Army under ‘Buy & Make’ category and at an approximate cost of over Rs 2300 crore. Post transfer of technology most of these engines will be manufactured by Ordnance Factories Board (OFB). The engines will enhance mobility, agility and acceleration of T-72 tanks making them more versatile and effective in the battlefield.

                Indian Armed Forces have always brought laurels to the Nation. Their contribution in war and peace are of immense value to every Indian.

 

It is the contribution of our Armed Forces that we proudly celebrate Vijay Diwas, Kargil Vijay Diwas Day and many such battle honour days.

 

Indian Army conducted surgical strikes in 2016 which had strategic ramifications and were aimed to dissuade inimical adversary from adopting the path of violence and to ensure an environment of peace for the Nation.

 

To showcase the courage, valour and sacrifice of Armed Forces, ‘Parakram Parv’ is being observed from 28-30 September 2018. The main event is planned in India Gate Lawns, Rajpath, New Delhi.

The programme will start with bugle call at 1830 hrs, thereafter, movies and photographs depicting valour & courage of the Armed Forces will be shown.

                            A message about a Personal Rescue Beacon being activated close to Pingdong La was received at the Regional Coordination Centre for rescue. The signal was coded for two German nationals trekking from Ringdum to Dibling. This message was relayed immediately to Western Air Command and the Siachen Pioneers Helicopter unit based at Leh was tasked to investigate. Since it was evening and weather in the region did not permit a launch, it was decided to get airborne at day break.

            Michael and his wife Annettee were trekking when they were caught in a blizzard. For two days incessant snowfall prevented any movement and by then the couples’ supplies had run out. Michael decided to activate his Personal Rescue beacon as a last resort.

            Two helicopters piloted by Wg Cdr Dey and Wg Cdr Pradhan of the Siachen pioneers got airborne at 0600 hrs today and headed in the probable direction of the PRB. On initial approach they could not find anything. “We went back to where the footprints had started and worked our way backwards. A little ahead we found a grey protrusion which initially looked like a rock face, but on closer inspection found the edges to be flapping due to wind. Soon Michael came out of the tent, which we thought was a rock and waved to us” said Wg Cdr Dey, the mission leader and commanding officer of the unit.

            “The site was on an incline of 35-45 degrees and we could not land the heptr. I held on a low hover and my co-pilot jumped out to ascertain that these were the people we were looking for and their medical condition. Both were able to move about, though the gentleman had developed Frost Bite. I picked up the lady and asked Wg Cdr Dey to come down and pick up the gentleman in a similar manner. Both on board we flew back safely to Leh” said Wg Cdr Pradhan the captain of the second heptr.

            The rescued couple have been transferred to a medical facility at Leh and are recuperating well.

                Raksha Mantri Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, while inaugurating the 37th Coast Guard Commanders’ Conference here, lauded the exemplary efficiency of the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and foresightedness of its leadership for scientific and meticulously planned development of the organisation to meet the emergent challenges.

Raksha Mantri added that admirable capabilities and relentless surveillance efforts of ICG in the vast and expansive maritime zones of India are unmatched in the Indo-Pacific region, and regularly the focus of discussion and appreciation in all international forums.

Smt. Sitharaman also appreciated the exemplary leadership and stellar role of ICG in protecting the citizens in times of adversity particularly post cyclone Ockhi as well as for the overwhelming response during Kerala floods. The RM called upon top Commanders of ICG to deliberate and discuss ways and means to engage fishing communities to adopt technology driven instruments for further enhancing safety and security at sea.

While complimenting consistent efforts of ICG in filling up the gaps in surveillance through CSN Phase-I, Smt. Sitharaman assured staunch commitment of Ministry of Defence (MoD) for completion of Phase-II in a time bound manner.

Director General Coast Guard, Director General Rajendra Singh, thanked the RM and the MoD for the unbounded support towards transforming the ICG capacity and capability and reassured that regardless of any challenge, the ICG remains ever diligent in performing its noble duty of saving life and property in distress at sea and protecting the marine environment and leaving no stone unturned in protecting security interests in the maritime zones of India.

                Golden Globe Race # GGR 2018 Commander Abhilash Tomy of the Indian Navy, representing India in the Golden Globe Race 2018(GGR) on an indigenously built sailing vessel ‘Thuriya’ was dismasted and suffered a back injury on 21 Sep 18. On 24 Sep 18, at about 1130 hrs Indian Time, French Fishing Vessel (FV) Osiris reached in vicinity of ‘Thuriya’ and carried out a successful rescue operation. Indian Navy’s P8I aircraft was also maintaining in the area providing close support and monitoring the rescue operations. Cdr Abhilash Tomy was rescued by a boat and rescue team from FV Osiris. The rescue team shifted Cdr Abhilash in a stretcher from ‘Thuriya’ to Osiris using their Gemini boat. Cdr Abhilash has been reported to be conscious and has been provided with initial medical care. He is presently safe onboard Osiris. Osiris is proceeding to rescue the second sailor from his damaged boat Hanley. Thereafter, Osiris will be moving to take shelter at Ile Amsterdam/ Ile S. Paul about 100 nautical miles north of the rescue position. Indian Naval Ship Satpura is closing the islands to take Cdr Abhilash onboard and bring him back to India safely.  

            The Indian Navy is truly indebted to all the agencies involved in this rescue operation, especially Royal Australian Navy and FV Osiris for their timely and proactive help.

                At around 1430 hrs, on 23 Sep 18, a request was received at Airforce Station Sarsawa from the State Govt of Himachal, for the rescue of personnel struck due to incessant rains at Kullu. Beas river had swelled and as a result of which small islets were formed in the river wherein people were stranded.

            One MLH class of helicopter was launched from the Mighty Armour unit of Western Air Command, based at Sarsawa. The helicopter was piloted by Squadron Leader Vipul Gupta with Sqn Ldr Dhiman as the co-pilot. The helicopter reached the spot and found 19 people stranded on an islet on the swelling Beas river. The pilot brought the helicopter to a low hover and the crew helped the stranded people into the aircraft. They were then flown to the local airfield of Bhuntar.

            On 24 Sep 18 two youth were spotted on another small strip of land in the river. The helicopter, which was available at Bhuntar was launched and these two person were winched up since there was no place for the heptr to land.

            The helicopter and its crew have been instructed to wait at Bhuntar airstrip should any other rescue is required.

            “Today restricted space, high winds speed, High tension cables and tall trees precluded the chance of landing hence we had to winch the two people. All rescued were reported to be safe and fine. We are on standby for any further requirements” said Squadron Leader Vipul Gupta.

                Raksha Mantri Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman concluded a two-day official bilateral visit to Egypt (20-22 September 2018), at the invitation of the Minister of Defence and Military Production & Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Arab Republic of Egypt.

Raksha Mantri and her counterpart, General Mohamed Ahmed Zaki Mohamed, Minister of Defence and Military Production & Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, noted with satisfaction the steadily growing bilateral defence ties between the two nations. They reviewed ongoing bilateral cooperation activities and discussed potential opportunities to further deepen ties and exchanges in the defence sphere.

 

The Ministers decided to explore deeper cooperation in the fields of defence industry and R&D, including joint production of defence equipment. Both sides reaffirmed their intent to enhance cooperation in counter-terrorism. Naval cooperation, including cooperation in Maritime Domain Awareness, was identified as an area of potential. India and Egypt would also intensify training interactions between their militaries. The two countries are also working towards holding joint exercises. The two Ministers agreed that technical and expert level delegations in relevant fields would be exchanged to follow up on their discussions.

Smt Sitharaman invited General Mohamed Ahmed Zaki Mohamed to visit India. The invitation was accepted with pleasure.

Raksha Mantri, who was accorded a ceremonial Guard of Honour, also laid wreaths at the memorials of the Unknown Soldier and the tomb of late President Anwar Al Sadat.

Raksha Mantri's visit to Cairo was reflective of the vision to build a New Partnership for a New Era between India and Egypt as articulated by Prime Minister Modi and President Sisi during the Egyptian President's State Visit to India in 2016.

          Indian Army and Kazakhstan Army today completed the third edition of their joint military Exercise KAZIND 2018 in Otar Military area, Kazakhstan in a significant step towards fostering military and diplomatic ties between the two countries. The two week long exercise had commenced on 10 Sep 2018.  

          The primary focus of the exercise was to train and equip the contingents to undertake joint counter insurgency and counter terrorist operations in urban and rural environment under mandate of United Nations. The participants initially familiarised with each other’s organizational structure, tactical drills and planning process before graduating to joint tactical exercises.  The contingents honed their tactical and technical skills in a wide spectrum of counter insurgency operations including joint training on weapons and equipment, cross training exercises, field training exercises and handling of improvised explosive devices.  Both sides jointly planned and executed a series of well-developed tactical operations based on scenarios that are likely to be encountered in rural and urban environment.  Commanders at various levels from both sides were exercised to work in close coordination to receive and collate information, jointly plan operations and issue suitable order to respective components. Subject experts from both the contingents also held in-depth discussions on various facets of counter insurgency and counter terrorist operations.

          The exercise provided an ideal platform for both contingents to share their operational experience and expertise while also being instrumental in broadening the interoperability and cooperation between the armies of India and Kazakhstan.  Future editions of Exercise KAZIND are likely to witness a progressive increase in the scope and content of combined training. The joint exercise will surely foster the spirit of friendship and enhance the strategic military relationship between India and Kazakhstan to higher levels.

                Unnecessary controversies are being sought to be created following media reports regarding a statement purportedly made by the former French President, Francois Hollande, concerning the selection of Reliance Defence as the Offset partner by Dassault, the manufacturers of Rafale aircraft.

The reported statement perhaps needs to be seen in its full context – where the French media has raised issues of conflict of interest involving persons close to the former President.  His subsequent statements are also relevant in this regard.

The Government has stated earlier and again reiterates that it had no role in the selection of Reliance Defence as the Offset partner.

For a rounded appreciation of this matter, it may be worthwhile to briefly dwell upon why and how Offset Policy came into play.  The Offset Policy was formally announced for the first time in 2005 and has been revised several times.  To leverage its huge arm-imports in order to develop a strong indigenous industry, a flow-back arrangement is made in the defence contracts, which is widely known as offsets, and constitutes a certain percentage of the contract value.  The key objectives of the Defence Offset Policy is to leverage the capital acquisitions to develop Indian defence industry by fostering development of internationally competitive enterprises; augmenting capacity for research and development in defence sector and to encourage development of synergistic sector like civil aerospace and internal security.  The offset can be discharged by many means such as direct purchase of eligible products/services, FDI in joint ventures and investment towards equipment and transfer of technology.  As per Defence Offset Guidelines, the foreign Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is free to select any Indian company as its offset partner.

It has been reported that a JV between Reliance Defence and Dassault Aviation came into being in February, 2017.  This is a purely commercial arrangement between two private companies.  Incidentally, media reports of February, 2012 suggest that Dassault Aviation, within two weeks of being declared the lowest bidder for procurement of 126 aircraft by the previous Government, had entered into a pact for partnership with Reliance Industries in Defence sector.

Dassault Aviation has issued a Press Release stating that it has signed partnership agreement with several companies and is negotiating with hundred odd other companies.  As per the guidelines, the vendor is to provide the details of the offset partners either at the time of seeking offset credit or one year prior to discharge of offset obligation, which in this case will be due from 2020.

In view of above, it is once again reiterated that the Government of India has no role in the selection of Indian Offset partner which is a commercial decision of the OEM..

The tactical drills showcased during the Validation Exercise included Hostage Rescue by insertion of troops from helicopters, Room Intervention as well as House Clearing Drill as part of Cordon and Search Operations, Raid on a Terrorist Hideout and neutralization of Improvised Explosive Devices(IED). The entire exercise was monitored and controlled through the Joint Command Post established with representatives of the participating contingents. The Exercise demonstrated the commitment and capabilities of the participating BIMSTEC National armies in working closely with each other to eradicate the menace of terrorism existing in different forms.

The Validation Exercise was followed by an equipment display organised under the aegis of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) at Aundh Military Station. Dr Subash Bhambre alongwith the Service Chiefs and other senior army officers witnessed more than 250 indigenously developed defence related equipment. Almost 20 different agencies dealing with defence equipment participated in the display including Ordnance Factories, Defence and Research Development Organisation (DRDO), leading private sector companies, startups etc to showcase some of the latest weapon systems and vehicles produced indigenously. Hon’ble Raksha Rajya Mantri alongwith General Bipin Rawat and General Secretary of BIMSTEC also interacted with the media before the Closing Ceremony. 

During the Closing Ceremony, Dr Subhash Bhambre reviewed an impressive parade of the participating nations at the drill square of Aundh Military Station in the presence of dignitaries from the BIMSTEC Nations. The parade was commanded by Captain Gaurav Sharma, who is a member of the participating Indian Contingent. The Raksha Rajya Mantri addressed the contingents and dignitaries and congratulated the participating nations for an Impressive parade. He also complimented the troops for the professionalism shown by them during the Exercise. He said that “The MILEX-18 Exercise has provided us all an opportunity to discuss the issue of Countering Terrorism from the military point of view with an endeavour to create synergy, better understanding and evolving of an institutionalized mechanism for regional cooperation in the field of Counter Terrorist Operations. This Exercise and Army Chief’s Conclave held yesterday will further augment the relations between all BIMSTEC nations”.

The exercise has been a grand success and has taught valuable lessons to the troops of the Bay of Bengal region in countering terrorism.  The camaraderie and friendship developed between the contingents during the course of the exercise will assist in enhancing interoperability between the armies which may be called upon to collectively fight this growing menace of terrorism in the region.

                Barbara de Rham and Antoine, her husband, were on a holiday, trekking the hills of Ladakh in the Zanskar valley. Barbara developed acute symptoms of “altitude sickness” which required the immediate evacuation to a place with better medical facilities. The Embassy of Switzerland at Delhi requested for her evacuation to Leh at the earliest. 

The Siachen Pioneers helicopter unit of Western Air Command were tasked with the mission, since this unit, not only was the closest but,also had pilots who are experienced in flying the treacherous Zanskar valley. The valley is known for its extremely turbulent weather, especially in the afternoons and is devoid of any suitable forced landing fields.The unit immediately launched two Cheetah helicopters at 1515 hrs. Two choppers were necessary due to the inhospitable terrain and the poor weather conditions in the general area of operations. Squadron Leader SangramPatil led the mission and safely evacuated the lady and her husband to Leh Airforce station at 1615 hrs from where she was taken to the civil hospital.

“The lady displayed acute symptoms of dehydration when I checked her on landing. This could be a case of acute mountain sickness and it was best that she was evacuated to a better medical facility” said the seniormedical officer of Airforce Station Leh, SqnLdr K Anurag, who attended to the patient on landing.

                As part of the ongoing Indo-US defence cooperation, a joint military training Exercise Yudh Abhyas 2018 is scheduled to be conducted in the foothills of Himalayas at Chaubattia in Uttarakhand from 16 September to 29 September 2018.  This will be the 14th edition of the joint military exercise hosted alternately by both countries. 

 

          The joint exercise Yudh Abhyas 2018 will simulate a scenario where both nations will work together in counter insurgency and counter terrorism environment in mountainous terrain under United Nation charter. The two week exercise will witness participation of about 350 personnel of the US Army and similar strength of the Indian Army. The exercise curriculum is progressively planned where the participants are initially made to get familiar with each other’s organizational structure, weapons, equipment, confidence training and tactical drills. Subsequently, the training advances to joint tactical exercises wherein the battle drills of both the armies are coherently unleashed. The training will culminate with a final validation exercise in which troops of both countries will jointly carry out an operation against terrorists in a fictitious but realistic setting. 

 

          Over the years the two countries have decided to progressively increase the scope and content of this joint exercise. Exercise Yudh Abhyas 2018 will witness a Division Headquarter based Command Post Exercise, an Infantry Battalion carrying out Field Training Exercise and discussions on issues of mutual interest by experts of both countries.

 

        Both armies have vast experience in active counter insurgency & counter terrorism operations and sharing each other’s tactics & drills in such diverse environment is of immense value. The exercise is a great step for the armies of the two democratic countries to train together and gain together from each other’s rich operational experiences. The latest exercise will help further build interoperability between the forces of both the nations.

                Three young sailors of the Indian Navy, Akash ME I, Dhananjay, SEA I, and Vishwakarma ME I, were instrumental in rescuing a man who had fallen into the sea off Marine Drive on the night of 09 September. 

The sailors were visiting Marine Drive when they noticed people gathering at a spot nearby. On reaching the spot, they observed a man drowning about 150 m into the sea. The man's hands were seen flailing as he struggled to stay afloat. 

Akash, a Ship's Diver, Dhananjay, a good swimmer, and Vishwakarma, a Marine Commando, immediately jumped into the water and swam out towards the drowning man. They brought the man to safety and administered CPR since the man had, by then, become unconscious. Once the man began breathing and regained consciousness, the sailors handed the man over to the local police. Their selfless and prompt act of bravery is in keeping with the finest traditions of the Indian Navy.

                The Annual General Body Meeting of the Indian Polo Association (IPA) was held under the Chairmanship of General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Army Staff who is also the President of the Indian Polo Association at Manekshaw Centre, Delhi Cantonment on 09 Sep 2018. It covered all the key facets required for major improvement of polo in the country. 

        The meeting had representation from polo fraternity which included all the officials, zonal stewards, professionals & amateur players, serving officers of all three Defence Services, Para Military Forces and patrons of the game.

        It was decided that the Jaipur Polo ground in Delhi would be renovated to bring it at par with International standards. Jaipur polo ground hosts most of the Polo Matches with foreign teams & players. The improvement of the ground would ensure better performance with lesser injury to both horses and players.

        Issue of player and horse safety was also discussed at length with serious concerns for evolving modus operandi for the safety of equines and players.

      Argentina Polo Association has agreed to collaborate to improve polo in the country. As per the understanding, player exchange programmes, bilateral tournaments and training of young & budding polo players in Argentina has been agreed upon. IPA has already sent four young players to Argentina for training.

        IPA also recognised Manipur as the origin of modern Polo and it included Manipur Polo as an important entity in its ambit, which would help promoting the Manipur polo at international level.

                In a significant achievement and a major step towards Final Operational Clearance (FOC) of LCA Tejas, the mid-air refuelling of ‘wet contact’ trial for LCA Tejas MK-1 was successfully carried out today from an Indian Air Force base. The trial was a part of the Air-to-Air refuelling flight tests conducted by IAF. 

Before this ‘wet contact’ trial, the ‘dry contact trials’ were successfully conducted on September 04 & 06, 2018 where the Drogue (basket) extended from the IAF tanker aircraft by a fuel hose, was tracked and plugged into using the aircraft refuelling probe without taking fuel. IAF provided all required support to DRDO including the tanker aircraft for the successful test flight.

The Air-to-Air refuelling capability for LCA is a ‘force multiplier’ for the IAF, giving the aircraft the potential to stay airborne for much longer periods of time. 

The enhanced range and endurance in air is expected to provide IAF a host of options in exploiting the operational potential of the LCA as well as to participate in international exercises without having to stage through several locations enroute. 

Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman has complimented DRDO-ADA, IAF, HAL and other agencies involved in the mission.

                Hazik Mushtaq Beigh and his friends were trekking in the Kolahai Glacier area when the team fell in a crevasse; two of the team were fatally injured. Hazik suffered injuries which required his immediate evacuation to a medical facility.

Western Air Command of Indian Airforce launched two Cheetah helicopters, of the Udhampur based Hovering Hawks unit who happened to be at Srinagar at that point. Two choppers were necessary due to the inhospitable terrain and the poor weather conditions in the general area of operations. The leader of Falcon formation was Wg Cdr Vishal Mehta with Flt Lt Mittal as the co-pilot. The plan was to winch the casualty into the heptr as no suitable landing site was available.

 Upon reaching the site Wg Cdr Mehta realised that Hazik could not be winched  due to his serious injuries, so both heptrs flew to Awantipur and removed the side doors, picked up a guide enroute from Lidru and reached the spot once again. The weather during the entire period was marginal.The elevation of the place is 12000ft which added to the piloting difficulties of the small heptr. The captain of the lead aircraft Mehta decided to find a small spot of flat land nearby and touchdown. 

 Having picked up Hazik both heptrs flew back to base. “The spot was such it did not offer any place to land, we had established that winching the casualty was out of question, hence only one option was left. I told my wingman to orbit overhead while I tried to land on a small flat land. The landing called upon my entire experience and training as a helicopter pilot. It was immensely satisfying when Hazik was saved” said the mission leader and captain of the lead aircraft Wg Cdr Vishal Mehta.

                Indian Naval Ships Kirch, Sumitra and Cora Divh entered Trincomalee, Sri Lanka to participate in the sixth edition of SLINEX 2018, a bi-lateral Naval Exercise between India and Sri Lanka, from 07 to 13 September 2018. The inaugural ceremony of the exercise held onboard SLNS Sayurala was attended by Rear Adm Dinesh Kumar Tripathi, Flag  Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet (FOCEF) of Indian Navy and Rear Adm SA Weerasinghe, Commander Eastern Naval Area (COMEAST) and Rear Adm Ananda Kumar Guruge, Flag Officer Commanding Naval Fleet (FOCNF) of the Sri Lankan Navy. 

 

In addition to three IN Ships, one ship-borne integral helicopter and two Maritime Patrol Aircraft Dornier are participating from Indian side while Sri Lankan Naval is represented by SLN Ships Sayurala, Samudra and Suranimala.  The exercise is being conducted in two phases, with the harbour phase from 07 to 10 September 18 at Trincomalee during which, the participants will engage in professional, sporting and social interactions. The Harbour Phase will be followed by the Sea Phase from 11 Sep to 13 Sep 18 in the Bay of Bengal off Trincomalle and will include gun firings, communication procedures, seamanship as well as navigation evolutions and helicopter operations. 


SLINEX series of bilateral maritime exercises were initiated in 2005 and since then five successful engagements have been conducted. SLINEX over the years has helped both the Navies in understanding each other's procedures and enhanced interoperability. This edition of the exercise will further strength ties between the two maritime neighbours and contribute towards maritime security in the region.

                Minister of External Affairs Smt Sushma Swaraj and Minister of Defence Smt Nirmala Sitharaman welcomed Secretary of State Mr. Michael R. Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mr. James N. Mattis, here today  for the inaugural India-U.S. Ministerial 2+2 Dialogue. They welcomed the launch of the 2+2 Dialogue as a reflection of the shared commitment by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and President Mr. Donald Trump to provide a positive, forward-looking vision for the India-U.S. strategic partnership and to promote synergy in their diplomatic and security efforts. They resolved to continue meetings in this format on an annual basis. 

Celebrating over 70 years of diplomatic cooperation, the Ministers reaffirmed their view that India and the United States, as sovereign democracies founded on the values of freedom, justice and commitment to the rule of law, must continue to lead global efforts to promote peace, prosperity and security. 

Recognizing their two countries are strategic partners, major and independent stakeholders in world affairs, the Ministers committed to work together on regional and global issues, including in bilateral, trilateral and quadrilateral formats. The two sides further decided to establish secure communication between the Minister of External Affairs of India and the U.S. Secretary of State and between the Minister of Defence of India and the U.S. Secretary of Defense, to help maintain regular high-level communication on emerging developments. 

 

Strengthening the Defense and Security Partnership

The Ministers reaffirmed the strategic importance of India’s designation as a Major Defense Partner (MDP) of the United States and committed to expand the scope of India’s MDP status and take mutually agreed upon steps to strengthen defense ties further and promote better defense and security coordination and cooperation. They noted the rapid growth in bilateral defense trade and the qualitative improvement in levels of technology and equipment offered by the United States to India in recent years. They welcomed the inclusion of India by the United States among the top tier of countries entitled to license-free exports, re-exports and transfers under License Exception Strategic Trade Authorization (STA-1) and also committed to explore other means to support further expansion in two-way trade in defense items and defense manufacturing supply chain linkages. They welcomed the signing of a Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) that will facilitate access to advanced defense systems and enable India to optimally utilize its existing U.S.-origin platforms. The Ministers also announced their readiness to begin negotiations on an Industrial Security Annex (ISA) that would support closer defense industry cooperation and collaboration. 

 

Recognizing their rapidly growing military-to-military ties, the two sides committed to the creation of a new, tri-services exercise and to further increase personnel exchanges between the two militaries and defense organizations. The Ministers reviewed the recent growth of bilateral engagements in support of maritime security and maritime domain awareness and committed to expand cooperation. Toward that end, the Ministers committed to start exchanges between the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) and the Indian Navy, underscoring the importance of deepening their maritime cooperation in the western Indian Ocean. 

Acknowledging the unique role of technology in the India-U.S. defense partnership, the Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to continue to encourage and prioritize co-production and co-development projects through the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) and to pursue other avenues of defense innovation cooperation. In this regard, they welcomed the conclusion of a Memorandum of Intent between the U.S. Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Indian Defence Innovation Organization – Innovation for Defence Excellence (DIO-iDEX). 

Welcoming the expansion of bilateral counter-terrorism cooperation, the Ministers announced their intent to increase information-sharing efforts on known or suspected terrorists and to implement UN Security Council Resolution 2396 on returning foreign terrorist fighters. They committed to enhance their ongoing cooperation in multilateral fora such as the UN and FATF. They reaffirmed their support for a UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that will advance and strengthen the framework for global cooperation and reinforce the message that no cause or grievance justifies terrorism. The Ministers denounced any use of terrorist proxies in the region and in this context, they called on Pakistan to ensure that the territory under its control is not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries. On the eve of the 10-year anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai attack, they called on Pakistan to bring to justice expeditiously the perpetrators of the Mumbai, Pathankot, Uri and other cross-border terrorist attacks. The Ministers welcomed the launch of a bilateral dialogue on designation of terrorists in 2017, which is strengthening cooperation and action against terrorist groups, including Al-Qaida, ISIS, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hizb-ul Mujahideen, the Haqqani Network, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, D-Company, and their affiliates. The two sides further reaffirmed their commitment to ongoing and future cooperation to ensure a stable cyberspace environment and to prevent cyber-attacks. 

Partners in the Indo-Pacific and Beyond

The Ministers reviewed cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, noting that the common principles for the region articulated in the India-U.S. Joint Statement of June 2017 have been further amplified by President Mr. Donald Trump at Danang, Vietnam on November 10, 2017 and Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in Singapore at the Shangri-La Dialogue on June 1, 2018. Both sides committed to work together and in concert with other partners toward advancing a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, based on recognition of ASEAN centrality and on respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, rule of law, good governance, free and fair trade, and freedom of navigation and overflight. Noting the importance of infrastructure and connectivity for the Indo-Pacific region, both sides emphasized the need to work collectively with other partner countries to support transparent, responsible and sustainable debt financing practices in infrastructure development. 

 

The Ministers reaffirmed their shared commitment to a united, sovereign, democratic, inclusive, stable, prosperous, and peaceful Afghanistan. The two sides expressed support for an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation process. The United States acknowledged India’s longstanding and ongoing contributions of economic assistance to Afghanistan and also welcomed India’s enhanced role in Afghanistan’s development and stabilization. 

India welcomed the recent U.S.-North Korea summit. The two sides pledged to work together to counter North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction programs and to hold accountable those countries that have supported them. 

The United States welcomed India’s accession to the Australia Group, the Wassenaar Arrangement, and the Missile Technology Control Regime and reiterated its full support for India’s immediate accession to the Nuclear Suppliers Group. 

Promoting Prosperity and People-to-People Ties

The Ministers recognized the importance and the potential for increasing bilateral trade, investment, innovation and job creation in both countries. Both sides committed to further expanding and balancing the trade and economic partnership consistent with their leaders’ 2017 joint statement, including by facilitating trade, improving market access, and addressing issues of interest to both sides. In this regard, both sides welcomed the ongoing exchanges between the Ministry of Commerce of India and the Office of the United States Trade Representative and hoped for mutually acceptable outcomes. 

Both sides looked forward to full implementation of the civil nuclear energy partnership and collaboration between Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and Westinghouse Electric Company for the establishment of six nuclear power plants in India. 

Observing the strong ties of family, education and business and the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation that unite their people, the Ministers highlighted the unmatched people-to-people ties between their countries and recognized the benefits to both nations and the world from these ties, including the free flow of ideas and collaboration in health, space, oceans and other areas of science and technology. 

The next 2+2 meeting is to be held in the United States in 2019.

                We have just concluded a most productive, positive and purposeful meeting.

I wish to thank Secretaries Mattis and Pompeo for their vision and commitment. We deeply value their support for stronger ties between India and the United States.

Our discussions today were marked by the deep friendship that characterises relations between the greatest democracies of the world.

The commitment of India and the United States to defend our shared democratic values and expand on our common interests is clear and unwavering.

In today's meeting, we reaffirmed our intention to cooperate in every way possible to ensure peace and stability as well as to realise the aspirations of our peoples for continued economic growth, prosperity and development. We will also work together to combat the persisting threat of terrorism and other shared security challenges.

In our discussions, we explored the instrumentalities necessary to deliver on those shared objectives.

Defence cooperation has emerged as the most significant dimension of our strategic partnership and as a key driver of our overall bilateral relationship.

The momentum in our defence partnership has imbued a tremendous positive energy that has elevated India-US relations to unprecedented heights. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi had succinctly stated at his address to the US Congress a year ago, India's relations with the US have overcome the hesitations of history. Nowhere is this more true than in the field of defence.

Today, India's defence forces carry out extensive training and joint exercises with the United States. Our joint exercises have acquired greater complexity and newer dimensions, both bilaterally and in wider formats. To enhance our synergies in this area, we have decided to carry out, for the first time, a tri-Services joint exercise with the United States off the eastern coast of India in 2019.

We are also putting in place an enabling framework for closer cooperation between our defence forces. The signing of the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 and the Helicopter Operations from Ships Other Than Aircraft Carriers (HOSTAC) earlier this year were important steps in this direction. The signing of the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) today will enable India to access advanced technologies from the US and enhance India's defence preparedness.

Maritime Security has been a focus area of our cooperation. To deepen our ties in this area, we will expand our interactions on Maritime Domain Awareness.

The United States has renamed its Pacific Command responsible for relations with India as Indo-Pacific Command. Reflecting our wider global partnership, we will also enhance our interactions with the United States military's Central Command.

One of the focus areas of the discussions was on expanding the scope and content of the US' designation of India as its Major Defence Partner. We welcome the recent decision to elevate India to STA Tier 1 status for access to advanced technologies, especially in the defence field. I am confident that this and other measures to follow will enable our defence industry cooperation to make speedy progress for mutual benefit.

We highlighted the major reforms being implemented by the government to promote defence manufacturing in India under the Make in India initiative, including setting up of defence manufacturing corridors. We welcome the US' positive response to India's request to nominate a Point of Contact in the US Department of Defense to help address procedural complexities and facilitate Indian companies to join the manufacturing supply chains of US defence companies.

We also identified cooperation in defence innovation as a major area of emphasis for the future. As our defenceneeds become increasingly driven by technology, this is both necessary and timely. I am particularly thankful to have Secretary Mattis, who has spent several years in Silicon Valley, as our interlocutor in taking this aspect of our ties forward. The Memorandum of Intent between our defence innovation agencies is a first step in this direction.

The conclusion of the first ever Ministerial 2+2 between India and the United States is a concrete manifestation of the vision of our leaders, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump, to take the India-US relationship to a new level.

Our leaders recognise that it is no longer viable to address foreign and defence issues in a compartmentalised manner. In today's meeting, we were able to discuss a range of issues relating to our ties in a strategic framework and identify steps to take forward our relationship.

Our discussions have paved the way for a new era in India-US defence and strategic engagement. Given our shared interests, we are confident that we can work together to promote peace, economic prosperity and security in our region and beyond. I once again thank Secretaries Pompeo and Mattis for their engagement in promoting the India-US partnership.

                On 04 Sep 18, the Indian Air Force successfully carried out the first ever mid air refueling of the indigenously build fighter aircraft Tejas MK 1 with an IL-78 MKI tanker of the 78 Sqn. The tanker was launched from its base in Agra while the fighter was launched from Gwalior. The specially modified Tejas aircraft carried out a series of  test  profiles including a ‘Dry Contact' with the tanker. A second Tejas aircraft flying in formation was used to observe the exercise closely.

All flight parameters of Tejas aircraft were transmitted live to a ground control unit set-up at Gwalior airbase, wherein ADA scientists constantly monitored the technical parameters of the mission. The Tejas aircraft was piloted by test pilot Gp Capt Joshi and the IL-78 MKI was flown by Gp Capt R Arvind, Commanding Officer of the tanker squadron. Prior to the test flight, extensive ground trials were conducted in all possible conditions under the supervision of ADA scientists.

The success of these trials is a major leap for the indigenous fighter, thus enhancing its mission capability by increasing its range and payload. The ability to carry out Air-to-Air Refueling is one of the critical requirements for the LCA to achieve 'Final Operational Clearance'.

                Indian Air Force (IAF) recently participated in Exercise Pitch Black 2018 at Darwin, Australia.  Sixteen different nations from across the globe, including French Air Force (FAF) participated in this exercise.  On the return leg, Rafale fighter aircraft and transport aircraft of FAF staged through Air Force Station, Gwalior and Air Force Station, Agra from 01 – 04 Sep 18. 

During the staging period, FAF and IAF carried out basic joint training, which included fighter sorties by pilots in their respective aircraft with observers onboard each other’s transport aircraft supporting the missions.  This interaction with FAF provided a unique opportunity for exchange of experience and sharing of best practices during cooperative deployment.

                Indo-Kazakhstan Joint Army Exercise 'KAZIND' will be conducted between the Indian and Kazakhstan Army from 10 to 23 Sep 2018 in Otar region, Kazakhstan. This is the third joint military exercise between the two countries which have a history of extensive cooperation in the defence arena. The second edition of the exercise was held in India last year.

The aim of the exercise is to build and promote bilateral Army to Army relations and exchange skills and experiences between Kazakhstan Army and the Indian Army. The exercise will also serve as a platform for exchange of drills and procedures.
  The fourteen days exercise with the Kazakhstan Army will follow a graduated continuum from orientation to a full scale mock exercise; the aim being to achieve optimum integration among the two contingents through enhanced mutual comprehension of each other’s tactics, techniques and procedures. The vast experience and expertise of Indian troops in counter insurgency operations holds special importance to the Kazakhstan Army. The conduct of the joint exercise will set the stage for greater defence cooperation and consequently will manifest in stronger ties between the two great nations.

                The Ambassador of Japan to India, Mr. Kenji Hiramatsu called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh here today. The two dignitaries discussed cooperation in various sectors in India’s North-Eastern Region (NER) including infrastructure and bamboo research.

Dr. Jitendra Singh noted with satisfaction that Japan has provided loan assistance of about Rs. 10,000 crore for various ongoing projects during the last over four years. Mr. Kenji said the NER projects account for approximately 10% of all ongoing projects supported by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in India.

The Japanese Ambassador gave a detailed presentation about the nine ongoing developmental projects in the NER supported by the JICA such as the Water Supply and Sewerage project in Guwahati and a number of projects under three Phases of the North East Connectivity project.  He said the JICA is also supporting three new projects in the NER including the Umian Umtru Hydro Power Stage-3rd project in Meghalaya. 

Mr. Kenji sought the Minister’s intervention in timely implementation and constant review of the NER projects funded by JICA and Japan’s Official Development Assistance (ODA). Dr. Jitendra Singh said the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has laid stress on rapid development of the NER and this week he inaugurated India’s 100th airport in the North-Eastern state of Sikkim. Dr. Jitendra Singh assured he would pursue with the Ministry of Home Affairs to ensure security for projects delayed due to insurgency problems.

                The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Sikkim's first-ever airport tomorrow i.e. Monday, 24th September, 2018.

 

Speaking to media persons soon after his arrival in Gangtok today on the eve of Prime Minister's visit, the Union Minister for Development of Northeastern Region (DoNER), Dr Jitendra Singh said that it is a historic occasion for the entire Northeast and, in fact, for the entire country to celebrate. It has been over 40 years since Sikkim became a part of India, but now tomorrow the Prime Minister will inaugurate the airport in this hill State and bring it on the air-map of the world, he said.

 

Elaborating further, Dr Jitendra Singh informed that the airport is located at Pakyong, around 60 kms from the Indo-China border, which also makes it strategically relevant from the security point of view. The Indian Air Force (IAF) will also find this airport convenient for the landing and taking off of its aircrafts, he said.

 

From the tourist point of view, Dr Jitendra Singh said, this is a major booster because Sikkim has been one of the favorite destinations for tourists, almost all throughout the year. With the new airport becoming functional, he said, the travelling time will be get cut down by almost 5 hours because, earlier, the nearest airport to which the tourists could fly down was Bagdogra in West Bengal.

 

Built at an estimated cost of over Rs. 605 crore, the Pakyong airport is a new distinction for the State of Sikkim which has, in the last three to four years, achieved the distinction of becoming the first ""Organic State"" of India and also the first ""Open Defecation Free"" (ODF) State of India.

During the meeting, Shri Along discussed various issues related to setting up of new educational projects in Nagaland and related to the technical and medical educational facilities. The Nagaland Minsiter said that the state wants to promote higher education avenues for youth and wants to become a hub for educational facilities.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that development of North Eastern region is on the priority of the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He said that the Prime Minister has made several visits to North Eastern states, which shows the importance that Government accords to the peripheral states. He added that he will take up the issues raised by the Nagaland Minister with the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) and Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER).

Shri Singh said that education plays an important role in the development of youth of the country. He added that educational facilities have played an important role in the peripheral states such as North East and Jammu & Kashmir (J&K). The migration of youth from the North East in search of job opportunities has come down in the recent past, he added. He also mentioned about the ‘Kashmir Super 30’ initiative of Indian Army, through which the students from weaker sections of society in J&K have made to the prestigious IITs and NITs. The energies of youth need to be channelized in right direction and education is an important tool of it, specially in the insurgency and conflict-hit areas, he added. The Minister said that accreditation conditions for educational institutes in North Eastern states should be made as per the peculiar topographic conditions there.

The DoNER Minister informed that an exclusive ‘NITI Forum for North-East’ has been set up by the Government recently which has been tasked to identify various constraints on the way of accelerated, inclusive and sustainable economic growth in the North East Region of the country and to recommend suitable interventions for addressing identified constraints. The first meeting of the NITI Forum was held on 10th April, he added. The Minister said that Government is committed to the development of North East and will assist the states in every possible manner.

                On the second day of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, 116 foreign delegates including sanitation ministers visited select sites related to the life and work of Mahatma Gandhi on the “Gandhi Trail”. The delegation was led by the Minister of State for Drinking Water and Sanitation, Shri Ramesh Jigajinagi.  The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention is a four-day convention organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, and includes more than 160 international representatives from 68 countries. It was inaugurated by the Hon’ble President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, yesterday in New Delhi.

The delegation first visited Punsari village, an example of the success of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). For the 5,100 residents, each home has a functional toilet with a water facility. Since it was declared open defecation free, not a single child has dropped out of school. The delegation showed keen interest in the twin pit toilet technology used in India, which is a low-cost, eco-friendly and easy to use toilet technology, suitable for large parts of rural India.

The visitors viewed the local health facility and took note that the infant and maternal mortality rates are zero. They also visited the school, anganwadi and interacted with villagers about the toilets they had built in their homes. They also undertook tree plantation, visited a micro compost pit and drainage as part of SLWM work in the village and said that they were inspired to see such high quality service delivery and behaviour change on the ground.

Later, the delegation visited Dandi Kutir at the Mahatma Mandir complex and paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi at the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad. They also attended a lunch hosted by the Governor of Gujarat, Shri Om Prakash Kohli.

Speaking about the visit, Ms. Siriwan Chandanachulaka, delegate from Thailand, noted that it was evident that the national- and state level political investment in health and sanitation was paying off. “It is clear that the achievement is the result of hard work, community participation, and strong leadership. Everybody looks happy and healthy”, she said. Mr. Amidou Sani, delegate from Togo, said that he was sending observations and findings in real time directly to 400 colleagues back home from his experience of Gujarat.

 

The MGISC culminates on 2nd October with the launch of Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth year celebrations, also marking the beginning of the final year of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) or Clean India Mission. The 2nd October session will be presided over by the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi.

India is close to becoming open defecation free. The rural sanitation coverage of India has increased significantly, from 39% in October 2014 to 94.44% as of 30 September 2018. Nearly 86.5 million household toilets have been constructed under the Mission. 25 States/Union Territories, 509 districts, and 500,000 villages have declared themselves free from open defecation. The number of people practicing open defecation in rural India has gone down from 550 million in 2014, to less than 150 million till date.

                The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention began today with more than 160 international representatives from 68 countries amongst the 350 attendees. Fifty-three Ministers of sanitation are among those in attendance, all of whom aim to learn from India’s Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), or “Clean India“ programme, and share their own sanitation and hygiene experiences from home.

Shri Ram Nath Kovind, President of India, noted in an inaugural speech that “an open defecation free India is the best 150th birthday gift we could give Mahatma Gandhi”. Mr. Arun Jaitley, the Indian Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, said that the SBM had benefited not only from political leadership, but also people’s participation from all sections of society including eminent personalities from various disciplines and, most importantly, ordinary citizens. “All of this occurred at an appropriate time of great economic growth in India and benefited from a bottom-up approach that broke a larger problem into smaller parts that were easier to solve”, he said. Mr. Kevin Rudd, Former Prime Minister of Australia, and Chair, Sanitation and Water for All, said, “Other things are important, but sanitation is essential. The glasses of Gandhi are the gaze of the ages looking down at us.”

A recurring theme through the day was how the SBM has transformed from a government programme to a true peoples’ movement. “Everybody in this country contributed [to the Swachh Bharat Mission]; that is why a miracle has happened”, said Sushree Uma Bharti, Minister of Drinking Water and Sanitation, India. “[Swachh Bharat] is no longer a project of the government; it has become a project of the people”, said Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister (I/C) Housing and Urban Affairs, India. Mr. Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, India, noted how Gandhi’s vision of an open defecation free India “is now being translated into reality, under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi.” Mr. D.S. Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, observed that the Convention would allow for sharing of experiences that would benefit India as well as visiting countries. 

In the plenary on behavior change at scale, Mr. Iyer noted that India has transformed from the largest contributor of open defecation to the largest behavior change movement. Ms. Jennifer Sara, Director of the Global Water Practice at the World Bank, indicated that targeted messaging was critical for behaviour change programmes to work. Mr. Roland Ravatomanga, Minister of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, Madagascar, spoke of studying and applying social norm theory and social transformation in sanitation programmes. And Prof Valerie Curtis, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said passion, emotion, reward and incentivization are all pillars for sustained behaviour change.

 

Following the opening plenaries, a series of parallel technical sessions examined key sanitation-related topics, including strategic partnerships (moderated by Ms. Naina Lal Kidwai, Chair, India Sanitation Coalition), urban sanitation and fecal sludge management (moderated by Mr. Brian Arbogast, Director of WASH, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), gender and inclusivity (moderated by Ms. Yasmin Ali Haque, Representative, UNICEF India), sustainability of ODF communities (moderated by Mr. Arun Baroka, Joint Secretary, MDWS), sanitation as everyone’ business (moderated by Mr. Akshay Rout, Director General, MDWS), and technology and innovation (moderated by Dr. R. A. Mashelkar, Chairman, High Level Technical Committee, MDWS). The sessions also included addresses by visiting Ministers from Bangladesh, Senegal, Ghana, and Indonesia, as well as eminent speakers such as Mr. Ashwani Lohani (Chairman Railway Board, India), Mr. R Venkataraman (Managing Trustee, Tata Trusts), Swami Chidanand Saraswati (Global Interfaith WASH Alliance), Mr. Bindeshwar Pathak (Founder, Sulabh International) and Prof Robert Chambers (IDS, University of Sussex), among others.

The MGISC, hosted by the Government of India, culminates on 2nd October with the launch of Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth year celebrations, also marking the beginning of the final year of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) or Clean India Mission. The 2nd October session will be presided over by the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi.

Dignitaries confirmed to attend the latter portion of this historical global sanitation convention include the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr António Guterres, and the Executive Director of UNICEF, Ms Henrietta Fore. 

Tomorrow, ministers will go on an inspirational ‘Gandhi Trail’ field visit to Gujarat. Another upcoming highlight of the event will be the Ministerial Dialogues, which will include discussions on topics such as adequate financing for sanitation, working at scale for universal access, country-specific sanitation challenges and the at-scale solutions found. 

India is close to becoming open defecation free. The rural sanitation coverage of India has increased significantly, from 39% in October 2014 to 94.35% as of 29 September 2018. Nearly 86.5 million household toilets have been constructed under the Mission. 24 States/Union Territories, 503 districts, and close to 500,000 villages have declared themselves free from open defecation. The number of people practicing open defecation in rural India has gone down from 550 million in 2014, to less than 150 million today.

                Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation will organize a global sanitation convention to mark the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi, also coinciding with the fourth anniversary of the launch of Swachh Bharat Mission.

Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC) will be a 4-day international conference that will bring together Sanitation Minsters and other leaders in WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) from around the world. A host of national and international dignitaries are slated to attend the event, for which preparations are under way. The Convention will culminate on 2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti, which is also celebrated as the Swachh Bharat Diwas. Several mass mobilisation events and campaigns are being planned across the States in the run up to this Day.

India aims to eliminate open defecation by October 2nd, 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, who held sanitation very close to his heart. Rural sanitation coverage has made ground-breaking progress, from 39% in October 2014, at the start of SBM, to over 92% today, with behaviour change being the key focus of implementation. The success of the Swachh Bharat Mission will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the global achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 6.2), i.e. to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all. Simultaneously, coordinated efforts are in place to improve sanitation levels in all sectors and all public places. The global Convention will be aimed at sharing sanitation success stories and lessons across all participating countries.

                The Union Minister for HRD Shri Prakash Javadekar has inaugurated a network of more than 3,400 Test Practice Centres (TPCs) spread across the 622 Districts in the country. 25 Test Practice Centres (TPCs) joined Minister of HRD through Google Hangouts in this inauguration at New Delhi  today. These test centres have been set up to facilitate students appearing in entrance examinations for Higher Education to hold practice sessions to enable them to get used to the changed mode and pattern of examination.

While interacting with Test Practice Centres (TPCs), the Union Minister said that the government is committed to provide quality education with equity, therefore we are launching Test Practice Centres across the countryfor those students who do not have computers and smart phones. Now no student will suffer due to lack of resources, the Minister added.

He further said that the government has changed the pattern of JEE (Mains) and UGC NET Examination from this year. Now it has become computer based instead of Pen and Paper mode. The new exam pattern is more Transparent, leak proof, scientific, student friendly and fast. In order to provide facility for practice for the changed pattern, National Testing Agency (NTA) has established Test Practice Centres across the country.NTA has also launched a practice App through which students can practice on their own on their computers or on smartphones.This is the real revolution in the field of competitive examinations, the Minister explained.

While interacting with students, HRD Minister informed students that now students can access IIT PAL(Professor Assisted Learning) video lecture on SWAYAM Platform for the preparation of JEE. The HRD Minister received overwhelmed response from all 25Test Practice Centres. Students from various centres appreciated and thanked the government for this particular initiative. Secretary, Higher Education Shri R. Subrahmanyam and DG, NTA Shri Vineet Joshi were also present during the video conference.

In order to bring efficiency, transparency and qualitative difference in competitive examination process for Higher Education, MHRD has set up ‘National Testing Agency’ (NTA), (www.nta.ac.in) a premier testing organization, to conduct entrance Tests for higher educational Institutions. The NTA has been mandated to conduct JEE (Main), NEET (UG),UGC-NET, CMAT and GPAT examinations. 

NTA has established, a network of ‘Test Practice Centres’ (TPCs)across the country in about 622 Districts in 33 States/UTs, so that students of rural areas and others, get an opportunity to practice the Computer Based Test (CBT)before the exam. The TPCs will provide Mock Tests to the candidates of JEE (Main) and UGC-NETexaminations.

The TPCs are made operational based on the student demand. A trial run, of Mock Tests, was conducted on the 8th& 9th September 2018, wherein 2,452 candidates practiced at 96 TPCs across the country and the candidates were provided instantaneous assessment & feedback on the Mock Test.

                Union Minister for HRD ShriPrakashJavadekar Inaugurates 4th World Summit on Accreditation (WOSA-2018) at New Delhi today. Speaking on this occasion the Minister said that ‘Ratings and Rankings’ both the quality hallmark for any educational institutions therefore accreditation becomes very important.

He further said that we need to cover each and every institution under accreditation but right now the number of accredited institutions is very less. He said that that it may be for two reasons first some institutions do not want to come under accreditation and second we have some restriction in our own accreditation mechanism therefore government wants to increase the strength of NBA and NAAC so that more number of institutions can be accredited. 

The Minister said that ranking and rating increase competitiveness among institutions for better performance. He gave the example of National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) and said that because of NIRF every institute has constituted an internal committee to improve the ranking. Students also see institutions ranking before taking admission, he added.

The Union Minister said that this government is very passionate about education therefore we havestarted learning outcomes in school education and in higher education students are now empowered with technology. He further said that our government wants to boost quality education in the country therefore every year we are closing some non-performing institutions. Our message to institutions is very clear perform or perish, he added. 

While suggesting to NBA regarding boost of quality and accreditation, the Minister said that if we change in norms and regulations in accreditation process we must give adequate time to the institutions for preparation.

The Minister said that we are promoting expansion and autonomy of the institutions and benchmark for the same is quality. He said that we have declared Institutes of Eminencewhich are completely autonomous. Beside this we have given graded autonomy to some higher educational institutions on the basis of NAAC and NBA rating. 

Secretary Higher Education Shri R. Subrahmanyam said that the biggest challenge before us isonly 15% institutions come under accreditation and 85% institutions are still not coming for accreditation. We need to review our accreditation system and need to change accordingly.  

Dr Anil Sahsrabudhe, chairman AICTE and Dr Surendra Prasad, chairman NBA were also present during the event. 

Background

      The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) is an autonomous organisation under Ministry of Human Resource Development engaged in quality assurance of the programs offered by the professional and technical institutions in India through accreditation. NBA has been accorded Permanent Signatory Status of Washington Accord since June, 2014.  It has adopted internationally implemented outcome based assessment and accreditation, to ensure that the graduates of the NBA accredited programs are globally competent and relevant.

      World Summit on Accreditation (WOSA) is a biennial Summit organised by NBA, which provides platform to stakeholders to share their knowledge and information on accreditation. NBA has already organised three Summits in 2012, 2014 and 2016 with the themes “Achieving Excellence through Accreditation”, “International Recognition of Education Qualifications” and “Quality Assurance through Outcome Based Accreditation” respectively. All these Summits were well attended (WOSA 2012 was attended by 800 participants, WOSA 2014 was attended by 850 participants and WOSA 2016 was attended by 800 participants). The deliberations were appreciated by academia, industry and policy – makers.

WOSA 2018

Continuing this tradition, NBA is organising WOSA 2018 from 07th to 09th September, 2018 at Hotel Ashok, Chanakyapuri, New Delhi. The focus of WOSA 2018 is on “CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN OUTCOME BASED ACCREDITATION”.

  Papers have been invited on the following sub-Themes:-

 


	Sub-Theme 1  –   Achieving Excellence through Learning Outcomes.
	Sub-Theme 2  –   Role of Industry in Technical Education.

havea Role in Quality Improvement?


	Sub-Theme 4 – Linking Government Funding with Quality.
	Sub-Theme 5 – Use of ICT in Accreditation in Large Jurisdictions.


 

The Summit will facilitate exchange of information on various challenges being faced during the transition between input-output based accreditation to outcome based accreditation. The discussion and global participation in WOSA 2018 will bring about new ideas and help in establishing new trends of identifying opportunities and challenges in professional and technical education world-wide. Many eminent Academicians/Industry Professionals/Policy Makers/Representatives of Washington Accord Signatories/leaders from accrediting agencies from India/abroad will participate and deliver plenary/key note addresses.

Expected Outcomes

WOSA 2018 is an opportunity for academia and the industry to explore avenues for future partnerships and to create an environment for open dialogue to facilitate mobility of students and professionals world-wide to gain international experience. The participants will gain a greater understanding of prevailing global accreditation practices.

The educational institutions will have an opportunity to interact with industry, policy makers and accreditation agencies from the globe and learn about their perspectives. It will also be a unique chance for the educational institutions to develop and fortify ties with the industry.

Industry would be able to interact with educational institutions and accrediting agencies for exchanging views on their requirements of quality manpower and accreditation parameters.

Accreditation agencies from across the world will have a common platform to share best practices, insights and to enhance their understanding of accreditation. The policy makers and regulatory bodies will have an in-depth appreciation of education systems operating in different countries and their strengths and weaknesses.

Background

International Literacy Day (ILD) is celebrated on 8th September every year all over the world. The celebration of ILD started following a recommendation of the World Conference of Ministers of Education on the Eradication of Illiteracy which met in Tehran in September 1965. The Conference recommended that 8th September, the date of the inauguration of the Conference, be proclaimed International Literacy Day and be observed world-wide. UNESCO in 14th Session of its General Conference held in Paris in November 1966, formally proclaimed 8th September as International Literacy Day. Since then, UNESCO has celebrated International Literacy Day with the aim to sensitize and mobilize international public opinion and to elicit their interest and active support for literacy activities – one of UNESCO’s major pre-occupations. 

In India, literacy and particularly Adult literacy has been a national priority since independence. With a view to eradicate illiteracy and impart functional literacy and lifelong education to adult education, National Literacy Mission was launched by Government of India in 1988. Since then, India has been celebrating International Literacy Day on 8th September to reaffirm its national commitment to achieve goal and objectives of literacy and express solidarity with international community in its efforts to eradicate illiteracy.

                The Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Dr. Satya Pal Singh lead a high level delegation to the G-20 Education Ministers’ Meeting as well as Joint Ministerial Meeting held at Mendoza, Argentina on 5th & 6th September, 2018. It was the first ever meeting of Education Ministers in the history of G-20. 

While speaking on the inaugural day in Educational Ministerial meeting, Dr Satya Pal Singh, appreciated and thanked Argentina for hosting an exclusive meeting of Education Ministers for first time in the history of G20 Summit. He said that Education should be the first and foremost priority area for any society to develop and for any country to flourish.  Therefore, it is most appropriate to place education at the center of global agenda.

Dr Singh said that India has been cradle of civilization and culture since ancient time. In modern time, India without forgetting its ancient wisdom has been making rapid strides in the field of education. He said that Prime Minister Modi has given immense importance to the education and therefore, India, under his initiative, has devised the strategy for its development which has core components of Accessibility, Equity, Quality, Affordability, Accountability, and Employability. He said that education should be ‘Child Centric’ and it should develop students holistically to make them a good human being first and global citizen later. To translate above philosophy in action, India is designing a new education policy. 

He mentioned that India is one of the largest education systems in the world with over 1.53 million schools, 864 Universities and enrolment of about 300 million students. Despite hosting such a large education system, India still needs further expansion to improve accessibility. Dr Singh said in last 4 years enormous work has been done to achieve the same. He highlighted the several digital initiatives of Modi Government which include India’s own MOOCs platform SWAYAM, which has been facilitating and encouraging a large number of students to learn anytime, anywhere. He said a special emphasis has been laid for teachers training by setting up National Resource Centres in 75 specific disciplines for delivering online refresher courses for 1.3 million faculty in higher education institutions. 

Dr Singh apprised the gathering about the various initiatives of Innovation Index ranking of higher educational institutions, Smart India Hackathon in both software and hardware to find solutions for the problems faced by the Government, Industry and Academia by young undergraduate students, Atal Tinkering Labs in schools and Research Parks in higher education institutions to promote the design thinking and innovation, and joint research projects with international collaboration. 

He said that we believe that education system should not only provide education but should also address the needs of the community directly. To achieve this, Government in India has launched ‘Unnat Bharat Abhiyaan’ under which higher education Institutions adopt nearby villages and help them by proving technological solutions to their problems. 

Dr Singh said that India is a major economy in the World and we fully understand and realize our roles and responsibilities for furthering the cause of education and evolution of human being. He assured India’s full support to the agenda of G20 Education Ministers meeting. 

 

With active help of India, G20 Education Ministers’ Declaration 2018 was finalized. [Copy attached]

On the second day, Dr Satya Pal Singh addressed the Joint Ministerial Meeting which comprised the Education Ministers and Labor & Employment Ministers of member countries. He said that India enjoys demographic dividend as 52% of its population is below 25 years of age. While it is a unique advantage, it also poses a challenge to utilize them productively towards the development and progress of the country. Realizing this, the Prime Minister of India has launched ‘Skill India mission’ in 2015 with a view to skilling 400 million youth by 2022. Vocationalization of the education has been undertaken at a large scale. He apprised that National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) has been laid down under which learner can acquire the certification for competency needed at any level through formal, non-formal or informal learning, leading to Certificate, Diploma, Advanced Diploma, Degree and further advanced studies and research.

 

Dr Singh said that G20 is the most appropriate forum for the creation of a collaborative framework where transnational skilling standards are shared with countries. 

 

He ended his address with once again thanking Argentinian Government and G20 Group for affording him an opportunity to showcase India’s achievements, concerns and future plans. At the end of the meeting, G20 Joint Education & Labour and Employment Ministers’ Declaration 2018 Mendoza Joint Meeting was released.

 

During G20 Summit of Education Ministers, Dr Satya Pal Singh successfully held bilateral talks with education minister of 9 countries, which included Mr. Lorenzo Fioramonti of Italy, MrYoshimasaHasami of Japan, Prof Thomas Rachel of Germany, Dr DU Zhanyuan of China, Mr Pavel Zenkovich of Russia, Mr Theodore Agnew of UK, Ms Betsy Davos of USA, Mr Ahmed Al Issa of Saudi Arabia, Ms Tina Beaudry Mellor of Canada, and also Senior Director of the World Bank, MrJaime Saavedra. 

 

He showcased the progress made by India in the field of education. He said that while India has a lot to offer, it also desires to learn from other countries to take its education sector to greater height. Dr Singh apprised them about recently launched initiatives of India for international collaboration. He elucidated salient features of Study in India, GIAN (Global Initiatives for Academic Initiatives) and SPARC (Scheme for Promotion of Academic & Research Collaboration). Education Ministers showed keen interests in all these schemes and assured India full cooperation. Italy, China, Japan, and USA also agreed to have an MoU with India. It was decided that further talks may be held to work out more details to develop roadmap for further collaboration. Dr Satya Pal Singh assured them that India will provide all support in their endeavor for bilateral collaboration.

 

The two meetings included Ministers of Education and Ministers for Labour and Employment from member countries as well as representatives of International Organizations like the World Bank, UNESCO.

                The Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Govt. of India, Shri Upendra Kushwaha felicitated 37 teachers and Principals from CBSE affiliated schools in the capital today for their contribution to the field of education and innovations in classroom teaching for the year 2017-18.

In a significant departure from the earlier practice which was manual, CBSE for the first time had invited online applications from the Principals and Teachers for CBSE awards 2017-2018.

The Board had formed a National Level Screening Committee instead of Regional committees constituted earlier. This committee selected awardees on the basis of:


	
	
		General Criteria for all categories of awards, such as Academic Qualifications, Scholarly Contributions, Functional Research, Curriculum, Community and Student Development achievements, awards and honours.
		Specific criteria like effectiveness as a teacher, remedial teaching, contribution of the teacher thereof and,
		Face to face interaction.
	
	


Besides the Principals the awardees include Primary, Secondary and Sr. Secondary Teachers. For the first time awards have also been earmarked for Performing Arts, Special Educators, School Counselors, Vocational, Physical Education & IT Teachers.

The felicitation ceremony was held in the gracious presence of Smt. Rina Ray, Secretary (School Education and Literacy), Smt. Anita Karwal, Chairperson CBSE, Sh. Anurag Tripathi Secretary, CBSE and several other distinguished dignitaries from the MHRD, NVS, KVS and schools. 

The Minister congratulated all the awardees and other teachers across the nation. The role of teacher is unparalleled because “A teacher affects till eternity and you can never tell where the influence stops”. Teachers as role models have long lasting impressions on the students. Therefore there is a need to humanise education by instilling values. The minister said that the teachers must be competent to face the challenges of the system and know how to implement good practices and educate since teachers are the nation builders.

Smt. Rina Ray, Secretary (School Education and Literacy) in her praise to all the awardees said that one of the goals of education is to prepare confident students for future and transform them into socially responsible, virtuous and innovative thinkers while education should be accessible, equitable and should promote excellence. The role of a teacher is to prepare students by emphasizing on competencies instead of rote learning. She exhorted teachers to take the country forward by encouraging creativity, inquisitive behaviour in class rooms and bring radical changes in education.

The Chairperson CBSE Smt. Anita Karwal congratulated all the recipients and said that the world is indebted to teachers for they build the nations, global societies and shape the lives of numerous students through teaching and guiding. Teachers are the real strength and pride of our nation said Smt. Karwal. She emphasized on Physical and Health Education, Skill Education, Mandatory Teacher Training for five days in a year and use of innovation and ICT.

                Union HRD Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar released the curriculum on Experiential Learning – Gandhijis Nai Talim in New Delhi today. This curriculum was brought out simultaneously in 13 languages i.e., Assamese, Tamil, Bengali, Odiya, Kannada, Malyalam, Punjabi, Marathi, Telugu, Gujarati, Urdu, Hindi and English in consultation with the state councils of educational research and training along with the universities in the country. 

Speaking on the occasion the Minister said that we would like to take experiential learning to all levels of education involving all states and all stakeholders. He said that the Gandhiji’s Nai Talim or basic education was a holistic approach of developing body, mind and soul (hand, head and heart), by making a productive art, craft or community engagement activity as the centre of learning. Gandhi ji said “by education I mean an all-round drawing out of the best in the child and man-body, mind and spirit”, said the Minister.

The Minister congratulated Mahatma Gandhi National Council of Rural Education for having involved all stakeholders in bringing out this Curriculum for Experiential Learning which is also based on Gandhi ji’s Nai Talim.

On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi’s upcoming 150th birth anniversary celebrations, a movement is on across the educational institutions in the country to promote Nai Talim, Work Education and Experiential Learning. A special effort is on school and teacher education in the areas of work education and experiential learning through the education departments of Universities as well as Central and State Governments and the SCERTs.

Marking the occasion of Teacher’s Day, the book titled “Experiential Learning – Gandhiji’s Nai Talim is launched today. This book is expected to inspire this movement to cover progressively 25 crore students of educational institutes at different levels in the country covering 80 lakh primary school teachers and 20 lakh secondary school teachers, spread over 17.5 lakh primary schools and 2.5 lakh secondary schools across the country. We wish to simultaneously release this book on September 5th, 2018 across the 29 States of India and NCR.

The book contains basic principles of Gandhiji’s Nai Talim (our notes and interpretations), along with the Work and Education curriculum for Schools, D.Ed, B.Ed and Faculty Development Programmes for teachers.

This book and this project is a joint effort of the Universities in the state, state SCERT and Mahatma Gandhi National Council of Rural Education (MGNCRE), formerly known as National Council of Rural Institutes (NCRI), under the Ministry of Human Resource Development in Government of India. MGNCRE in Higher Education Department of the Union Ministry Human Resource Development strives to promote resilient India through curricular interventions like curriculum design, development and capacitating teachers for higher education programmes offered by Universities and Autonomous Institutions in India.

                The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu presented the National Award to Teachers for the year 2017 on the occasion of Teachers’ Day, in New Delhi today. The Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Prakash Javadekar, the Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Shri Upendra Kushwaha and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu said that ‘Teachers are the key Architects of National Development’ and the basic education must be in mother tongue. The Vice President said that it is because of teachers like you that our system of education is moving steadily towards greater heights of excellence. In recognising your outstanding contribution the government has not only recognised you as individuals but has also show cased what can be actually achieved with competence, commitment and collaboration, he added.

The Vice President said that the countries of the world had recognized India as a world teacher or Vishwa Guru. He further said that in many ways this stream of intellectual pursuits and knowledge creation has continued over the last two millennia. However, there are persistent challenges in providing good quality education for all children, youth and adults, he added.

The Vice President said that the teachers must make their instruction learner-friendly and this essentially implies that if we have to universalise quality education the teachers must individualise learning. They must know each child well and respond to the learning needs of each and every child in the classroom, he added.

The Vice President said that experiential learning or learning by doing is one the most effective methods. As Confucius had said, “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand”. He further said that the teachers should make students learn through activities and this is the basic principle which has been detailed by educationists like Gurudev Tagore, Shri Aurobindo and Mahatma Gandhiji. Gandhiji had evolved a comprehensive, integrated vision of education called ‘Nayee Taaleem’ which relied on learning by doing, he added.

While addressing the gathering, Shri Prakash Javadekar said that teaching is a most respected profession and the purpose of National Award to the Teachers is to celebrate the unique contribution of some of the finest teachers in the country and to honor those teachers, who through their commitment have not only improved the quality of school education but also enriched the lives of their students. 

 

He said that to ensure transparency, we have changed the selection process for National Award for the teachers. This year, the teachers with innovative teaching methods, using the applications of ICT, creative learning, mobilizing community, promoting civic sense were selected. He further said that teachers have been awarded the national awards on their performance and not on the recommendations.   

 

Shri Javadekar said that the Ministry of Human Resource Development has taken a number of initiatives to change the structure of the entire education system. He added that to promote teaching reforms, the ministry has developed various platforms like Swayam, Diksha and Shagun. He also highlighted significant achievements of the Ministry like more than 14 lakh teachers have applied for D.El.Ed courses, increased funding under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan etc. He congratulated the winners of the awards for the invaluable services rendered by them. He said this felicitation to teachers is inspiration to others to perform in the future.

 

Addressing on the occasion, the Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Shri Upendra Kushwaha congratulated the winners of National Award to Teachers – 2017. He said that the teachers are the real agents of change and they have greater responsibility in nation development.

 

Smt. Rina Ray, Secretary, Department of School Education and Literacy gave vote of thanks on the occasion. Teachers from KVS and NVS performed songs at the end of ceremony. 

 

The award carries a Silver Medal, Certificate and Rs.50, 000/- as award money.

 

This year, the Ministry of Human Resource Development revised the guidelines for the selection of Teachers for National Awards (2017).From now onwards, all regular teachers will be eligible to apply and no minimum years of service is required. This has enabled meritorious young teachers to apply (under the earlier scheme, only teachers with minimum 15 years of service were eligible). For the first time, all teachers could directly apply and nominate themselves for the award (this feature did not exist in the earlier scheme).

 

A total of 6692 applications were received from teachers from all over the country. The number of awards has been rationalized to 45. This has been necessary to restore the prestige of the awards (under the earlier scheme the number of awardees had crossed 300).

 

The final selection was done by an independent Jury. The criterion adopted was to select those teachers who had shown innovation in their work and had added value to the school and to their students. These nominated teachers gave a presentation before an independent Jury comprising a senior educationist, during 3rd week of August, 2018. This ensured that all of them were given an opportunity to place before the jury their contribution and the work done by them.

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will be interacting with the recipients of the National Teachers’ Awards on 4th September (i.e the eve of National Teachers’ Day), and the Vice President will be conferring the awards on them at a function on 5th September i.e. Teachers’ Day.

This year, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has revised the guidelines for the selection of Teachers for National Awards (2017).The basic premise now is that the new scheme should be transparent, fair, and reward demonstrated excellence and performance and has been inspired by recent innovations in major national awards.

The features of the new guidelines are as under:


	From now onwards, all regular teachers will be eligible to apply and no minimum years of service is required. This has enabled meritorious young teachers to apply (under the earlier scheme, only teachers with minimum 15 years of service were eligible).
	For the first time, all teachers could directly apply and nominate themselves for the award (this feature did not exist in the earlier scheme).
	Self-nominations from teachers were invited online  on www.mhrd.gov.in.The Web Portal was developed by the Administrative Staff College of India(ASCI) and the entire software ran smoothly without any glitches or complaints (it is for the first time that online applications have been invited for these awards).
	6692 applications were received from teachers from all over the country clearly indicating that the initiative was successful.
	The number of awards has been rationalized to 45. This has been necessary to restore the prestige of the awards (under the earlier scheme the number of awardees had crossed 300).
	Out of all the applications received, every district selected the 3 best teachers and forwarded these to the committee under the State / UT Secretary of Education who made a shortlist. A total of 152 nominations were finally received from all States, UTs and Organisations.
	The final selection was done by an independent Jury. The criteria adopted was to select those teachers who had shown innovation in their work and had added value to the school and to their students.
	These nominated teachers gave a presentation before an independent Jury comprising a senior educationist, during 3rd week of August, 2018. This ensured that all of them were given an opportunity to place before the jury their contribution and the work done by them.

                Union Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences and Environment, Forest and Climate change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan inaugurated air pollution control device WAYU(Wind Augmentation PurifYing Unit) for traffic junctions at ITO intersection and Mukarba Chowk in Delhi today.WAYU is developed by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research – National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI) as a part of Technology Development Project being funded by Department of Science and Technology.

 

Speaking at the inauguration Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the prototype device that has been indigenously developed has the capacity to purify air in an area of 500 meter square. Dr. Vardhan further added that the device consumes only half a unit of electricity for 10 hours of running and has a maintenance cost of only Rs. 1500 per month. “We are in the process of developing a bigger version of WAYU which can purify air in an area of 10,000 meter square and also the designs of future WAYU devices will have even better aesthetics and can be deployed in bus shelters etc.”, said Dr. Vardhan. 

 

The device works on two principles mainly Wind generation for dilution of air pollutants and Active Pollutants removal. The device has filters for Particulate Matter removal and activated carbon (charcoal) and UV lamps for poisonous gases removal such as VOCs and Carbon Monoxide. The device has one fan and filter for sucking and removing Particulate Matter. There are two UV lamps and half kg of activated carbon charcoal coated with special chemical Titanium Dioxide.

 

By 15th of October, the ministry plans to install 54 more WAYU devices at various traffic intersections across Delhi.

                India, along with 23 otherIndian Ocean Nations, participated in a major Indian ocean-wide tsunami mock exercise (drill) on 4th& 5thSeptember, 2018. The Exercise, known as IOWave18,was organized by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, which coordinated the setting up of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (IOTWMS) in the aftermath of the 26 December 2004 tsunami.

IOWave18 which was completed yesterday focused on a simulatingan earthquake with magnitude of 9.3 at Northern Sumatra, Indonesia at 0830 IST. All eastern coastal states participated till community level. The exercise todayis being conducted in realtime lasting for around 12 hours and ITEWC will issue 15 tsunami bulletins in all,to both national and regional stakeholders through GTS, email, fax, SMS as well as on website. 

In India, IOWave18 is being coordinated by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) with support from National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the Coastal States/UTs. 

In yesterday's exercise, over 1000 people were evacuated in Andaman & Nicobar. Similarly, in West Bengal over 1200 people were evacuated in 3 districts.

                Union Minister of Electronics & IT, Sh. Ravi Shankar Prasad today inaugurated Centre of Excellence for Data Analytics (CEDA) in New Delhi. The technology backbone of the government – the National Informatics Centre (NIC), in a joint initiative with National Informatics Centre Services Incorporated (NICSI) has set up CEDA. 

 

Speaking at the inauguration the IT Minister said that today is the age of Data, and Data is power and information highway is equally important as national highways. “India has emerged as a big centre of data analytics and today the whole world is looking at us”, added Sh. Prasad. Unveiling the potential that data analytics has in transforming the way the government schemes are run, Sh. Prasad also released a white paper on ‘Data Analytics in Government’ which brings to the fore the need for a data driven decision making and policy formulation in Government across the entire spectrum of its activities.

 

Minister of State for Electronics & IT  Sh. S.S. Ahluwalia who was also present at the launch said that data analysis has been traditionally done since the time of Kautaliya for effective decision making, but today with great capabilities achieved in Information and communication technologies Data analysis can help in effective and efficient governance.

 

Centre of Excellence for Data Analytics (CEDA) will aid in fast-tracking the adoption of advanced analytics in government. In the era of rapid digitization of various government functions and services under Government of India’s flagship Digital India program, the centre aims to strengthen citizen service delivery through data-driven governance. The Centre of Excellence for Data Analytics (CEDA) has been created to support government departments to unlock the hidden potential of the data that they are generating as a part of the governance processes, and use it to improve the overall governance. It will provide world class data analytics services to the Government. Through its service offerings, CEDA aims to:

 


	Be a focal point and centre of expertise in data analytics for government and public sector
	Help ministries in assessing impact from the analytics solutions and help in understanding changes to organizational roles and responsibilities
	Facilitate faster and cost effective technology adoption
	Promote capacity building and enable the departments to self-service analytics with minimum technical support  
	Implement knowledge repository to collect learnings from across projects and share best practices across initiatives to ensure adoption of best practices
	It aims at providing following services to Government:-



	Data Quality Assurance Services –. The centre will provide data profiling tools and techniques and necessary expertise to analyse the data for quality issues. While data cleaning shall be done for making the data ready for analytical use, recommendations shall also be given in order to help the department take necessary actions to further improve their data collection process.
	Custom-built Data Analytics Solutions – Build analytic solutions that are specific to a particular problem which may relate to a single or a combination of departments.
	Develop reusable assets - This will be one of the many USPs of the centre. CEDA will build Data Analytic solutions that address a generic data analytics problem that is prevalent across departments or States. Such a solution will then be made available to other departments/states as a pre-built analytic solution that can be operationalized for the new States at a cost effective and a much faster rate. 
	Knowledge Management – CEDA will implement knowledge repository to collect learnings from across projects and share best practices across initiatives and will ensure usage of best practices in across the government.
	Capacity Building and Self Service Analytics – Besides creating the analytics solutions for the government departments, the centre’s focus would also be to train and enable the departments to do self-service analytics by simplifying the data in a manner in which an administrator can use it with minimum technical support.
	Change Management - CEDA will help ministries in assessing impact from the analytics solutions and help in understanding changes to organizational roles and responsibilities


 

The shift towards the digital age, propelled by Digital India Program, has led to tremendous growth in data related to various aspects of Government functions and services. As the next logical step, government departments are now looking to exploit this mount of gold mine by investing in analytical solutions that can turn this data into insights.

 

CEDA proposes to establish strong partnerships with academia and industry to ensure that the cutting edge technologies and quality expertise are brought in to help the Government take advantage of the booming analytic wave. Through its focused efforts, the centre aims to provide data analytics services to the government and help in solving complex policy issues through data-driven decision making to ensure effective formulation and implementation of various development initiatives that will ultimately benefit the citizens.

 

DIGIVAARTA LAUNCHED

DigiVaarta was launched in Delhi with the express intention of spreading awareness on DigiDhan, and also to spread popularity of BHIM’s barcode-based merchant payment mode with merchants and traders at large. This launch has two components – 

 


	An SMS application which operates from NIC’s SMS Gateway on a special Short-code service allotted for this purpose by DoT with the number “14444”. Citizens will receive SMS messages which are pre-approved by experts and the response messages will be made available for further action, analysis and research.

                Common Services Centers, through its initiative for women’s health and hygiene, named ‘Stree Swabhiman’ is striving to create a sustainable model for providing affordable and accessible sanitary products close to the homes of adolescent women and girls in rural areas. The initiative is driven by awareness and personalized outreach by women entrepreneurs who produces and market sanitary napkins themselves. The initiative aspires to play its part in reducing gender divide in access to development opportunities for women and girls which sadly affects access to education, health and workforce participation. 

Under Stree Swabhiman initiative for women’s health and hygiene, women entrepreneurs have become symbols of empowerment for women and girls in their communities. Till date, 278 Sanitary Napkin Micro Manufacturing Units have been successfully set up by these Women VLEs. The sanitary napkin produced by these units not only suits the needs of low-income communities, but are also bio-degradable and thus environment friendly. Besides, these are made easily accessible to rural communities. Apart from boosting women’s health and hygiene, this initiative also provides employment opportunities to women in rural communities as each facility employs 5-7 women. Besides this, women VLEs also create awareness, access and affordability. 

In furtherance the objective of women health and hygiene, CSC SPV has installed Sanitary Vending Machines in MeitY Women Restrooms. This will benefit women employees availing Sanitary Pads in the ministry. Based on the success and learning of this initiative, further similar vending machines will be installed at the other Public and Private institutions.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had deployed 41 teams in Delhi-NCR for ground-level inspection of activities that cause pollution from September 15 this year.  CPCB has also issued directions to concerned State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), MCDs, construction agencies, transport and agricultural departments to prepare targeted action plans for air polluting sources and to implement these plans. Three mitigation pilot projects have also been sanctioned for deployment in Delhi.  In addition, several steps such as restriction on the use of petcoke and furnace oil in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, introduction of BS VI compliant petrol in Delhi since April 2018, conversion of brick kilns to zig-zag technology, issuance of list of approved fuels permissible for use within the borders of NCT of Delhi, operationalisation of Eastern Peripheral Expressway to ease congestion and diversion of traffic from Delhi, financial incentive for in-situ crop residue management in Haryana and Punjab, are likely to have a positive impact on the ambient air quality in the coming months.

With a view to enhance public participation, CPCB has invited proposals through crowd sourcing. Any person with any practical idea has been invited to participate in the collective endeavour.

It was also emphasised at the meeting that NCR states should ensure that farm implements that are being distributed to tackle stubble burning should be completed in the next 10 days to ensure that no stubble burning incident takes place in the States of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  Ambient air quality monitoring network is being expanded in NCR States and more data is expected to facilitate better air quality management decisions.  

Minister of State, MoEF&CC, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Environment and Forest Minister, NCT of Delhi, Mr Imran Hussain, Minister of Environment & Forest, Uttar Pradesh, Mr Dara Singh Chauhan and senior officers from MoEF&CC, CPCB, as well as from the States of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh  attended the meeting.

                Stressing upon the need to strengthen active collaboration between the government, industries, industry associations and all stakeholders, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said that the World Ozone Day offers an opportunity to focus global attention and action on the vital environmental issue of protection of the ozone Layer.  Dr. Vardhan added that this is a hallmark in implementation of ODS phase-out programme in the country.   Dr. Harsh Vardhan pointed out that the Ministry has already undertaken an important initiative for upskilling of 100,000 Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Servicing technicians in collaboration with the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) – Skill India Mission. The Minister underlined the need to work consistently under the aegis of the Montreal Protocol to phase out Ozone Depleting Substances.  

Dr. Harsh Vardhan released the draft India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP) and a booklet on ‘Montreal Protocol – India’s Success Story’.  A refurbished website on the Ozone Cell of the Ministry and a Management Information System (MIS) for Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) were also launched on the occasion.  The Minister also released two handbooks for trainers and technicians on “Good Service Practices and installation of room air-conditioners with HCFC-22 and flammable refrigerants”. Dr. Vardhan also presented awards to students for competitions in painting, poster and slogan organized on World Ozone Day.  Besides these publications, “A Guide for integration of topics related to HCFC Phase out and Energy efficiency in Architectural Curriculum” was also released.  

Addressing the gathering, Secretary, MoEF&CC, Shri C.K Mishra said that the Ministry has developed a very strong linkage with the industry and other stakeholders.  He added that along with energy efficiency, it is critical to identify the usage of gases and not merely replacement of gases.  Shri Mishra emphasised that the Government’s effort is to provide thermal comfort to those who have no access to it.  “There are alternative ways to cooling that should be looked at.  Another issue is an army of trained manpower to handle manufacturing and maintenance”, he said.  He also pointed out to the criticality of the need for finances and expanding research & development (R&D).  

India is the first country in world to develop such a document (ICAP), which addresses cooling requirement across sectors and lists out actions which can help reduce the cooling demand.  This will help in reducing both direct and indirect emissions. The thrust of the ICAP is to look for synergies in actions for securing both environmental and socio-economic benefits.  The overarching goal of ICAP is to provide sustainable cooling and thermal comfort for all while securing environmental and socio-economic benefits for the society.

The goals emerging from the suggested interventions stated in ICAP are:  (i) Recognition of “cooling and related areas” as a thrust area of research under national science and technology programme to support development of technological solutions and encourage innovation challenges, (ii) Reduction of cooling demand across sectors by 20% to 25 % by year 2037-38, (iii) Reduction of refrigerant demand by 25% to 30% by year 2037-38, (iv) Reduction of cooling energy requirements by 25% to 40% by year 2037-38, and (v) Training and certification of 100,000 servicing sector technicians by the year 2022-23, in synergy with Skill India Mission.

The broad objectives of the India Cooling Action Plan include - (i) Assessment of cooling requirements across sectors in next 20 years and the associated refrigerant demand and energy use, (ii) Map the technologies available to cater the cooling requirement including passive interventions, refrigerant-based technologies and alternative technologies such as not-in-kind technologies, (iii) Suggest interventions in each sector to provide for sustainable cooling and thermal comfort for all, (iv) Focus on skilling of RAC service technicians, and (v) Develop an R&D innovation ecosystem for indigenous development of alternative technologies.   

ICAP had been prepared by the Ministry after extensive deliberations and multi-stakeholders engagement in public domain for receiving comments/suggestions.   Recognizing that integrated actions, taking a holistic view on the cooling requirement across sectors with long term perspective (20 years) will have a higher impact than either of the actions taken in isolation, the Ministry had initiated the process for developing the Cooling Action Plan in July 2017.

""Keep Cool and Carry on” : The Montreal Protocol is the theme of 24th World Ozone Day celebrations.

The Montreal Protocol is the only environmental treaty which enjoys universal ratification of 197 UN numbers countries. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer has been recognized as the most successful international environment treaty in history.  Its implementation has not only led to the phase-out of around 98% of ozone depleting chemicals, but also averted more than 135 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Nearly 2 million cases of skin cancer per year have been averted globally.

India has consciously chosen a path for most environment-friendly and energy efficient technologies while phasing out Ozone Depleting Substances, unlike many of the developed countries. India is among the few countries globally and a pioneer in some cases, in the use of technologies, which are non-ozone depleting and have low global warming potential.

Cooling has been recognized as an important development need due to cross-sectoral nature and considerable use of cooling and air conditioning in different Sectors of the economy such as industries, residential and commercial buildings, cold chain, transport (personal, commercial, metro and railways, ships).

The integration of topics on HCFC phase out and energy efficiency in architectural curriculum will help the future architects to introduce energy efficiency and use ozone friendly materials in new construction of buildings. This will help not only in the protection of Ozone layer, but also reduce energy consumption in building sector, which is one of the significant consumers of electricity in urban areas.  

The World Ozone Day celebration was well attended by senior officers of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, representatives of multilateral and bilateral agencies including UN Environment, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), representatives of various government departments, industry and industry associations and a large number of students.

                Emphasising that circular economy and resource efficiency can provide solutions to the challenges posed in the process of reconciling economic growth with environmental sustainability, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has pointed to the need for corporate participation in building resource efficiency and a circular economy. Addressing the 13th Sustainability Summit with the theme – “Everyone’s future” here today, Dr. Vardhan underlined the growth of Indian economy, along with successful management and development of forests, wildlife habitats and ecosystems. He stated that India has registered 1 per cent growth in its forest and tree cover, according to the latest report of Forest Survey of India. The Minister stressed that while talking about sustainable development, economy and ecology must go together. “The present Government has given equal thrust to both these components and we are marching towards the path of Sustainable Development”, he said. Dr. Vardhan referred to the recent implementation of ‘PARIVESH’- a single window clearance system in the spheres of Environment, Forest, Wildlife and Coastal Regulation Zone. He pointed out that the automated system will help applicants track the application status, as well as help in improving environmental compliance. The Minister highlighted India’s affirmative action in embracing a sustainable lifestyle by aligning the 5 Ps – People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership.

 

Acknowledging that the quality of air is an environmental issue that impacts the health of the country’s citizens, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that the National Clean Air Action Plan and air quality monitoring infrastructure are the Government’s key areas of focus. The Minister averred that environmental challenges necessitate coordinated action from all sections of the society. He said that human beings have put immense pressure on the systems of nature, which has resulted in the emergence of global challenges such as climate change, melting of glaciers, loss of biodiversity, poverty and growing inequity. Dr. Vardhan alluded to the development of strategies for proper segregation of municipal solid waste and utilisation of plastic waste for recycling and recovery. “We have engaged with various municipal authorities and state pollution control boards to facilitate better understanding of regulatory frameworks to ensure an efficient waste collection and disposal system”, Dr. Vardhan said. 

 

The Minister also invited the industry representatives to join hands with the Government on various initiatives such as air pollution control, waste management river conservation, or biodiversity conservation. 

 

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Housing and Urban Development, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri said, “India’s development trajectory will be ‘green’ and in consonance with the ethos of the 2030 development agenda”. He stated that India stands united in its efforts against rising global temperatures and elaborated that a quick glance at India’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions reaffirm this point and referred to the target of 175 GW renewable energy capacities by 2022 as unprecedented. He  averred that the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 recognized the intrinsic linkages between climate change and urbanization. “Goal 11, titled “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” has embedded in it, critical elements of climate action. Solid waste management, air pollution, slum housing, and water related disasters, are just some of the climate-related aspects covered in Goal 11”, he outlined.

 

Pointing to the objective of the Swacch Bharat Mission (SBM) to make India ODF and have 100% scientific solid waste management by October 2, 2019, the Minister suggested that SBM is not only about infrastructure, but also bringing about behavioural and cultural changes among citizens. He added that to ensure India’s city driven development is sustainable, the government has embarked on the world’s largest planned urbanization programme. The key to the process is “integration”, meaning all policies, projects, and proposals are considered in relation to one another, he added.

 

Shri Puri stated that the use of new and alternate construction technologies in the construction of houses, locally available eco-friendly materials suited to local climatic conditions are being encouraged, reducing not only the cost of construction but also the resultant carbon footprint. He also emphasised on affordable, eco-friendly and modern urban transportation services and said that Delhi Metro is today comparable to the best in the world. 

 

Director General, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Shri Chandrajit Banerjee, European Commissioner, Mr. Karmenu Vella and representatives from industry and civil society were among those present on the occasion.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved continuation of the Centrally Sponsored Umbrella Scheme of Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (CSS-IDWH)beyond the 12thPlan period from 2017-18 to 2019-20.  The Scheme consists of  Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Project Tiger (CSS-PT), Development of Wildlife Habitats (CSS-DWH) and Project Elephant (CSS-PE). The total outlay is Rs. 1731.72 crore as central share (Rs. 1143 crore for Project Tiger, Rs. 496.50 crore for Development of Wildlife Habitats and Rs.92.22 crore for Project Elephant) from 2017-18 to 2019-20.

A total of 18 tiger range States, distributed in five landscapes of the country would be benefitted under the Project Tiger scheme. Similarly, for other two schemes, the coverage is entire country in case of Development of Wildlife Habitats (DWH) and 23 elephant range States for Project Elephant. It  would foster wildlife conservation in general with specific inputs for tiger in Project Tiger area and elephant in Project Elephant area.

Besides immense environmental benefits and effective implementation of tiger conservation inputs in and around tiger reserves under Project Tiger, wildlife conservation inputs in Protected Areas & nearby areas under Development of Wildlife Habitats and Elephant conservation inputs in Project Elephant areas, the schemes would result in overall strengthening/ consolidation of tiger, elephant and wildlife conservation in the country.

The schemes would address the human wildlife conflict effectively. Besides, the communities opting for voluntary relocation from the Core/Critical Tiger Habitat (6900 families) would be benefitted under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Project Tiger (CSS-PT) and 800 families under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Development of Wildlife Habitat.

These schemes would generate employment opportunities resulting in economic upliftment of people in and around tiger reserves/ Protected Areas besides leading to reduction in natural resource dependency with substitution by clean energy use. It will generate direct employment of about 30 lakh mandays annually which shall include many local tribes besides non-tribal local workforce. People living in vicinity would also get indirect benefits. Local populace would get opportunities to serve as guides, driver, hospitality personnel and in other ancillary jobs. These schemes would foster imparting various skills towards making people self-dependent through various eco-development projects, thereby enabling them to go for self-employment.

These schemes would result in resource generation through tourist visits, thereby fostering in securing tiger source areas and other areas important for wildlife conservation, besides being helpful in sustaining life support systems as well as ensuring the food, water and livelihood security.

The implementation of the schemes would be done through the respective States in designated Tiger Reserves, Protected Areas and Elephant Reserves.

 The Government of India in consultation with Reserve Bank of India will continue to have the flexibility to modify the notified amount and timing for auction of Treasury Bills depending upon the requirements of the Government of India, evolving market conditions and other relevant factors, after giving due notice to the market. Thus, the calendar is subject to change, if circumstances so warrant, including for reasons such as intervening holidays. Such changes, if any, will be communicated through regular press releases.

 

 The auction of Treasury Bills will be subject to the terms and conditions specified in the General Notification No. F.4(2)-W&M/2018 dated March 27, 2018 issued by the Government of India, as amended from time to time.

                Himachal Pradesh has made credible progress in adhering to the macro-economic parameters, however, Debt to GSDP ratio which is unacceptably high at 38% is an area of continuing concern, said Chairman of Finance Commission Shri N.K.Singh at a press conference in Shimla today. Nonetheless, he appreciated state govt’s efforts to bring it down form an unusually high debt level in past few years. State govt is conscious of it and would do suitable amendments in its FRBM Act for further fiscal consolidation. 

Hydroelectric potential is a major source of revenue for the state but its full potential could not be realised due to the fact that Government of India does not recognise hydel projects beyond a certain threshold as renewable energy projects. Commission feels that hydel is a great source of renewable energy. This policy approach needs reconsideration in the broader context of having rich hydel potential of Himachal Pradesh and other similar states. No doubt, if agreed, it would be significant source of revenue generation for the state and ameliorate their debt burden, said Shri Singh. Connectivity is another pillar to unlock the economic potential of Himachal Pradesh specially the huge potential in tourism sector needs vigorous push for road, rail and air connectivity alongwith other infrastructure development, he added. Commission recognizes that problem of hill states and NE states need a somewhat innovative approach for meeting its developmental needs.

Himachal Pradesh is lagging in GST collections and the present numbers need to be boosted due to various policy level decisions. Himachal Pradesh needs to find innovative ways to increase the tax base and the collection. However, Sh. Singh acknowledged that there are issues with GST like rates and the compensation which may take some time to settle. Commission will try to make realistic GST projections for states from 2020-2025 considering that 14% compensation will not be there for states in the last three years of award period of this commission. It will also be a challenge to make revenue projections from GST for centre. 

There is a consensus that there is a great economic potential but is vulnerable to disasters which is a general problem of hilly states. Commission will try to incorporate international experience in funding pattern for mitigation and adaptation efforts. Commission has also conducted a study on Disaster Management which will consider the issues specific to Himachal.

              Chief Minister Shri Jairam Thakur along with his cabinet colleagues in his welcome remarks highlighted the historical perspective about the statehood of the State which shows the low economic potential. He apprised the Commission about the rural nature of the economy, cost disabilities and difficult geographical conditions of the state. He urged the Commission to make a realistic assessment of the revenues and provide a post devolution Revenue Deficit grant as Himachal Pradesh historically has been a chronically revenue deficit state. He stated that state is incurring annual losses of around 3000 crores due to abolition of Planning Commission.

State govt officials in their presentation apprised the commission about the cost disabilities arising due to service provision on hilly areas and conservation of forest area. State demanded 800 crore for SDRF which is required due to its proneness to disasters. They emphasised on the need for mitigation funding. 

They proposed to include Fiscal Capacity distance and state’s performance on National Priorities as criteria for devolution. They made some state specific proposals like connectivity and infrastructure projects specially rail and air connectivity projects to boost tourism and Rs. 11684 crore for forest management. State mentioned that in view of low credit deposit ration in hill/NE states, 30% of shareable pool of taxes may be set aside for NE/Hilly states.

15th Finance Commission which is on a 3 day visit to Himachal Pradesh also sought views of the representatives from various political parties, local bodies and trade and industry. Industrial package on the line of north east States was demanded in these meetings. In the meeting with representatives of Local Bodies some policy related issues like the modalities of fund transfer to the local bodies were the main focus area. Municipalities urged the commission to consider the flux of tourists and tough climatic conditions for grants and devolution of funds. Representatives also focused on the need for the funds to be given to the Zila Parishads and Panchayat Samitis. They also urged the commission to consider a change the funding pattern for Smart City Projects with 90:10 ratio for Himachal.

Commission appreciated the warm hospitality extended by the State Govt. The Commission also looked forward to continuing interaction with the State Government based on today’s meaningful discussion. The Commission will finalise its recommendations by October 2019 after completing its discussions with all the State Governments, the Government of India and relevant stakeholders.

                            Department of Financial Services (DFS), Ministry of Finance and National Informatics Centre  (NIC) has jointly developed a mobile app called Jan Dhan Darshak as a part of financial inclusion (FI) initiative . As the name suggests, this app will act as a guide for the common people in locating a financial service touch point at a given location in the country.

 

            While locator apps are a common feature for many individual banks and financial service providers, in this era of inter-operable banking services, Jan Dhan Darshak app will be in a unique position to provide a citizen centric platform for locating financial service touch points across all providers such as banks, post office, CSC, etc. These services could be availed as per the needs and convenience of the common people. 

 

            While over 5 lakh FI touch points (Bank branches, ATMs, Post Offices) have been mapped on this App, approx. 1.35 lakh Bank Mitras would be on-boarded by 01.12.2018. Some of the salient features of this App are as follows:

 


	Find nearby Financial touch points,  based on current location (Branches/ATM/Post offices)


 


	Search by place name


 


	Search by place name also available with Voice Interface


 


	Phone number of bank branches available in app, with the facility of call button for integrated dialing


 


	Users’ feedback will go directly to the concerned bank for carrying out the necessary updation in data on financial touch points.

                The Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley  launched the Financial Inclusion Index after his Annual Performance Review Meeting with CEOs of the Public Sector Banks in New Delhi today. Department of Financial Services (DFS), Ministry of Finance will release an Annual Financial Inclusion Index (FII) which will be a measure of access and usage of a basket of formal financial products and services that includes savings, remittances, credit, insurance and pension products. The index will have three measurement dimensions; (i) Access to financial services (ii) Usage of financial services and (3) Quality.

The various components of the index will also help to measure financial services for use of internal policy making. Financial Inclusion Index can be used directly as a composite measure in development indicators. It enables fulfilment of G20 Financial Inclusion Indicators requirements. It will also facilitate researchers to study the impact of financial inclusion and other macro-economic variables.

                                 This will be released on January, 2019.

                The Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley said the Formalisation of the Indian Economy through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), GST, demonetisation and digital payments have enabled better assessment of financial capacity and risks, and coupled with inclusive growth through massive financial inclusion, has unlocked purchasing power which will drive India’s growth. The Finance Minister said that this should help India sustain a growth rate of around 8%. A growing economy will also help banks grow in strength, he added. Conversely, as lifelines of the economy, banks would need to build their strength to support the lending needs of a growing economy. The Finance Minister, Shri Jaitley was addressing the Chief Executives and other whole-time Directors of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) at the Annual Review Meeting of the PSBs in New Delhi today. The Finance Minister was, highlighting the factors that make for sustained high growth for India over the next decade.

 

While noting the positive results from the IBC mechanism, the Finance Minister, Shri Jaitley also flagged the need to assess and revisit the efficacy of the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT) mechanism, particularly in view of long lead times in disposal of cases. He underscored the requirement for expediting recovery through the DRT mechanism, so that their original objective of speedy recovery proceedings is realised.

 

The Finance Minister noted that the perception regarding the health of PSBs has become more positive as banks have posted positive results in terms of resolution, recovery, provisioning and credit growth. The Finance Minister said that the Amendment of IBC to debar wilful defaulters has had the unintended positive consequence of defaulting borrowers stepping forward to make payment in order to participate in the resolution process.

 

The Finance Minister also noted the continued relevance of PSBs in the Indian context, in view of their development contributions and to support financial inclusion. In this regard, he noted that support for non-retail banking from other lenders continues to be insufficient.

 

The Finance Minister, Shri Jaitley also underscored the need to trust and confidence in the Banking System as a necessary precondition for meeting the needs of the economy. With the recent amendment to the Prevention of Corruption Act, there now need not be any apprehension in the minds of bankers in supporting investments that are in the best interests of the economy, the nation and the banks. At the same time, he exhorted the banks to ensure all steps at their end to ensure clean lending and effective action in cases of fraud and wilful default, to justify the trust reposed in banks. Banks must strive to be seen always as institutions of clean and prudent lending, the Finance Minister concluded.

                Gurugram Zonal Unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) have arrested two businessmen, namely, Sh. Vikas Goel, Director of M/s Mica Industries Ltd, Delhi and Bhiwadi& M/s. Satellite Cables Pvt Ltd., Bhiwadi and Sh. Raju Singh Proprietor of M/s Galaxy Metal Products on 14.09.2018 in a case of fraudulent issuance of Input Tax Credit invoices without actual supply of goods, involving evasionof approximately Rs. 79.21 croreson the taxable value of concocted supplies of Rs. 450 crores.This quantum of evasion and the gravity of the offence is cognizable and non bailableunder the CGST Act, 2017 under the provisions of sub section (5) of Section 132 (1). Thus, both of them were arrested under Section 69 (1) of the CGST Act,2017 and produced before the Hon’ble Judicial Magistrate 1st Class (JMIC), Gurugram.

Searches were conducted at several places during which various incriminating documentsand evidencewere found. During investigation it was revealed that these businessmen heading M/s Mica Industries Ltd. had floated two entities namely M/s. Galaxy Metal Products, Delhi and M/s. Sri Ram Industries, Delhi for issuing such fake invoices. They are involved in issuing fake bills/invoices to each other in a Circular manner without any concomitant movement of goods or payments for such transactions thereby wrongfulavailing and utilizing fake ITC. On verification of corroborated documentary evidences and statements of various persons it was established that there was no movement of goods against the invoices raised. Both the Directors of companies and both the proprietor of firms have admitted that all payments for the transactions were made by third party adjustments and which were done at the end of the year. There was no actual payment invoice wise. 

Further investigations are underway and the quantum of evasion is likely to go up. Officers are not ruling out the possibility of existence of several other fake firms as the investigation moves ahead. Sh. Vinay Gupta, the other Director of M/s Mica Industries Ltd. and Sh. Vinod Kumar Aggarwal, Proprietor of M/s Sri Ram Industries, Delhi are absconding. Efforts are being made to trace them.

The Alternative Mechanism comprising of its Chairperson, the Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley and Cabinet Ministers, Shri Piyush Goyal and Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman met here today in New Delhi and decided that Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank may consider amalgamation of the three banks. The envisaged amalgamation will be the First-ever three-way consolidation of banks in India, with a combined business of Rs. 14.82 lakh crore, making it India’s Third Largest Bank. 

The consolidation will help create a strong globally competitive bank with economies of scale and enable realisation of wide-ranging synergies. Leveraging of networks, low-cost deposits and subsidiaries of the three banks has the potential of yielding significant synergies for positioning the consolidated entity for substantial rise in customer base, market reach, operational efficiency, wider bouquet of products and services, and improved access for customers.  

Some of the strengths of the envisaged amalgamated entity are— 

· Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) at 67.5% is well above Public Sector Banks (PSBs) average (63.7%), and steadily increasing

·  Net NPA ratio at 5.71% significantly better than PSB average (12.13%), and declining further

·         Gross NPAs for the combined entity have started declining (decline of Rs. 1,048 crore in Q1)

·         Cost to income ratio of the combined entity at 48.94% better than the PSB average of 53.92%

·         Dena Bank’s strength in MSME will further augment the strength of the other two to position the amalgamated bank for being an MSME Udyamimitra

·         Capital Adequacy Ratio (CRAR) at 12.25% is significantly above the regulatory norm of 10.875%, and stronger amalgamated bank will be better positioned to tap capital markets 

·  Significant cost benefits from synergies: Larger distribution network will reduce operating and distribution costs with benefits for the amalgamated bank, its customers and their subsidiaries

·  Global network strength of Bank of Baroda will be leveraged to enable customers of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank to have global access  

·   Access improvement through amalgamation of networks 

·  Wider range of products and services through leveraging of bank subsidiaries and leveraging of a larger network for offering more value-added non-banking services and products

                Interest payable by an Indian company or a business trust to a non-resident, including a foreign company, in respect of rupee denominated bond issued outside India before the 1stof July, 2020 is liable for concessional rate of tax of Five Percent (5%). Consequently, Section 194LC of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) provides for the deduction of tax at a lower rate of five percent on the said interest payment.

Consequent to review of the State of Economy on 14th September, 2018 by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, the Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley had announced a Multi-pronged Strategy to contain the Current Account Deficit (CAD) and augment the Foreign Exchange Inflow. In this background, Low Cost Foreign Borrowings through Off-shore Rupee Denominated Bond have been further incentivised to increase the foreign exchange inflow. 

Accordingly, it has been decided that interest payable by an Indian company or a business trust to a non-resident, including a foreign company, in respect of Rupee Denominated Bond issued outside India during the period from 17th September, 2018 to 31st March, 2019 shall be exempt from tax, and consequently, no tax shall be deducted on the payment of interest in respect of the said Bond under Section 194LC of the Act. 

Legislative amendments in this regard shall be proposed in due course.

                The Fifteenth Finance Commission of the Government of India is visiting the state of Maharashtra from 17th to 19th September 2018. The Commission led by the Chairman Shri N.K.Singh, Members – Sh. Shaktikanta Das, Dr. Anoop Singh, Dr. Ashok Lahiri, Dr. Ramesh Chand and Secretary Shri Arvind Mehta along with other officials will have meetings with Chief Minister, Ministers and other officials of the state in Mumbai. There will be meetings with the leaders of various political parties, representatives of Trade and Industry, Urban Local Bodies and Panchayati Raj Institutions to understand the issues concerning the state.

Commission had also held a consultation meeting with economists in Pune in the month of August to understand the issues in the region. Ahead of the visit, Commission understood in New Delhi, various aspects of its finances and issues related to socio-economic spheres from Accountant General of Maharashtra. 

Maharashtra is a high income State of the Indian Union. It is a leading industrial State and also one of the most urbanized States in India. It is also known as the host State to several leading educational institutions in the country. Maharashtra contributes around 15 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product of India. Service sector contributes 57 per cent of the state income, followed by industrial sector with 33 percent and remaining 9 per cent originates in the agriculture and allied sectors. However, high inter regional disparity has been a characteristic feature of the State since its inception in 1960. The state seems to have faltered in translating its high economic growth into commensurate human development.

 

The State is a front runner in terms of better fiscal management in the country since the enactment of state FRBM Act in 2006. The fiscal deficit of the state continues to be well within the limit of 3 per cent of GSDP. The debt stock to GSDP ratio is also well within the 17.5 per cent limit set by the Maharashtra Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Rules (MFRBM, 2011). Yet, a revenue deficit of 0.5 per cent of GSDP continues to be a worrisome factor for Maharashtra; the revenue deficit to GSDP ratio has increased even as the fiscal deficit to GSDP ratio has fallen. This indicates that debt is being used for revenue expenditures. Revenue expenditures show rigidities due to the presence of high levels of salary and interest payments. More stringent steps would be required to achieve complete sustainability. Complete sustainability would require a huge increment in the revenue generation capacity of the State. Inter-se Shares of the state for Tax Devolution has been on rise in past four finance commissions. Central transfers increased from 11 per cent to 16 per cent of total revenue receipts during 2012-17.

GST could well be a game- changer in this respect. No revenue loss to the state on implementation of GST. The tax to GSDP ratio for the State stands at about 6.24, which is far lesser than other comparable, large-sized developed States. It is also worrisome to note that the targeted Budget Estimate of the tax-GSDP ratio shows a secular decline over the past decade. Debt sustainability should be addressed through higher revenue generation rather than through expenditure contraction.

 

The pace of decentralization needs to be increased. As of March 2015, only 14 functions out of the indicated 29 functions have been fully transferred to the local bodies. The State Government allocates about 20 per cent of its revenues to local bodies; within the allocated funds, there is a heavy bias towards Panchayat Raj Institutions which receive 78 per cent of the allocated funds. The ratio of funds allocated to Urban Local Bodies is far lesser than the ratio of population residing within the urban areas in Maharashtra.

 

Main Issues which the Commission will focus upon:

 

• The State could not maintain the momentum of growth of revenue receipts during 2009-13 to 2014-17. The trend growth declined from 17.69% during 2009-13 to 11.05% in 2014-17.

• The trend growth of States own tax revenue declined from during 19.44% in 2009-13 to 8.16% in 2014-17

• The percentage of capital expenditure to total expenditure remained between 11 and 12 during 2013-17


	5th SFC recommendations are ideally required to be implemented from 2014-15 onwards, and it appears in Maharashtra that even Report of the 4th SFC is pending 


 

Sharp Social and Economic Social Disparity across various districts

• The state had a urbanisation rate of 45.23 in census 2011 as compared to All India Average of 31.16%.  Mumbai city which is the commercial and financial capital contributes to around 2.5% of India’s GDP and 30.5% of the total tax collection in the Country.

• On the other hand, of 34 districts in Maharashtra, 16 districts of Vidarbha and Marathawada have per capita income below the state and national average.

• Of the 351 Development Blocks, 125 blocks in the State have been identified as socially backward on Human Development Index.

Poverty Rate of 17.35 as compared to 21.92 All India as per 2011-12 Tendulkar Estimates, though districts in north and east Maharashtra have high poverty.

• 21.2% of the State Population is SC/ST. The state is home to 7.9% of the total SC/ST Population in the Country (4th Rank after UP(14.07), WB(8.8%)and MP(8.8%)

• High poverty rates and slow poverty reduction and illiteracy among the STs in Maharashtra

 

Issue of Rural Distress and Farmer Suicides

1. Status of formal lending to farmers

2. Irrigation- only 18% of Maharashtra’s total cultivable land is irrigated while the national average is over 35%. This is despite Maharashtra accounting for 35% of the total number of irrigation projects in India. Maharashtra is spending less on irrigation than All India average.

3. Issue of Escalation of Costs in Irrigation Project and land acquisitions.

 

State govt. has also submitted a detailed memorandum to the Commission for consideration. Commission expects to gain an in-depth understanding of the peculiar issue related to the economic growth and development in Maharashtra during its interactions and meetings with the state govt.

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval for the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Collaborative Research on Distributed Ledger and Block chain Technology in the context of Development of digital economy by Export-Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) with the participating member banks, under the BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism namely Banco Nacional de DesenvolvimentoEconomico e Social (BNDES, of Brazil), China Development Bank (CDB), State Corporation Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs (Vnesheconombank, of Russia) and Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA).

Major Impact

Distributed Ledger/Block chain technology holds potential for solutions to various challenges being faced in the financial sector space of the BRICS nations. The MoU intends to enhance understanding of Distributed Ledger/Block Chain technology, through the joint research efforts to identify areas within respective business operations where it may have the potential for applications aimed at enhancing the operational efficiencies.

Background:

The Xiamen Declaration signed in China on digital economy by the BRICS leaders had highlighted the importance of the digital economy and how the BRICS nations could leverage the thriving and dynamic digital economy that will foster global economic development and benefit everyone. Accordingly, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Collaborative Research on Distributed Ledger and Block chain Technology in the Context of the Development of the Digital Economy was suggested to be inked by all member banks.

                It has been observed that the number of taxpayers who have filed FORM GSTR-3B is substantially higher than the number of taxpayers who have furnished FORM GSTR-1. Non-furnishing of FORM GSTR-1 is liable to late fee and penalty as per the provisions of the GST law. In order to encourage taxpayers to furnish FORM GSTR-1, a one-time scheme to waive off late fee payable for delayed furnishing of FORM GSTR-1 for the period from July, 2017 to September, 2018 till 31.10.2018 has been launched.

In this regard, the due date for furnishing FORM GSTR-1 for the period from July, 2017 to September, 2018 has been extended till 31st October, 2018 for all registered persons having aggregate turnover above Rs 1.5 crores including the registered persons in Kerala, or whose principal place of business is in Kodagu (Karnataka) and Mahe (Puducherry). For taxpayers having aggregate turnover up to Rs 1.5 crores, the due date for furnishing FORM GSTR-1 for the quarters from July, 2017 to September, 2018 has been extended till 31st October, 2018. Notification Nos. 43 and 44/2018 – Central Tax dated 10th September, 2018 have been issued in this regard.

                Public Debt Management Cell (PDMC) (earlier Middle Office), Budget Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance has today brought-out the Quarterly Report on Debt Management for the Quarter April-June 2018 (Q1 FY 2019).

 

During Q1 of FY19, the Central Government issued dated securities worth Rs. 1,44,000 crore in 12 tranches as against Rs. 1,68,000 crore in Q1 of FY18. The Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) of new issuances increased to 15.16 years from 14.92 years in Q1 of FY 18 owing to issuances of longer tenor securities. The weighted average yield (WAY) of issuances for the same quarter was 7.76 per cent compared to 7.01 per cent in Q1 of FY 18. The temporary cash flow mismatches were bridged through issuances of Cash Management Bills in three tranches up to Rs. 65,000 crore during the Quarter. The net average liquidity absorption by RBI under Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) including MSF was Rs. 25,825 crore during the Quarter.

 

The total liabilities (including liabilities under the ‘Public Account’) of the Government, as per provisional data, increased to ₹ 79,80,667 crore at end-June 2018 from ₹ 77,98,772crore at end-March 2018. Public debt accounted for 89.3 per cent of total outstanding liabilities at end-June 2018 with internal debt accounting for 83.0 per cent of its share. Nearly 27.0 per cent of the outstanding dated securities had a residual maturity of less than 5 years. The holding pattern indicates a share of 41.8 per cent for commercial banks and 24.2 per cent for insurance companies by end-June 2018. 

 

G-Sec yields have shown a hardening trend in Q1 of FY19 with the increase in weighted average yield of primary issuances to 7.76 per cent from 7.34 per cent since the last quarter reflecting the impact of both global and domestic developments. The manifestation of global developments being increase in crude oil prices, rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, rising geo-political tensions while domestic developments included weak Rupee, rise in CPI, demand-supply imbalance for shorter-tenor securities and weak demand from FPIs. The yield on 10-year benchmark G-Sec (7.17% GS 2028) closed higher at 7.90 per cent on June 29, 2018. A similar reflection is also observed in yield spreads of different maturities as at end-June 2018 compared to those prevailing at end-March 2018. Central Government dated securities continued to account for a major share of total trading volumes, with a share of 86 per cent in total outright trading and repo volumes in value terms during Q1 of FY 19.

Schemes which may look like populist may in fact be popular as well and the scheme which may have commenced as a populist scheme has over a period of time may have generated multiplier effect said N. K. Singh, the Chairman of the visiting Finance Commission at a press conference in Chennai today. On what constitutes populist or not, commission is hearing different viewpoints, it will need to consider this in totality taking everything into account, he added.

North versus South debate is misleading, he mentioned, as many states from other parts of the country are also expressing similar apprehensions as made by southern states like the issue of population date of 2011 etc. It will be the endeavour of commission not to penalise the states doing well on demographic front as well as economic front while carefully balancing the equity and efficiency.

Acknowledging that there are issues with GST like rates and the compensation which may take some time to settle, he said that Commission will try to make realistic GST projections for states considering that 14% compensation will not be there for states in the last three years of award period of this commission. It will also be a challenge to make revenue projections from GST for centre. Finance Commission is doing consultation with CBIC on GST.

Challenge arising out of urbanisation and resultant migration is a significant issue for tamilnadu which needs serious consideration as the urban centres are the growth engines for not only TN but for the country as well. With achieving Total fertility rates less than replacement rate of population growth, rising percentage of ageing population will create new pressure on state finances and need specific care by the state.

Appreciating the growth momentum of the state, Chairman said that Tamil Nadu has made an outstanding contribution in the momentum for India’s economic development with per capita income significantly higher than national average and poverty significantly below, noted the Chairman. There have been excellent record of fiscal management and debt management well within the limits, however, inter district disparities are a worrisome feature and need priority attention.

Tamil Nadu has been traditionally welcoming the private and foreign investment which makes TN an imp engine of Indian growth. Commission also noted the policy imperatives by the state govt for enhancing Ease of Doing Business which has also helped in creating jobs.

Other issues which were discussed during meeting to take growth momentum of TN further while reducing disparities

1.        Floods management system

2.        Improving productivity of agriculture

3.        Imp flood erosion works and paucity of resources for management of water resources

Commission has taken serious note of all the submissions made in the memorandum submitted and discussed and assured TN govt that to ensure that gains that tn has achieved is further strengthened so that tn continues to play the imp role which it has played as an imp engine in india’s economic growth and creating a catalytic effect by attaracting foreign investment.

The Commission noted all the suggestions made by the State Govt. with respect to higher vertical devolution and different weightage for horizontal devolution. In particular, the way calibration is done for the geographical areas, forest areas, environment and high density of tribal population. Commission recognised that it requires sympathetic treatment by the Finance Commission and to come up with solutions in terms of combining the virtues of rewarding efficiency and equity along with consideration to special needs of states like Jharkhand.

Chief Minister urges the Commission for a flexible Debt/GSDP norm

   Chief Minister Shri E. Palanisamy in his welcome remarks highlighted the growth momentum in the State. He reminded the Commission about the declining share of the state in the devolution share since 10th Finance Commission. He urged the Commission to reverse this trend so that development efforts of the state do not stifle.

State govt officials in their presentation gave some innovative suggestions on vertical and horizontal devolutions. They demanded to include the population control and contribution to central taxes as criteria. They also suggested using ‘Environmental Performance Index’ which is a more holistic approach. They made some state specific suggestions related to Conservation of heritage buildings and Maintenance and strengthening of tourist circuits.

State govt also highlighted the issues related to Centrally Sponsored Schemes. They urged that Debt to GSDP norms should be customized to the rate of interest and rate of growth and not fixed rigidly in a doctrinaire fashion.

The Chief Minister submitted a detailed Memorandum to the Commission. The Chairman complemented the Govt. of Tamil Nadu for making an analytical presentation and stated that the issues raised would receive appropriate consideration during deliberations in the Commission.

15th Finance Commission which is on a 3 day visit to Tamil Nadu also sought views of the representatives from various political parties, local bodies and trade and industry. Yesterday, Commission also held enriching interaction with economists in Chennai.

Commission appreciated the warm hospitality extended by the State Govt. The Commission also looked forward to continuing interaction with the State Government based on today’s meaningful discussion. The Commission will finalise its recommendations by October 2019 after completing its discussions with all the State Governments, the Government of India and relevant stakeholders.

                In a major boost to pro-people and pro-poor initiatives, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in its meeting held on 5.9.2018 has approved the continuation of National Mission for Financial Inclusion - Pradhan Mantri JanDhan Yojana (PMJDY) with the following changes:-

 


	The National Mission for Financial Inclusion (PMJDY) to continue beyond 14.8.2018


 


	Existing Over Draft (OD) limit of Rs 5,000 to be raised to Rs 10,000. 


 


	There will not be any conditions attached for OD upto Rs 2,000.


 


	Age limit for availing OD facility to be revised from 18-60 years to 18-65 years.


 


	Under the expanded coverage from ""every household to every adult"", accidental insurance cover for new RuPay card holders to be raised from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh to new PMJDY accounts opened after 28.8.18.


 

Impact:

 

          The continuation of the Mission would enable all adults/households of the country to have atleast a basic bank account with access to other financial services, social security schemes and overdraft upto Rs. 10,000.  It will, thus, bring them into the mainstream of financial services and will facilitate transfer of benefits of various subsidy schemes of the Government more efficiently.

 

Achievements under PMJDY:

 


	Approx. 32.41 crore Jan Dhan accounts have been opened with more than Rs 81,200 crore of deposit balance. 


 


	53% women Jan Dhan account holders and 59% Jan Dhan accounts are in rural and semi urban areas. More than 83% operative Jan Dhan accounts (except states of Assam,Meghalaya, J&K) are Aadhaar seeded, with issuance of approx 24.4 crore RuPay cards to these account holders.


 


	More than 7.5 crore JanDhan accounts receiving DBTs. 


 


	Banking Correspondents (BCs) have been deployed in 1.26 lakh Sub Service Areas (rural areas), each catering to 1000-1500 households.  Nearly 13.16 crore Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) transactions have taken place through BCs during the month of July, 2018.


 


	13.98 crore subscribers under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) with 19,436 claims, involving an amount of Rs, 388.72 crore settled so far. 


 


	Similarly, 5.47 crore subscribers under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) with 1.10 lakh claims, involving an amount of Rs. 2206.28 crore settled so far.


 


	1.11 crore persons have subscribed for Atal Pension Yojana (APY).


 

A pipeline has been created for the implementation of PMJDY through which JanDhan accounts and mobile banking have been linked to Aadhaar (JAM). This pipeline is not only facilitating savings, disbursal of credit, social security, etc. but more importantly channelizing direct benefits of various government schemes to poor people of the country through DBT.

 

It has been decided to continue the flagship financial inclusion program (PMJDY), with focus on opening accounts from ""every household to every adult"".  The pipeline of JanDhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) will continue to provide the necessary backbone for coverage of these activities and thereby accelerating the pace of digitized, financially included & insured society.

 

Background:

 

          With a view to increase banking penetration, promote financial inclusion and to provide at least one bank account per household across the country, a National Mission on Financial Inclusion known as Pradhan Mantri JanDhan Yojana (PMJDY) was announced by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in his Independence Day Speech on 15th August, 2014.  The scheme was formally launched on 28th August, 2014 at National level by the Prime Minister

                Ahead of its meeting with the Govt. of Tamil Nadu, Finance Commission held its third consultation with the leading economists of the region in Chennai today which was attended by 11 eminent economists and domain experts. Commission was greatly enriched by the interaction and the discussions with domain experts and economists in understanding some necessary assumptions which are necessary for the Commission to come up with appropriate recommendation, said Chairman of the XV Finance Commission, Dr. N.K.Singh interacting with the media here. Some suggestions which came out of the meeting include the variables which need to be kept into account for estimating the nominal GDP, inflation on real GDP growth, risks and challenges which lie ahead in making projections for the period from 2020-2025, the award period for the Finance Commission, he added. 

Commission also received suggestions on how to strengthen the framework to tackle global warming and climate change and its consequences on environment and treating that issue in broader sense like in adaptation and coastal erosion. Economists pointed out that for better disaster management owing to climate change and otherwise also, more investment in adaptation strategies will be helpful rather than focusing on mitigation only which is the trend at present. They highlighted the need of a broader perspective of ecological preservation rather than simply forest cover. 

Apart from this, other issues deliberated upon were inter district disparities, unplanned urbanization and resulting migration, disparity in the fund flow between rural and urban local bodies, issue of Centrally Sponsored Schemes and revival of local water bodies through water technologies for better water management.

The Chairman appraised the gathering about the peculiarities about the present Commission which are mainly due to abolition of Planning Commission, introduction of GST and the whole gamut of CSS which will affect the vertical devolution. Chairman said that more such interactions will continue and thanked Madras School of Economics for coordinating this meet. First meeting with economists and domain experts was held in New Delhi in May, 2018 which deliberated upon various issues related to its TOR. Second meeting was held in Pune in August 2018.

Earlier during the day, Commission met the representatives of various political parties, trade and industry and local bodies. All major national and regional parties attended. They urged the commission not to penalize the performing states like Tamil Nadu on which Chairman reaffirmed commission’s even handed approach vis a vis states and the centre. Industry representatives raised issues related to land acquisition, water availability for industry and agriculture and grid development for Green energy.

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is inquiring into a matter (Case No. 77 of 2015) for alleged violation of provisions of Section 3 and 4 of the Competition Act, 2002 relating to imposition of unfair prices by private super-speciality hospitals. 

Finding prima facie contravention of the provisions of the Act, the Commission referred the matter to the Director General (DG) for investigation. Pursuant to the aforesaid order of the Commission, the DG submitted the investigation report.

After perusing the material on record, the Commission noted that huge profit margins are being earned by sale of products to the locked-in in-patients to the detriment of such patients. Considering the mandate given to the Commission to eliminate the practices having adverse effect on competition and to protect the interest of consumers, the Commission decided to widen the scope of investigation to cover the practices of super specialty hospitals across Delhi in respect of healthcare products and services provided to their in-patients. Investigation will focus on the products sold by the super specialty hospitals to their in-patients which are not required on an urgent basis for any medical procedure / intervention or which do not involve any high degree of quality issue from the medical procedure point of view and for the purchase of which the patients have the time and scope to exercise their rational choice to purchase such products from open market where such products may be available at lower rates. The Commission has directed the DG to complete investigation expeditiously. 

By broadening the scope of investigation in the matter, the Commission aims to prevent practices having adverse effect on competition in the tertiary healthcare sector.  

A copy of the order of the Commission passed in Case No. 77 of 2015 has been uploaded on the website of the Commission at www.cci.gov.in.

Background: 

Inter district disparity in PCI, GST Collections, declining growth of Own tax revenue and capital expenditure remain concern 

Tamil Nadu has made great strides in its industrial sector development and has emerged as a manufacturing hub. Its contribution to the country’s economic growth is quite impressive and it has shown a great growth potential. The structure of GSDP in Tamil Nadu has been shifting away from agriculture towards industry and services. From 2012-13 to 2016-17, the average share of agriculture and allied sector was 10.9%, industry was 35% and that of services was 54.6%. 

States GDP after a decline in 2015-16 has picked up again, however declining growth rate of own tax revenue in recent years particularly from 2013-14 onwards is a concern. Since 2013-14 due to a combination of factors like slow revenue growth, spurt in exceptional expenditures like UDAY, pay commission award and drastic reduction in central devolution, the State is witnessing Revenue Deficits. Its Capital expenditure is also low. As per RBI study of state budgets, Tamil Nadu is among the highest borrowing states. Its Fiscal deficit stood above 4 % and debt to GDP ratio stands at 22.31% in 2016-17.  Commission will also look into the issues relates to GST collections. Power sector is not fully unbundled in the state. Commission will try to understand the issues related to the implementation of UDAY scheme. 

Though Tamil Nadu has done well in economic uplift of the people, Inter district disparity in per capita income (PCI) is evident. 18 out of 32 districts are having lower PCI than the state average PCI (Rs. 1,54,375 in 2015-16). Per capita income of the top ranked district is about 2.8 times larger than that of the poorest district. Poverty in Tamil Nadu is lower than many states of the country, parts of Tamil Nadu are having high poverty. State intervention is resulting in fast decline in poverty ratios, nearly all of this reduction in the number of families below poverty line comes from rural areas.

Tamil Nadu is one of most urbanised states which throws up the challenges related to urbanization, migration, slums and urban poverty. State has achieved replacement level of population growth therefore increasing population of elderly is a concern. This unique combination of demography and urbanization needs a specific strategy in public expenditure and investment in critical areas in the coming decade if it is to attain its growth potential and provide a model for the rest of India.

State is doing well on many social parameters like Sex Ratio, institutional delivery, IMR, MMR etc. However, NFHS -4 shows a higher percentage of Anaemia among women and children than All India percentage. In education sector, state is depicting weak learning outcomes as per ASER 2016-17 report, despite having high literacy rates. State has done well in the democratic decentralization to the third tier. 5th State Finance Commission recommendations (2016) are under implementation. 

State govt. has also submitted a detailed memorandum to the Commission for consideration. Commission expects to gain an in-depth understanding of the peculiar issue related to the economic growth and development in Tamil Nadu during its interactions and meetings with the state govt.

                The total gross GST revenue collected in the month of August, 2018 is Rs. 93,960crore of which CGST is Rs. 15,303 crore, SGST is Rs. 21,154 crore, IGST is Rs. 49,876 crore (including Rs. 26,512 crore collected on imports) and Cess is Rs. 7,628 crore (including Rs. 849 crore collected on imports). The total number of GSTR 3B Returns filed for the month of July up to 31st August, 2018 is 67 lakh. This is slightly higher than 66 lakh returns of the month of June filed up to 31st July, 2018. The last date of filing return of July, 2018 in the State of Kerala was extended upto 5th October, 2018.

The total revenue earned by Central Government and the State Governments after settlement including provisional settlement of Rs. 12,000 crore in the month of August, 2018 is Rs. 36,963 crore for CGST and Rs. 41,136 crore for the SGST. For the bi-monthly period June-July, 2018, compensation of Rs. 14,930 crore has been released to the States.

The revenues collected in August, 2018 of Rs. 93,960 crore is slightly lower than July, 2018 collection of Rs. 96,483 crore, and June, 2018 collection of Rs. 95,610 crore. The chart shows trends in revenue during the current year.

One of the main factors for the dip in tax revenues is probable postponement of sale of items for which tax rate was reduced by the Council as the decision to reduce the tax rate was taken in meeting held on 21st July while the notification of the reduced rate came into effect only from 27th July, 2018. Since it would have taken some time for the market to pass on the benefit of reduced taxes, consumers would have postponed their decision to buy expecting the benefit. The actual impact of reduction of rate of taxes would be observed only from next month onwards as the rate reduction would have got affected only in last few days of the month.

Even past trend of indirect tax collection shows that while July collections are 8.2% of the total annual collections, August collections are at a lower level of 7.7% of the total annual collections. This is another reason for lower collections during the month of August as compared to that in July.

                There has been a marked improvement in the number of Income Tax Returns(ITRs) filed during FY 2018 (upto 31/08/2018, the extended due date of filing) compared to the corresponding period in the preceding year. The total number of ITRs e-filed upto 31/08/2018 was 5.42 crore as against 3.17 crore upto 31/08/2017, marking an 

increase of 70.86%. Almost 34.95 lakh returns were uploaded on 31/08/2018 itself, being the last date of the extended due date of filing of ITRs.

A remarkable increase is seen in the number of ITRs in 2 categories ie ITRs filed by salaried Individuals (ITR-1& 2) as also those availing the benefit of the Presumptive Taxation Scheme(ITR-4).

The total number of e-returns of salaried Individual taxpayers filed till 31/08/2018 increased to 3.37 crore from 2.19 crore returns filed during the corresponding period of 2017, registering an increase of 1.18 crore returns translating into a growth of almost 54%. 

A stupendous growth has been witnessed in the number of returns e-filed by persons availing the benefit of Presumptive Tax, with 1.17 crore returns having been filed upto 31st August, 2018 compared to 14.93 lakh returns upto 31st August, 2017 

registering a massive increase of 681.69%.

The increase in the number of returns reveals a marked improvement in the level of voluntary compliance of taxpayers which can be attributed to several factors, including the impact of demonetisation, enhanced persuasion & education of taxpayers as also the impending provision of late fee which would be effective on late filing of 

returns. This is indicative of an India moving steadily towards a more tax compliant society & reflects the impact of continuous leveraging of technology to improve taxpayer service delivery.

                “Our goal continues to be to achieve the vision of universal access to quality diagnosis and treatment for TB and address the social determinants of TB through a multi-sectoral response.”This was stated by Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare during his address at the ‘High Level Meeting on Tuberculosis at 73rd session of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at New York’. Shri J P Nadda further said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji has shown personal commitment to tackle TB head-on as India plans to eliminate TB by 2025, five years ahead of the SDG target of 2030, by launching the TB Free India Campaign.“We have adopted a patient-centred and community-based model to end TB,” the Union Health Minister further emphasized.

In his address, Shri Nadda said that India’s National Health Policy 2017 clearly articulates the vision of a TB free India. “To implement this vision, a National Strategic Plan has been made operational,”Shri Nadda added. He stated India has allocated US$ 430 million for implementation of the Plan in the current year, which is an increase of 54% over last year. Shri Nadda informed the delegates that India is making innovative use of digital technology in monitoring and notification of TB cases. “We are also engaging with private sector care providers to improve access to TB care,” ShriNadda said. 

The Union Health Minister cautioned that chronic underfunding of TB research and development is one of the reasons why TB still remains a challenge. “Equitable access to medicines, diagnostic tools and technologies remains a concern. We must address all barriers to access to medicines and to new technologies, including through use of flexibility provisions in WTO TRIPS Agreement and the Doha Declaration,” Shri Nadda elaborated.

“New partnerships need to be forged to eliminate TB. Successful development of rapid molecular TB tests by using indigenous, affordable technology and new digital X-Ray technology herald the potential that India holds to the future of TB research,” Shri Nadda stated. He further added that India has established its own TB research consortium to accelerate research efforts in TB. The launch of the BRICS TB Research Network is also a promising opportunity.

                “I heartily welcome the Ordinance to supersede the Medical Council of India (MCI), that was cleared today. This will strengthen medical education in the country”, stated Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare Shri J P Nadda, today. He said that “The powers of the Council have been vested in a Board of Governors (BoG). It is expected that the BoG will bring about urgent and much required reforms in the field of medical education.” Further he added: “I am happy that professionals of great eminence, who were earlier part of the Oversight Committee formed by Hon. Supreme Court, will constitute the BoG and I am sure they will work towards enhancing access to quality healthcare for all.”

The Health Minister stated that the Government of India has been committed to improving health care of all, particularly the poor and deprived sections. The country has faced several challenges in health sector: high levels of out of pocket expenditure and catastrophic expenditure that impoverished people due toinadequate public health infrastructure andlimited access and coverage of essential and life-saving interventions. During the last four years, several measures have been taken to systematically address these challenges.

Shri Nadda stated that to enable holistic health care to our citizens with focus on poor and vulnerable, we have launched the ambitious Ayushman Bharat, with its twin pillars of comprehensive primary health care through Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) and the PM-JAY.  “By 2022 we will create over 1,50,000 Health and Wellness Centres so that primary health care including prevention and health promotion is universal, accessible and equitable”, he elaborated.

The PM-JAY enables financial protection to 10.74 crore vulnerable families (about 50 crore individuals), covering nearly 40% of our people, with an annual benefit cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family. 31 states have already signed the MOU and 26 states have already started implementing it. 

Over 2,300 HWCs are already operational across the country and 15,000 will be operational before the end of the year.

The Health Minister said that on the policy front, the Government launched the National Health Policy in 2017, fifteen years after the last policy in 2002 that reflects our vision to improve health status through concerted policy action in all sectors and expand preventive, promotive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services with a focus on health care needs of the poor and disadvantaged.

Despite several path-breaking efforts and initiatives, the country’s march to achieving the Universal Health Coverage and other targets of Sustainable Development Goals and National Health Policy is constrained on account of inadequate number of qualified health care professionals due to slow pace of commensurate reforms in Medical Education.

For years poor people have to travel from far of places to Delhi for getting tertiary care facility at AIIMS. Priority of the government is to expand quality tertiary health care facilities in all parts of the country.With announcement of 14 new AIIMS over the past 4 years, the total number of AIIMS will go upto 22. Further, super specialty Blocks are being set up in 54 medical colleges at a cost of around Rs 9,000 crores. 

To improve availability of tertiary care and expand access to medical education in underserved areas, the GOI is setting up a network of medical colleges all over the country. 82 new Medical Colleges costing Rs 16,000 crores are being set up under a centrally sponsored scheme to ensure that there is at least one college for every three parliamentary constituencies.

Shri Nadda said that the ambitious programmes and policies of health care could not be made a reality without ensuring availability of required number of qualified doctors and other health care professionals. Realizing this need, the Government has attempted to bring about reforms in medical education. 

Based on the 92nd Report of March, 2016 of the Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health & Family Welfare and recommendations of a Group of Experts under late Professor Ranjit Roy Chaudhary, the Government introduced the National Medical Commission Bill, 2017 in Lok Sabha on 29.12.2017. 

The Bill provides for simplification of procedures and is expected to spur rapid growth in the number of UG and PG seats in the country besides enhancing the governance and quality of medical education. The NMC Bill provides for distribution of functions among four autonomous boards whose members would be persons of proven ability selected through a transparent process.

The Bill was taken up for consideration on 02.01.2018 and was referred to Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health & Family Welfare for examination. The Parliamentary Standing Committee presented its 109th Report on the Bill to the House on 20.03.2018. The Ministry after examining the recommendations obtained approval of the Cabinet on 28.03.2018 for moving official amendments. Thereafter, the Bill is pending in the Lok Sabha.

Meanwhile, Hon’ble Supreme Court in its judgment dated 02.05.2016 issued directions to the Central Government to constitute an Oversight Committee with the authority to oversee all statutory functions of MCI till a new legislation comes in.

In 2017, another Oversight Committee (OC) was set up with the approval of the Supreme Court after expiry of the one year term of the first OC. This OC was chaired by Dr V K Paul and included eminent doctors including Directors of AIIMS Delhi, PGI Chandigarh, NIMHANS.

On 6th July 2018, OC cited instances of non-compliance of their instructions by MCI and said that MCI has not only misinterpreted orders of the Supreme Court but has also challenged the authority of OC. Subsequently all members of OC have resigned.

In such circumstances when the Supreme Court mandated Oversight Committee is unable to function due to non-cooperation of MCI and the NMC Bill is pending in Parliament and its passage is likely to take some time, certain immediate steps are required to be taken. Accordingly, an ordinance to supersede the MCI has been promulgated and the powers of the council have been vested in a Board of Governors (BoG). The BoG will continue to perform till a Council is constituted as per the provision of the Act in one year time. It may be recalled that a Board of Governors was also appointed in 2010.

Now, the Government has appointed the Board of Governors in supersession of MCI.The Board members include persons of eminence in the medical field namely Dr. V K Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, Dr. Randeep Guleria, Director, AIIMS, New Delhi, Dr. Jagat Ram, Director, PGIMER, Chandigarh, Dr. B N Gangadhar, Director, NIMHANS, Bangalore, Dr. Nikhil Tandon, Professor, Department of Endocrinology & Metabolism, AIIMS, New Delhi who were the members of second OC. Dr. S. Venkatesh, DGHS and Prof.Balram Bhargava, Secretary, DHR & Director General ICMR will be the ex-officio members. 

All the BoG members are eminently qualified and apolitical. Further, five of the seven members were the members of the Supreme Court appointed Oversight Committee. It is expected that the BoG will bring about urgent and the much required reforms in the field of medical education and promote access to quality healthcare for all the people of India, Shri Nadda said.

Under the vision of Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Jan AarogyaYojana (AB-PMJAY) shall be implemented so that each and every citizen receives his due share of health care. With Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan AarogyaYojana, the government is taking healthcare protection to a new aspirational level. This is the “world’s largest government funded healthcare program” targeting more than 50 crore beneficiaries.

	Over 10.74 crore vulnerable entitled families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) will be eligible for these benefits. 


 


	PMJAY will provide cashless and paperless access to services for the beneficiary at the point of service. 


 


	PMJAY will help reduce catastrophic expenditure for hospitalizations, which impoverishes people and will help mitigate the financial risk arising out of catastrophic health episodes. 


 


	Entitled families will be able to use the quality health services they need without facing financial hardships. 


 


	When fully implemented, PMJAY will become the world’s largest fully government-financed health protection scheme. It is a visionary step towards advancing the agenda of Universal Health Coverage (UHC).


 

FEATURES OF THE SCHEME

It adopts a continuum of care approach, comprising of two inter-related components: Creation of 1,50,000 Health and Wellness Centres which will bring health care closer to the homes of the people. 

 

These centres will provide Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC), covering both maternal and child health services and non-communicable diseases, including free essential drugs and diagnostic services. The first Health and Wellness Centre was launched by the Prime Minister at Jangla, Bijapur, Chhatisgarh on 14th April 2018. 

 

The second component is the Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana (PMJAY) which provides health protection cover to poor and vulnerable families for secondary and tertiary care. 

 

The Health and Wellness Centres will play a critical role in creating awareness about PMJAY, screening for non-communicable diseases, follow-up of hospitalization cases among others. The features of the scheme are as follows.

 

 

Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana: Financial protection from catastrophic expenditure:


	71st Round of National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) has found 85.9% of rural households and 82% of urban households have no access to healthcare insurance/assurance. More than 17% of Indian population spend at least 10% of household budgets for health services. Catastrophic healthcare related expenditure pushes families into debt, with more than 24% households in rural India and 18% population in urban area have met their healthcare expenses through some sort of borrowings. 


 


	PMJAY primarily targets the poor, deprived rural families and identified occupational category of urban workers’ families as per the latest Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) data for both rural and urban areas as well as the active families under the RashtriyaSwasthyaBimaYojana (RSBY). 


 


	Approximately 10.74 crore identified families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) will be entitled to get the benefits. There is no cap on family size and age as well as restriction on pre-existing conditions.


 

Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana: Hospitalization cover from inpatient care to post hospitalisation care:

 


	The objectives of the Yojana are to reduce out of pocket hospitalisation expenses, fulfil unmet needs and improve access of identified families to quality inpatient care and day care surgeries. 


 


	The Yojana will provide a coverage up to Rs. 5,00,000 per family per year, for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization through a network of Empanelled Health Care Providers (EHCP). 


 


	The EHCP network will provide cashless and paperless access to services for the beneficiaries at the both public and private hospitals. 


 


	The services will include 1350 procedures covering pre and post hospitalization, diagnostics, medicines etc. 


 


	The Yojana beneficiaries will be able to move across borders and access services across the country through the provider network seamlessly.


 

Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana in alliance with the States:

 


	The scheme architecture and formulation has undergone a truly federal process, with stakeholder inputs taken from all States and UTs through the national conclaves, sectoral working groups, intensive field exercises and piloting of key modules. 


 


	The Scheme is principle based rather than rule based, allowing States enough flexibility in terms of packages, procedures, scheme design, entitlements as well as other guidelines while ensuring that key benefits of portability and fraud detection are ensured at a national level. 


 


	States have the option to use an existing Trust/Society or set up a new Trust/Society to implement the Scheme as State Health Agency and will be free to choose the modalities for implementation. 


 


	States can implement the Scheme through an insurance company or directly through the Trust/Society/Implementation Support Agency or a mixed approach. 


 

PROGRESS OF THE SCHEME:

 

MOUs with the states: 30 states and UTs have signed the MoU and have started working on implementation of the mission. Maharashtra has joined on 14th August 2018. MoU has been signed with Tamil Nadu on 11th September 2018.

 

Pilot launch of PMJAY: 

 

Pilot launch of the scheme has started. The focus of the pilot launch of the mission is to test and enhance the developed IT systems and streamline the state preparedness for a comprehensive launch. 

 

The pilot been done in around 22 States / UTs (Arunachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Dadar Nagar & Haveli, Daman & Diu, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Goa, Maharashtra among others). 

 

The pilot launch is taking place in specific hospitals to test the Beneficiary Identification System (BIS) and Transaction Management System (TMS) systems. 

 

The pilot launch involves over 1280 hospitals. 

 

Pradhan MantriAarogyaMitra (PMAM):

 


	The scheme is creating a cadre of certified frontline health service professionals called Pradhan MantriAarogyaMitras (PMAMs) who will be primary point of facilitation for the beneficiaries to avail treatment at the hospital and thus, act as a support system to streamline health service delivery. 


 


	MoU was signed between National Health Agency and Ministry of Skills Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) on 27th August 2018 in New Delhi. 


 


	AarogyaMitras training is being conducted in collaboration with National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Ministry of Skill Development to strengthen implementation and operational preparedness. 


 


	Training has already been conducted in across 20 states and around 3519 AarogyaMitras have been trained so far. Training programs for State, District and PMAMs have been conducted in 27 states. 


 


	A total of around 3936 personnel have been trained at state, district and PMAM levels.


 

Hospital Empanelment:

 

So far 15,686 applications for hospital empanelment have been received.

 

 

Fraud detection and Data privacy:

 


	Detailed guidelines have been prepared to address the issues around potential fraudulent activities that could be committed by any individual or organization. 


 


	Anti-fraud cells will be established at the national and state level, and strong IT tools will be deployed to prevent and detect fraud. 


 


	NHA Information Security Policy & Data Privacy Policy are being institutionalized to provide adequate guidance and set of controls on the secure handling of Beneficiaries Personal Data & Sensitive Personal Data in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable. International standards/regulation, like ISO 27001, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); and Indian regulations such as Aadhaar Act 2016, Indian IT Act 2000, IT (amendment) Act, 2008 and Personal Data Protection Bill by former judge BN Sri Krishnan (Yet to be enacted) are referenced while drafting these policies.


 

IT systems update:

 


	Beneficiary Identification System (BIS) has been developed to identify and verify the beneficiaries at CSCs and point of care. 


 


	NHA has tested the software in 80 districts across 10 states and further enhanced the system based on feedback. 


 


	Hospital empanelment module has been active from 4th July and has already received empanelment requests from over 7,857 hospitals across 354 districts in 22 States / UTs. A comprehensive 


 


	Transaction Management System (TMS) has been developed to facilitate transactions from hospitals (such as filing pre-authorization requests and claims submission). 


 


	There have been trainings across the state concerning the operability of IT systems to enhance the state preparedness and receive feedback on the IT systems. 


 


	Focused workshops have been organized to train the state level officials in operating the developed IT systems. 


 


	Robust measures are being put in place in the IT platform to ensure privacy and security of the data.


 

Beneficiary related: 

 


	MoU has been signed with Common Service Centre (CSC) for Beneficiary Identification and will utilize the over 3 lakh village level entrepreneurs for identifying beneficiaries. 


 


	Personalized Letters with unique family code are in the process of being sent to the identified families in the Additional Data Collection Data (ADCD) drive. This will drive awareness among the beneficiaries and further ease the identification process when they visit points of care or CSC centres. 


 

Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan AarogyaYojana (AB-PMJAY) is a paradigm shift from sectorial, segmented and fragmented approach of service delivery through various national and State schemes to a bigger, more comprehensive and better converged and need based service delivery of secondary and tertiary care.

                The Hon’ble Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu today addressed the 19thConvocation of National Board of Examinations (NBE), an autonomous body of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, in presence of Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey and SmtAnupriya Patel, Ministers of State for Health and Family Welfare. At the convocation ceremony, 306 doctors received the Gold Medal in their respective specialty and 61 medical teachers werehonored for their exemplary work in the field of modern medicine. NBE also conferred degrees to 20,534 Post Graduates doctors.

Addressing the participants, the Vice President of India stated that as medical scientists, epidemiologists and clinicians, they must continue their experiments with truth and extend the frontiers of scientific and medical knowledge. The Vice President advised the doctors to always be observant and curious and develop intrinsic virtues of inquiry, exploration, analysis, discussion, patience, tolerance, humanism and an inclusive outlook. “It is these qualities which shall take you far,” he said.

In his address, the Vice President further stated that as doctors, you have an unprecedented opportunity to serve and be a part of this inclusive growth that India is aiming for with sharp focus on cleanliness and affordable healthcare. “We must find ways and means to ensure that every citizen benefits from the advancements in medicine” he added. The Vice President urged the doctors to serve in rural areas.

Congratulating the students,Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State forHealth and Family Welfare said that the students graduating today must not stop learning and should always enhance their skills and knowledge. They must not also forget their responsibility towards the society and the patients they are treating. “The main aim of your training is to serve people and poverty should never come in between. The advice you give to your patients should not result in destitution. No person should be left without treatment due to lack of money,” Shri Choubey said.

Highlighting the initiatives of the Ministry, Shri Choubeystated thatAyushman Bharat programme is aimed at making path breaking interventions to address health holistically, covering both prevention and health promotion components. Under this 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres will bring healthcare system closer to the homes of people. These centres will provide comprehensive primary health care, including that for non-communicable diseases and maternal and child health services. ShriChoubey further stated that the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana (PMJAY) will be launched by Honorable Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi on 23rd September from Jharkhand and will cover over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families (more than 50 crore beneficiaries) providing coverage upto 5 lakh rupees per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. 

Speaking at the function, SmtAnupriya Patel,Minister of State forHealth and Family Welfare stated that for those who are getting their degrees, the challenges of life have just begun and nobody knows in what manner the challenges will unfold. She further added that from a protected atmosphere of being a student and always being worked under supervision, you will enter into a world where you will be expected to work and take decisions independently and will be fully liable for your actions. “It is here that your knowledge and skills coupled with experience of the learned seniors will guide you to make a remarkable impact on the society and achieve success in true means,” she said.

SmtAnupriya Patel further said that we need to focus on providing adequate number of healthcare service providers through capacity building without affecting the quality of the healthcare services. To achieve this objective, we need teachers to train the human resource in healthcare delivery. “The government has taken several steps on this from by increasing the number of medical colleges, introduction of NEET at all levels to get rid of multiple entrance exams and to ensure greater transparency”, she elaborated.

NBE is a key organization of Health Ministry which was setup in 1982 with the prime objective of conducting uniform and high standard examinations in the field modern medicine and provides trained manpower in the form of medical specialists to the country.

NBE is credited with conducting maximum and largest number of examinations for Graduate and Post Graduate Doctors. NBE has been entrusted with task of conducting National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test – Post Graduate (NEET-PG) and NEET-SS which are the only examinations for admission to Broad and Super Specialty Medical courses respectively. NBE is also a nodal agency for conducting the licensing examination for Indian Citizens who have obtained their MBBS equivalent outside India.

NBE has been providing more than 8000 specialists in modern medicine every year utilizing the existing infrastructure of Private and Government Hospitals. NBE has pioneered starting of Post Graduate courses in district hospitals of the country.

Smt. Anupriya Patel further said that this ambitious program of reaching out to such large target group cannot be successfully implemented without a strong IT backbone. She lauded Dell for the development of the technology platform and Tata Trusts for the implementation support of the NCD programme and added that this software application will help in plugging gaps at the field level.

Non-Communicable Disease (NCD screening program addresses Hypertension, Diabetes, Oral, Breast and Cervical cancers and covers all men and women over the age of30 years. The programme, which is one of the modules in Ayushman Bharat’s Comprehensive Primary Healthcare (CPHC) Initiative, is currently being deployed in about 200 districts across the country. Through implementation of the software, it will also be possible to track health trends across the country.

Aimed at bringing healthcare technology transformation in Comprehensive Primary Health Care NCD program under Ayushman Bharat, the Health Ministry is working with Dell as technology partner and the Tata Trusts as deployment partner. A cloud-based mobile, web and analytics solution has been developed to digitize health records to aid the population-based screening program, to bring quality health services at door step, to enable increased productivity for health workers and doctors, and to facilitate monitoring of delivery of services by state and district administrators. 

This technology solution has been developed by Dell, through Dell Giving, Dell’s CSR program, and in collaboration with reputed institutions and experts from AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences),  DGHS (Directorate General of Health Services), WHO (World Health Organization) India, ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research), NHSRC (National Health Systems Resource Center), NICPR (National Institute of Cancer Prevention Research), Tata Trusts, NIC (National Informatics Center), (CHI) Center for Health Informatics, and IndiaStack team at iSPIRT and State Health Departments. The technology solution is hosted on a Government Data Center and managed by Centre for Health Informatics, MoHFW. 

The Tata Trusts are supporting the quality implementation of the programme in States through training, and programme management activities to ensure technology adoption amongst health staff and steady progress through continuous monitoring. Through the Trusts’ trained and skilled personnel on the field, health workers, doctors and local administrators have ready access to support and guidance on challenges they may face adopting the IT solution. The NCD IT solution covers program-level data for screening, referral, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up activities of non-communicable diseases with an aim to connect health workers, doctors and decision-makers in a single, integrated platform. It will provide health records for citizens, mobile applications for health workers, a web portal for the medical officers and dashboards for health officials.

Harpreet Singh, Post Master General (M& BD), and Dr. KS Sachdeva, DDG TB.

A significant proportion of patients are not tested becausethe specimen does not reach the laboratory due to non-availability ofspecimen transportmechanisms.Transport of collected specimen also spares the patient’s from travelling to the reference laboratory. Prompt transport of specimen followed by efficacious testing will enable appropriate management of the TB patients and reduced disease transmission.

The learning from Delhi Pilot experience will be useful for adaptation of specimen transport mechanism throughthe Postal Department across the country.

The web-based application of RNTCP, Nikshay Version 2.0 with better user interface and data structures, was also launched during the event.Mobile app for all major functions on Nikshay,is available on Google Play for download. The web-application is also designed to be mobile friendly, enabling data entry also from the mobile browser.

                Encouraged by the achievements of Kayakalp Scheme, National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH) has decided to consider assessment of healthcare facilities in the private sector on the lines of parameters of Kayakalp Scheme. This is also an initiative as part of the Swachchta hi Sewa cleanliness and sanitation campaign being undertaken across various parts of the country.

Cleanliness and hygiene in hospitals besides being critical for preventing infections also provide the patients and visitors with a positive experience and encourages moulding behaviour related to cleanliness and sanitation at their homes and work-place. Clean & bright environment where patients are received with dignity & respect, along with delivery of prompt care go a long way in promoting faster healing and enhanced satisfaction of patients. To complement this effort, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India has launched “Kayakalp” in the year 2015 with initiative to recognise such efforts under ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan’. 

            With above initiative of the Government, the Healthcare Facilities in the Public sector have been competing with each other to attain highest levels of cleanliness and hygiene in their respective facilities. The initiative has resulted in bringing significant improvement in the sanitation and hygiene, patient satisfaction, behavioural change in the staff & employees of the Hospitals/Institutions, patients and their attendants towards cleanliness.  Public perception towards cleanliness & hygiene in public healthcare facilities has also been changing. Besides, public healthcare facilities have also given focused attention on promoting activities like Green Initiatives to reduce carbon footprint by encouraging Public Sector Hospitals to undertake Energy Conservation, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, horticulture & landscaping, optimal skill based training of sanitation employees and capacity building, celebration of Swachhta Pakhwada, Swachhta hi Sewa Campaign across all the public sector health care facilities every year. The Health Ministry will recognise the outstanding work done by the private hospitals on an annual basis.

                Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare inaugurated the two-day National Dissemination Workshop on Anemia Mukt Bharat and Home-Based Young Child Care(HBYC), here today. Dr V K Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog was also present at the inaugural function. The objective of this workshop is to orient the state program managers for rolling out these interventions. 

Speaking at the function, Shri Choubey stated that under the dynamic leadership of the Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, we are here to witness the beginning of two significant programmes, the Anemia Mukt Bharat and Home-based Young Child Care. “Both of these programmes are our commitment to the ‘PoshanAbhiyaan’ in improving the nutritional outcomes in this population,” ShriChoubey added.

Highlighting the achievements of the Health Ministry, Shri Choubey said that India has taken huge strides in reducing Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) and achieving MDGs and with these initiatives we will be addressing the burden of anemia and under-nutrition among children in the country. “With an average prevalence of 40 percent across all age groups, anemia still is a challenge which needs attention,” he said. Shri Choubey appealed to create a ‘Jan Andolan’ for nutrition and contribute to this hard-work of ensuring survival and healthy development of every new-born of future India.

At the function, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey also released the Toolkit for Anemia Mukt Bharat & Home-Based care for Young Child programmes.

 

Addressing the participants, Dr V K Paul said that under Poshan Abhiyaan, and as part of Anemia Mukt Bharat, we have everything that technically should be there to address Anemia in the country. “These interventions will make a difference. We have ingredients for all that can be done to make sure that no one is left behind,” Dr Paul added.  He further stressed that during the increased contacts/home visitswith the ASHAs, importance should be given to nutrition, including breast feeding, how often a child should be fed (bringing in the concept of energy density) with optimum food, and information and awareness regarding early childhood development.

The Anemia Mukt Bharat- intensified Iron-plus Initiative aims to strengthen the existing mechanisms and foster newer strategies for tackling anemia, focused on six target beneficiary groups, through six interventions and six institutional mechanisms; to achieve the envisaged target under the POSHAN Abhiyan.

The strategy focuses on testing & treatment of anemia in school going adolescents & pregnant women using newer technologies, establishing institutional mechanisms for advanced research in anemia, and a comprehensive communication strategy including mass/mid media communication material. A web-portal anemiamuktbharat.info has also been developed as part of the monitoring mechanism of the strategy, which would provide survey data on anemia across beneficiary groups, target prevalence of anemia as per POSHAN Abhiyan and quarterly HMIS based reporting of programme implementation coverage upto the district level.

The Home-Based Care of Young Child (HBYC) programme has an objective to reduce child mortality and morbidity by improving nutrition status, growth and early childhood development of young children through structured and focused home visits by ASHAs with the support of Anganwadi workers (AWWs). 

The programme is envisaged to be implemented as an extension to the existing HBNC programme and will be rolled out in a phased manner. In the first phase (F.Y 2018-19) the programme will be rolled out in all the identified Aspirational Districts. In the second phase, all the remaining districts under Poshan Abhiyan will be included and in the third phase programme this shall be expanded to cover all the districts in the country. Under the HBYC programme, five additional home visits (in every three months) by ASHAs are proposed after the last visit on 42nd day, as in the existing HBNC programme. Thus, the contact of new-born with the health system is extended till 2nd year of birth. 

ASHA will ensure exclusive breastfeeding till 6 months of life, adequate complementary feeding after 6 months, Iron and Folic Acid supplementation, full immunization of children, regular growth monitoring, appropriate use of ORS, appropriate hand washing practices and age appropriate playing and communication for children during each home visit. 

Dedicated skill building, additional incentives, provision of additional commodities and additional home visits for SNCU discharged & sick-newborns are also included in the programme.

The participants of this workshop include senior officials from key Ministries (MoHFW, MWCD, MHRD, MoTA, MoRD) and State Nodal officers for both the programmes, representatives of various UN agencies and development partners.

                The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) released the report HIV Estimations 2017 at a function, here today. The HIV Estimations 2017 is the 14th round in the series of HIV Estimations under National AIDS Control Programme (NACP). NACO undertakes HIV estimations biennially in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Medical Statistics (NIMS). The first round of HIV estimation in India was done in 1998, while the last round was done in 2015. 

The report highlights the significant achievement of National AIDS response on prevention as well as on treatment front but has also indicated that there is no place for complacency as country move forward on ambitious goal of attaining the ‘End of AIDS’ by 2030. As per the report, in 2017, India had around 21.40 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) with adult prevalence of 0.22%. Around 87.58 thousand new HIV infections and 69.11 thousand AIDS related deaths happened in 2017 while around 22,675 mothers needed Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. HIV Estimations 2017 corroborate the previous rounds in terms of characteristic of the HIV epidemic in India i.e. national prevalence and incidence remains low, but the epidemic is high in some geographical regions and population group. The report has noted that the rate of decline in annual new HIV infections has been relatively slower in recent years. 

The report concludes that, overall, the impact of the programme has been significant with more than 80% decline in estimated new infection from peak of epidemic in 1995. Similarly, estimated AIDS related death declined by 71% since its peak in 2005. As per UNAIDS 2018 report, the global average for decline in new infections and AIDS related deaths from peak has been 47% and 51% respectively. 

 

The objective of HIV Estimations is to provide updated information on the status of HIV epidemic in India at national and State/UT level. Estimations of adult HIV prevalence, annual new infections (HIV incidence), AIDS-related mortality and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) needs are produced as outcomes of HIV estimations. The modelled estimates are needed because there is no direct reliable way of measuring these core indicators which are used to track the epidemic and monitor and evaluate the response in countries around the world.

                Shri Manoj Jhalani, Additional Secretary & Mission Director (NHM), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has been conferred with the prestigious UN Interagency Task Force (UNIATF) Award for his outstanding contribution towards prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and related Sustainable Development Goals.

It is in recognition of Government of India’s efforts made in the field of prevention and control of Non-Communicable Diseases. National Programme to control NCDs has been scaled up by more than eight times in the past four years and covers all the 36 States/Union Territories now. The Government has also initiated population level prevention, control, screening and management initiative in almost 200 districts under NHM which will cover people above 30 years of age. When fully rolled out, the population-based screening will reach over 500 million adults with health promotion, risk reduction, screening, early detection and management of common NCDs. Free diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, referral and back referral have been integrated into the program with an IT platform developed through a multi-stakeholder partnership. The intervention also forms the core of Ayushman Bharat, comprehensive primary health care program.

The risk factors of NCDs are multi-sectoral and many of the interventions to control these lies outside the health sector. A National Multi-sectoral Action Plan has been developed which outlines the interventions for different sectors of the Government and other stakeholders.

This award will be conferred on ShriManojJhalani during the forthcoming Third High-level meeting of the UN General Assembly at the event organized by the Task Force on 27thSeptember to be held atNew York.

The United Nations Interagency Task Force (UNIATF) on the Prevention and Control of NCDs coordinates the activities of relevant UN organizations and other inter-governmental organizations to support Governments to meet high-level commitments to respond to NCD epidemics worldwide. The commitments were made by Heads of State and Government in the 2011 Political Declaration on NCDs. The Task Force was established by the UN Secretary-General in June 2013 and placed under the leadership of WHO.

                The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has prohibited the manufacture for sale, sale or distribution for human use of 328 Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs) with immediate effect. It has also restricted the manufacture, sale or distribution of six FDCs subject to certain conditions. 

Earlier, the Central Government had, through its notifications published on the 10th March, 2016 in the Gazette of India, prohibited the manufacture for sale, sale and distribution for human use of 344 FDCs under section 26 A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Subsequently, the Government had prohibited five more FDCs in addition to the 344 under the same provisions. 

However, the matter was contested by the affected manufacturers in various High Courts and the Supreme Court of India. In compliance with the directions given by the Supreme Court of India in its judgment dated the 15th December, 2017, the matter was examined by the Drugs Technical Advisory Board constituted under section 5 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 which furnished its report on these drugs to the Central Government.The Drugs Technical Advisory Board recommended, amongst other things, that there is no therapeutic justification for the ingredients contained in 328 FDCs and that these FDCs may involve risk to human beings. The Board recommended that it is necessary to prohibit the manufacture, sale or distribution of these FDCs under section 26 A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 in the larger public interest. With regard to six FDCs, the Board recommended that their manufacture, sale and distribution be restricted subject to certain conditions based on their therapeutic justification. Fifteen FDCs out of the 344 prohibited on the 10th March, 2016, which were claimed to be manufactured prior to 21stSeptember, 1988, have been kept out of the purview of current notifications. 

Earlier, an Expert Committee appointed by the Central Government had also examined these FDCs and made recommendations in line with those of the Board as indicated above. 

The Central Government considered the recommendations of the Expert Committee and Drugs Technical Advisory Board, and based on such consideration, it was concluded that it is necessary and expedient in public interest to prohibit the manufacture for sale, sale and distribution for human use of these 328 FDCs in the country.

Accordingly, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has, in exercise of powers conferred by section 26A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940,prohibited the manufacture for sale, sale or distribution for human use of 328 FDCs through its gazette notifications dated 7th September 2018; it has also restricted the manufacture, sale or distribution of six FDCs subject to certain conditions. These notifications will take immediate effect.

                Recently, on 08.09.2018, based on information gathered by CDSCO through intelligence, a joint surprise check was carried out in various chemist shops, departmental stores and diaries in Gazipur, East Delhi by a team of officers of CDSCO and Drug control Department, NCT Delhi for search and seizure of unauthorized sale, distribution of Oxytocin.   

During the search, the  team has seized plastic bottles (200 ml & 100 ml ) suspected to be oxytocin injection, from a departmental store situated at C-9, Gazipur, Gazipur Dairy Farm, Delhi -96, run by  Sh. Rajinder Pal Sethi S/o K. C. Sethi. The shop does not hold any license for sale & distribution of drugs as required under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 & Rules,1945 made thereunder. The samples of seized bottles have also been collected for test/analysis as per the procedures under the said Act and Rules.

 A case against the accused Sh. Rajinder Pal Sethi S/o K. C. Sethi has been registered at Station House Office (SHO), PS: Gazipur for contravening the provisions of Section 18 (c) r/w 27(b) (ii) of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and   FIR has been filed at the Police Station on 8.09.2018.Further action is in process for launching prosecution against the accused under the provisions of the Act. 

It may be mentioned that earlier, in 2015, CDSCO had also raided various places in  Gazipur, East Delhi and seized large quantity of oxytocin bottles from some store and unlicensed premises. Two persons were arrested and prosecution was launched against those accused. The matter is under trial before the Hon’ble Court in Delhi. 

CDSCO has already requested all the State/UT Drugs Controllers as well as its Zonal, Sub-zonal and Port offices to sensitize their inspectorate staff to keep strict vigil on manufacture, sale and distribution of oxytocin in the country and take all measures to ensure that the drug is not manufactured / sold illegally and its misuse is prevented.

Oxytocin is a peptide hormone used in various conditions such as induction of labor, control of postpartum bleeding or haemorrhage, etc.

It has been reported from time to time that clandestine activities of manufacture and sale of oxytocin is leading to its grave misuse, which is harmful to animals and humans. 

Its misuse is mostly in the dairy industry, where livestock are injected with oxytocin to make them release milk. 

From time to time, the CDSCO as well as State/UT Drug Control Authorities have conducted various raids to unearth clandestine manufacture, sale of oxytocin in the country and necessary actions have been taken against the accused as per the provisions of Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 & Rules, 1945 thereunder.

Further, her commitment to the public health agenda in the Member States is reflected in the significant achievements in all the flagship priority programmes of the Region” 

We are happy that she has been able to translate her strategic vision into concrete actions during her tenure - whether it is in addressing the persisting and emerging epidemiological and demographic challenges; strengthening emergency risk management for sustainable development; advancing universal health coverage and robust health systems or articulating a strong regional voice in the global health agenda, Shri Nadda said.

While we take pride in her belonging to India, we are sure that she will continue to work in the best ethos of Indian tradition and democracy, bearing allegiance to the oath that she once took; of doing right to all manner of people without fear or favour, affection or ill-will, ShriNadda said.

Initially spanning almost 1300 procedures under 20 different specialties, this will be the largest government funded health protection scheme in the world,” the Health Minister elaborated.He added that under the second pillar, one hundred & fifty thousand health and wellness centres would ‘bring healthcare closer to people, so that every Indian can have timely access to health care, including diagnostic services and free essential drugs. Shri Nadda further stated that the Health Ministry is working very hard for effective implementation of “Ayushman Bharat” for a healthy, productive and prosperous India.

Highlighting the initiatives of the Government, Shri Nadda said that although the WHO has fixed 2030 as the timeline for elimination of Tuberculosis, our Prime Minister has exhorted us to do it five years ahead of target in 2025. “In line with this ambitious plan, India is on track for the implementation of the National Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis and we have recently introduced supplementary nutritional support for the complete duration of treatment for patients,” he added. Shri Nadda further stated that India has already initiated universal screening for prevention and management of five common NCDs including hypertension, diabetes and three common Cancers of oral cavity, breast and cervix at pan India level.

Central Government is providing all possible support to the State Government for smooth conduct of these elections including deployment of Central forces in sufficient numbers. 

Elections to Local Bodies

     The local body elections will have a historic significance in many aspects. The local body elections will re-establish the long overdue grassroots level democracy in J&K. The urban local body elections are being held after 2005 and Panchayat elections after 2011. Provision of direct elections for Sarpanches of the Panchayats has also been restored to ensure accountability. These elections will also pave the way for making available nearly Rs. 4,335 Crores of 14th Finance Commission Central grants to the duly constituted local bodies. But for these elections, people of J&K would have been deprived of these funds meant for their welfare. Local bodies are also being vested with significantly enhanced devolution of powers in line with best practices in the country. This will enable them to address most of the local issues in their jurisdictions. 

    The functions and functionaries of all the 29 subjects transferred to Panchayats under the 73rd Amendment of the Constitution of India will also be transferred to the Panchayats of J&K including institutions like Primary Health Centers, Primary Schools, Aganwadi Centers to name a few. Financial powers of Panchayats are being enhanced 10 times from Rs 10 thousand to Rs 1 lakh for Panchayats. And, from Rs 25 thousand to Rs 2.5 lakhs for Block Councils. Powers for “Own fund generation” are also being given to Panchayats. These will include building permission fee, taxes on entertainment, advertisement, hoardings, various kinds of businesses & profession. Central and State government funds will further supplement “Own funds” of the Panchayats under various schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Gurantee Act ( MGNERGA) , Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), Integrated Child Development Services ( ICDS) and  Mid-Day meal etc. 

    In addition to selection of eligible beneficiaries for various schemes, Panchayats will also be involved in the implementations of key national achemes such as National Health Mission, Samagraha Siksha, Mission for development of Horticulture, Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY). On an average every Panchayat will now get around Rs. 50-80 lakhs per year at its disposal for implementation of such schemes. To further strengthen the Panchayats, additional posts are being sanctioned for Accountant, Data Entry operator, Block Panchayat Inspector etc.

Strengthening of the Leh and Kargil Autonomous Hill Development Councils (LAHDC and KAHDC)

     The Leh and Kargil Autonomous Hill Development Councils (LAHDC and KAHDC) have been strengthened and empowered to become the most autonomous councils in the country to address various issues being faced by people living in the remote areas of Ladakh region. The LAHDC & KAHDC have been given more powers to levy and collect local taxes. Control has been given over functioning of various departments as well as the Government employees working for the subjects that are transferred to them. 

    All such properties like public buildings, public roads constructed by LAHDC & KAHDC shall now belong to the council. Funds allocated to these councils from the State Budget can now be carried forward for the next year. The Panchayats in Kargil and Leh will also follow directions of these councils. Chief Executive Councillor will also be the Chairman of all Tourism Development Authorities. These Councils will also have a Deputy Chairman for better functioning. 

Special Police Officers

Considering the crucial role being played by the Special Police Officers in anti-militancy operations, MHA has enhanced their honorarium from existing Rs 6,000 per month to 9,000 on completion of 5 years and Rs 12,000 on completion of 15 years. 

Financial Assistance to West Pakistan Refugees settled in J&K

   MHA has approved a scheme of Rs 5.5 Lakh financial assistance to nearly 5,764 West Pakistan Refugees settled in J&K. Amounts due to the eligible beneficiaries will be transferred in their bank accounts. The State Government has designated Divisional Commissioner Jammu as the nodal officer for effective and speedy disbursement of the amount to all eligible beneficiaries.

                Government of India has taken an important decision to enhance its contribution in the State Disaster Response fund (SDRF) from 75% to 90%. w.e.f. 1st April 2018. Central Government will contribute 90 per cent and all States will contribute 10 per cent to the SDRF. The additional contribution by Central Government in SDRF on this account will be Rs. 1690.35 crore for the year 2018-19 and Rs. 1774.67 crore for the financial year 2019-20. 

Under the Disaster Management Act 2005, a financial mechanism has been set up by way of National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) at national level and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) at state level to meet the rescue and relief expenditure during any notified disaster.  SDRF has been constituted in each State in which Centre, so far, had been contributing 75% for General Category States and 90% for Special Category States of hilly regions every year. SDRF is a resource available to the States to meet the expenses of relief operations of immediate nature, for a range of specified disasters.  At any point, the State Government has fair amount of funds available under the SDRF. In case of any natural calamity beyond the coping capacity of a State, additional financial assistance, as per norms, is provided by the Central Government from NDRF, in which 100% funding is by the Central Government. 

Based on the recommendations of successive Finance Commission, Government of India approves the annual allocation to SDRF. On the recommendations of 14th Finance Commission, the Government has significantly enhanced the allocation to SDRF by 82.30% i.e. from Rs. 33,580.93 crore during the years 2010-11 to 2014-15 to Rs. 61,220 crore for the years 2015-16 to 2019-20. In addition the Central Government has provided the additional financial assistance of Rs 32,142 crore from NDRF to States during 2014-2018 compared to Rs 14,098 crore provided during 2010-2014, which is also significantly higher.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is conducting a basic training programme at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad. The five-day training programme, aimed at enhancing the preparedness of Airport Emergency Handlers (AEHs) to respond to CBRN emergencies at the airports, started today. 

CBRN emergencies pertain to threats emanating due to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear material. 

The training programme is being conducted in collaboration with the Airport Authority of India (AAI), Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

Handling CBRN emergencies need specialised skills and efforts. In fact, even a small CBRN related event can cause panic among people at the airports. This training programme will improve the CBRN safety at our airports by enabling the AEHs to handle any CBRN emergency.

The programme consists of lectures as well as field training, including live demonstrations of detection and decontamination including use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Besides equipping the AEHs to handle CBRN emergencies, the training programme will also enable them to provide medical first aid and initial psycho-social support. 

Experts from stakeholder departments such as Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), INMAS, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) will train the participants. 

A total of 50 participants representing various agencies responsible for operation and maintenance of the airport will be trained on various aspects of CBRN emergencies. Another 150 working level staff will be sensitized on the subject in a half day module.

This is the seventh in a series of such programmes being conducted at airports across the country to enable AEHs to respond suitably till the arrival of specialised response teams. Six batches have already been trained - one each in Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Varanasi, Patna and Ahmedabad.

                It has been reported in a section of the media that Shri Rahul Gandhi, during an interaction at New Delhi on Saturday (Sept 22), had commented that “The SPG Chief appointed by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had to quit because he refused to accept a list of SPG officers handpicked by the RSS”.

 

The matter has been verified. The officer in question, Shri Vivek Srivastava, former Director, Special Protection Group (SPG), has specifically averred that he did not have any such conversation with Shri Rahul Gandhi at any point of time. The officer has stated that as part of his professional duties he interacted with SPG protectees; however, he has categorically stated that during his interaction with Shri Gandhi, there was no talk whatsoever regarding the appointment of a new Director, or the reasons for his leaving SPG.

 

SPG is a professional organisation which takes its task of protecting serving Prime Ministers, former Prime Ministers and their families entrusted to its security, very seriously and in the highest professional spirit. The comment reportedly made by Shri Gandhi through the media is baseless, devoid of fact and unfortunate, coming from an SPG protectee.

                Union Home Minister, Shri Rajnath Singh here today launched two separate portals to strengthen Women Safety. The portal “cybercrime.gov.in” will receive complaints from citizens on objectionable online content related to child pornography, child sexual abuse material, sexually explicit material such as rape and gang rape. 

The National Database on Sexual Offenders (NDSO), which is accessible only to law enforcement agencies, will assist in effectively tracking and investigating cases of sexual offences. 

Addressing the Officers from the States through a video conference, Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh said that the Government has taken several measures to check crime against Women and Children, including provision of stringent punishment and creation of modern forensics facilities to improve investigation, creation of the Women’s Safety Division in the Ministry of Home Affairs and launching of Safe City projects for Women’s Safety. He added that the two portals launched today are part of efforts in the direction of strengthening security of women and children. However, he said that the field level challenges have to be overcome by the Police at the ground level to ensure speedy justice to the victims. He urged them to fully utilize potential of the two portals and update the database regularly for greater effectiveness. Shri Rajnath Singh appreciated measures introduced by some of the states to check crimes against women and children, and urged them to share the best practices for adoption by others.

Speaking on the occasion, the Women & Child Development Minister Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi urged the law enforcement agencies to pay special attention to the safety of children at shelter homes. She also underlined the need for provision of forensic kits at police stations for quick investigation of sexual crimes. She also asked the police to take prompt action in cases where a husband abandons wife shortly after marriage.

The Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba highlighted the need for timebound completion of investigation in sexual crimes to instill deterrence among potential offenders. While appreciating the progress made by Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh Police, he said MHA will monitor progress in all the States. He added that the two portals will be extremely helpful to the law enforcement agencies especially in investigation where offenders migrate to other states after committing the crime. 

The Cyber Crime Prevention Against Women and Children (CCPWC) portal is convenient and user friendly that will enable complainants in reporting cases without disclosing their identity. This will not only aid the  victims/complainants but also help the civil society organizations  and  responsible citizens  to anonymously  report complaints pertaining to child pornography, child sexual abuse material or sexually explicit material such as rape and gang rape. Complainants can also upload the objectionable content and URL to assist in the investigation by the State Police. The complaints registered through this portal will be handled by police authorities of respective State/UTs. There are other features such as a victim or complainant can track his/her report by opting for “ report and track” option using his/her mobile number. 

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) will proactively identify such objectionable content and take up with intermediaries for its removal. For this NCRB  has already been notified  as the Government of India agency  to issue notices under Section 79(3)b of IT Act.

The second portal unveiled by the Union Home Minister today relates to the National Database on Sexual Offenders (NDSO). It is a central database of “sexual offenders” in the country which will be maintained by the NCRB for regular monitoring and tracking by the State Police. The database is accessible only to the law enforcement agencies for investigation and monitoring purpose. The database will include offenders convicted under charges of rape, gang rape, POCSO and eve teasing. At present the database contains 4.4 lakh entries. The State Police have been requested to regularly update the database from 2005 onwards. The database includes name, address, photograph and fingerprint details for each entry. However, the database will not compromise any individual’s privacy.

Ministry of Home Affairs has already released a grant of Rs. 94.5 crore to States/UTs for establishing cyber forensic-cum-training laboratories to strengthen cybercrime investigation and conduct training programmes to enhance capabilities of Police officers, public prosecutors and judicial officers.

Senior Officers from MHA, Ministry of Women & Child Development and senior police officials from States and UTs through video conference attended the meeting.

                The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is conducting a two-day training-cum-workshop programme on ‘Application of GIS (Geographic Information System) in Disaster Management’ here today.  The training programme aims to help participants develop skills for effectively utilising the geo-information tools for disaster management.

 A total of 19 representatives from 12 States, UTs and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are participating in the training programme which will enable them to understand the need, role and scope of web-based GIS service for management of disasters more efficiently and effectively through an integrated platform. Experts from NDMA, Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), Teri University and ESRI will train the participants on various aspects of geo-information tools.

 Speaking during the inaugural session, Dr. D. N. Sharma, Member, NDMA, underlined the importance of quantifying risks in a qualitative manner through geo-spatial tools to reduce disaster losses. He added that this workshop would serve as the first step towards integrating and sharing of GIS database on one platform by different stakeholders. In a post-disaster situation, critical decision-making depends on quality geospatial information and there is a need to make it authoritative so that all stakeholders are able to use the same information and ensure a unified response to any given situation. 

NDMA is working towards integrating geospatial data for research, mitigation and post disaster management. This system will help the Centre as well as State Governments, local bodies, civil societies and other stakeholders to handle the complete disaster cycle in an effective and efficient manner.

                The Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba launched an online ‘e-Sahaj’ portal here today for grant of Security Clearance. The portal will facilitate an applicant to submit application online and also to view the status of his application from time to time.

Speaking on the occasion, the Union Home Secretary said that with the introduction of online portal, the process has become standardized, resulting in a process which will be faster, transparent and easy to monitor. Various functionaries can access the application and documents online and take timely decisions.

Shri Gauba said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has recently streamlined the Security Clearance procedures and issued a fresh set of guidelines. A Committee of Officers meets every week in MHA for timely decision on security clearance proposals.

MHA has cleared about 1,100 cases of security clearance in the past one year. Although the given timeline is 90 days, MHA strives to decide Security Clearance cases in 60 days (average time per case in 2018 is 53 days), which is being reduced further. In 2016, there were 209 cases which were over 6 months old; in 2017, this came down to 154 cases and further down to 47 cases in 2018. 

MHA is the nodal Ministry for security clearances in certain sensitive sectors before issue of licence/permit, permission, contract etc, to companies/ bidders/individuals by the administrative Ministry. The objective of national security clearance is to evaluate potential security threats, including economic threats, and provide risk assessment before clearing investment and project proposals in key sectors. The aim is to strike a healthy balance between meeting the imperatives of national security and facilitating ease of doing business and promoting investment in the country.

Special Secretary (IS) Smt. Rina Mitra and senior officers of MHA and other Ministries were present during the launch function.

                The 28th meeting of the Southern Zonal Council was held under the Chairmanship the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh in Bengaluru today.  The meeting was attended by the Chief Ministers of Karnataka and Puducherry; Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu; Finance Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala Minister for Social Justice & Empowerment and Minister for Tourism, Karnataka; Minister for Health, Puducherry and Minister of State for Home, Govt. of India, Lt. Governor of Andaman & Nicobar Islands and senior officers from Central and State Governments. 

The Council expressed deep sorrow and sympathy to the people who lost their lives and property in the floods caused by the fury of the Monsoon in the Southern part of the country. The Council was informed that Central Government would not lag behind in providing the requisite assistance to the States concerned in this regard. 

The Council reviewed the progress of the implementation of the recommendations made at the last meeting relating to security to fishermen, introduction of peninsular tourism trains, uniformity in allocation of funds in proportion to population of SC/ST for scholarship for all the courses, optimum harnessing of renewable energy available in the Southern States without endangering grid security and development of Puducherry Airport. Thereafter, the Council took up issues which relate to Pulicat lake dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu fishermen over fishing rights, menace of red sander smuggling in the holy Seshachalam hills, supply of Krishna water to augment the drinking water supply to Chennai city, issues relating to fishing in coastal States in Southern Zone, checking of Antibiotic residues in aquaculture shrimp export, scheme for modernization of State Police Forces in the States of Southern Zone, issuance of 'No Objection Certificate' (NOC) for LPG godown site plan, issues pertaining to Biofuels programme, etc. Out of the 27 items discussed today, 22 were resolved in the meeting. 

Prior to this Council meeting, the Standing Committee of the Council met on November 28, 2017 at Bengaluru. In the meeting seven issues  were resolved i.e. extension of High Speed Rail corridor between Thiruvananthapuram and Mangalore upto Udupi, revision of ceiling on Profession Tax by the Government of India, giving Infrastructure status to Housing by the Central Government, Inter-State Animal Movement, promotion of Oil seeds and Oil palm cultivation to augment availability of Vegetable Oils, inclusion of Puducherry in Central Finance Commission and security of fishermen from Puducherry. 

The five Zonal Councils (Western, Eastern, Northern, Southern and Center Zonal Councils) were set up under the States Re-organisation Act, 1956 to foster Inter-State cooperation and coordination among the States. The Zonal Councils are mandated to discuss and make recommendations on any matter of common interest in the field of economic and social planning, border disputes, linguistic minorities or inter-State transport etc. They are regional fora of cooperative endeavour for States linked with each other economically, politically and culturally. Being compact high level bodies, specially meant for looking after the interests of respective Zones, they are capable of focusing attention on specific issues taking into account regional factors, while keeping the national perspective in view. 

It was emphasized that it has been the objective of the present Government to strengthen the institution of the Zonal Councils as well as the Inter-State Council in order to promote and maintain a good federal atmosphere of cooperation among the States and between the Centre and the States as well. As a result, during the last four years, two Council meetings and three Standing Committee meetings of the Southern Zonal Council were held. Apart from this, eight Council meetings and twelve Standing Committee meetings of other Zones were also held. In these meetings, about 600 issues were discussed, out of which 406 issues were resolved. 

Today’s deliberations of the Council were held in a warm and cordial atmosphere in the true spirit of cooperative federalism and ended with the decision to host the next meeting in Tamil Nadu.

                Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated two pilot projects of smart fencing along the Indo-Pak International Border in Jammu today.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Rajnath Singh said that government has taken a number of initiatives to make the borders of the country more secure. He said that the Centre has been making maximum use of technology to make the security system at the borders stronger and effective. The Minister said that smart fencing at the borders is a technological solution devised to address the security issues in the border states and the two projects in five kilometres areas each have been installed along the Indo-Pak International Border in Jammu on a pilot basis.

 

He said that with this smart fencing, the number of casualties of our jawans on borders would get minimised and the stress level among the jawans would also reduce to a large extent. 

 

The Union Home Minister further added that with the digital smart fencing, our borders would become absolutely safe since it would virtually make it impossible for the terrorists to breach it and infiltrate across the borders.

 

Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh, Director General, Border Security Force, Shri K.K. Sharma and other senior officers were present on the occasion.

 

Later, addressing the media, Shri Rajnath Singh said  that making border security  foolproof is a priority of the  Government. Around a  total of 2,026 km border is vulnerable and that the digital fencing technology would be utilised along such long stretches of the borders, he added.  The Minister said that with the help of smart border fencing, our borders would become secure and the dependence on ground patrolling by troops will  considerably be reduced. 

 

The smart border fencing projects built under the Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) programme is the first of its kind in the country.   The two projects  each covering a 5.5 km border stretch along the International Border  have got hitech surveillance system that would create an invisible electronic barrier on land, water and even in air and underground and would help the BSF detect and foil infiltration bids in most difficult terrains. The CIBMS is designed to guard stretches where physical surveillance is not possible either due to inhospitable  terrain or riverine borders.

 

CIBMS uses a number of different devices for surveillance, communication and data storage.  Sensors like Thermal Imager, UGS, Fiber Optical Sensors, Radar, Sonar have been mounted on different platforms like Aerostat, tower, poles etc. A comprehensive integration of such sensors and other technical systems of communication and data processing have been achieved in the CIBMS project. The signals reach the Unified Command and Control Centre where the BSF can monitor the border on real-time basis. The CIBMS enables round-the-clock surveillance on border and under different weather conditions be it in dust storm, fog or rain.

 

Duing his visit to Jammu, the Home Minister also participated in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and administered Swachhta pledge to BSF officers, jawans and officers.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh inaugurated the 6th International Geriatric Orthopaedic Society of India Conference on the theme “Increased Longevity with Reduced Fragility and Enhanced Mobility”, at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences here today. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Minister hailed the Ayushman Bharat Health Protection Scheme announced by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra  Modi  for the benefit of the rural and poor people. Under this scheme the Government will provide affordable healthcare with universal health insurance to poor and needy people and their families, specially the elderly, he added. 

Speaking on the increasing health problems faced by the elderly due to disintegration of the joint family culture in the country, Shri Rajnath Singh said that this scheme would take care of the health problems of such ageing people. He said that however we should preserve the joint family culture as the old people also need emotional care in addition to the physical care. 

Appreciating the efforts of the Geriatric Orthopaedic Society of India in organizing such event to spread awareness about the health needs of the ageing population, he hoped the deliberations during the conference will benefit the participants and general public. He said this effort is also in the direction of serious efforts being made by the Government for providing better health facilities to the needy. 

Speaking on the occasion, the Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Shri Ashwani Kumar Chaubey said that due to economic progress in the country, the elderly population is increasing at great pace which is expected to touch 30 crore by 2050. Thus we also need to increase the health facilities for them. For this, he said that the Government will establish around 1,50,000 Wellness Centres and Sub Centres across the country. 

The President of the International Geriatric Orthopaedic Society of India, Dr.John Ebnezar, the Dean and Acting Director of AIIMS, Dr. V K Bahl also addressed the conference.

                The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has called upon the law enforcement agencies to adopt new technologies to enhance their capacities to contain terror and to counter the emerging challenges to homeland security. He said that India has been facing security and terrorism-related challenges for years and there are multiple vulnerable areas that are prone to various risks. The Union Home Minister was inaugurating the 3-day Defence & Homeland Security Expo and Conference – 2018, organised by PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry in association with Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), here today. 

 

Shri Rajnath Singh said that the Government will soon implement the new Drone Policy which was announced recently, containing comprehensive regulations on the use of drones. He said drones are being increasingly inducted into the Indian security establishment to monitor sensitive and vulnerable areas prone to security risks including thick and dense jungles in Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas in which physical monitoring is extremely difficult.


Shri Rajnath Singh also announced technological upgradation and modernization to monitor and check activities related to terrorism especially in Jammu & Kashmir, Gujarat and Assam. A new technological solution facility is already due to be unveiled shortly in Jammu region.  He said that our security forces are guarding one of the longest borders in the world, running across more than 7,500 kms, out of which physical barrier is not possible for around 900 kms length. And to secure such a long non-physical border, we need to use the latest techniques such as laser, radar and other means, he added.

 

The Union Home Minister said that cyber crime is the biggest challenge in today’s world and to counter it, we need to adopt latest technologies. For this, the MHA has created an exclusive Division in the Ministry of Home Affairs, he added.

 

Terming the Public-Private Partnership in Homeland Security as a unique effort, Shri Rajnath Singh said that issues related to the prevailing Industrial Licensing Policy for Homeland Security Manufacturers would be sorted out shortly in consultation between the Ministries of Home Affairs and Commerce & Industry. The Home Minister said that the financial powers of chiefs of Paramilitary forces have been enhanced significantly to speed up and simplify the procurement process.

In his address, Director General, CRPF, Shri Rajeev Rai Bhatnagar gave a detailed presentation on how the Paramilitary force is engaged in providing and ensuring security to the nation and its future requirements. 

Pertinent issues related to Homeland Security and Defence Modernisation with exclusive partnership from the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) segment would be discussed and deliberated upon at great length during the 3-day Conference.

The expo is being organised for the first time to make leading policy makers and luminaries from diverse defence segments take part with special focus on MSMEs in defence production and procurement. The expo is cutting across various industries vis-a-vis surveillance, cyber security, bulletproof jackets, robots, drones, hi-tech equipment including livelihood items, research and development and police modernisation.

Among those present on the occasion were the  Senior Government and Police Officers; acting Ambassador, Charge de Affairs, Embassy of Israel, Ms. Maya Kadosh; President, PHD Chamber, Mr. Anil Khaitan ; Sr. Vice President and Vice President, Mr. Rajeev Talwar and Mr. D K Aggarwal; Chairman, Defence & Homeland Security Committee, PHD Chamber, Mr. Rajiv Bhatnagar; Partner, KPMG.

                A five-day training programme on ‘Landslide Mitigation and Detailed Project Report (DPR) Preparation’ concluded at IIT-Mandi successfully at Himachal Pradesh, yesterday (August 31, 2018). Supported by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in collaboration with IIT-Mandi, the training programme aimed to train various stakeholders for better landslide mitigation and DPR preparation to reduce impact of landslides on human lives and properties.

The programme brought together key groups, including geo-technical engineers, civil engineers, geologists, disaster managers, etc., which work towards developing, adopting, implementing and enforcing mitigation measures in their concerned States. Landslide experts Prof. Vikas Thakur, NTNU, Norway, Dr A. K. Naithani, NIRM Bangaluru, Dr. Deepak, Dr. Vaun and Dr. Uday, IIT Mandi and Dr. Ravinder Singh, NDMA, Delhi conducted the training programme in the pristine campus of IIT Mandi. Field visit of Katropi landslide was organized as a part of the training on 29th August, 2018. 

Speaking during the valedictory session, Lt. Gen. N. C. Marwah (Retd.), Member, NDMA, underlined the need to focus on the preparedness and mitigation of landslides. He also emphasized upon the need for indigenous research and technologies to address the problem of our difficult terrain and provide low-cost solutions to meet local requirements.

Earlier, inaugurating the training programme on August 27, 2018, Shri Rugved M. Thakur, Deputy Commissioner Mandi, Government of Himachal Pradesh, shared the inputs on the pre and the post disaster services to deal with landslides and other disasters in Mandi District. The importance of multi-disciplinary approach in the field of landslide studies was also highlighted. Participants were also briefed about the importance of landslide mitigation through preparation of DPRs in line with the NDMA template.

Total 32 officials nominated from various landslide affected States, viz. Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir and various departments such as Public Works Department (PWD), Directorate of Geology & Mineral Resources (DGM), State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs), Geological Survey of India (GSI) and others.

Landslides affect at least 15 per cent of India's landmass and incur huge economic losses annually. Landslide mitigation involves awareness, education, preparedness, prediction and timely warning systems to minimise the adverse effects of a landslide. As a step forward, NDMA is collaborating with IIT-Mandi for a pilot project on “Development and Evaluation of Low-Cost Landslide Monitoring Solutions”.

                The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, under the aegis of Swachh Bharat Mission – Urban (SBM – U), has partnered with Google to launch the Loo Review campaign to encourage all local guides in India to rate and review public toilets on Google Maps. This campaign is part of a feature which allows all citizens to locate public toilets in their cities on Google Maps, Search and the Assistant and also provide feedback on the same.  500+ cities in India with more than 30,000 toilets with the name of “SBM Toilet” are currently live on Google Maps.

One of the objectives of the Swachh Bharat Mission – Urban (SBM - U) is to provide sanitation coverage through public toilet facilities across cities in India for achieving Open Defecation Free (ODF) status. With around 3400cities already having achieved ODF status, and other cities gearing up towards the same, there is now a need to ensure that the ODF status is sustained through continuous usage and proper maintenance of public toilets.

The joint campaign to be run throughout October and November 2018 is an effort to increase the awareness and ease of locating public toilets across India. The campaign will involve and engage Local Guides in India to rate and review public toilets on Google Maps, and use the hashtag #LooReview for the chance to be featured on Google Local Guides’ social channels.  Local Guides are people who share reviews, photos, and knowledge on Google Maps to help people explore the world.

Shri DurgaShanker Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, said, “The Ministry has identified that there is now a need to move beyond monitoring and measuring outputs and targets for toilet construction to enhance actual usage, functionality and sustainability. The ‘Public toilets near me’ feature will benefit citizens, particularly women and senior citizens, who often find it difficult to find access to clean toilets in the public space. The feedback provide by local guides through the Loo Review campaign will press upon the Urban Local Bodies to take proactive steps to improve public toilet facilities across the country.” 

Chetan Krishnaswamy, Director Public Policy, Google, said “Google is a committed partner in achieving the Government’s vision of a Swachh Bharat. ‘Public toilets near me’ is a feature that is supported across Google Maps, Search and the Assistant. In close partnership with the MoHUA, we have mapped toilets across 500 cities in India in the last year alone. Through the #LooReview campaign we are engaging our enthusiastic Local Guides community in India to further increase the awareness on public toilets in the country, and help citizens discover clean and well-maintained options in their vicinity.”

Anyone can join the Local Guides community and review places on Google Maps. To find a place to visit and review, search “Public toilet near me” on Google Maps.

                Shri Hardeep Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs has called upon the Industry and the society to self-regulate  to bring about behavioural change for a greener and sustainable growth. He was delivering the inaugural address at a Conference on “Plastic Recycling & Waste Management – Opportunities and Challenges” here today.  In this context, he pointed out that “India’s gigantic urban initiative is not a mindless thrust of infrastructure investment but combining the attainment of social indices and environmental objectives along the way”. 

Stating that India’s Urban rejuvenation must be greener and resilient, Shri Puri said all these are being achieved without compromising on environmental concerns. “We have adopted a conscious approach that places a premium on building green and resilient structures. Use of new and alternate construction technologies in the construction of houses, locally available eco- friendly materials suited to local climatic conditions are being encouraged, reducing not only the cost of construction but also the resultant carbon footprint”, he added. 

Addressing the participants, the minister said that India’s capacity to treat its waste scientifically, will increase in future as waste management in India is still majorly restricted to traditional methods of waste collecting and disposing it in landfills with minimal segregation.  “The launch of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan   in 2014 has led to some degree of sensitisation and awareness campaigns on waste management, resulting in segregation and recycling being adopted across several cities and towns in India”, he said.   Stating that the volume of plastic waste has also grown over the years, not just in India, but globally, Shri Puri said that India has a good record or recycling of plastic waste, bulk of which is carried out in the informal sector.   “For example, we recycle over 80% of PET bottle waste into fibre, which is one of the highest rate of recycling in the world.  For a sustainable growth, it is also necessary to reduce use of non-essential “single use” plastic products. All solid wastes, including various plastic wastes, can be recycled or the inherent energy recovered. The Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 is a good frame-work to address the challenges posed by plastic waste” Shri Puri added. 

Elaborating on the challenges and opportunities in terms of collection, segregation and recycling of plastic waste in order to waste proof the future, the Minister said we must also look into the alternatives to plastic products available that can be scaled up commercially for both large scale and small scale applications. He said that even though plastic waste forms 4% -7% of MSW in India, it is the most visible part and poses a major challenge. “While civic bodies are entrusted with the primary responsibilities of handling waste, other stakeholders need to join-in in this endeavour” he suggested. Shri Puri said that advanced economies in the world have managed plastic waste well through building robust infrastructure and public awareness for management of all solid waste. 

Highlighting that India’s development trajectory will be ‘green’, and in consonance with the ethos of the 2030 development agenda, the Minister pointed out that almost a year before the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formalized by the United Nations, India officially launched the world largest cleanliness drive -- Swachh Bharat Mission. Stressing on the role of newer technologies, the Minister said, “they have allowed us to do more with less, and increase the efficacy and efficiency in delivering urban services”. 

The day-long Conference will deliberate not only on innovations in plastic waste management and technology but also to look for alternative to the use of single-use plastic products.

                Shri Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs has emphasized the use of new technologies for fast tracking the construction of houses under PMAY(U).  The Ministry has approved 6,28,488 houses to be constructed under PMAY(U) on 26.9.2018 across 11 States; UP (2,34,879), AP (1,40,559), M.P. (74,631), Bihar (50,017), Chhattisgarh (30,371), Gujarat (29,185), Maharashtra (22,265), Tamil Nadu (20,794), Odisha (13,421), Tripura (9,778) and Manipur (2,588).  With this approval, total number of houses to be constructed under PMAY(U) now stands at 60.29 lakh.

         Addressing the committee members after the above approval, Shri Mishra observed that states like Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Maharashtra are pioneer in using innovative technologies like Shear Wall, Pre-Cast, Monolithic etc.  More than 50% of the sanctioned houses have been grounded which are presently in various stages of construction.  A total of 495 project proposals for construction of 2,34,879 houses under PMAY(U) submitted by State of Uttar Pradesh have been approved by 38th CSMC on 26.9.2018 which is highest in terms of number of houses submitted by any State so far.  Increasing number of proposals submitted under PPP mode for AHP & ISSR vertical reveal that participation of private sector in affordable housing sector is on rising trend.   The increased participation of private sector is due to fruition of various initiatives taken by the Ministry to address the housing shortage in urban areas.

               It is noteworthy that progress of construction of houses is being monitored by geo-tagging of different stages of construction.  Ministry has decided to release central assistance of Rs.486.87 crores for Kerala considering the extraordinary situation due to heavy floods.   Ministry has advised Government of Kerala for early submission of project proposals under PMAY(U) for flood affected households.

                Union Minister of State (I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri has said that urban areas in India faced multi-pronged challenges and a complex ecosystem in ensuring housing for all, technology-based solutions to enhance service delivery, better mobility and greener transport, smart governance and in doing more with less.  Addressing the inaugural session of Project Managers Global Summit 2018 on ""Powering India’s Breakthrough Growth: New Dimensions in Project Management"" here today, he said that meeting these challenges requires efficient project management which means translating vision into reality.  Shri Puri said professionalism is essential in project management and not populism saying the processes must be carried out in a transparent manner and through competitive bidding.

The Minister  said that India has undertaken the ""most comprehensive"" planned urbanization programme in the world and stressed that India still had to build 70 per cent of the new urban infrastructure required by 2030 and this has to be green and resilient. At present, over 30 per cent of India's population, on a base of 1.2 billion, lives in urban centres, as compared to 17 per cent of the population living in urban areas at the time of India's independence in 1947. The flagship programmes being implemented by the Indian government were moving in a direction to ensure that India succeeds in the 2030 Agenda, he added and pointed out that the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana or the Prime Minister's scheme on Affordable Housing for All is the world's largest housing programme for the poor under which the government aims to build 11 million affordable homes for urban Indians by the year 2022. India is in the process of creating 100 Smart Cities to strengthen urban infrastructure by applying smart solutions, he further added.

The Minister said that the Smart Cities Mission envisaged area-based interventions for developing urban areas or cities. Following citizen consultations with more than 2.4 million people, 100 cities are now implementing concepts such as smart roads, smart solid waste management, solar rooftops and smart schools, to name a few. He said, “smartness, whether of building or a city, is not something on which you have a choice. It’s an imperative with thrust on your current existence. When we talk smart cities it includes host of things—greens, sustainable infrastructure, safety for everyone, surveillance ensuring safety for women. So it is an ongoing process”.

Shri Puri said, by December 2018, you can start getting physical contours of what a smart city looks like. Different cities are in different stages of processing, tendering, he said.  The Minister said, in democracy you cannot tell people where to live and nor can we stop migration, adding that we have to tackle it by creating infrastructure, adding that we have to look at urbanization as a great opportunity for economic growth.

Shri Puri pointed out that, cities were selected through a competitive process for funding under a Government of India programme, and added that the programme design was based on comprehensive citizen engagement, leveraging the power of technology at our disposal.

The Minister underlined that “new technologies and platforms will increasingly enable citizens to engage with governments, voice their opinions, coordinate their efforts and even circumvent the supervision of public authorities”. This phenomenon is embedded in the concept, design, and implementation of India’s Smart Cities Mission, he said.

He pointed out that every Smart City will have a Smart City Centre (SCC) (i.e. Integrated Command and Control Centre). The SCC functions as a city’s nervous system where digital technologies are integrated with social, physical, and environmental aspects of the city, to enable centralized monitoring and decision making. SCCs have already been set up in 11 cities.   Twenty eight other cities have started work on setting up such centres.

Shri Puri said,  proactively improving the urban space will require a reform of the “enabling environment”, which includes governance frameworks, policy protocols, capacities of urban local bodies, and the nature of citizen-government engagement.

On the occasion, awards for Excellence were given to NBCC and DMRC.

                A High-Level Committee of the Uttar Pradesh government has come out with recommendations aimed at providing solution to the completion of homes in the stalled projects of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway. The Committee was constituted by the State government vide order dated 18th June, 2018 under the chairpersonship of Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in order to address the issues of home buyers and affected parties of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway. The mandate of the Committee was to identify the problems and to make clear recommendations to solve the issues raised by homebuyers. The committee held deliberations with all the stakeholders Home Buyers Association, Developers & their Association, Bankers, concerned administrative Authorities etc. before finalization its report.

It is being noticed that on various social media platforms the recommendations of the Report have not been clearly understood and it has been alleged that it favors the developers/builders.

In this regard, it is important to note that main problem of home buyers of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway is that of the ‘stalled projects’ and the only relief for home buyers is to ‘get these completed and give possession of their booked home’ as early as possible. Therefore, each recommendation has been made keeping the interest of home buyers only. The Committee has made a total of 10 recommendations. 

Ø It is evident that the main reason of the stalled projects is the ‘lack of fund’ and ‘non-availability of last mile funding’, therefore the Committee’s first recommendation pertains to RBI for issuing guidelines to enable Banks to fund this gap. It will help home buyers to get their homes.

Ø Presently, nobody wants to put the money in stalled projects as there is no guarantee of the return on their investment. Second recommendation of the Committee pertains to Last-In First-Out (LIFO) model for execution of Stress Fund to ensure the confidence of investor to put its money in order to complete the stalled projects, as it will also help home buyers to get their homes.

Ø Third recommendation was related to introduction of Project Settlement Policy (PSP) by State Government of Uttar Pradesh with certain modifications. It is important to know that PSP was launched earlier by the Authorities but no developer availed the same. Now, the situation is more critical than before, therefore PSP for fixed 6 months’ period has been recommended, wherein the developer has to give a written undertaking to complete the projects within 3 years, otherwise the benefits of PSP shall be taken back and all the dues shall be recovered from developer by the concern Authority. This would ensure that the PSP helps in completion of the stalled projects and its benefits not misused by the developers. The provision to introduce co-developers to complete the stalled projects is to ensure early completion of the projects to help home buyers only.

Ø Fourth recommendation to avoid multiple sale of single property, the “Agreement to Sale” to be registered in the office of concern Sub-registrar with nominal registration fee will ultimately secure the interest of Home Buyers.

Ø Fifth recommendation is related to establishment of one Real Estate Regulatory Authority in Noida or Greater Noida, to readdress the issue of home-buyers of the Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and nearby area on a regular basis. 

Ø Sixth recommendation is to permit the affected home buyers to get the title deed registered on stamp duty at the rate prevailing at the time of committed date of the completion of the project by the developer. It will give huge monetary benefits to each affected individual home buyer. 

Ø Seventh recommendation relates to policy for taking over their unused land/FAR of stalled projects by the Authorities, wherein no third-party interest has been created, is to instil a sense of discipline among the developers and penalise the defaulters.

Ø Ninth recommendations pertain to preparation of a panel Lawyers of RERA to assist the homebuyers in pursuing their cases before RERA Authorities at reasonable fees. 

Ø Tenth recommendation pertaining to survey by NBCC (India) Limited of other developer’s stalled projects in Noida and Greater Noida and take up few selected viable projects upon its independent audit/survey in order to complete the same. This would directly benefit the homebuyers in the selected stalled projects.

None of the recommendations puts any additional burden on the homebuyers, rather they will smoothen completion of the projects to deliver possession to home buyers at the earliest at the cost already conveyed to them by the developers/builders.

                      Andhra Pradesh has topped the charts among States in terms of “Ease of Living Index” rankings launched by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).  It was followed by Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.  The three States were awarded the three best performing States at the National Dissemination Workshop on Ease of Living Index, 2018, here today. While presenting the awards to the States, the Union Minister of State (I/C)) for Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri said that the Ease of Living Index is a transformative initiative of the Ministry to help the cities assess their liveability vis-à-vis national and global benchmarks. He exuded confidence that the Ease of Living Index will encourage all cities to move towards an ‘outcome-based’ approach to urban planning and management and promote healthy competition among cities.  Sh Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary MoHUA, Sh Shiv Das Meena, Additional Secretary and Mission heads under Urban Affairs, urban planners from States and Union Territories attended the Workshop. 

Addressing the participants, Sh Puri said that this exercise marked a major milestone in India’s goal to promote evidence-based planning and action towards sustainable urbanization.  “The ‘Ease of Living’ Index seeks to assist cities in undertaking a 360-degree assessment of their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats”, he added. It was decided in June 2017 to rank 116 cities (all smart cities and million plus cities) based on the liveability parameters. The implementation of the assessment commenced formally on 19 January 2018.  The MoHUA released the first ever ‘Ease of Living Index’ covering 111 Indian cities on 13 August, 2018, which serves as a litmus test to help assess the progress made in cities through various initiatives. All cities were evaluated out of 100. The 'physical' pillar (infrastructure) was given the highest weightage of 45, while institutional (governance) and social were weighted 25 each. Economy was weighted 5. 

Shri Hardeep Puri pointed out that Ease of Living framework comprised four pillars namely Institutional, Social, Economic and Physical which are further broken down into 78 indicators across 15 categories (governance, identity and culture, education, health, safety and security, economy, affordable housing, land use planning, public open spaces, transportation and mobility, assured water supply, waste-water management, solid waste management, power, and quality of environment).  “Another highlight of the Ease of Living assessment standards is its close linkage with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Of the 17 SDG goals, 8 goals are directly linked to India’s ease of living assessment framework with SDG 11” he said. 

The Minister highlighted that SDG 11 is aimed at making our cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable and is measured through a set of 30 indicators.  He said, “the ease of living index provides a strong impetus to India’s effort for systematically tracking the progress of SDGs in the urban areas.”

Elaborating on the importance of having a relook at the whole exercise undertaken which led to the final scores and ranking, Shri Hardeep Puri said, “the assessment was launched at the national level with a National Orientation Workshop to orient city officials on assessment framework. It was followed by 33 state level workshops spread across all 26 states and Union Territories to introduce and explain the framework to all stakeholders. Over 1500 officials participated across all workshops.”  Shri Puri also pointed out that besides collecting data on a range of metrics to evaluate performance of the city administration, the exercise spread over four months also collected feedback from over 60,000 citizens to measure satisfaction on urban services. The first round of Ease of Living covered 111 cities. Gurugram was subsequently included in the assessment.  Four cities of West Bengal – Howrah, New Town Kolkata, Kolkata and Durgapur did not participate and Naya Raipur of Chhattisgarh and Amravati of Andhra Pradesh did not fulfil the parameters as they are green-field cities. 

The Minister hoped that this workshop will provide an opportunity for the states and cities to offer their valuable suggestions and also go over  the lessons learnt from the previous Index to ensure a more robust methodology for future. The workshop will dwell upon the approach, challenges and key learnings from the first exercise of Ease of Living Index, 2018. Shri Puri also urged all States and cities to share their inputs on ‘City GDP Framework’ so as to devise a robust GDP framework for cities.

The government hoped that the big bonus that will come with the scheme is the fact that it will lead to a healthy competition between cities, based on the rankings, and generate acute interest, comparisons, critiques and analysis by citizens.

                In an early morning initiative for making our cities clean and motivate people to adopt Swachhta as a way of life, more than 300 officials from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, NDMC, NBCC, CPWD, HPL and other entities under the Ministry took part in a plogging exercise here today. More than 2 hours long exercise was led by Sh Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary, M/O Housing and Urban affairs which started from Janpath market area and culminated near Shastri Bhawan, also motivated scores of bystanders, onlookers, taxi drivers, vendors and morning walkers to join in this unique exercise.

More than 500 filled packets of garbage including broken bottles, ice cream and gutkha wrappers, cups, packets, etc were collected as part of the exercise. Sh Mishra used the opportunity to also talk to the people who gathered on adopting Plogging as a way of exercise and suggested that it can be undertaken as a way of routine to ensure a clean and garbage free city. The event was organised as part of Prime Ministers initiative of “Swachhata Hi Sewa” by the Ministry today. Several members of the NGO, CFAR also participated in the event.

Sh. Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary - MoHUA, encouraged everyone to take up plogging as a regular initiative. He said that picking up the litter should be carried out simultaneously with walking or jogging. “Self-littering should not be done and all the waste and litter should always be thrown in a dustbin nearby.” he added. Sh. Mishra also encouraged several shopkeepers on the way to take responsibility for throwing the waste in garbage bins only.

Enthused by the tremendous response, it has been decided that the next plogging drive will be carried out on 30th September, 2018 from Nehru Park, Chankyapuri to Yashwant place in New Delhi. About 300 students from Sharda Vakil School of Art and National Centre for Arts will also be roped in as volunteers on the occasion.

                Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs (I/C), has stated that his Ministry iscommitted to provide enabling environment to the street vendors by taking up with the states to notify Rules and Schemes under the Act thus paving way for its implementation. Addressing the National Convention of NASVI (National Association of Street Vendors of India here today, the Housing and Urban Affairs Minister informed that hisministry is implementing the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihood Mission (DAY-NULM) with seven components which is being implemented in the statutory towns of the country. The DAY-NULM aims to reduce poverty and vulnerability of the urban poor households and enables them to access gainful self- employment and skilled wage employment opportunities. Sh Arbind Singh, National Coordinator of NASVI, Sh Sanjay Kumar, Joint secretary and Mission Director, DAY-NULM and participants from all over the country were present at the function. 

Observing that most of the vendors involved in informal sector activities earlier faced a constant threat of eviction, removal, confiscation of goods and almost non-existent social security cover, Sh Puri informed that, to address these very issues and to promote pro-vending town planning, the parliament passed the landmark Act i.e. the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street vending) Act 2014. The Act provided for regulating street vending, certification of vending, harassment against unlawful eviction, rights and obligations of street vendors. It also provided protection to the natural markets.The Act lays down an important role to Town Vending committees in the governance of provisions relating to protection of rights of street vendors. In the composition of Town Vending committees, street vendors’ representatives will be not less than 40% of the total strength of the Committee. Under the Act, respective states/ UTs have to notify Rules and Schemes for ensuring its implementation. So far 30 states/ UTs have notified their respective Rules and 21 States have notified their respective Schemes.

Sh Puri further informed that the DAY-NULM addresses livelihood concerns of the urban street vendors by facilitating access to suitable spaces, institutional credit, social security and skills to the urban street vendors for accessing emerging market opportunities. Taking in account the importance of street vendors in the urban space, DAY-NULM has included Support to Urban Street Vendors as one of its components. 

Considering the importance of Street vending which has a prominent place in the urban supply chain by providing inexpensive and convenient access to goods and services to all segments of the population, up to 5% of the allocations under the Mission can be spent by State/ ULB for creation of infrastructure for street vendors. Apart from the benefits under the Street Vendors component, street vendors can also take advantage of other components under the Mission.One such advantage is that Street vendors can access skill training under Skill Training programme of DAY-NULM.They can also take concessional loans @ 7% interest for setting up and expanding self-employment enterprises under Self-Employment Programme of DAY-NULM.There may be some street vendors who are homeless.  Such persons can stay in the nearby shelter homes being run with the assistance of DAY-NULM.The female and handicapped street vendors can also form Self-Help Groups and take advantages under the Mission by accessing revolving fund and bank linkage loans and forming part of SHG federations. 

Appreciating the support of voluntary organizations like NASVI in creating supportive environment for street vendors to carry out their livelihood activity, Sh Puri observed that efforts made towards securing  livelihood of street vendors through policy interventions, advocacy for changes in political- legal environment, dialogues with policy makers, administrators and planners, providing legal aids, capacity building of street vendor and sensitizing society about the issues of street vendors will help in providing an effective voice to the street vendors.

                Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs ( I/C), has stressed on the need for integrating divyang-friendly measures in various projects being implemented in the Smart Cities in India. This, he said, is required at the initial project planning stage to ensure that cities become divyang-friendly, accessible and inclusive. He was speaking at an interactive session on “Divyang Friendly Measures and Policy Recommendations for Smart Cities in India” here today. He said that in conjunction with the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), the Smart Cities Mission seeks to ensure that the most vulnerable sections of our society enjoy ‘Ease of Living’ in Indian cities. The workshop, organised by the National Institute of Urban Affairs, had participation from divyang persons from different walks of life and eminent citizens and experts, including several international sports personalities. 

 

      Addressing the participants, Shri Puri said that the feedback emanating from such stakeholders’ interactions will be sent to the CEOs and project managers of the Smart Cities to be incorporated in their plans. He said that these measures will improve the “ease of living” for those who lacked accessibility to all facilities.Lamenting that India particularly lacks data on disability, Shri Hardeep Puri said that “we will be looking at 25% of the population that will need universal accessibility in order to live independently and with dignity.” He asserted that the Disability Act of 1995 also mandated accessibility for persons with disabilities. He pointed out that the “Clause 40-48 of the VIIIth Chapter of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 also mandates making all buildings, services and products accessible giving definite timelines for implementation and retrofitting.”

 

The Minister was categorical in saying that “the standards exist, legislation is in place, thus we now have no reason to ignore this very urgent issue of accessibility any longer.” He outlined that according to the United Nations, a mere 1% additional cost is incurred for incorporating universal design and accessibility in the design and planning stage itself. Stating that India is at an interesting cusp, Shri Puri said that “we have the Accessible India Campaign, AMRUT, HRIDAY, Swachh Bharat, Digital India and the Smart Cities Mission – and accessibility cuts across them all.”

He further said that “clarity must be maintained on the standards applicable,” and added that “NCPEDP worked closely with BIS to update the National Building Code 2016 to ensure that accessibility cuts across all chapters and section.” Shri Puri said that accessibility also makes for a business case, adding that tourism-based cities are likely to face an opportunity loss of an estimated 15-20% of the global market share if they exclude tourists with disabilities. “Leaving people with disabilities out of economic opportunities leads to a loss of 3-7%of GDP annually,” he added.

 

Shri Hardeep Puri also said that accessibility needs to be looked at beyond the built infrastructure alone. He said, “with a growing digital interface, technology must be made accessible too – municipal apps, bus shelters, kiosks, red light junctions, ATMs, all need to be made accessible for people with disabilities. Signage captioning is important for the deaf and hearing-impaired. Products that we use must be accessible- e.g. low floor buses, lifts and elevators that announce the floor reached for people with visual disabilities, etc.”

The Smart Cities Mission adopts a unique approach to urbanization, adding that at its core, the Mission promotes the access to infrastructure for all citizens and this becomes a platform to provide social justice. The Minister pointed out that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 goals and 169 targets, has given the nations of the world a very ambitious framework with the underlying theme of ‘Leave No One Behind’. “This framework is inspired by the Indian ethos of Sarvodaya through Antyodaya,” he said, stating further that people with disabilities are among the most marginalised – not because of their disability but because of an environment that is hostile insensitive and inaccessible.

 

The Minister elaborated on the “Article 36 of the New Urban Agenda’ which said, “We commit ourselves to promoting appropriate measures in cities and human settlements that facilitate access for persons with disabilities, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment of cities, in particular to public spaces, public transport, housing, education and health facilities, public information and communication (including information and communications technologies and systems) and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, in both urban and rural areas.”

                The Union Minister of State(I/C) Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri has said that the NDA government at the centre is committed to provide positive solution to the problems of home buyers, so that they get their home as soon as possible. He was delivering the inaugural address at the “First Regional Workshop on RERA – a New Era of Transparency and Accountability in Real Estate – 2 years of implementation and way forward (Western Region)” in Pune today. During his address, the Minister pointed out that the country had no regulator for the real estate sector for nearly 70 years after it gained independence, and said that the year 2016 will reveal that year to be a seminal one as that was the year when the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 was enacted by the NDA Government under the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. Various stakeholders associated with the Real Estate Sector i.e. Developers, Home Buyers, Financial Institutions along with the Chairpersons and senior officers of Authorities, Tribunals and State Government officials from the western part of India attended the workshop.

 

Addressing the participants, the minister stated that the year 2016 changed the real estate sector forever and defined the dawn of the post RERA era. RERA is characterized by trust, rules, regulations and regulatory oversight as opposed to the pre-2016 period which essentially was one of mistrust, fraud, cheating and broken promises, he said and asserted that “the plight of the homebuyers who were at the mercy of the developers and bringing discipline in the Real Estate Sector was one of the core objectives of this landmark legislation”. “Had RERA been in place, say, 20 or even 10 years ago, consumers would not have had to knock on the doors of the judiciary, as the stringent provisions of RERA would have ensured an eco-system that would have prevented the entry of ‘fly by night’ operators, he further said and added that, “we now have a Government that believes in bold and radical reforms”. Which is determined to bring about a change in the lives of the honest tax payer. “We will and are urging, encouraging and persuading the States to set up the regulatory apparatus envisioned under RERA, speedily”, he further said. 

 

Shri Puri said, the Real Estate Act fills the existing gap between the Development/Municipal laws and the Apartment Ownership Act, and is intended to regulate transactions (buying and selling) and enforcement of contracts and added that the Act upholds the spirit of federalism by allowing the States to set up the Regulatory Authority and the Appellate Tribunal and the role of the Central Government is limited to Union Territories without legislature. He emphasised that the Act attempts to balance the interests of the consumers and the developers by imposing clear responsibilities on both, seeks to establish symmetry of information between the promoter and the purchaser; transparency of contractual conditions; set minimum standards of accountability; and a fast-track dispute resolution mechanism. He pointed out that the Act is aimed at consumer protection, by creating an online system for information sharing so that there is mutual trust between the developer and the buyers, and projects are implemented in time. He also outlined various benefits and advantages that RERA has brought about in its wake. 

 

Stating that the Indian real estate sector has witnessed transformative reforms in the last few years, Shri Puri said, “according to CREDAI-JLL report, the contribution of housing sector to the Indian GDP is expected to be 11 percent by 2020, up from current 5 to 6%"" the Indian real estate market is expected to touch USD 180 billion by 2020 and USD 350 billion by 2027 – where the products will be more structured and pre-planned”.

Outlining the progress since the enactment of the RERA, Shri Puri said, “28 States / UTs have notified the rules under RERA, except Jammu & Kashmir; 6 North Eastern States (because of land issues) and West Bengal. All these States have also set up Authorities (Regular – 12, Interim – 16); 20 States / UTs have set up the Real Estate Appellate Tribunals so far; total 21 States/ UTs have set up web-portal by giving facility of online registration; and so far 31,475 Real Estate Projects and 24,000 Real Estate Agents have been registered under RERA across the country”.

Speaking about Western region, the Minister pointed out that “Maharashtra is one of the first states to implement the provision of RERA and establish the Real Estate Regulatory Authority of Maharashtra, which is popularly known as MahaRERA. MahaRERA is taking big (Maha) initiatives such as 1st state in India to initiate the conciliation mechanism, by way of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to redress the issue of aggrieved home buyers and look forward to an early and amicable resolution of their disputes with their developers in Maharashtra. Maharashtra has the highest number of Projects (17,567) and Real Estate Agents (16,045) registered with Authority – higher than anuy other authority”. 

He said, “Madhya Pradesh is fully RERA compliant state, which has established Regular Authority, Tribunal and have fully functional web-portal to enable the registration of project and Agents”, and added that “recently, Gujrat has also established its regular Authority and others (Rajasthan and Goa) are on their way to implement RERA in their states.

                India and France have signed an implementation agreement on “MOBILISE YOUR CITY” (MYC) here last evening in the presence of Minister of State (I/C), Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) Shri Hardeep Singh Puri and Shri Alexander Ziegler, Ambassador of France in India. The agreement was signed by Shri Mukund Kumar Sinha, OSD & Ex-Officio Joint Secretary, M/o Housing and Urban Affairs for India while Regional Director, Agence Française de Développement (AfD), Shri Nicolas Fornage, signed the agreement on behalf of AfD.

 

Mobilise Your City (MYC) is part of an international initiative which is supported by the French and the German Governments and was launched at 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) meeting in December, 2015. Based on a proposal made by AFD in 2015, the European Union has agreed to provide funds of Euro 3.5 million through the AFD to contribute to specific investments and technical assistance components within the Mobilise Your City (MYC) programme in India.

 

The MYC aims at supporting three pilot cities viz. Nagpur, Kochi and Ahmedabad in their efforts to reduce their Green House Gas (GHG) emissions related to urban transport by implementing urban mobility plans at local level and to help India at national level to improve their sustainable transport policy.

 

The three pilot cities selected under the programme as well as MoHUA will benefit from the Technical Assistance activities. The main components of the proposed assistance are:

(1) to support planning and implementation of sustainable urban transport projects, 

(2) support to strengthening institutional capacity for regulating, steering and planning urban mobility, and

(3) learning and exchange formats with other cities across India for exchanges on best practices.

 

The details of the project activities will be worked out by AFD in consultation with MoHUA and the three partner cities including institutions such as the respective Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) for Smart Cities, the Municipal Corporations and any transport authority or transport related SPV.

                The Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri has said that there is a great opportunity for the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) as India needs to build 700 to 900 million square meter of urban space every year between now and 2030 that has to be green, resilient and ecologically sustainable.   Put another way, India has to a build a new a Chicago every year, he said.   

Shri Hardeep Puri was speaking at a function for release of a booklet on Schedule of Rates (SOR) 2018 for new technologies and First Q R Code of CPWD here today.  The Minister also launched CPWD’s official Facebook and Twitter page on the Department’s website on the occasion. 

Dwelling on the rapid strides in country’s progress, Shri Puri said that our country is having the distinction of fastest growing economy in the world and going through a major phase of industrialization and modernization with a flood of construction and infrastructure projects. Therein, he said, lie the challenge and opportunity before CPWD.  He said that CPWD must increasingly look at excellence in its projects along with private players. 

The Minister also advocated the need to look beyond conventional construction practices of energy intensive building materials based on natural resources, emerging technologies, which not only brought speed & quality but are safe and durable, thereby leading towards sustainable development. He advised that construction and demolition waste should be recycled and extensively used in CPWD works. Energy efficiency measures should be given highest priority, he added.

Speaking about the importance of social media, Shri Puri said it has introduced a new dimension, a new narrative of work culture by sharing the organisation’s experiences with public at large. He also advised CPWD of an effective grievance redressal mechanism through feedback from its social media platforms. He said, it will also provide an opportunity to CPWD to advertise its good work before the people. The Minister said the Department has had a great past and added that with some remedial measures, it will have even brighter future. 

The Director General of CPWD, Shri Prabhakar Singh, in his opening remarks, said the Department is moving towards the path of transformation, innovation, delivery and image building in a mission mode. He said, with the release of SOR for new technologies,  CPWD has added one more feather in its cap in setting bench marking standards in the construction sector.            

Senior officials of the Ministry and CPWD also attended the function.

The Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs, Shri Hardeep Singh Puri has said that the civic bodies of the national capital will achieve their physical target of  constructing  5 lakhs community and 67 lakhs individual household toilets by the end of 2019.  Speaking after inaugurating a workshop on “Swachh Survekshan-2019” for the municipal bodies of the national capital city here today, he said,  so far as the Open Defecation Free (ODF) target was concerned, it required the behavioral change of the public at large in rural and urban areas of the country. 

The workshop on “Swachh Survekshan-2019”,  organized by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC)  in collaboration with Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, was attended by delegates from all the three civic bodies and Delhi Cantonment Board.

Shri Hardeep Puri said that the behavior change had many aspects like gender empowerment,  dignity of girl child,  and green and clean cities envisioned under the Swachh Bharat Mission. He said, in addition to construction of toilets, more attention and efforts are required in respect of scientific processing of solid waste Management. He said, the Swachhta Mission has now become a mass movement.  

The Minister appreciated that the NDMC  has bagged the first position in the category of cities of 1-3 Lakh population and overall fourth position in the country and hoped that it would get the overall first position in the forthcoming Swachhta Survekshan-2019.  

Shri Hardeep Puri  said that under the Smart City initiatives, the NDMC had achieved many milestones by commissioning various projects like Wi-Fi, Smart Poles, Solar Tree and Ideation Centre at Connaught Place.  

Stressing upon the reduction of plastic items in day-to-day life, Member Parliament, Smt. Meenakashi Lekhi said that it is the need of the hours to come forward to reduce, reuse  and recycle the plastic waste so as to make the planet environment friendly. 

 Outlining the details of the steps undertaken by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, the National Mission Director of the  Swachh Bharat, Shri V. K. Jindal  informed that the entire nation would be Open Defecation Free by the end of 2019.  He said,  the scientific segregation of the waste, started in 73 cities in 2016, now has increased  to 4,203 cities in 2018 and the all cities of the country will be covered by 2019.  

NDMC Chairman, Shri Naresh Kumar in his welcome address threw light on several achievements of  the civic body in New Delhi area under the Swachh Bharat Mission.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Information & Broadcasting and Sports & Youth Affairs Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore (Retd.) flagged off 9 DSNG Vans of Doordarshan here today. Secretary Ministry of Information & Broadcasting Shri Amit Khare, DG Doordarshan Smt Supriya Sahoo and other senior officials of the Ministry were also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion Col Rajyavardhan Rathore (Retd.) said that his Government stresses on Act East Policy and a lot of development efforts are taking place in North East India in this regard. Deployment of more DSNG vans in North East will help in making the development stories from North East reach the people. 

As a part of  fleet augmentation programme to enhance the capacity of Doordarshan for live broadcasting, 9 new C-Band DSNG vans has been inducted, which are capable of uplinking HD signals. These vans have been procured at a cost of Rs.22.83 Cr (at Rs.2.54 Cr each) through a Global Tender. 

These DSNG Units would enable Doordarshan to enhance its live telecast capability from the North-East as 4 of these DSNGs are meant for Gangtok, Kohima, Imphal and Agartala. Since North-East is the focus area of the Government of India, these would provide a boost to the news gathering as well as programming initiatives from the hitherto uncovered areas in the North East. Apart from this, new DSNG units are also being deployed at Allahabad, Visakhapatnam, Chandigarh, Jagdalpur and Pune

Doordarshan has a fleet of 34 DSNGs which are deployed across the country.   16 of these DSNGs operate in C Band while 18 operate in Ku Band. However, out of 34 DSNGs only 2 are capable of uplinking HD signals, at present. DSNGs are Mobile Earth Stations which enable broadcasting from any remote place through a satellite system.

                Around 3.2 crore Insured Persons (IPs) will benefit from newly launched scheme of ESIC ‘Atal Bimit Vyakti Kalyan Yojna’. The ESI Corporation has approved ‘ATAL BIMIT VYAKTI KALYAN YOJNA’ for Insured Persons (IP) covered under the Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948. This scheme is a relief payable in cash directly to the Bank Account in case of unemployment and while they search for new engagement. The cash benefit given to the unemployed persons searching for new employment will be 25 percent of his average earning of 90 days. Shri Gangwar was addressing on the occasion of 7th National Conference on Security and Safety at Workplace and distribution of Safety Systems Excellence Awards in New Delhi today.

 

Addressing the function, the Minister added that there are around six crores of workers in organized sector who are getting benefits of EPFO, ESIC and Social Security Schemes. The Union Government has taken many steps to enhance their working conditions, safety and social security in order to improve their standard of living. Present government is continuously making efforts to improve life conditions of around 40 crore workers of the unorganized sector also. In last two years nearly one crore workers have been linked with ESIC benefits and more than one crore have been brought in the fold of EPFO. Pradhan Mantri Jeewan Jyoti Beema Yojna and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Beema Yojna  are totally free for unorganized workers. He further said that nearly 3 crore workers are benefitting from these Social Security Schemes. 

 

The honorarium of 14 Lakh Aanganwadi workers have been increased from Rs. 3,000 per month to Rs. 4,500 per month. Likewise, honorarium of Aanganwadi helpers has also been increased from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 2,250 per month. The incentive of AASHA workers has also been doubled, he added. 

 

Shri Gangwar further said that the Ministry is making efforts to increase employment opportunities through Pradhan Manrti Rojgar Protsahan Yojana. Twelve per cent of the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) contribution of new employees is being given by government so that employers may not have to bear this cost. The government has spent Rs. 1,744 crores for this EPF contribution for around 72 Lakh employees of nearly 87,000 organizations in last two years.

 

The Minister congratulated all the winners of Safety Systems Excellence Awards and expressed hope that all the participants of this conference will gain from the ideas discussed on this forum.

                The ESI Corporation during its 175th Meeting held yesterday in New Delhi under the Chairmanship of Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Union Minister of State for Labour & Employment(I/C) has taken some very important decisions towards improvements in its services and benefits being provided to Insured Persons and their dependants. 

 

Considering the change in employment pattern and the current scenario of employment in India which has transformed from a long term employment to fixed short term engagement in the form of contract and temping, the ESI Corporation has approved a Scheme named “ATAL BIMIT VYAKTI KALYAN YOJNA” for Insured Persons (IP) covered under the Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948.  This scheme is a relief payable in cash directly to their Bank Account in case of unemployment and while they search for new engagement.  Detailed instructions including eligibility conditions, application format, etc. will be issued separately.

ESI Corporation has approved the proposal for reimbursement of Rs. 10/- per person to the employers to encourage the seeding of Aadhar (UID) in ESIC database of their workers and their family members. It will curtail the multiple registrations of same Insured Persons and thus enable them to avail the benefits requiring longer contributory conditions.

ESI Corporation has approved the proposal for relaxing the eligibility conditions for availing Super Specialty treatment has now been relaxed from earlier insurable employment of 2 years to 06 months with contribution requirement of only 78 days. Besides, the eligibility for availing Super Specialty treatment for dependents of Insured Person has now been relaxed to insurable employment of one year with 156 days of contributions. This relaxation will immensely help the Insured Persons and their beneficiaries to avail Super Specialty treatment free of cost as per revised eligibility.

  ESI Corporation has approved the proposal for increasing the Funeral Expenses from existing Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 15,000/- being paid on the death of Insured Person. 

Shri Heera Lal Samariya, Secretary, Labour and Employment, ESI Corporation Members representing, Members of Parliament, Employees’ & Employers’ Federation/Association representatives of State Governments and Senior officials of the Ministry were also present in the meeting.

                Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Labour& Employment ShriSantosh Kumar Gangwar, led a delegation to Mendoza, Argentina for the G-20 Labour& Employment Ministers’ Meeting, held on 6-7, September, 2018. 

Applauding the Argentine Presidency for holding the joint meeting of the Education and Labour Ministers, Shri Gangwar said that the coordination between these Ministries is needed to strike a right balance between the supply and demand of the labour in a country. He reiterated that India is committed to job security, wage security and social security to all workers in the country. All round efforts have been made to promote job creation in India over the last few years through various schemes and programmes. He also stressed on inclusive development and signing of Social Security Agreements amongst the G-20 countries for ensuring portability of social security benefits to its workers.

Labour& Employment Minister highlighted India’s initiatives for promoting skill development like Pradhan Mantri Kaushal VikasYojana and setting up of Sector Skill Councils and for employment creation like the Start Up India and the MUDRA scheme. He added that the process of simplifying and rationalizing nearly 40 labour laws into 4 labour codes has been startedwhich  would not only lead to effective enforcement, better compliance but also ensure universal applicability of various welfare measures.

The Minister said that new forms of work and digital economy provides employment opportunities and flexibility in working scenario, especially for women, youth and disabled. It also opens all kinds of possibilities for women who have to make balance between work and family responsibilities. It provides flexibility in working hours for these groups and even possibility of work from home. 

Santosh Kumar Gangwarhighlighted the various initiatives taken for ensuring social security to its workers. Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) provides social security in the form of PF, Pension and Death Benefit to nearly 60 million workers. In the last two years, it has added 10 million new workers under its ambit. In order to facilitate transitions from informal to formal sector Government has started the PradhanMantriRozgarProtsahanYojana where the Government will bear the entire 12% contribution of the PF given by the Employer. Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) is providing health care services in more than 500 districts in India. In the last two years, over 10 million workers have been linked to the ESIC. 

The Government of India’s recently launched landmark scheme, Ayushman Bharat will also ensure better health care of the workers. Around 500 million workers and their families are expected to benefit through this scheme. Pradhan Mantri Jeevan JyotiBimaYojana (PMJJY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana (PMSBY) have been launched to provide for insurance cover in the case of disability or death to the workers engaged in the unorganised sector. Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2017 and Unorganized Workers Social Security Act, 2008 have been enacted. He reiterated signing of Social Security of Agreements amongst the G20 countries for ensuring portability of social security benefits to its workers.

He stressed on design and implementation of policies for greater and easier participation of women in the labour market. Shri Gangwar said, “we are implementing policies and programmes that ensure their education, training, skilling, entrepreneurship, minimum wages and social protection for women. Such measures include providing skills that enable women to become self-employed or entrepreneurs; creating online platform for women to sell their products; enhancing paid maternity leave, promoting flexible working hours and opportunity to work from home”.

G-20 Labour and Employment Ministerial Declaration and Joint G-20 Education and Labour and Employment Ministerial Declaration were adopted and will be presented in the next summit of Leaders/ Heads of the State later this year.

                India and Morocco signed an MoU for deepening cooperation between MSME sectors of the two countries in Rabat, Morocco yesterday.  The MoU was signed by CMD, National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC), Ravindra Nath and Director General, Maroc PME, Mr. Rabri Barrazouka. Through this MOU, the NSIC and Maroc PME will work together to enhance cooperation opportunities for MSMEs of both countries. It will facilitate transfer of Indian technologies and products to Morocco.  

Ms. Alka Arora, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of MSME, who is leading the official delegation along with CMD NSIC to Morocco held bilateral meetings with Mr. Othman El Ferdaous, Secretary of State in the Ministry of Industry, Investment and Trade and Digital Economy and with other related Departments for enhancing cooperation in MSME Sector. Both sides discussed the ways and means to synergize the strengths of both countries in MSME Sector in terms of capacity building, sharing of experiences, exchange of business delegations for creating linkages, JVs and technology transfers. Morocco mainly relies on its exports of minerals and ores and SERVICE sector. It has very small MSME sector in manufacturing, whereas India has strong MSMeE sector especially in manufacturing. 

 Over the years, India and Morocco have enjoyed cordial and friendly relations and bilateral relations have witnessed significant growth. India is one of the major markets for Moroccan phosphate and its derivatives. An India-Morocco joint venture in fertilizer sector in Morocco, called IMACID, was set up in November 1999. At present, the JV is producing around 430,000 MT per annum of phosphoric acid, nearly all of which is imported by India. The Moroccan phosphate company, OCP, has invested in Paradip Phosphates Ltd. in India. Other main items of export to India are metallic ores and metal scrap, semi-finished products and inorganic chemicals. 

The main items of India’s exports to Morocco are cotton yarn, synthetic fiber, transport equipment, pharmaceuticals, agricultural implements, chemicals, spices and manufactured metals. The balance of trade has been in favour of Morocco because of imports of phosphoric acid and rock phosphate by India.

The quantum of bilateral trade, which was US$ 1.63 billion in 2010, reached to US$ 2.04 billion in 2011.  However, in 2014, it decreased and stood at $ 1.36 billion. Indian exports to Morocco in 2014 decreased by 21.6% compared to the previous year while Moroccan exports to India registered an increase of 10.2% in 2014. 

Indian industry and business associations CII, FICCI and ASSOCHAM have institutional arrangements with Moroccan industry and business associations. A number of trade delegations from various industry and export promotion councils have been visiting Morocco periodically in connection with trade promotion activities.

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said that the foundation stone of first world class educational institute for poor, backward and Minorities will be laid at Alwar in Rajasthan on 01st October, 2018. 

 

While chairing the 57th meeting of General Body and 101st meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, Shri Naqvi said that the educational institution, being set up in Alwar, will start functioning in 2020.

 

Shri Naqvi said that the Rajasthan Government has given 15 acres of land in Kohrapipali village in Kishangarh Bas tehsil of Alwar district for this educational institute. World class research centres, labs, libraries, educational facilities for primary to higher studies and sports facilities will be established here. He said that these world class institutions will provide education in technical, medical, Ayurved, Unani and job-oriented skill development courses etc. We have proposed 40 per cent reservation for girls in these institutions. 

 

A 3-member committee of Minority Affairs Ministry’s officials and members of the Maulana Azad Education Foundation has been constituted to chalk out the entire process of the institute at Alwar. Soon, the detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared regarding construction and other process for the institute. The Minority Affairs Ministry had worked out on a plan a year ago to establish world class educational institutes for poor, backward and Minorities and a 11-member committee, headed by former Secretary, Govt. of India, Shri Afzal Amanullah, had been constituted in this regard. 

 

In the 57th meeting of General Body and 101st meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, various schemes for educational empowerment of minorities, ""Begum Hazrat Mahal Girls Scholarship"", ""Gharib Nawaz Kaushal Vikas Yojana"", other scholarship programmes were reviewed.

 

Shri Naqvi said that during the last about 4 years, the Central Government’s “Empowerment without Appeasement” policy has ensured that record about 3 crore students belonging to poor and weaker sections of Minorities have been benefitted from various scholarship programmes. The beneficiaries include about 1 crore 63 lakh girls.

 

Shri Naqvi said that school dropout rate among Muslim girls, which was earlier more than 70 per cent, has now been reduced to about 35-40 per cent due to awareness and educational empowerment programmes of the Government. Our goal is to bring it down to zero per cent. Transparent and hassle-free scholarship system has played a key role in this endeavour. This year, ""National Scholarship Portal Mobile App"" (NSP Mobile App) has been launched which will ensure a smooth, accessible and hassle-free scholarship system for students from poor and weaker sections.

 

Shri Naqvi said that Ministry of Minority Affairs has worked with commitment to “3E- Education, Employment & Empowerment”. In the last about one year, thousands of educational institutions of all Minority communities including Madarsas, have been included in the mainstream education system by connecting them with ""3T-Teacher, Tiffin, Toilet"".

                Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi launched the country's first ""National Scholarship Portal Mobile App"" (NSP Mobile App) here today.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Naqvi said that this ""National Scholarship Portal Mobile App"" will ensure a smooth, accessible and hassle-free scholarship system for students from poor and weaker sections. He said that all the scholarships are being given directly into bank accounts of the needy students under Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode through the National Scholarship Portal which has ensured that there is no scope for duplication and leakage.

 

Shri Naqvi said that the ""National Scholarship Portal Mobile App"" will prove beneficial for students, and will help in strengthening a transparent mechanism for the scholarships. The mobile app will be beneficial for the students in many ways: students will get all the information regarding various scholarships on this mobile app; they will be able to apply for scholarships sitting in their home; students can upload necessary documents on this mobile app; students can check the status of their application, scholarship disbursement etc. Students from far-flung/hilly areas/North East will be the most benefitted.

 

Shri Naqvi said that the Ministry of Minority Affairs has completely gone online, which has eliminated middlemen and benefits of every scheme are reaching directly to the needy without any obstacle. The Minister said that during the last about 4 years, the Modi Government’s “Empowerment without Appeasement” policy has ensured that record about 3 crore students belonging to poor and weaker sections of Minorities have been benefitted from various scholarship programmes. The beneficiaries include about 1 crore 63 lakh girls. He added that school dropout rate among Muslim girls, which was earlier more than 70 per cent, has now been reduced to about 35-40 per cent due to awareness and educational empowerment programmes of the Modi Government. Our goal is to bring it down to zero per cent. Transparent and hassle-free scholarship system has helped in this endeavour.

 

Shri Naqvi said that Ministry of Minority Affairs has worked with commitment to “3E- Education, Employment & Empowerment”. In the last about one year, thousands of educational institutions of all Minority communities including Madarsas, have been included in the mainstream education system by connecting them with ""3T-Teacher, Tiffin, Toilet"".

                The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is organising the First Assembly of International Solar Alliance (ISA); the 2nd Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Renewable Energy Ministerial Meeting and the 2nd Global Renewable Energy Investment Meeting and Expo, (REINVEST- 2018) from 2nd to 5th October 2018 in New Delhi.

The three events will be inaugurated in a common function by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, in the presence of Mr Antonio Guterres, Secretary General, United Nations on 2nd October 2018 in Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi. The Business and Technical Sessions of ISA Assembly, IORA Meet and RE-INVEST 2018 Expo will be held at India Expo Mart, Greater Noida, UP.

The International Solar Alliance (ISA), an Indian initiative, was launched jointly by Shri Narendra Modi, Hon’ble Prime Minister of India and H.E. François Hollande, Hon’ble President of France on 30 November 2015 in Paris, France on the side-lines of the 21st Conference of Parties (CoP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Alliance, recognising that solar energy provides potential member solar resource rich countries lying fully or partially between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, with an unprecedented opportunity to bring prosperity, energy security and sustainable development to their peoples, opened ISA Framework Agreement for signature on 15 November 2016 in Marrakech, Morocco, on the side-lines of COP-22. 

In conformity with the ISA Framework Agreement, 30 days after ratification by the 15th country, on 6 December 2017, ISA became the first full-fledged treaty based international intergovernmental organization headquartered in India. Through this initiative, the countries, inter alia, share the collective ambition: (i) to address obstacles that stand in the way of rapid and massive scale-up of solar energy; (ii) to undertake innovative and concerted efforts for reducing the cost of finance and cost of technology for immediate deployment of competitive solar generation, mobilise more than 1000 Billion US Dollars of investments by 2030. The Government of India has committed Rs.175 crore for setting up of ISA and till date released a sum of Rs 140 crore for creating a corpus fund, building infrastructure and meeting day to day recurring expenditure.

On 11 March 2018, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and the President of France, H.E. Emmanuel Macron co-hosted the Founding Conference of the International Solar Alliance (ISA). Forty eight countries, including India participated in this conference. In addition, there were representations from the United Nations, Multilateral Development Banks, energy-related think tanks, corporate sector and civil society.

The Delhi Solar Agenda, adopted in the Founding Conference of the ISA, states that the ISA member States inter-alia have agreed to pursue an increased share of solar energy in the final energy consumption in respective national energy mix, as a means of tackling global challenges of climate change and as a cost-effective solution by supporting and implementing policy initiatives and participation of all relevant stakeholders, as applicable, in respective States.

Consequent to the Founding Conference, the first Assembly of ISA will be held from 2nd to 5th October 2018. Till date, out of 121 prospective member countries that lie either fully or partially between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, 68 countries have signed the Framework Agreement of the ISA. Out of 68 countries that have signed Framework Agreement of the ISA, 44 countries have deposited the instrument of ratification. 

The first Assembly, in a way, will lay the foundation for global Solar Agenda. The Assembly, as supreme decision making body of the ISA, will steer the process to significantly harness solar energy for achieving universal energy access at affordable rates. The Assembly will adjudicate upon various administrative, financial and programme related issues. Hon’ble Ministers from ISA Treaty Framework signatory countries have been invited for the Assembly. The countries that have ratified the ISA Treaty Framework will attend the Assembly, as Members. Countries that have signed but are yet to ratify the ISA Treaty Framework will attend the Assembly as Observers. 

Till date, we have received delegation confirmation from 18 ministerial-level delegations for attending the 1st Assembly of ISA besides many partner organisations and observers. The Indian Ocean Rim Association was set up with the objective of strengthening regional cooperation and sustainable development within the Indian Ocean Region with 21 Member States and 7 Dialogue Partners. The last Renewable Energy Ministerial Meeting was held on 21st January, 2014 in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Subsequently, during the meeting of IORA Council of Ministers, held in October, 2016 in Bali, Indonesia, it was decided that the next conference will be held in India. In line with the commitment made, India will be hosting 2nd IORA Renewable Energy Ministerial meet from 2nd to 4th October, 2018. In this meeting, Ministers and delegates from all 21 member-countries are expected to participate. India, Australia, Iran IR, Indonesia Thailand, Malaysia, South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Singapore, Mauritius, Madagascar, UAE, Yemen, Seychelles, Somalia, Comoros and Oman are members of IORA.

 

The 2nd RE-INVEST aims at accelerating the worldwide effort to scale up renewable energy and connect the global investment community with Indian energy stakeholders. 2nd RE-INVEST will include a three-day Conference on renewables, cleantech and future energy choices, and an Expo of renewables-related manufacturers, developers, investors and innovators.

The 2nd RE-INVEST will provide a great opportunity to various organisations to showcase their business strategies, achievements and expectations. It would facilitate collaboration and cooperation with key stakeholders in India, which has today emerged as one of the world’s largest renewable energy markets. 

The 2nd RE-INVEST is expected to be attended by Ministerial Delegations from across the world, including ISA and IORA Member Countries, over 600 global industry leaders, and 10,000 delegates.

                Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Statistics and Programme Implementation, Shri Vijay Goel presided over the Valedictory Session of the two-day National Orientation workshop on National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA), organized by Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, here today. This was the first workshop amongst a series of workshops planned by Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs for effective roll-out of NeVA. 

NeVA, an initiative by Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, aims to make all the Legislatures of the country paperless by making the proceedings of the Houses digital.  It is an attempt to provide the information about the functioning of House to the common citizen at the click of a button. The iOS and Google app of NeVA along with the NeVA Website, will act as a repository of data related to the business of all Legislatures in the country in a uniform manner. 

The NeVA aims to live up-to its potential of being ‘One Nation, One Application’. This uniformity of database will lead to easy and effective engagement of citizens with the Government, which will lead to efficient delivery of services and ensure reliability, efficiency, transparency and accountability of all the stakeholders. NeVA will bring Legislatures closer to citizens, thereby taking a decisive step in achievement of substantive democracy. 

Once the programme is operational, details of 5,379 Members from the 40 Legislatures will be uploaded on the portal. A total of 1,13,337 questions, 25,662 notices, 1,708 Bills, 515 committee reports and 10,043 papers from the Legislatures will become available in public domain on NeVA app and website.

Addressing the gathering of over 200 delegates from 29 States and Union Territories, representing 36 legislatures across country including Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Shri Vijay Goel congratulated the team of Union Ministry of Parliamentary affairs for spearheading the NeVA initiative as well as the Assembly of Himachal Pradesh for taking the lead in adopting digitalization. The Minister said that cooperation from States is of utmost importance in making this step a success. He assured full cooperation from the Union Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to the State Legislatures in this direction. 

Shri Goel emphasized on the need for reforms in functioning of Legislatures, including Parliament, with changing times for increasing the productivity of the Houses and efficiency of the respective members. He stressed upon the importance of imbibing suggestions from Members of Parliament and State Legislatures and make this digital initiative more lively and user friendly. 

Shri Goel praised the benefits of digitalization and making Legislatures paperless, yet he firmly expressed his desire that there has to be a balance between technology, consumption of information digitally and the traditional form of functioning of Legislatures. He laid stress on the importance of intellectual debates and interpersonal relations among Members of the Houses. Adoption of technology is inevitable, yet, it should not overpower the human element in the Legislatures in the country, Shri Goel added.

Addressing the gathering, CEO, NITI AAYOG, Shri Amitabh Kant noted that with the world becoming increasingly complex with overload of information, the NeVA initiative promises to ensure ease of access of important information about functioning of Legislatures in a simplified format to everyone. He encouraged the delegates from States to adopt this revolutionary tool with open arms in respective State legislatures and ensure that information regarding functioning of Houses reaches the fingertips to all citizens.

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, Parliamentary Affairs, Shri S.N. Tripathi informed that there are over 4000 applications already running in the Parliament and State Legislatures on different subjects. He said that huge volume of information is being managed by these applications, which makes accessing the relevant information instantly very difficult. NeVA is an effort to integrate this information on one platform and giving anytime anywhere access to everyone at a click of a button, he informed.

Over the course of two days, a series of lectures/interactive sessions were delivered by dignitaries and experts on important features of NeVA. Technical sessions were also conducted, including a live, hands-on demonstration of the application. Session by experts from NIC explained the cloud first and mobile first architecture of NeVA application. An experience sharing session with Himachal Pradesh Assembly was also conducted where the team responsible for the implementation of the project discussed the challenges as well as the benefits of implementing the project. Through group discussions an attempt was made to answer all the queries of the participants. A consensus emerged for speedy implementation of NeVA. During the valedictory session, Shri Goel felicitated Punjab, Gujarat and Karnataka for their outstanding work in early adoption of the project.

BACKGROUND

e-Vidhan is a Mission Mode Project to digitize and make the functioning of State Legislatures paperless.  This is part of Digital India programme andMinistry of Parliamentary Affairs,being the Nodal Ministry for thisproject, desires to roll out e-Vidhan as NeVAcovering all 40 Houses including two Houses of Parliament and thereby putting all them on a single platformand proving the theory of ‘One Nation One Application’.

NeVA is a Rs.739 Crore (approx.) project for bringing Legislatures on digital platform,covering all Houses.  It is to be used by the Legislatures as well as all the Government Departments. This journey began with a pilot project executed in Himachal Pradesh with the central assistance of Rs.8.12 crores which made the Shimla Legislative Assembly the first Assembly in India to go paperless in 2014. This project resulted into overall savings of about Rs.5.08 crores annually on account of expenditure on papers, printing, manpower costs and conservation of forests/ trees as ancillary benefits.

                A delegation of West Pakistan Refugee Action Committee, led by its President Shri Labha Ram Gandhi, met  the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and discussed compensation related and other issues with him.

Dr Jitendra Singh said the Union Government is in constant touch with the J&K State Government and instructions had been issued to simplify the procedure related to identification and other formalities to the maximum extent, so that the disbursement of compensation of Rs.5.5 lakh per family to West Pakistan Refugee (WPR) population could be undertaken at the earliest and could be completed without undue delay. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said, even today he spoke with the concerned officers and it will be ensured that wherever a family was not able to produce documents mandated in the existing rules, a separate inquiry could be conducted by the concerned Deputy Commissioner to establish the claim of the said family and based on the information obtained and recorded by the Deputy Commissioner, the family could be declared as being West Pakistan Refugee and therefore eligible for the issue of relief / compensation accordingly.

It has also been decided, said Dr Jitendra Singh, to appoint a Nodal Officer for closer coordination and prompt disposal of the issues related to the refugees. In this regard, he said, the Union Government has issued instructions to expedite the process of the disbursement of Rs.2,000 crore allocated in favour of PoJK refugees.

 Shri Labha Ram Gandhi was highly appreciative of the Central Government for its concern towards the issues of this large section of population which remains deprived of citizenship rights even after having been settled in the State of Jammu & Kashmir for the last 70 years. He said, it was for the first time that a government at the Centre had taken certain practical initiatives to address their issues and in this case, he referred to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs Order / Official Memo dated March 16, 2018, providing for one time compensation of Rs.5.5 lakh per family to the families of West Pakistan Refugees.

Shri Gandhi was also appreciative of the close cooperation and support received from Dr Jitendra Singh with whom they have been holding regular meetings in recent times. He said, it was the personal intervention of Dr Jitendra Singh which made it possible to simplify procedures and formalities for disbursement of compensation.

Appreciating the efforts of little Master, Dr Jitendra Singh said that such noble efforts on the part of children, that too of very small age, are appreciable and an inspiration for the countrymen to have a humane and courageous approach towards any disaster that fellow countrymen may encounter. He wished Master Himanshu success and happiness in all his efforts in future.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh inaugurated the ‘Pension Adalat’ here today, organised by the Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Government of India. He also presented the ‘Anubhav’ awards 2018 to six pensioners for their contribution towards creating institutional memory for the departments. On the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh also launched a booklet—“An era of sustained  reforms for Central Government Pensioners” enumerating simplification of rules and steps initiated to strengthen the Grievance Portal and make it user friendly.

Inaugurating the All India Pension Adalat,  Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Pension Adalats will help in on-the-spot redressal of pensioners’ grievances. This has given the right of “Ease of Living” to the pensioners, he added. Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the Prime Minster Shri Narendra Modi has directed that Pensioners be provided a hassle-free administrative system to resolve their grievances. Dr. Jitendra Singh also appealed to the States to implement the Good Governance measures taken by the Central Government. 

Speaking about the benefits of the Grievance Portal for the Central Government pensioners called CPENGRAMS, the Minister said that we have saved huge resources and precious time of the people by using the technology.

The Minister said that a number of reforms have been undertaken by the Government to facilitate the pensioners. Highlighting the initiatives of the Government, he said that one of the main initiatives taken was to fix the minimum pension at Rs 1,000. He said that other initiatives such as Bhavishya, Sankalp, Jeevan Praman-digital life certificates, doing away with the obsolete laws and self-attestation, among others have also been taken. He said that a mechanism has been put in place where pensioner will get PPO on the day of his retirement. He further said that the retired population is increasing in India and we should do our best to channelize their energies in a positive manner. There should be smooth transition from their active life to retired life, he added. The pensioners should re-orient themselves to a new beginning, the Minister said. 

The Pension Adalats are being convened with the objective of bringing on a common table the aggrieved pensioner, the concerned department, the bank or CGHS representative, wherever relevant, so that such cases can be settled across the table within the framework of extant rules. 

On the occasion, Dr. Jitendra Singh gave away the third Anubhav Awards-2018 to six Central Government employees to recognise their contribution to the Anubhav portal which is designed to create an institutional memory for successive generations of Central Government employees. Congratulating the awardees, Dr Jitendra Singh said that under Anubhav, the retiring employees give an account of their experiences during service. He said that these experiences are an important account for research and resource for administrative reference and thus will help in improving our working.  

The Anubhav scheme was instituted at the call of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in the year 2015. Till date, more than 5,000 contributions have been made for Anubhavs by Government employees from 91 Departments.

The Secretary, Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare and Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances, Shri K.V. Eapen, in his welcome address, said that the aim of the Department is to provide a life to dignity to the pensioners post-retirement.

Besides the Pension Adalat, a Pre-Retirement Counselling (PRC) was also conducted for the Central Government employees who are about to retire in the next six months. 600 retiring Central Government employees participated in this PRC out of which a significant number were from the Central Armed Police Forces. The objective of the PRC Workshop is to create awareness about post-retirement entitlements as well as to educate them on advance planning for retirement including medical facilities and participation in voluntary activities after retirement.

Senior officers of the Department were present on the occasion.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh will inaugurate the All India Pension Adalat here tomorrow. 

 

The Pension Adalat, being organised by the Department of Pension & Pensioners Welfare (DoP&PW), will be one of the largest exercises for Pensioners’ Welfare ever undertaken by the Government as part of Good Governance dedicated to Central Government Pensioners. It is a unique effort wherein on a single day all the Central Government Ministries would be conducting their respective Pension Adalats in which on-the-spot resolution would be provided across the table to the grievance holder.

 

All the stakeholders of the pensioner’s case viz. the Department, Pay and Account Officer, the concerned Bank, along with the pensioner or his representative, will settle the grievance within the framework of extant rules. This is a great reformative measure to get the grievances resolved in the quickest possible way by avoiding unnecessary recourse by the pensioners to Courts.

 

It is expected that this measure will resolve issues of thousands of pensioners in one day, in a single sitting across the country. In addition to the Central Ministries, the Offices of Accountant General would be separately addressing the Pensioner grievances of All-India Service officers, in all the states across the country. 

 

Besides the Pension Adalat, a Pre-Retirement Counselling (PRC) is also scheduled for the Central Government employees who are about to retire in the next six months. 600 retiring Central Government employees will participate in this PRC out of which a significant number will also be from the Central Armed Police Forces. The objective of the PRC Workshop is to create awareness about post-retirement entitlements as well as to educate them on advance planning for retirement including medical facilities and participation in voluntary activities after retirement.

 

On the occasion, Dr. Jitendra Singh will also give away the Anubhav Awards-2018 to recognise the contribution of the Central Government employees to the Anubhav Portal which is designed to create an institutional memory for successive generations of Central Government employees.  It may be recalled that the Anubhav scheme had been instituted at the call of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in the year 2015. This is meant to encourage retiring and retired employees to submit an account of their experiences while working in the government and thereby create an institutional memory to help in future governance as well as to motivate and inspire different generations of government officials in their respective assignments. The scheme has resulted in registering more than 5,000 Anubhavs from Government employees till date from 91 Departments.

                A delegation of Indian Information Service (IIS) officers called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today.

He further said that Government has tried to rejuvenate the communication through radio, since this channel of information has wider reach in otherwise inaccessible areas. He said that Prime Minister himself reaches to the common man of India through the ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme on radio. The Minister added that he has recently inaugurated 10KW transmitter of All India Radio at Patnitop in Ramban District of Jammu & Kashmir, that will provide services to people living in a radius of around 60 km (aerial) in various districts. He also discussed other issues related to communication system prevalent in the Government and steps required to strengthen it so as to increase its reach to the people at ground level across India.

The Minister said that Indian Information Service Officers play an important role in reaching out to the common man and informing the public about the policies and programmes of the Government. Dr Singh said that the priority of the Government is to provide enabling working environment to the employees and various steps have been taken in this direction.

During the meeting, the IIS officers discussed various issues related to their service such as promotions and cadre management. The Association of IIS Group ‘A’ officers also presented a memorandum to the Minister. After listening to the officers, Dr Jitendra Singh assured that he will discuss the matter with the concerned officials in DoPT.

                The Vice Chancellor of Panjab University, Prof Raj Kumar met the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here yesterday and discussed the setting up of a separate hostel for students from Northeast and Jammu & Kashmir in the premises of Panjab University at Chandigarh.

Prof Raj Kumar informed Dr Jitendra Singh that since the Panjab University was attracting increasing number of students from Northeast and Jammu & Kashmir with each passing year, it would, therefore, be desirable to  have a separate hostel facility for students from peripheral states of Jammu & Kashmir and the eight states of Northeast, who otherwise are constrained to look for accommodation outside the University campus.

Dr Jitendra Singh told the Vice Chancellor  that the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) and the North Eastern Council(NEC) have, in the last four years, undertaken the task of constructing exclusive hostels for students from Northeast in such Universities where the number of these students was reasonably high.  In this regard, he disclosed that an exclusive hostel for North Eastern students is under construction in the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi and similarly, another such hostel is nearly complete with construction, in the campus of Bangalore University. He further informed that a piece of  land has been acquired at Rohini to construct a hostel for Northeast students undergoing studies in the Delhi University.

As far as construction of hostel for North Eastern and Jammu & Kashmir students in the Panjab University is concerned, Dr Jitendra Singh said that he will work out the feasibility within the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) and North Eastern Council(NEC).  He said, he will also take up the issue with the Human Resource Development(HRD) Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar and also personally write to him to help in funding from the HRD sources.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said the society bears collective responsibility towards imparting the right education to the children. Addressing the Teachers' Day function organised by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation here today, he exhorted the teachers to help mould the young minds as able and responsible citizens.

Dr Jitendra Singh said the birth anniversary of Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan is an occasion for us to introspect whether we have sincerely followed the education policy charted out by the former philosopher-President. He said the teacher deserves the appropriate respect due to him/her. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said 70% of India’s population is upto 40 years of age and thus it is important to provide the right education to the children and youth. He said the Central Government under the leadership of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has taken several steps to provide a level-playing field to fulfill the aspirations of our youth. This includes scrapping Interviews for recruitment to lower level posts in Government.

Addressing the gathering, the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju said the concept of education is changing and we all are making efforts to fulfill the objectives set out by the Prime Minister, including the Swachh Bharat Mission. Saluting the teachers, he said they are the real nation builders, nurturing children into able and responsible citizens in the future.

On the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh and Shri Kiren Rijiju gave away awards to 40 teachers and released the annual journal of the Education Department. The Mayor of North Delhi, Shri Adesh Gupta and other dignitaries were present.

The delegation was led by its General Secretary, Shri Umesh Mishra. 

The Association presented a memorandum to the Minister regarding the delay in promotion of Officer Surveyors to the post of Superintending Surveyors. The Association informed that a large number of Superintending Surveyors’ posts are vacant. They added that 125 posts of Superintending Surveyor posts out of sanctioned 160 posts (90 Civil and 70 Defence) are vacant as per Survey of India Group ‘A’ Service Rules, 1989. About 200 officer Surveyors have completed their eligibility of 8 years and are waiting for their next promotion for the last 12-15 years. The Department of Science & Technology has already taken up this matter with DoPT for obtaining one time relaxation in Survey of India Group ‘A’ Service Rules, 1989 for promoting Officer Surveyors to the post of superintending Surveyors. 

Dr Jitendra Singh said that it is the priority of the DoPT to ensure timely promotions of officers and to address their issues in order to avoid unnecessary delays in promotions. He assured the Association that he will take up the issue with concerned DoPT officials and expedite the matter as per the rules.

                The Union Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh today inaugurated 10KW transmitter of All India Radio at Patnitop in Ramban District of Jammu & Kashmir, that will provide services to people living in a radius of around 60 km (aerial) in various districts. 

 

While inaugurating the FM transmitter Dr Singh said that with the commissioning of the relay transmitter  at Patnitop, the high reaches and remote areas of the State in various districts like Ramban, Doda, Udhampur, Anantnag  and parts of Jammu would now be able to listen to the radio for entertainment and information more clearly. He further said that the commissioning of the relay transmitter had fulfilled the long pending demand of the local people. Shri Neelam Langeh , MLA Ramban and Director General , All India Radio Shri Fayyaz Sheheryar were also present on the occasion. 

 

While appreciating All India Radio for coming upto the expectations of the people in the era of tough challenges and competitions from private TV channels, Dr. Jitendra Singh  said that AIR can play a key role in countering the malicious  and fake propaganda being unleashed by some anti-national elements and mischief mongers .  

 

While addressing the audience, Dr Singh said that in the era of social media where misinformation spreads quickly, the credibility and trustworthiness of AIR serves as an alternative yet accurate source of information for the audience. The medium is prompt, credible and instantaneous and has continued to remain so despite the fast changing media landscape. 

 

Dr Singh, while referring to radio as a medium for information as well as entertainment said that the medium is still relevant and its reach is greater than other types of media. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it engages us even while not disengaging us from the work we are doing. The medium, its use and applications have changed over time, but it continues to remain relevant. Citing example, Dr Singh said that the use of the radio for education (Tele-education) has opened new niche for the applicability of the medium in the modern digital age.

 

While highlighting the important role played by the public broadcaster towards the socio-economic development of the country, Dr Singh said that the FM Transmitter would provide people access to information related to developmental initiatives of the Government and will open a new chapter in the developmental journey of the region. The Union Minister said that now the people living in remote and mountainous areas of the J&K State would be able to listen to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's 'Mann Ki Baat' programme and will also be able to know about various developmental programmes and welfare schemes launched by the  Government. 

 

MLA Ramban while expressing gratitude on behalf of the people of the district for the installation of the FM transmitter at Patnitop said that it was a historic development for the physical as well as emotional connectivity of the remote areas of the district.  

 

Earlier in his address, Director General, All India Radio, Shri Fayyaz Sheheryar said that the installation of  the 10 KW FM transmitter at Patnitop was a landmark achievement  for reaching out to the people in remote areas of the state by the public broadcaster. He expressed the hope that the Station at Udhampur would be commissioned before the end of current year and ensured that steps would be taken for augmenting the reach of the public broadcaster in difficult areas of the state.

 

The 10KW transmitter will help cover an ariel distance of 60 km in nearby districts of Doda, Ramban, Udhampur and parts of Jammu. It wil be available in the frequency of 101 MHz. It will provide services in districts of Ramban, Doda, Udhampur, Anantnag and parts of Jammu and will also be heard across the border especially in and around Sialkot.

                The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh launched India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) in Jammu today. The launch was a part of the nationwide launch of IPPBs across the country that is aimed at reaching the population of the country through utilization of the postal network for banking services. The Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha (Jammu-Poonch), Shri Jugal Kishore Sharma was also present on the occasion. 

Reiterating the commitment of the Government towards financial inclusion, Dr. Singh said that launch of IPPBs was an unprecedented step of the Union Government to empower the rural masses by providing banking facilities in the far-flung areas of the country. He further said that this revolutionary step would ensure that the benefits of development reach the people of the entire nation at the grass root level.

Addressing the audience at the function, Dr Singh said that the same technology that had made Post offices obsolete would mark the revival of these post offices through the Post Payments Banks. While highlighting the critical role that the Postman or the ‘Dakiya’ would be playing in the functioning of IPPBs, Dr Singh said that the Postman would become the ‘new bank’. The Postmen would become the new digital teachers for unprivileged and unbanked section of society marking the transformation to a new Digital India.  

Dr. Singh said that the developmental agenda occupied a central place for the Government where the focus was not just on rhetoric but on pragmatic programmes and practical implementation of schemes.  Dr Singh also mentioned that special attention was being given by Shri Narendra Modi led Government at the Centre by ensuring that parallel developmental measures were being taken in the state as that in the rest of the country. 

Arrangements were made at the function to see the live telecast of the National Launch of IPPBs by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi at an event in New Delhi.

In Jammu and Kashmir, eight branches of India Post Payments Banks, located at Jammu, Kathua, Udhampur, Rajouri, Srinagar, Anantnag Baramulla and Leh started their operations today along with 40 Access Points. The Postal Payments banks would not only provide the banking facilities but also financial services in remote and rural areas of the country. These banks are technology driven and yet having a simple interface. Process like opening a bank account, access to insurance and mutual funds, money transfers, etc., have been simplified and time taken has been reduced substantially. IPPB includes paperless banking and provides secure Aadhaar enabled transactions with zero balance accounts facility.

Banking through IPPBs would give boost to Government’s initiatives like promoting digital transactions and Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) and will help in better penetration of Government schemes like Sukanya Samridhi Yojna. 

The state launch was a part of the simultaneous nationwide launch of IPPB across the country at various locations in which a total of 650 branches and 3,250 access points were launched. By the year end, all the 1.55 lakh post offices across the country will start serving as the India Post Payments Banks. Nearly 3 lakh postmen will work as ‘Mobile Bankers’ and provide facility of ‘banking at your doorstep- aapka bank aapke dwar’. 

The inclusion of the unbanked population in the banking network through IPPBs will empower individuals who will be able to open bank accounts in less than a minute and have access to financial services and can avail of Government schemes in an improved and assured way. It would also boost India’s GDP and increase the flow of cash in the economy.

                Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship will kick off an innovative initiative in New Delhi on 1st October, 2018, with PSU Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs ,i.e. IOC, BPCL and HPCL) inviting Expression of Interest (EoI) from potential entrepreneurs to set up Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) production plants and make available CBG in the market for use in automotive fuels. This significant move has the potential to boost availability of more affordable transport fuels, better use of agricultural residue, cattle dung and municipal solid waste, as well as to provide an additional revenue source to farmers.

Titled SATAT, the initiative is aimed at providing a Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) as a developmental effort that would benefit both vehicle-users as well as farmers and entrepreneurs. 

To be launched on the penultimate day of the ongoing Swachhta Hi Seva fortnight, a mass movement to fulfil Mahatma Gandhi's vision of a Clean India, this initiative holds great promise for efficient municipal solid waste management and in tackling the problem of polluted urban air due to farm stubble-burning and carbon emissions. Use of CBG will also help bring down dependency on crude oil imports and in realising the Prime Minister’s vision of enhancing farmers’ income, rural employment and entrepreneurship.

Background

Bio-gas is produced naturally through a process of anaerobic decomposition from waste / bio-mass sources like agriculture residue, cattle dung, sugarcane press mud, municipal solid waste, sewage treatment plant waste, etc. After purification, it is compressed and called CBG, which has pure methane content of over 95%. Compressed Bio-Gas is exactly similar to the commercially available natural gas in its composition and energy potential. With calorific value (~52,000 KJ/kg) and other properties similar to CNG, Compressed Bio-Gas can be used as an alternative, renewable automotive fuel. Given the abundance of biomass in the country, Compressed Bio-Gas has the potential to replace CNG in automotive, industrial and commercial uses in the coming years.

There are multiple benefits from converting agricultural residue, cattle dung and municipal solid waste into CBG on a commercial scale:


	Responsible waste management, reduction in carbon emissions and pollution  
	Additional revenue source for farmers
	Boost to entrepreneurship, rural economy and employment
	Support to national commitments in achieving climate change goals
	Reduction in import of natural gas and crude oil 
	Buffer against crude oil/gas price fluctuations


The potential for Compressed Bio-Gas production from various sources in India is estimated at about 62 million tonnes per annum. 

Compressed Bio-Gas plants are proposed to be set up mainly through independent entrepreneurs. CBG produced at these plants will be transported through cascades of cylinders to the fuel station networks of OMCs for marketing as a green transport fuel alternative. The 1,500-strong CNG stations network in the country currently serves about 32 lakh gas-based vehicles. The Working Group on Biofuels, set up under the National Policy on Biofuels 2018, is in the process of finalising a pan-India pricing model for Compressed Bio-Gas. 

The entrepreneurs would be able to separately market the other by-products from these plants, including bio-manure, carbon-dioxide, etc., to enhance returns on investment. 

It is planned to roll out 5,000 Compressed Bio-Gas plants across India in a phased manner, with 250 plants by the year 2020, 1,000 plants by 2022 and 5,000 plants by 2025. These plants are expected to produce 15 million tonnes of CBG per annum, which is about 40% of current CNG consumption of 44 million tonnes per annum in the country. At an investment of approx. Rs. 1.7 lakh crore, this initiative is expected to generate direct employment for 75,000 people and produce 50 million tonnes of bio-manure for crops.  

The National Policy on Biofuels 2018 emphasises active promotion of advanced bio-fuels, including CBG. The Government of India had launched the GOBAR-DHAN (Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources) scheme earlier this year to convert cattle dung and solid waste in farms to CBG and compost. The scheme proposes to cover 700 projects across the country in 2018-19. The programme will be funded under Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) component of Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin (SBM-G) to benefit households in identified villages through Gram Panchayats. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has notified Central Financial Assistance (CFA) of Rs. 4 crore per 4,800 kg of CBG per day generated from 12,000 cubic metres of biogas per day, with a maximum of Rs.10 crore per project. 

Compressed Bio-Gas can be produced from various bio-mass/waste sources, including agricultural residue, municipal solid waste, sugarcane press mud, distillery spent wash, cattle dung and sewage treatment plant waste. The other waste streams, i.e, rotten potatoes from cold storages, rotten vegetables, dairy plants, chicken/poultry litter, food waste, horticulture waste, forestry residues and treated organic waste from industrial effluent treatment plants (ETPs) can be used to generate biogas. 

Going forward, Compressed Bio-Gas networks can be integrated with city gas distribution (CGD) networks to boost supplies to domestic and retail users in existing and upcoming markets. Besides retailing from OMC fuel stations, Compressed Bio-Gas can at a later date be injected into CGD pipelines too for efficient distribution and optimised access of a cleaner and more affordable fuel.

Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production

  

 

Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


	
	
		Crude oil production by ONGC during August, 2018 was 1783.38 TMT which is 7.59% lower than the monthly target and 6.06% lower when compared with August, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-August, 2018 was 8964.81 TMT which is 4.26% lower than target for the period and lower by 5.21% than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:
	
	


 


	
	
		
		
			Electric Submersible Pumps (ESP) problem in wells of NBP field (Rig deployment post monsoon).
			Less than planned production from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUs Sagar Samrat and Sagar Laxmi. 
			Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of Mumbai High & Neelam Heera Assets leading to flow restriction (line replacement to commence post monsoon under PRP-V scheme).
			Low Gas injection pressure in Geleki, Lakwa & increase in water cut in Geleki, Lakwa, Lakhmani & Rudrasagar fields.
		
		
	
	


 


	
	
		Crude oil production by OIL during August, 2018 was 286.34 TMT which is 8.04% lower than monthly target and 0.74% lower when compared with August, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-August, 2018 was 1411.41 TMT which is 5.12% lower than target for the period and 0.41% lower than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is less than planned contribution from work over wells and drilling wells. 
	
	


 


	
	
		Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during August, 2018 was 838.40 TMT which is 3.42% lower than the monthly target but 0.65% higher than August, 2017.

Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production  

 

 


	
	
		Natural gas production by ONGC during August, 2018 was 2061.90 MMSCM which is 6.55% lower than the monthly target and but 5.56% higher when compared with August, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-August, 2018 was 10013.07 MMSCM which is 6.07% lower than the cumulative target but 2.83% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. The reasons for shortfall are as under:
	
	


 


	Restricted off-take ex-Odalarevu in Eastern Offshore Asset.
	Less than planned gas production from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUs Sagar Samrat and Sagar Laxmi.
	Pressure / potential decline in gas wells of Gandhar field.
	Less off-take by consumers/ grid restrictions in Tripura.


 


	
	
		Natural gas production by OIL during August, 2018 was 236.97 MMSCM which is 12.62% lower than the monthly target and 9.37% lower than August, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-August, 2018 was 1137.41 MMSCM which is 14.32% and 7.92% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is loss of well head production potential of high producing wells of Deohal area, due to downhole tubing corrosion.
	
	


 


	
	
		Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during August, 2018 was 490.47 MMSCM which is 12.05% lower than the monthly target and 12.14% lower when compared with August, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-August, 2018 was 2421.20 MMSCM which is 11.26% lower than the cumulative target and 10.88% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:
	
	


 


	Panna-Mukta: Gas Production Lower due to wells underperformance and water loading post unplanned shutdown (SHELL).
	KG-DWN-98/3: Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 and 1 well in MA field.  Well B6 ceased to flow due to low reservoir pressure. (RIL)
	Sohagpur West CBM Block: Underperformance of CBM wells (RIL).
	Raniganj East CBM Block: Some wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs. Major customer 'Matix' operational shutdown (NEL/ESSAR)

                The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Policy framework to promote and incentivize Enhanced Recovery (ER)/ Improved Recovery (IR)/ Unconventional Hydrocarbon (UHC) production Methods/techniques to improve recovery factor of existing hydrocarbons reserves for augmenting domestic production of oil and gas. The ER includes Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR), Unconventional Hydrocarbon (UHC) production methods include Shale oil and gas production, tight oil and gas production, production from oil shale, gas hydrates and heavy oil. Enhanced Recovery, Improved Recovery and exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons are capital intensive, technologically complex and challenging in nature. It calls for supporting infrastructure, logistic support, fiscal incentives and enabling environment. 

The strategic objective of the Policy is to build a supportive ecosystem through academic and research institutes, industry- academia collaboration and to support and encourage Exploration and Production (E&P) Contractors to deploy ER/IR/UHC Methods/ techniques. The Policy will be applicable to all contractual regimes and Nomination fields. This policy initiative is expected to spur new investment, provide impetus to economic activities and generate additional employment opportunities. The Policy is expected to facilitate induction of new,innovative and cutting-edge technology and forging technological collaboration to improve productivity of existing fields.

The Policy envisages systemic assessment of every field for its ER potential, appraisal of appropriate ER techniques and fiscal incentives to de-risk the cost involved in ER Projects to make the investment financially viable. Mandatory Screening of fields through designated institutions, to be notified by Government, and conducting Pilot before actual implementation of ER Project on commercial level, are other prominent features of the Policy. An Enhanced Recovery (ER) Committee comprising of representatives of Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), experts from upstream sector, and academia would monitor and implement the Policy. The Policy, having a sunset clause, will be effective for 10 years from the date of its notification. However, the fiscal incentives will be available for a period of 120 months from the date of commencement of production in ER/UHC projects. In case of IR Projects, the incentives will be available from the date of achievement of the prescribed benchmark. Defined timelines have been prescribed to complete the various processes under the Policy. The fiscal incentives are extended in form of partial waiver of applicable Cess/Royalty on incremental production resulting from the adoption of ER methods on designated wells.

Technological interventions have significant potential in stimulating the recovery of hydrocarbon reserves from the matured/aging fields. An increase by 5% in recovery rate of original in-place volume in oil production is envisaged producing 120 MMT additional oil in next 20 years. In case of gas, an increase of 3% recovery rate on original in- place volume is envisaged, leading to additionalproduction of 52 BCM of gas in next 20 years.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to revise / fix the price of ethanol derived from B heavy molasses / partial sugarcane juice and fix a higher price for 100% sugarcane juice based ethanol for the forthcoming sugar season 2018-19 during ethanol supply year from 1st December 2018 to 30th November 2019 as under:

 


	To fix the ex-mill price of ethanol derived out of B heavy molasses / partial sugarcane juice to Rs.52.43 per litre (from prevailing price of Rs.47.13 per litre).
	To fix the ex-mill price of ethanol derived from 100% sugarcane juice at Rs.59.13 per litre (from prevailing price of Rs.47.13 per litre) for those mills who will divert 100% sugarcane juice for production of ethanol thereby not producing any sugar.
	Additionally, GST and transportation charges will also be payable. OMCs have been advised to fix realistic transportation charges so that long distance transportation of ethanol is not disincentivised.
	OMCs are advised to prioritise ethanol from 1) 100 % sugarcane juice, 2) B heavy molasses / partial sugarcane juice, 3) C heavy molasses and 4) Damaged Food grains/other sources, in that order.


 

Impact:


	The decision will serve multiple purposes of reducing excess sugar in the country, increasing liquidity with the sugar mills for settling cane farmer's dues and making higher ethanol available for Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme. 
	All distilleries will be able to take benefit of the scheme and large number of them are expected to supply ethanol for the EBP programme. Remunerative price to ethanol suppliers will help in reduction of cane farmer's arrears, in the process contributing to minimizing difficulty of sugarcane farmers.
	Ethanol availability for EBP Programme is expected to increase significantly due to higher price being offered for procurement of ethanol from B heavy molasses / partial sugarcane juice and 100% sugarcane juice for first time. 
	Increased ethanol blending in petrol has many benefits including reduction in import dependency, support to agricultural sector, more environmental friendly fuel, lesser pollution and additional income to farmers.


 

Background:

 

Ethanol Blended Petrol Programme was launched by the Government in 2003 on pilot basis which has been subsequently extended to the Notified 21 States and 4 Union-Territories to promote the use of alternative and environment friendly fuels. This intervention also seeks to reduce import dependence for energy requirements and give boost to agriculture sector.

 

Government has notified administered price of, ethanol since 2014. This decision has significantly improved the supply of ethanol during the past four years. The ethanol procured by Public Sector OMCs has increased from 38 crore litre in ethanol supply year 2013-14 to estimated 140 crore litre in 2017-18.

 

Consistent surplus of sugar production is depressing sugar price. Consequently, sugarcane farmer's dues have increased due to lower capability of sugar industry to pay the farmers. Government has taken many decisions for reduction of cane farmer's dues.

 

With a view to limit sugar production in the Country, Government has taken multiple steps including, allowing diversion of B heavy molasses / sugarcane juice for production of ethanol. As the ex-mill price of sugar has increased from the earlier estimated price, there is a need to revise price of B heavy molasses / partial sugarcane juice and 100% sugarcane juice for production of ethanol.

 

It is worth noting that as compared to ethanol derived from C heavy molasses route, diversion of B heavy molasses reduces the sugar by about 20% and increases ethanol availability by about 100%. On the other hand, diversion of sugarcane juice reduces sugar by 100% and increases ethanol availability by about 600%.

                The Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has emphasized on a clean, efficient and affordable mobility system. In his opening remarks at the Global Mobility Summit 2018 here today, he said that despite changing global trends, consumption of petrol and diesel in India is growing in excess of 5% per annum. Whatever be the scenario of the growth of Electric vehicles, India would still need higher refining capacities. To achieve cleaner emissions, the Minister added, India will leapfrog from BS-IV to BS-VI standards, and the NCT of Delhi has already switched to the better fuel since April this year. Shri Pradhan said the Government has already implemented fuel efficiency norms for commercial heavy vehicles.

            Talking about the gas based transportation solutions, the Minister said that the use of CNG, LNG and Bio-CNG is being promoted in the sector, and there are plans in place to have about 10,000 CNG stations within a decade, covering over half of the country. On the issue of promoting LNG as a fuel for long distance transportation by heavy commercial vehicles, Shri Pradhan informed about the efforts being made by Public sector oil companies and some private enterprises in setting up LNG distribution infrastructure. He said that 12 bio-refineries are being set up and steps are being taken to achieve 10% ethanol blending. Soon, Bio-ATF and Bio-CNG policies will be formulated. Indian Oil has tied up with the Delhi Government to introduce 50 Hydrogen enriched CNG buses next year. On the issue of Electric Vehicles, Sh Pradhan said that there are challenges concerning setting up of infrastructure and economy of converting to EVs, and Inter-ministerial teams are working to put in place a comprehensive policy on the matter.


            In the session, Mr Graham Stuart, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, UK, Dr Lam Pin Min, Senior Minister for Health and Transport, Singapore and Mrs Sindisiwe Chikunga, Deputy Minister of Transport, South Africa also participated. All of them outlined the trends and developments in the mobility sector in their respective countries. Mr Stuart appreciated the Indian Government’s efforts to provide LPG and Electricity to a large number of citizens.

                Ministry of Power, Government of India launched an ambitious program to encourage the deployment of Energy Efficient chiller systems in the country here today. The Chiller Star Labelling Program has been formulated by Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). The program envisages providing star rating in terms of its energy performance. Initially, the program is launched on voluntary basis and will be valid upto 31st December 2020. 

Launching, this key program, Shri A.K. Bhalla, Secretary, Power, emphasised the need to improve energy efficiency in space and process cooling sector, considering the occasion of 24th World Ozone Day and the 31st Anniversary of Montreal Protocol, which will be observed on 16th September 2018. “This initiative will promote advancement technology for central HVAC (Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems and will also facilitate energy efficient solutions for the large commercial and industrial applications”, Shri A.K. Bhalla added.

Chillers are used extensively for space conditioning of buildings and for industrial process cooling applications. The size of Indian chiller market which stood at 1 Million Tonne per year at 2017, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.6 per cent fuelled by a growth in the retail, hospitality and infrastructure projects. Chillers, being energy intensive system, contribute more than 40 per cent of the total energy consumption in commercial buildings. Therefore, it is important to optimize energy performance of chillers and create awareness amongst the end users to adopt transition towards energy efficient chillers.

BEE has developed an online registration platform for easy and expeditious approval under this initiative. The manufacturers will be able to register online for availing appropriate star rating of chiller equipment. Based on the test certificate from designated agencies and after due verification from BEE, the star label (1 to 5) will be awarded, with 5 star being the most efficient chillers. 

Through Chiller star labelling Program, it is estimated that more than 500 million units of electricity would be saved in 2019 along with Green House Gases (GHG) reduction of 0.5 million-ton equivalent of CO2. It is also anticipated to save more than 4 Billion units of electricity in the year 2030 with CO2 emission reduction of 3.5 million ton through this program.

The chiller manufacturers, Air Conditioner association and testing labs also endorsed and appreciated this flagship program. The program was attended by senior officials from CEA, BIS, CPRI, MoP, MoEFCC, technical partners, air conditioning manufacturers, RAMA and other key stakeholders.

                Minister of Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal has launched “Rail Heritage Digitisation Project” of Indian Railways in collaboration with Google Arts & Culture here today through video-conferencing. The project can be accessed through link:“https://artsandculture.google.com/project/indian-railways”. The project is a landmark effort, first of its kind in this part of the globe, to showcase country’s Rail Heritage to National and International audience in an online story-telling platform. Chairman, Railway Board, Shri Ashwani Lohani, other Railway Board Members, Vice President, South East Asia and India, Google, Shri Rajan Anandan, Director, Google Cultural Institute, Shri Amit Sood, other Railway Board Officials, Dignitaries from Google, UNESCO representatives and Railway Enthusiasts were among those present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Piyush Goyal said “At the outset, let me congratulate the Indian Railways and the Google Arts and Culture Association for this wonderful initiative, which has taken over 2 years of hard work, research, inquiry and execution. It is often said that civilisation is built over millenia by countless generations, with each generation leaving its footprints in the sands of time. A culture must reserve these footprints to remember what it was and where it came from. Whenever we look at the evolution of the transport system in India, all these rich traditions, history and culture will play an important role in understanding how the Indian Railways has evolved. Being a 165 year old organisation, the Railways has a lot of material which we need to preserve and leave behind for posterity. Mark Twain had once said, ""Our most valuable and instructive materials in the history of mankind are treasured in India"". The Indian Railways has a lot of treasured moments for the world to see how technologies evolved over time: Mumbai has a special place in the Railways, being the first Railway line to be set up in India. It was way back on 16th April, 1853 when the first train ran between Bori Bunder and Thane. We will be setting up 22 digital screens across different locations in India for showcasing this historic project”.

The Minister further added, “This partnership between the Railways and Google also has the dimension of the Wi-Fi, which we have proliferated to over 400 stations in India. This shows the potential of collaborations to serve people. The Wi-Fi that has been set up in 711 stations now, have faster Wi-Fi access than any other system in the nation. I would like to compliment the Google and RailTel team for this feat. When I was in Raipur Station, I found loads of people particularly the youth who flock to stations to enjoy the service provided. This confirms my desire that we should take Wi-Fi to over 6,000 stations to provide it to people who cannot afford Wi-Fi. We have already offered around 5,000 odd stations for public-private partnership through “Rail Sahyog” (http://RailSahyog.in) where we have invited people to come and make offers to pick up stations so as to expand it throughout the Railways”.  

Shri Goyal further said that this project is the largest cultural heritage digitization project not only in India but possibly the Asia Pacific Region. He expressed the hope that collaborative efforts will continue to expand the project further and possibly make it the largest such endeavour to preserve Railway Heritage in the world. Shri Goyal described this project as the gift from the 13 Lakh Railways employees to the 130 crore citizens of India”.

Chairman, Railway Board, Shri Ashwani Lohani said that collaboration with Google Art & Culture, has enabled Indian Railways to digitize National Rail Museum, Rewari Steam Centre, three World Heritage Railways, CSMT Mumbai building and other prominent aspects of country’s rail heritage. He appreciated the monumental efforts which went into this project of digitising the invaluable railway heritage. During the event, Shri Lohani also felicitated few of the railway heroes associated with the conservation of World Heritage Railways and said that Railway is a human centric organisation and it is the railway heroes who make it run.

Introducing this collaborative digital project between Indian Railways and Google Arts & Culture, Shri Rajan Anandan, Vice President, South East Asia and India, Google described it as an extension of their partnership with Indian Railways of providing public with Wi-Fi at 400 railway stations. He described it as an endeavour to bring incredible Indian Rail Heritage online.

Director, Google Cultural Institute, Shri Amit Sood, said that Google is committed to preserving and breathing new life into artistic and cultural treasures around the world. He added that the extraordinary wealth of heritage, history and culture that Indian Railways inherits, is truly fascinating, and a treat for both the young and the old. This project is all about the iconic moments, the movements, and the making of Indian Railways, which today is the backbone of the country in many ways.

 

Backgrounder:

Railways in India started its journey on 16th April, 1853 between Bori bunder and Thane. Since then Railways India not only expanded to be one of the largest network in the world but also significantlycontributed to social, technological and economic development of this country.

Today we have three World Heritage Railways: DHR, NMR, KSRand two World Heritage Buildings (CSMT, Churchgate), still unique feat in this part of the Globe (The other two World HeritageRailways are in Europe). In collaboration with Google Art & Culture, IndianRailways have been able to digitize National Rail Museum, Rewari Steam Centre, three World Heritage Railways, CSMT Mumbai building and other prominent aspects of country’s rail heritage.

Indian Railways has also created one of the largest repositories of industrial heritage in the World. Glimpses of Railway history and evolution are captured in 33 Rail Museums & Heritage Galleries, four World Heritage Sites, hundreds of buildings, bridges, locomotives, coaches, other rolling stocks, artefacts etc.Conservation of these industrial relics also helps in promoting tourism, preserving traditional skills and communication with people.

Digitization of rail heritage provides immense opportunity to contextualize artefact and other heritage assets with the stories thus becoming more meaningful to next generation. Digital heritage also removes bottleneck of being physically there and thus providing universal access to the large repository of knowledge.

With over 151,000 kilometres of track, 7,000 stations, 1.3 million employees and 160 years of history, the Indian Railway is one of the most celebrated railway networks in the world. Bringing this journey to the forefront, Google Arts & Culture’s new online collection is a story-telling marvel, and will make India’s rich rail-heritage and legacy digitally accessible to people in India around the world. The 75 online exhibition, 3500+ images and 200 videos, will offer an in-depth exploration of the sights, sounds and significance of India’s railways. Heritage routes with a 360-degree panoramic view of iconic railway stations, including Kalka-Shimla, Nilgiri Mountain Railway Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, and Kangra Valley Railway. The exhibition will also bring alive the lost stories and heroic efforts of people like the track-man, station master, and workshop engineers, to celebrate their contribution.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the following:-

 


	The New Broad Gauge Electrified Line of 294.53 route Kms from Katghora to Dongargarh will provide rail connectivity to unserved areas of Chhattishgarh, opening them up for industrial development through movement of freight to the busy Jharsuguda-Nagpur section of Howrah Mumbai route by avoiding busy yards of Bilaspur, Champa and Durg stations. 
	The Korba, Bilaspur, Mungeli, Kabirdham and Rajnandgaon districts of Chhattisgarh will be benefitted by this new rail line. 
	Estimated cost of this project is Rs. 5950.47 crore to be implemented by a Project SPV namely Chhattisgarh Katghora-Dongarhgarh Railway Limited with equity participation of Ministry of Railways and Government of Chhattisgarh through Chhattisgarh Railway Corporation Ltd (CRCL) and private stakeholders. 


 

With opening up of Raigarh District (Raigarh-Mand) to coal mining, it is expected that South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. and various end use miners will increase coal mining in Chhattisgarh State from the present 150MTPA to 250MTPA in near future. This project will reduce congestion on the existing Jharsuguda-Nagpur route which has more than 135% average utilization as on 2014-15. This will add nearly 30-35 MTPA capacity to system of Indian Railways which is nearly 3% of its present output. This project will also provide a faster dedicated route to west bound traffic of SECR, serve unserved areas of the State of Chhattisgarh and facilitate setting up of industry along the route. This is the first project of its kind and magnitude to be undertaken through the State Joint Venture route.

 

Background:

 

Chhattisgarh Railway Corporation Ltd. (CRCL) is a Joint Venture between Ministry of Railways (MoR) and Chhattisgarh Government on 49:51 basis in the form of a company under the Companies Act 2013 for jointly identifying, mobilizing resources and monitoring of the Railway Projects in various States.  Accordingly, CRCL has prepared a Detailed Project Report for a new single electrified railway line between existing Dongargarh Station on Nagpur-Raipur route and Katghora, a station on the under execution section from Gevra Road-Pendra Road.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved to construct new line between Budni to Indore (Mangaliyagaon) with approximate length of 205.5 Km. Total estimated cost of this project is Rs. 3261.82 crore. 

The main purpose of this project is the development of backward area and reduction in travel time from Indore to Jabalpur as well as from Indore to Mumbai and towards southern side also, as this will reduce distance by 68 Kms compared to present available route via Bhopal. It will provide better transport facilities for public and industries in this area. It will also help to provide/generate employment opportunities in the project area. The project will generate direct employment during construction for about 49.32 Lakhs man-days.

The proposed line will take off from existing yard of Budni and will connect at Mangaliyagaon existing station of Western Railway near Indore. 10 New crossing stations and 7 new halt stations are proposed to be constructed enroute. The new line will serve Sehore, Dewas and Indore districts and will provide direct link from Budni to Indore bypassing the congested route of Bhopal-Itarsi including Ghat section from Budni to Berkheda.

The new line will provide basic infrastructure support for industrial development of the surrounding area having large socio-economic ramifications. 

This project is meant for development of backward area of this region and to provide connectivity to various towns/villages like Nasrullaganj, Khategoan and Kannod, where presently there is no railway connectivity.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the proposal for electrification of balance un-electrified BG routes of Indian Railways (IR) comprising of 108 sections covering 13,675 route kilometers (16,540 track kilometers) at a cost of Rs.12,134.50 crore. This electrification is likely to be completed by 2021-22.

 

The major trunk routes on IR network have already been electrified and are operational. Considering the requirement for seamless operation of rail traffic across the network, it is necessary that the bottlenecks created by the need to change traction are done away with. The proposed electrification, which is mainly for missing links and last mile connectivity will increase the operational efficiency, enhance the line capacity and improve the average speed of trains.

 

The approved electrification will reduce the use of imported fossil fuels thereby improve energy security to the Nation. After the planned electrification, there would be reduction in the consumption of high speed diesel oil by about 2.83 billion litres per annum and a reduction in GHG emissions. This will also reduce environmental impact of Railways.

 

Currently, around two thirds of freight and more than half of passenger traffic in Indian Railways moves on electric traction. However, electric traction accounts for just 37% of the total energy expenses of Indian Railways. Due to this advantage, post electrification, Indian Railways is likely to save Rs 13,510 crore per annum in fuel bill and the same will improve its finances.

 

The approved electrification will generate direct employment of about 20.4 crore man days during the period of construction.

 

The benefits from this decision are listed below:

 

Capacity & Speed


	100% electrification will provide seamless train operation by eliminating detention of trains due to change in traction from diesel to electric and vice versa. 
	It will help Railways in enhancing line capacity due to higher speed & higher haulage capacity of electric locomotives


 

Safety


	Improved signalling system will lead to enhanced safety in train operation


 

Energy Security


	In line with the new Auto Fuel Policy of the Government, total shift to electric traction will reduce fossil fuel consumption of about 2.83 billion liters per annum
	Reduced dependence on imported petroleum based fuels will ensure energy security to the nation 


 

Energy bill savings


	Overall savings in fuel bill to the extent of Rs. 13,510 cr per annum. Electrification of sections covered under this decision will result in net savings of Rs. 3,793 cr per annum
	Reduced expenditure on maintenance of locomotive as electric locomotive  maintenance cost is Rs. 16.45 per thousand GTKM compared to diesel locomotive  maintenance cost which is Rs. 32.84 per thousand GTKM
	Regeneration facility of electric locomotives will save 15-20% energy
	Reduced overall requirement of electric loco due to higher horse power


 

 

Sustainability


	Reduced carbon footprint as environmental cost per Tonne Km for Electric Traction is 1.5 Paisa and for Diesel Traction 5.1 paisa 
	In line with commitment made by India in COP21, total shift to electric traction will reduce CO2 emission of Railways by 24% till 2027-28
	Green house gas emission for electric traction will fall below diesel traction by 2019-20 making it environmentally friendly option.


 

Employment Generation


	Direct employment during construction phase for about 20.4 crore Man days.


 

The complete electrification of railway is poised to continue the growth story of Indian Railways. Through the aforementioned benefits, complete electrification will act as a catalyst for the modernisation process and deliver greater economic benefits. It will help Indian Railways become the growth engine of India as envisaged by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

                Indian Railways has always focussed on adoption of new technologies to improve train operations and provide better passenger experience to its customers. In this series, Indian Railways has introduced various IT initiatives. Following are the major initiatives taken by Indian Railways in this regard. 

Tracking of trains using newer technologies:

Railways have experimented with tracking of trains using GPS devices with these GPS devices located in the locomotive.  For a sustainable solution, a Real Time Train Information System (RTIS) is being implemented, whereby GPS tracking devices would communicate using satellite communications.  The trials have been successful. Apart from this, data logger systems already available in track circuited stations are being used at major interchange points to capture arrival/departure information on trains.  

In an effort to computerise the transactions of the station master, a Computerised Train Signal Register is going live at 650 stations and this enables arrival/departure information to be transmitted to the Control Office Application (COA) and the National train Enquiry System (NTES) directly from the station master’s desk.

Handheld Devices on trains:

Handheld Terminals (HHTs) are being provided to the Train Ticket Examiners (TTEs) to be able to check the reserved coaches, allot the vacant berths and transmit information on available berths to the subsequent stations.  The HHT can also access the ticketing application and collect excess fares as per rules. The terminal can potentially connect to a Point of Sale (POS) machine and charges can be collected digitally. 

Modernisation of Ticketing Website (IRCTC):

Over the last four years, the capacity of the website has increased to 20,000 tickets per minute starting from 2000 tickets per minute in 2014, a ten-fold increase.  Apart from the capacity, the entire user experience has been improved substantially with the launch a new interface with easier navigation and standard views that enable the passengers to transact smoothly. New features have been added that enable better planning of journeys aiding the passenger to obtain confirmed tickets.

Paperless Unreserved Ticketing through Mobile Phones:

Paperless Unreserved ticketing on mobile phones was launched on 25.12.2014 at Mumbai and has since been expanded to suburban sections of Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Secunderabad and New Delhi-Palwal section of Northern Railway. This has eliminated the need for passengers to stand in queue for getting tickets for journey in unreserved compartments of trains.  The ticket is delivered on the Mobile Phone and is embedded with QR Code.   This service has added to passenger convenience.  About 4 lakh passengers per day are booking tickets on Mobile phones.

Indian Railway e-Procurement System (IREPS):

Complete tendering activity of Indian Railways for procurement of goods, services & works and e-auction of scrap sale is on IREPS.   IREPS system is largest such G to B portal in India.  It has helped in achieving objectives of transparency, efficiency and improving of ease of doing business.   During 2017-18, 4,44,000 e-tenders valuing more than Rs.1,50,000 crore  were issued on IREPS.  Online scrap sale of Rs.2800 crores was also done last year through e-auction.  90,000 vendors have registered themselves on IREPS website. Central Vigilance Commission has recognized and awarded the system under “Vigilance Excellence Award – 2017” for outstanding contribution in the category of “IT initiatives for transparency in the organization”.

                Ministry of Railways & Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) organised a seminar on “Leveraging IT for Mobility” here today.  Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal graced the occasion as the Chief Guest. Shri Goyal also launched a new app – “AAPOORTI’ mobile App of ‘Indian Railways e-procurement system’. 

Speaking on this occasion, Shri Piyush Goyal said, “It's time we get the charm back to the Indian Railways and to my mind, technology can be that defining factor that will help Indian railways change both its direction and its face. There are so many new transformations that the railways is working on related to the tracks, safety, signalling, catering, punctuality, and modernizing our inspection processes which will make them more efficient and clinically sound. A rapid scale-up of technology is what the nation expects out of us, and that's where we can take the help of the private sector in helping us develop and use that technology. It is encouraging to note that Paperless Unreserved Tickets have moved up from 195 in 2014-15 to 67,000 last year, which is a 35,000 % increase over a period of three years. We have now taken Wifi to 710 railway stations, best in the country in terms of speed. I am proud of Railwaymen who have done that. We have to make Indian Railways efficient, better & customise it for better customer experience by changing the mindset.”

Shri Girish Pillai, Member Traffic, Railway Board, Shri Mukesh Nigam, MD, CRIS, Shri V.P.Pathak, DG/Store, Railway Board, Shri Anand Mathur, DG/Personnel, Railway Board, Ms. Sunira Bassi, Additional Member, C&IS, Railway Board & other senior Railway officers were also present on the occasion. The seminar was organised in four sessions namely i) Mobility for Passenger Business, ii) Continuous Cargo Visibility, iii) Network Optimisation, iv) IoT (Internet of Things) and Mobile Data in Maintenance, Repair and Operations.

About the seminar:

During the sessions in the seminar, it was deliberated how IT can be leveraged to facilitate mobility in a number of ways. Speakers during the sessions spoke how IT can be used to enhance mobility can give rise to a number of solutions for the Railways such as continuous information availability to customers, network optimisation, end-to-end visibility of cargo, and maintenance of assets using IoT. These solutions which came during seminar can help to make Railway operations more effective to serve  customers.

Apart from computers and information processing systems, communication networks play a crucial role in leveraging IT for mobility. Efficient communication networks can be designed using latest technologies, to provide reliable high-bandwidth channels for fixed and moving devices.

Similarly, modern IoT devices provide high processing power in small packages with low power consumption to ensure that workers are facilitated even while working in harsh environments.

Mobility being such an important part of the overall productivity of the nation’s enterprises, this seminar served a good platform to deliberate upon the technology alternatives that can best facilitate it. 

Background material:    

IT can be leveraged to facilitate such mobility in a number of ways.

Firstly, mobile apps on hand-held devices connected through reliable networks to central IT systems can provide information to consumers while they are on the move. Such devices also facilitate collection of information for further processing. Secondly, IT systems can help to optimise the resources that make mobility possible. Examples are information systems that can optimise the routing of traffic through the rail network. Thirdly, IoT (the Internet of Things) enables data to be collected automatically using remote devices placed on fixed or moving assets to ensure that these are optimally utilised. This helps to provide reliable transportation systems for mobility. Fourthly, the use of IT can enable information to be seamlessly exchanged across organisational, even national boundaries, to provide efficient and uninterrupted movement of goods and people across these boundaries.

                The Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the Rehabilitation and Up-gradation of existing road to 2-lane with paved shoulders configuration in Jowai-Ratacherra (Meghalaya Assam border) section of the National Highway- 06 today at Shillong and dedicated the road project to the nation. The 102 km long road was constructed at a cost of 683 crore rupees by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Nitin Gadkari said the government decided to give highest priority for development of infrastructure in North East, especially in road sector, as prosperity comes from good roads connectivity. In addition, the other two important sectors are industry and agriculture. He also expressed happiness that after Narendra Modi has taken charge as Prime Minister, he has given top priority to the N.E states. The Union Minister asserted that there are various big projects for the NE States and further urged the National Highway and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) to make small packages and give more contracts to the people from the area so as to provide employment opportunities. We have project involvement of 1.50 lakh crore rupees in the NE, he said.

The Union Minister added that the 102 km long stretch of road is very important for the development of industries in Meghalaya as it passes through cement and coal belts of the State. With the travel time reduced from 4 hours to 2.5 hours, now trucks and heavy vehicles coming from Brahmaputra Valley can move smoothly in a record time frame to Silchar in Barak Valley, within Assam and thus providing connectivity to other N.E states like Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and southern Assam.  The Union Government is also giving highest priority for regional connectivity through aviation and waterways. The Ministry is also considering options for developing waterways in the Brahmaputra River.

Meanwhile, the Chief Minister of Meghalaya Shri Conrad Sangma thanked the government of India and especially the Honourable Minister Shri Nitin Gadkari for having taken up this project way ahead of its time, and that it is truly a very important and historic day and proud moment not only for Meghalaya but for the entire north eastern region. The Chief Minister said that the particular area where this road goes through is a very highly economically active zone, where there are more than ten cement plants, different resources that have been taken out of there including limestone and coal, agricultural products like turmeric and other products that they grow there. He also recalled Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicating Shillong-Nongstoin-Rongjeng-Tura Road to the nation which has now improved connectivity and further economic growth of that region.

Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb, Arunachal Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein and other officials were also present at the inaugural function.

A two-day review meeting of every ongoing national highway project in the North Eastern States with Chief Ministers, Central and State Officials and contractors began after the inauguration by the Union Minister.

                The Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari has called the urgent attention of automobile companies towards the need for an efficient public transport system in the country, run on electricity or alternate fuels.   Addressing CEOs of Indian and global automobile companies as part of MOVE: Global Mobility Summit 2018 in New Delhi today, Shri Gadkari urged them to actively think about diversifying into the public transport sector, and focus their research   and innovation efforts in this direction. Private vehicles are proliferating rapidly on Indian roads he said, and highways expansion cannot feasibly keep pace with this growth.  We therefore need to encourage people to shift to public transport, and for this we have to put in place systems that are efficient and convenient, comfortable and safe.  

Shri Gadkari further emphasized the need to bring down the huge cost of petroleum imports that the country bears, and reiterated his appeal to the automobile sector to shift to electricity or alternate fuels like ethanol, methanol, bio-diesel or hybrid. He assured the companies that the government was committed to developing all kinds of fuels – anything that brought import-substitution, was cost effective, environment friendly and indigenous. 

The minister also appealed to the industry to explore inland waterways and coastal shipping as alternate and cheaper means of transportation. He said the ongoing Jal Marg Vikas project on River Ganga was readying the river for transport, and this route, which will link further to Brahmaputra, will make it possible to transport goods from India right up to Bangladesh and Myanmar through waterways.  He called upon  automobile companies to use this route for transporting their vehicles. 

CEOs/ MDs / Representatives from various Indian and global companies including  TATA Motors, TATA Power, Mercedes Benz (India) , Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Honda India, Ford and Spicejet attended the Session with CEOs at the summit  today. They deliberated on the challenges and opportunities that their companies faced with regard to the mobility sector in India and especially in context of the Prime Minister’s call earlier today to focus on the three C’s of Common, Connected, Convenient, Congestion-free, Charged and Cutting -edge when talking of the mobility solutions in the country. 

Shri Gadkari also chaired the session on Reinventing Public Transport at the Summit today, where he appealed to stakeholders to give highest emphasis on introducing cost effective and pollution free public transport systems based on new technology. He invited the industry to invest in water transport especially for ferrying pilgrims between Allahabad and Varanasi during Kumbh. 

Road Transport and Highways Secretary Shri Yudhvir Singh Malik underlined the need to shift concentration towards developing more public transport in intercity travel. He said, we need to  substitute personal vehicles with public transport. For this public transport  requires reliability, timeliness and comfort. Indicating that while highways are carrying about 40 per cent of total traffic, and highway construction has picked up speed, last mile connectivity still remains a matter of concern. He said, there is over 10 times growth in number of vehicles in the last 25 years. Number of two-wheelers has exploded, share of cars is lesser, and that of the buses is down hugely. This has necessitated re-inventing public transport system in the country.

The two day Global Mobility Summit has been organized by Niti Ayog in New Delhi as a platform to rethink and deliberate upon ways to move people and goods more efficiently.

                The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modihas approved the extension of timeline for implementation of the Special Package under DeendayalAntyodayaYojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) for Jammu & Kashmir for another period of one year during 2018-19.  

 

The Cabinet also approved allocation of funds to the State under DAY-NRLM on a need basis for implementation of the Special Package without linking it with poverty ratio. There is no additional financial implication as the approval is to extend the time line to cover two thirds of the vulnerable households in the State within in the originally approved financial outlay of Rs. 755.32 crore.  An amount of Rs.143.604 crore will be required for the period of one year during 2018-19.

 

Impact:


	This will help in covering all the vulnerable rural households in the State (estimated at two thirds of the total number of households) within a definite time frame. 
	It will ensure mobilization of households under the auto inclusion category and households with at least one deprivation category listed in the Socio Economic Caste Census – 2011.
	It will also ensure coverage of all the blocks in Jammu & Kashmir under DAY-NRLM and ensures social inclusion, social development, promotion of livelihoods leading to poverty alleviation in the State.


 

 

Background:

 

Due to unavoidable reasons and disturbed conditions in the State, the Special Package as approved in May 2013 could not be fully implemented. Now, the State Government has requested Government of India to consider extension of the earlier approved implementation schedule of the Special Package and continued funding of DAY-NRLM in Jammu and Kashmir on a demand driven basis without linking allocation with poverty ratio during this extended period.  Hence the approval by the Cabinet which will give a boost to the vulnerable rural families in Jammu & Kashmir.

                Science & Technology Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has urged former scientists of CSIR to join a national mission to resolve the unresolved problems of the country through science. Addressing the 76th Foundation Day of CSIR in New Delhi, he said, the laboratories under CSIR should proactively involve those scientists, who were part of its family, as “scientists never retires”. 

“Take a resolve on this Foundation Day, to diagnose the problems that remain unresolved during these 70 years; define specific goals and targets; make a team; develop a management plan and finally a mechanism to monitor the implementation of the action on year-to-year basis” said Dr Harsh Vardhan.  

The minister said, during the past four and a half years, he had visited all the 38 laboratories of CSIR and interacted with the scientists. Dr Vardhan said, he is of the firm belief that Indian scientists are among the best in the world and the labs are comparable and in some fields ahead of similar institutions elsewhere in the world. 

Earlier NITI Ayog Member Dr S.K. Saraswat delivered the CSIR Foundation Day Lecture on Artificial Intelligence and Humanity. 

Dr Saraswat also presented CSIR Annual Awards in various categories - Innovation Awards for School Children, Young Scientists Awards, Technology Awards, Diamond Jubilee Technology Award, Award for S&T Innovation for Rural Development, GN Ramachandran Gold Medal for Excellence in Biological Sciences & Technology and Commendation Award to Indian Air Force team, which carried out the successful test flight of indigenously developed SARAS aircraft on January 24, 2018. 

Prof. Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary Department of Science & Technology and DG: CSIR announced Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Awards 2018, the highest multidisciplinary science awards in India. Thirteen scientists were selected for the award, which carries a prize money of Rs. 5 lacs and a citation.

                Union Science & Technology minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan today inaugurated a novel holistic Local Treatment of Urban Sewage Streams for Healthy Reuse (LOTUSHR) project at Sun Dial Park in New Delhi that produces clean water which is reused for various purposes, while simultaneously recovering nutrients and energy from the urban waste water, thus converting the Barapullah drain into profitable mines.

Along with that, Dr.Vardhan also inaugurated two bio toilets supported by DBT-BIRAC and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation installed at the Sun Dial Park. This is an attempt to meet the goals set by the Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan and contribution of the Department of Biotechnology, the Ministry of Science and Technology to “Swachhta Hi Seva” movement launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently.

Speaking at the inauguration, Union Minister congratulated the researchers and scientist involved with the pilot project and said this plant is a unique example of how waste can be made into a profitable mine. Dr. Vardhan said that this plant, which can convert 10 lakh litre of sewage into clean water and generate 3 tonnes of biofuel ,will be scaled up and will become a model for example for the whole world.

In another unique initiative at the site Department of Biotechnology has undertaken afforestation of marshy flood plains, degraded and unusable land and planted 2281 plant and tree species. These are from 44 indigenous species. This not only cleans the area, mitigates mosquito breeding but also purifies the air and soil. The species and the spacing of the planted material is carefully planned using a technology which allows these trees to grow rapidly and within a short span of two-three years recover a unique ecosystem of birds, insects and animals.

The Local Treatment of Urban Sewage Streams for Healthy Reuse (LOTUSHR) project inaugurated today is a joint initiative of Indian and Dutch scientists. Around a year back DBT in consultation with DDA identified the Barapullah drain, Sarai Kale Khan, in the state of Delhi for setting up on-site experimental testing lab and for the establishment of a pilot plant. DDA leased to DBT, a land measuring 200 Sq meters for a period of 5 years adjacent to the Sun Dial Park for this purpose. The project at the site today demonstrates how science and technology can be leveraged to effectively turn urban waste into profitable mines.

Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) Kochi faced technical issue with the Antenna Servo sub unit and Leakage of pressure inside Wave guide assembly on 2nd August 2018. The normal operations were stalled because of this major issues and RADAR become unserviceable.

 

As the RADAR is under Annual Maintenance Contract with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), DWR Kochi immediately informed the issue to the BEL Bangalore. BEL Bangalore deputed their site engineers on 4th August 2018. The engineers rectified the issues by 8th August evening and normal RADAR operation resumed w.e.f 8th August 2018. Again 21 UTC & 22 UTC (Co-ordinated Universal Time) scan on 8th August was interrupted for performance evaluation and checking of RADAR by BEL. During 0430 UTC to 0700 UTC & 1800 UTC to 2300 UTC on 9th, RADAR operation was stopped for performance evaluation and checking by BEL. Thereafter RADAR was on continuous operation. 

 

 

DWR Thiruvananthapuram is an inter-departmental service provided by Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre(VSSC), DWR Thiruvananthapuram is being operated during day time only. On all launch day, RADAR will be put in the off mode. Even though on 8th August also DWR Thiruvananthapuram was on operational mode, except during one hour time of 0432 hrs to 0555 hrs UTC, that too due to RF silencing for Rocket launch. From 10th onwards as per request from IMD, the DWR was put on 24X7 operation mode. Thereafter it was on continuous operation till 26th August, when it was put on day time operation. 

 

DWR products are mainly used for monitoring of weather, for issue of nowcast (Nowcasting is weather forecasting on a very short term period of upto 3 hours).IMD is issuing nowcast at 3 hourly interval uninterruptedly based on alternate atmospheric surveillance systems during the breakdown period of RADAR also. Nowcast for next 3 hours is being issued through SMS to SDMA, SEOC, District collectors. All weather warnings including nowcast are uploaded in the local website (www.imdtvm.gov.in) on routine basis.

                Union Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Chemical & Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya today announced that the number of seafarers in the country has increased by over 60,000. He said, while only about 92, 000 people were engaged in ship related jobs, their number has gone up to 1,54,000 now.

The Minister said, the government has taken steps to increase employment opportunities for the youth in this sector. The reforms under this include improving the sea farers examination. He said, while earlier only one to two per cent applicants could clear the said examination, with improved curriculum the pass percentage has gone up to 10 per cent now. This has resulted in more and more young people qualifying for jobs in the sector. 

Shri Mandaviya further said that rules and regulations have been strengthened for ensuring that students training to be seafarers get a chance to visit the sea during their training period. This, he said, will give them better exposure and prepare them well for jobs in the sector.

                 The arrival of first vessel ‘PennaSuraksha’ carrying 25,000 tonnes of cement from Krishnapatnam marks the beginning of operations of the 4th cement terminal at Cochin Port. This modal shift in transport of cement from road/rail to sea is another step towards promoting coastal shipping as cost-effective & environment-friendly means of transportation as envisaged under the SagarmalaProgramme of Ministry of Shipping.  Cement being a high-volume, low-value product, lower-cost sea transport is very important as a game changer in logistics. 

 

With huge destruction that has occurred in the recent floods, the requirement of cement in re-building the state of Kerala is expected to increase. Coastal shipping of building material like cement is economic & will help rebuild Kerala after recent floods in a cost effective manner with lower logistic costs.

 

 Presently, three Cement Terminals-  Ambuja, UltraTech and Zuari are in operation and handle 7,83,000 tonnes of cement annually. The Bagging Terminal of Penna Cement Ltd. is the fourth such terminal in Cochin Port. The terminal has been set up in 1.14 ha of land leased by Cochin Port Trust and is expected to handle 3 lakh tonnes of cement annually.

 

The Terminal has been designed to connect to Q6 berth at Ernakulam Wharf, where  ships carrying cement from Krishnapatnam Plant will be berthed for transfer of the cargo to the silos through pneumatic suction. The Terminal has four silos of total capacity of 20,000 MT, and has the designed capacity of 0.50 MMTPA in cement bagging. The Cochin Packing Terminal has an annual throughput of 0.30 MMT, to begin with.

 

 Cochin Port has facilitated the installation of automated cement bagging units by allotting land adjacent to berths to cement companies.  Cement is brought in bulk through ships, and is   transferred to silos on the adjacent land through pipelines.

The Port is expected to handle 1.5 million metric tonnes of cement by 2020. Malabar Cements, a Govt. of Kerala Co. has also been allotted land at Cochin Port for setting up a bagging terminal.

                In a bid to understand and address the challenges faced by the district administrations in implementing skill programs and help develop capacities, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has approved a plan for visits of the senior officers of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurships to the ‘Aspirational Districts’ between October 2, 2018 and January 26, 2019. 

 

Government of India has launched the Aspirational Districts Program to effectively transform the identified districts through convergence of Central and State schemes; collaborations among officers and creating competition among districts. This program lays emphasis on district to bring about overall improvement in the living standard of the citizens and ensuring ‘Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas.’ One of the key focus areas of this program is skill development.

 


The visit of officers of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurships will begin with a meeting with Districts Collector / CEO-Zila Parishad and other State level officers implementing the programs. The team will also have interactions with Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras, training providers, ITIs, Polytechnics and JSS administrations. The team would also have conversation with students and industry present in these districts. This will enable a stock taking of the available skill ecosystem vis-à-vis the available data and provide good understanding of challenges to be addressed at the district level to make youth employable. A detailed reporting format has been prepared which would be utilized by the visiting team.

                The Hindi film stars- Varun Dhawan and Anushka Sharma, have been signed on to promote and endorse the Skill India Mission, chaired by the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. 

The duo, through their film ‘Sui Dhaaga - Made in India’, are saluting India’s entrepreneurs and skilled workforce, especially homegrown artisans, craftspeople and weavers who are making the country proud the world over. The film highlights the untapped potential of India’s talented craftsmen and skilled workers at the grassroot level and the challenges and issues faced by them. Varun and Anushka, the star cast of the film, have partnered Skill India and will dedicate time to promote India’s skilled talent and their fine work by engaging with them across different parts of the country.

Speaking about this association in Mumbai yesterday, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, said, “Varun Dhawan and Anushka Sharma, through this unique film Sui Dhaaga - Made in India, are bringing to focus the incredible skills and talent of our homegrown artisan and craftsmen community. It is really heartening to see actors like them doing a film that has such a significant social message. India is one of the youngest countries in the world; and it is a matter of great pride for us to see such dedicated and passionate skilled youth with entrepreneurial skills in our country who are bringing name and fame to the nation with their work.”

“I wish this endorsement by both actors encourages and influences the youth to take up skill training and earn a better livelihood for themselves and help us in creating the New India envisioned by Honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi,” he further added.

Led by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), Skill India aims to standardize vocational training — both new-age and traditional skills —, helps in creation of latest infrastructure, ensures industry partnerships to extend technology support to make the youth more employable and assists in creating opportunities of employment for the youth of our country. This has led to more than 1 crore youth joining the Skill India Mission every year and transforming their lives through better livelihood.

Varun Dhawan said, “Prime Minister Modi has displayed incredible vision and genuine foresight in aiming to organise, skill, train and give financial support and backing to our craftsmen, artisans and similar workmen. We are proud to be promoting this campaign that we feel extremely close to like our movie Sui Dhaaga that celebrates self-reliance and entrepreneurship’’

Anushka Sharmasaid on the association, “Skill India Campaign reflects the government’s determination to include and support the talented skilled force of the country. While making Sui Dhaaga, we came across so many stories of talented, skilled crafts people and artisans who don’t get a fair chance to showcase their talents.”

The Skill India Campaign has brought about multiple policy interventions though its Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Policy, comprehensive changes in the Apprenticeship Act of 1961 and introducing the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) which together aims to provide best-in-class training to our workforce and formally recognize their skills. MSDE’s Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) program under PMKVY recognizes the skills and experience gained through years of working, bringing about a major shift from un-organized sector to the organized sector.

Newer jobs are being created in emerging areas – bringing forward the need of the youth to acquire a new breed of skillsets that will help them leverage the opportunity and maximize their own potential. Today, I am glad that major IT companies like Adobe and IBM have joined us in this mission to drive skills and proficiency in emerging areas among the masses of India”

                “International Day of Sign Languages” was celebrated by Indian Sign Language Research and Training  Centre (ISLRTC) under Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment here today. Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar, Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment was the Chief Guest on the occasion. Smt. Shakuntala D. Gamlin, Secretary, DEPwD, Smt. Dolly Chakravarty, Joint Secretary & Director, ISLRTC and many Deaf and Dumb persons along with their families were present. A special calendar of year 2019 with Sign Languages designed by ISLRTC was released on the occasion.

 

Addressing on the occasion, Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar congratulated all Deaf and Dumb persons on the International Day of Sign Languages and said the Union Government is committed to the welfare of Divyangjan and many important steps have been taken during past 4 years. He said that his ministry has written to all ministries to make special provision for Sign language interpreter in all their functions and programmes so that the deaf and dumb persons may also get benefitted.  He said that Sign language is a powerful visual language which can revolutionize deaf education and develop qualified human resources.

 

International Day of Sign Languages is celebrated annually across the world on 23 September every year along with International Week of the Deaf. The choice of 23 September is the same date that the WFD was established in 1951. The theme of International Day of Sign Languages is ""With Sign Language, Everyone is Included !” With Sign Language, Everyone is Included! IDSL held today, along with IWDeaf, which runs between Monday, September 24 and Sunday, September 30, 2018.

 

Sign language has been used for over centuries. The language capabilities of deaf children who use sign language are better. There is no advantage to delaying exposure to sign language, and research on the development of language has found that early exposure reduces the risks of language development. Lot of intensive therapy is needed after CI, even then the success is not guaranteed.

Earlier the schools focused on the oral education. However, now the educators and policy makers have gradually started bilingual schooling which is considered ideal for the deaf children as they acquire sign language as first language and are taught other spoken language through first language. This helps in enhancing their literacy skills. A child can express anything through sign language because it is a natural language. Each deaf child is different therefore one type of education may not be fit for all. A deaf child can have a CIAND use sign language simultaneously.  

The longer a person waits, the more his child’s brain has to deal with the harmful effects of language loss. Sign languages are complex grammatical languages just like the spoken ones. They have their own grammar and vocabulary. No one form of sign language is universal. Different sign languages are used in different countries or regions. For example, British Sign Language (BSL) is a different language from ASL, and Americans who know ASL may not understand BSL.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved continuation of the Capacity Development Scheme for the period 2017-18 to 2019-20 with an outlay of Rs 2,250 crore.

 

The Capacity Development Scheme is an Ongoing Central Sector Scheme of MoSPI. The overall objective of the scheme is to augment infrastructural, technical as well as manpower resources for making available credible and timely Official Statistics for policy makers and public at large.

 

The major ongoing activities under the Capacity Development Scheme, include augmenting resources for bringing out important statistical products, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Index of Industrial Production (IIP), Statistical classifications, etc.; conducting various Socio-Economic surveys, capacity building and strengthening statistical coordination, and improving IT infrastructure. Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), a continuous survey to assess quarterly labour data in urban areas and annual labour data for the whole country (urban and rural areas), was launched in April, 2017 under the scheme.

 

The Capacity Development Scheme has two Sub-schemes, Economic Census and Support for Statistical Strengthening (SSS). Under Economic Census, listing of all non-agricultural establishments is undertaken periodically, which forms the basis for conducting detailed socio-economic surveys. The last (6l) Economic Census was conducted during January, 2013 to April, 2014 and the Government now aims to conduct the Census once every three years in future. The SSS Sub-scheme is to strengthen State/ Sub-State level statistical systems/ infrastructure to facilitate development of a robust national system. Funds are released to States/ UTs for this purpose after detailed examination of their proposals.

 

In view of the requirement for better statistical coverage of sectors/areas, in addition to the regular ongoing activities, the Ministry proposes to also take up three new surveys under the Capacity Development Scheme, namely, Time Use Survey (TUS), Annual Survey of Service Sector Enterprises (ASSSE), and Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE).

                Chairman and Managing Director, SAIL Saraswati Prasad has said the persistent strategic approach to improve operational profitability assisted SAIL to improve the EBIDTA in FY’18 to Rs 5,184 Crore, a substantial increase over FY’17. He said this while addressing the shareholders of Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) on Company’s 46th Annual General Meeting held here today. He added that the improved operational performance is backed by increase in Saleable Steel production, higher share of Concast production, improved product mix, improvement in BF Productivity, reduction in Coke Rate & Specific Energy consumption, reduction in specific wage bill etc. In FY’18, after slimming losses by around 83%, Company’s Profit After Tax (PAT) on standalone basis improved to Rs (-) 482 Crore from Rs (-) 2833 Crore in FY’17. The consolidated profit after tax of the Company stood at Rs (-) 281 Crore for FY’18 as against Rs (-) 2,756 Crore in FY’17. 

 

The Managing Director said that SAIL has almost finished its balance Modernization & Expansion Program. He reiterated that FY’18 witnessed several landmark achievements through ramping up of new facilities and surpassing previous records in physical performance. SAIL achieved its highest ever production of Hot Metal of 15.983 MT, Crude Steel of 15.021 MT and Saleable Steel of 14.071 MT. It also clocked an all-time best performance of Continuous-Cast (CC) Steel production of 12.80 MT with a growth of 9% over previous best of 11.77 MT, achieved in FY’17. He added that, on the back of various new initiatives to improve productivity and efficiency across all Plants, every Unit has registered improvement. Bhilai Steel Plant's new BF#8 ‘Mahamaya’ and SMS-III were commissioned during FY’18 and the Plant also supplied long rail panels (260 meters) to Indian Railways from new Universal Rail Mill, registering a growth of around 112% in FY’ 18. At Durgapur Steel Plant, Narrow Gauge Wheels from Wheel & Axle Plant and High Strength Structural E350 grade from Medium Structural Mill (MSM) were developed in-house. Rourkela Steel Plant’s New Plate Mill recorded a growth of 48.1% over CPLY by rolling more than 8 lakh tonnes and the Mill exported 1,27,000 tonnes of CE marked Plates to the European Market as well. With consistent efforts, Bokaro Steel Plant registered record production of Cast Slab at 3.276 MT (previous best: 2.990 MT) and highest ever production of CR Coil for sale at 0.916 MT against previous best of 0.776 MT. 

 

Sighting positive outlook for global and domestic steel industry, he further said that growth in domestic steel consumption is strongly backed by robust development of India's infrastructure sector. It is further supported by 7.8% growth in domestic finished steel consumption during the FY’18, as a result of growing activities of steel intensive sectors. He said, SAIL continues to be the nation’s trustworthy steel supplier and SAIL steel is being used in country’s major developmental projects.

                For the first time, the Ministry of Steel will be giving away awards to the secondary steel sector on 13th September 2018 at a function in New Delhi. The awards have been instituted in order to encourage the secondary steel sector as it plays a key role as a growth engine for the national economy and employment generation.

 

Strong performance of the secondary steel sector has added muscle to India’s steel production. Encouraged by the overall potential, the Government of India has taken various initiatives to improve the performance of this sector. A few such initiatives are - supporting energy efficiency projects (Energy conservation and control of GHG emission) and R&D activities, strengthening institutional support, protecting domestic producers from below-cost import from foreign countries through antidumping measures, launching of an award scheme to recognize and encourage progressive units for adopting energy-efficient technologies and innovative measures.

 

Based on the present growth pattern, it is expected that India will rise to the second position after China. The National Steel Policy 2017 has set a target of 300 million tonnes per annum of production capacity by 2030. The production capacity in 2017-18 has already reached 137.97 million tonnes (MT).

 

One of the most significant aspects of the secondary steel sector is that it reaches out to millions of people in the rural areas, meeting rural demand. Growing in conjunction with the primary steel sector, the secondary steel sector holds enormous potential for growth and opportunities in the country. This sector has certain specific advantages over the primary steel sector such as lower capital and land requirements and the capability to produce special sections and customized products. With these abilities, the sector is bound to play a major role in actualizing the growth target of 300 million tonnes of steel production capacity by 2030.


The secondary steel sector comprises various sub-sectors such as sponge iron units, EAFs, IF units, re-rolling mills, cold rolling mills, galvanizing units, wire drawing units, and tinplate producers with annual production capacity of less than 1 million tonne and they meet the country’s demand for value added steel products. 

 

From a modest beginning with a small steel rerolling mill (SRRM) unit in 1928 in the industrial town of Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, the industry grew impressively in different parts of country over the years. By 1968, this sector grew to produce nearly 5 million tonnes of steel annually. Kolkata in West Bengal, Mumbai in Maharashtra, and Mandi Gobindgarh in Punjab were the initial three clusters of the secondary steel sector in the country. With the advent of induction furnace (IF) melting units in the early eighties, the sector further expanded in the country in cluster mode with a wider entrepreneurship base.

 

India has achieved 103.13 million tonnes in 2017-18 against the production of 97.94 in the year 2016-17. Per capita consumption of steel is also steadily increasing and has reached about 69 kg Per capita today

 

World crude steel production in 2017 registered a growth rate of about 5.3% as compared to the previous year. The global production in 2017 stands at 1691.2 million tonnes. With about 6% share in the total world crude steel production, India occupies the third position behind China and Japan. The steel industry in India contributes nearly 2 per cent to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).

The main objective of setting up of the Indian Culinary Institute (ICI) is to institutionalize a mechanism to support efforts intended to preserve, document, promote and disseminate Indian Cuisine, meet the sectoral requirement of specialists specific to Indian Cuisine, as also of promoting Cuisine as a Niche Tourism product. The main thrust area of ICI is to, not only create internationally recognized culinary experts, but also preserve the Indian cuisine, regional cuisine, document them and showcase them internationally.   

 

Indian Culinary Institute has been set up by the Ministry of Tourism, Govt. of India as an autonomous society under Societies Registration Act, 1860, as an educational research Institute, headquartered at Tirupati with another Campus created at Sector 62, Noida. In India, at present, there is a dearth of state-of-the-art training ground to groom top-of-the-line chefs of international standards. To fill this void, the Indian Culinary Institute would provide the appropriate training platform at par with the elite “Chef Schools” functioning in different parts of the developed world.

                The Ministry of Tourism clarifies that the Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) in India from the USA during the year 2017 have registered a positive growth of 6.17% over the year 2016. The FTAs from USA in India has never declined since the year 2010.

However, it is observed from the report of National Travel & Tourism Office (NTTO), USA that the outbound tourists from the USA to India have declined by 7% in the year 2017, as compared to year 2016. The figures of outbound travellers in the report are 1195000 and 1111000 for the year 2016 and 2017 respectively. In the said report released by NTTO, it is also mentioned that Traveler volume is based on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Advanced Passenger Information System wherein all airlines are required to electronically submit passenger data on flights arriving into and departing from the United States. Thus, it is obvious that the source of data for the report is only airlines reporting. In the cases where direct flight between USA and India is not operating, it is not known whether the final destination or the transit destination is reported as India by the passengers. Moreover, departures at International check posts other than airports are not captured in the report. Therefore, it may not contain the complete information on the outbound departures from the USA.

On the other hand, the Bureau of Immigration of India (BoI) compiles the data of FTA) from the records of scanned passport of each person arriving at all the International Check Posts in India, which include Airports, Sea Ports and the Land Check Posts. The FTAs from USA in India during 2011 to 2017 and in January – August, 2018 along with growth rates over corresponding period of the previous year are shown in the table below:

The Minister said that unless the infrastructure/fundamentals are set up, India can’t come up as a well sought after destination and he said that the present government has been developing these like ensuring 24 hour power supply, promoting renewable energy forms, and improving connectivity by effectively connecting the remotest destinations. The Minister also added that the most important element that will help promote Tourism in a complete way is the Government’s cleanliness drive, the Swachhta Abhiyan, which will ensure India becoming a preferred destination for all international tourists. Mentioning the income multiplier effect in the Tourism sector, the Minister said that Tourism generates a number of employment opportunities in formal and informal sectors and can change the destiny of the country.

The Minister said that India is so vast that there will be something new for everyone to see and experience in this country with its varied geography, culture, traditions, architectural marvels, religions. Shri Alphons also added that visiting the country has become easier with the new e-visa regime which is now open to 166 countries.

                Tribes India and TRIFED under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs launched “Punch Tantra Collection and Ms. Mary Kom as Brand Ambassador of Tribes India” at a function here today. Shri Jual Oram, Union Minister for Tribal Affairs introduced the Indian Sporting Legend and the World Boxing Champion Ms. Mary Kom as the Brand Ambassador of “Tribes India” and launched the “Punch Tantra” Diwali collection. Four promotional video spots produced by NFDC featuring Brand Ambassador Ms. Mary Com promoting Tribal products of Tribes India were also released on the occasion.

 

The Punch Tantra range of tribal artefacts includes handlooms and handicrafts, which are inspired and promoted by the World Boxing Champion Ms Mary Kom. Shri R.C. Meena, Chairman, TRIFED, Shri. Deepak Khandekar, Secretary, M/o Tribal affairs and Shri Pravir Krishna, Managing Director, TRIFED were present. 

 

Shri Jual Oram said that the probable potential of TRIFED is much more than many other PSUs under the Government and if utilized properly, it may become a game changer in the Indian economy. He commended the efforts of TRIFED for promoting tribal products through the vast network of Tribes India Showrooms, Aadi Mahotsavs/Exhibitions and various e-commerce platforms namely, Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal and GeM which provide a window to National & International markets.  Now TRIFED has opened 103 Sale outlets nationwide and its turnover has also increased 300 times. We have extraordinarily talented tribal artists and master craftsmen and women and their potential needs to be harnessed so that they may become industrialists. In addition, proper marketing strategy should be adopted for sale of diverse tribal products, he added.

 

The Minister further said that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is highly obliged to Ms. Mary Com for her support to the tribal products and that too without any remuneration. He hoped that by roping in Ms Mary Com, the sale of Tribes India products will also gain new heights.

 

Ms Mary Com, in her address, thanked Ministry of Tribal Affairs and said that she feels very happy to be associated with the Tribes India. She said that she herself belongs to the Tribal community. She hoped the such initiatives will bring great change in the lives of tribal people, socially and economically.

 

Shri Deepak Khandekar said that there are so many tribal products and proper marketing strategies are being adopted by TRIFED and launching Ms Mary Com is a right decision in this direction. The ultimate objective of TRIFED is to work for the betterment of tribal artisans and the Ministry. 

 

In his opening remarks, Shri Pravir Krishna said that that all out efforts are being made for increasing livelihood opportunities of tribal artisans and tribal entrepreneurs across the country through various schemes. He said that presently there are one lakh tribal artisans in our country and TRIFED wants to make them skilled master craftsmen and entrepreneurs. He expressed his happiness that the business on e-commerce has now reached to Rs. 10 Lakhs and it is being linked with Mudra and Jan Dhan Bank.

 

In his vote of thanks, Shri R.C. Meena said that the TRIFED has developed an e-commerce portal www.eshop.tribesindia.com for sale of its products. TRIFED’s sole objective is to bring about a multidimensional transformation of the tribal society.

 

Punch Tantra exclusive Collection products were unveiled during the event. These product symbolises with the years of hard-work, discipline, determination and dedication of both tribal artisans of the country and the Brand Ambassador Mary Kom. As the name of the collection suggests, the “punch” of Mary Kom represents the hard work and dedication of the tribal master craftpersons in creating such master prices of art and craft. The Punch Tantra is a magnificent collection of such excellence and powerful tribal legacy, which comprises of a range of ethnic and traditional tribal handicraft and handloom products like Sarees, Stoles, Dupatas, Shawls, Kurtas/Kurtis, Lamp shades (Kandels), Sky Lanters, Diyas, Gift hampers, etc. specially introduced for the coming Diwali and festival season. 

 

As part of its initiative of promoting tribal entrepreneurship and generating livelihood opportunities, TRIFED invited top 200 tribal artisans/ producers associated with it, from different regions of the country. Besides, a team of 60 young entrepreneurs from Dantevada, Chhattisgarh was also present. These young entrepreneurs have been invited to Delhi jointly by Niti Aayog and TRIFED to explore opportunities for livelihood development. All these tribal artisans and entrepreneurs create attractive handcraft and handloom products out of different fabrics, iron/metal or clay, wood/bamboo, beads and other material close to nature. Much of their output relates to fabrics, which are simple, in bold designs and colours, and express a simple but robust attitude to life. Tribal artisans are excellent at crafting things of beauty, but vulnerable in the competitive world of urban marketing. It is here that the Government has to intervene to fulfil its constitutional obligation of protecting the cultural and economic interest of tribes, which include providing livelihood and empowering them for a better life.

	Farmers in the area would be benefitted due to stabilisation / improved irrigation  in   98,739 Ha of land due to relining  of   Rajasthan Feeder and 69,086 Ha due to relining of Sirhind Feeder.


 

Expenditure:


	Funding for CA to the Rajasthan Feeder and Sirhind feeder shall be made through NABARD under existing system for funding of 99 PMKSY-AIBP projects under LTIF.


 


	In addition to existing monitoring mechanism for projects by Central Water Commission, an Expert Project Review Committee may be constituted to oversee the overall implementation of these projects.
	The approved cost of relining of Sirhind Feeder Canal is Rs. 671.478 Cr and that of relining of Rajasthan Feeder Canal is Rs. 1305.267 Cr, at 2015 PL. Of the total estimated cost, Rs. 826.168 Cr would be provided as Central Assistance (Rs. 205.758 Cr for Sirhind Feeder and Rs. 620.41 Cr for Rajasthan Feeder).


 


	Investment Clearance of Revised Cost Estimates amounting to Rs.671.478 crore and Rs.1305.267 crore for Relining of Sirhind Feeder and Relining of Rajasthan Feeder respectively have been accorded on 6th April, 2016.


 


	The projects were visited by a team under Chairman CWC during 2016 and by another team under Sh. A. B.   Pandya, former Chairman, CWC during 2017.  They recommended remedial works to be taken up. The Punjab Government also    conveyed    its    financial concurrence on 26.04.2018.


 

Background

 

Sirhind and Rajasthan Feeders take off upstream of Harike Head works and flow through Punjab before crossing over to Rajasthan. The twin canals have a common bank and were constructed in the 1960s as lined (brick) channels to convey water to command  areas in Punjab and Rajasthan.

 

The Government of Punjab has reported considerable seepage loss due to damages in the lining of both Sirhind and Rajasthan Feeders. As a result, apart from reduced flows in these canals, the adjacent areas have been affected by water logging causing huge agricultural losses.

 

The project would mitigate water logging problem and enhance the flows/ water availability in the two canals.

                The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the Revised Cost Estimate of Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) at the revised cost of Rs 3466 crore with the financial assistance of the World Bank to improve safety and operational performance of 198 Dams, along with institutional strengthening with system wide management approach.  Out of Rs.3,466 crore, Rs.2,628 crore will be funded by the World Bank and Rs.747 crore will be funded by DRIP States / Implementing Agencies (IAs) and balance Rs.91 crore to be funded by Central Water Commission (CWC).

 

 The CCEA also gave its ex-post facto approval for two-year time extension from 1st July, 2018 to 30th  June, 2020 

Impact:

          The project will improve the safety and operational performance of selected existing dams and mitigate risks to ensure safety of downstream population and property.  The primary beneficiaries are both urban and rural communities dependent on reservoir and downstream communities, who are prone to risk associated with dam failure or operational failure.  Further, through institutional strengthening component, effectiveness of Dam Safety Organisations will be increased to take the lead to make dams safe from structural and operational point of view through capacity building of staff and officials. 

Details:

DRIP envisages following objectives: -

 

a)   Component-I: - Rehabilitation of Dam and its Appurtenant Structures,

b)   Component-II: - Institutional Strengthening and

c)   Component-Ill: - Project Management.

The Scheme envisages comprehensive rehabilitation of 198 existing dam projects located in seven states of India namely, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Jharkhand (Damodar Valley Corporation) and Uttarakhand (Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited).

                I am grateful to the Prime Minister for leading the Poshan Abhiyan from the front.  It was actually his idea that unless we convert our efforts to eliminate malnutrition into a Jan Andolan, these efforts will have limited success.  

Over the last 4 years, we have been putting the pieces of puzzle together so that the fight against malnutrition can be taken up in a mission mode.  The first aspect we dealt was the increase of daily cost norms for the beneficiaries of the ICDS Programme.  The second was to have a technology based real time monitoring system of the Anganwadi services.  These two have been put in place.  The third aspect was the identification and elimination of fake beneficiaries which is an ongoing process.  We have already eliminated approximately one crore fake beneficiaries from the system.  The fourth piece has been announced today by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on the long standing demand of the Anganwadi workers to increase their honorarium.  The honorarium of Anganwadi workers and Anganwadi helpers is being increased by 1½ times from the existing amount.  The Anganwadi workers will be given Rs. 4500/- instead of Rs. 3000/-, Mini Anganwadi worker will be given Rs.3500/- instead of Rs.2250/- and the Anganwadi helper will be given Rs. 2250/- instead of Rs. 1500/- per month. This will boost their morale and help improve the delivery of services by the frontline workers and will  in turn help to achieve the goal of Poshan Abhiyan.

With these steps, we have launched the Poshan Abhiyan and we are taking the message of good, healthy and hygienic nutrition to all the targeted beneficiaries.  I am extremely grateful to my colleagues in the Cabinet who have partnered with us in the Poshan Abhiyan.   We are bringing a convergence of Government services at the ground level from the Ministries of WCD, Health, Rural Development, Tribal Affairs, HRD, Drinking Water & Sanitation, among others.  All these efforts are aimed to convey the message that the health and well-being of the children is the top most priority for the Government.

                The Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi has urged the Ministers of partner Ministries and all the Members of Parliament to extend full support to the ongoing Rashtriya Poshan Maah with outreach activities. The Government is celebrating the month of September, 2018 as the National Nutrition Month under the Poshan Abhiyan.

“In order to mainstream this programme during September, 2018, I request you to undertake outreach activities in your constituency. Your participation in this mission will enable common citizens to associate with the objective of eliminating malnutrition”, WCD Minister has stated in written communication to her colleagues. 

Smt Maneka Gandhi also said that the Poshan Abhiyan is a visionary programme to address the nutritional challenges of the country which was launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister in March, 2018. The programme seeks to bring convergence amongst various ministries to work in a coordinated manner so that malnutrition can be quickly and progressively reduced. The key features of this programme is mobilization of communities across the country and get their participation in addressing various aspects of the nutritional challenges, she said.

A number of Ministries of Central Government are collaborating in the Poshan Abhiyan. The primary aim is to enable awareness on the importance of nutrition and how individual families can easily access government services to supplement nutrition for their children and pregnant/lactating mothers.

POSHAN Abhiyaan seeks to synergise efforts of key stakeholders by leveraging technology and intends to take Nutrition Awareness to the level of Jan Andolan or People’s Movement. This People’s Movement intends to reach 11 crore beneficiaries during the Rashtriya Poshan Maah itself.

Since the launch, Government has organised many Awareness Workshops with an aim to reduce stunting, under-nutrition, anemia and low birth weight. As one of the nodal agencies of this Campaign, Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) has been at the forefront in driving Sensitisation Programs. Along with other partnering Ministries and Organisations, MWCD has been successful in mobilizing support from communities across the country.

Stakeholders across India will be encouraged to undertake activities ranging from State Level Workshops to Nomination of Brand Ambassadors to Multi-Media Campaigns. The MPs and Ministers have also been requested to update accomplished activities on the Jan Andolan Dashboard. In a swift response to the letter, the Ministers and MPs have already started undertaking series of POSHAN activities. 

National Nutrition Month has eight Key Themes, namely, Antenatal Care, Optimal Breastfeeding, Complementary Feeding, Anemia, Growth Monitoring, Education; diet and right age of marriage for girls, Hygiene and Sanitation and Food fortification. All the Departments of the Government and other associated organisations have adopted an integrated approach towards accomplishing a target of malnutrition-free India. Social Media Updates pertaining to this campaign can be followed by using #PoshanMaah.

This programme through use of technology, a targeted approach and convergence strives to build a Healthy nation. To ensure a holistic approach, all 36 States/UTs and 718 districts will be covered in a phased manner by the year 2020. The Jan Andolan intends to give prominence to Nutrition at the highest level in the country. Nearly 100 community radio stations are also participating in the special drive during this month.

                Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports (I/C) Col Rajyavardhan Rathore today felicitated Indian ace athlete Govindan Lakshmanan for his excellent performance in the recently concluded Asian Games at Jakarta. Lakshmanan was unfortunate to have missed the medal as he was disqualified at the end of the 10,000 metre race for no fault of his. Lakshmanan had stepped off the track momentarily, as he was hit by the spike of another athlete. The Indian team protested against the disqualification at two levels but it was turned down. To encourage the athlete to keep doing the hard work and strive for the medals, the Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Col Rajyavardhan Rathore rewarded him Rs 10,00,000/- ( Rupees Ten Lacs only).

                Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports (I/C) Col Rajyavardhan Rathore has approved the participation of Kho Kho team from India at the First International Kho Kho Championship in England from 1st to 4th September, 2018, with financial support from the Government of India. Financial support for participation of the Kho Kho team in an International event has been approved for the first time in relaxation of extant guidelines of the Ministry which, inter-alia, lay down that sports disciplines like Kho Kho, which are categorised as “Others”, will not be eligible for financial support for participation in International sporting events.

The decision to provide financial support to the Kho Kho Federation of India for participation in the First International Kho Kho Championship in England has been taken with a view not only to give fillip to this traditional Indian sports and sportspersons but also to pave the way for its future mainstreaming at the International level and its possible inclusion in multi-disciplinary sporting events like the Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, Olympics, etc.

                In order to fight the growing problem of counterfeit drugs in India, NITI Aayog and Oraclesigned a Statement of Intent (SoI) to pilot a real drug supply-chain using blockchain distributed ledger and Internet of Things (IoT) software. Apollo Hospitals and Strides Pharma Sciences will partner in this effort.

The SoI was signed by Adviser NITI Aayog, Ms. Anna Roy and Regional Managing Director of Oracle India, Shailender Kumar, in the presence of CEO of NITI Aayog, Shri. Amitabh Kant; Joint MD Apollo Hospitals Group, Ms. Sangita Reddy along with senior officials of all partnering organizations. 

Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, said “The problem of fake and counterfeit drugs is a major issue, costing the Indian pharma industry billions. At the same time, it’s putting patients at higher risk. This agreement with Oracle and our partnership with Apollo Hospitals and Strides Pharma, will help ensure that Indian drug manufacturers and healthcare experts have access to a standards-based, modern technology platform – blockchain and IoT, to help eliminate fake drug distribution.”

The major advantages of blockchain software will be its ability to allow the sharing of information across the drug supply chain securely with every exchange of information getting recorded, inability to tamper with any record of the drug movement and inability to delete any records so there can be no dispute, if an offender is caught.

About Blockchain technology in drug supply-chain

Blockchain technology helps to permanently register a drug’s record in the manufacturer’s drug supply chain (serial number, labelling, scanning), leaving no scope for record tampering. At every point of hand change, it records the drug’s movement – from manufacturer to logistics, to stockist to hospital, or pharmacy to consumer. In case of a fake drug, the software will detect irregularity. Additionally, critical information such as chemical ingredients of the drug or maintenance of temperature control in case of life saving drugs or vaccines, can also be tracked.

                NITI Aayog and United Nations in India signed the Sustainable Development Framework for 2018-2022 at a function in the capital today. The agreement is a reflection of the commitment and efforts made by India towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals. The Government of India-United Nations Sustainable Development Framework (UNSDF) for 2018-2022 was signed by the CEO, NITI Aayog, Amitabh Kant and United Nations Resident Coordinator in India Yuri Afanasiev, at a special signing ceremony presided over by Vice Chairperson, NITI Aayog, Dr. Rajiv Kumar. Members of NITI Aayog and Heads of UN agencies in India were present on this occasion.

Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairperson of the NITI Aayog, emphasized that 2018-2022 will be a crucial phase in India’s development story since the year 2022 marks the 75 years of India’sindependence.  In this backdrop, partnership instruments such as the UNSDF assume even more significance to accelerate the pace towards building a New India by 2022, an India that is free of poverty and equal for all.

The UNSDF outlines the development cooperation strategy between the Government of India and the United Nations Country Team in India, in support of the achievement of India’s key national development priorities and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The UNSDF was framed following a highly participative process, in consultation with government entities, civil society representatives, academia, and the private sector. The focus areas include poverty and urbanization; health, water, and sanitation; education; nutrition and food security; climate change, clean energy, and disaster resilience; skilling, entrepreneurship, and job creation; and gender equality and youth development. Across outcome areas, the UN will support the Government of India on south-south cooperation, in partnership with the Ministry of External Affairs. The total planned budget outlay for the implementation of the UNSDF 2018-2022 is approximately INR 11000 crore, of which 47 percent is planned to be mobilized through the course of implementation from multiple sources, including the private sector and the government.

CEO, NITI Aayog, Amitabh Kant, highlighted the need to promote innovation in meeting India’s development challenges and bringing on board the power of social entrepreneurs and the private sector to act on scale. 

The UNSDF is underpinned by the overarching principle of the SDGs to leave no one behind, echoing the Government of India’s message of SabkaSaathSabkaVikas (development for all). The programmatic work outlined in the UNSDF targets the seven low-income states (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, MP, Odisha, Rajasthan, UP), the North-East region, and the aspirational districts identified earlier this year by the NITI Aayog. Work will focus on improving the lives of the most marginalized, poor, and vulnerable communities and people in the country, especially women and girls. 

UN Resident Coordinator, Mr. Yuri Afanasiev, said that “The United Nations in India is committed to provide full support to the Government of India’s development priorities, ensuring that the UNSDF outcomes are achieved. The solutions we find together can catalyze action across the global south- just as solutions from elsewhere in the world will be adapted to India. He added that together, the India-UN team will ensure that poor, vulnerable, and marginalized communities participate in and benefit from the country’s robust growth trajectory.” 

The UNSDF also includes a set of UN flagship programs that are aligned with major government schemes. The flagship programs will be scalable innovative, multi-sectoral solutions to some of the most pressing development challenges that India faces, while also serving as catalysts for increased investment of development finance. The programmes range from affordable housing for the poor to increasing access to clean energy in rural off-grid areas; from protecting all children from vaccine-preventable diseases to quality education for all children and skilling for young people, especially young girls; and from ending stunting to improving the child sex ratio.

                Aiming to solve major challenges in India, the center will focus on application-based AI research in healthcare, agriculture and smart mobility

NITI Aayog, Intel, and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) announced on 7th September that they are collaborating to set up a Model International Center for Transformative Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI) towards developing and deploying AI-led application-based research projects. This initiative is part of NITI Aayog’s ‘National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence’ Discussion Paper that focuses on establishing ICTAI in the country through private sector collaboration. 

Based in Bengaluru, the Model ICTAI aims to conduct advanced research to incubate AI-led solutions in three important areas – healthcare, agriculture and smart mobility – by bringing together the expertise of Intel and TIFR.It aims to experiment, discover and establish best practices in the domains of ICTAI governance, fundamental research, physical infrastructure, compute and service infrastructure needs, and talent acquisition. 

Through this collaborative effort, the model ICTAI is chartered to develop AI foundational frameworks, tools and assets, including curated datasets and unique AI algorithms.The intent is to develop standards and support policy development related to information technology such as data-storage, information security, privacy, and ethics for data capture and use. The model Centre also plans to develop AI foundational technologies to promote applied research that can scale for national impact and will lead to the creation of a vibrant and self-sustaining ecosystem. 

Another key area of its focus will be collaboration with industry leaders, startups, and AI services and product companies to productize technologies and IP that are developed at the model ICTAI.And finally, the goal is to support skilling and talent development for world-class AI talent.

The learning and best practices developed through this model ICTAI will be used by NITI Aayog to set up the future ICTAIs across country. 

Anna Roy, Advisor, NITI Aayog, said“NITI Aayog had recommended ICTAIs for applied research in AI in the National Strategy Paper. Private sector collaboration is deemed tobe essential in making fundamental research get adopted for solving actual problems India faces, especially in the five sectors identified in the paper – Healthcare, Agriculture, Education, Smart cities and Mobility. This collaboration with TIFR and Intel will help us experiment and establish the foundational governance practices required to enable such applied research institutions succeed in the long term.”

Nivruti Rai, Country Head, Intel India, & Vice President, Data Center Group, said, “Artificial Intelligence is going to be a transformative driver of economic growth and social progress, and Intel’s vision is to drive human-centric AI to benefit humanity in an inclusive manner. In India, through the AI-for-All initiative, we aim to deliver the twin goals of solving hard problems of humanity, and helping India achieve its vision of global AI leader, by bringing together a rich ecosystem of research, innovation, technology development and deployment. We take immense pride in being the Industry lead along with NITI Aayog and TIFR, and I believe the model ICTAI will pave the way for application-based AI research and solutions needed in India for critical domains such as healthcare, agriculture, and smart mobility.” 

Professor Sandip Trivedi, Director TIFR, said,``This collaboration is a very exciting beginning where we plan to bring fundamental and applied research, innovation and technology development together to solve important problems facing our nation with potentially transformative effects on society. There are also a number of important issues related to ethics, privacy, etc, that AI and related technologies raise which are important to address. TIFR is excited to be in this collaboration; this center will be an important role model for future partnerships between industry, academia and government, which are the need of the hour in our country today.”

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has imposed a penalty of Rs. 9.33 lac upon Esaote S.p.A and Esaote Asia Pacific Diagnostic Pvt. Ltd. (‘Esaote’) for abusing dominant position in supplying dedicated standing/ tilting MRI machines.

 

The Final Order was passed by CCI on 27.09.2018 on an information filed by House of Diagnostics LLP (HoD).

 

The Informant - House of Diagnostics LLP - which is engaged in the business of medical diagnostic imaging services, filed information before CCI against Esaote alleging inter alia supply of old machines with various manufacturing and other defects. The Informant also alleged that Esaote charged huge sum of money for supplying spare parts and by refusing to perform its obligations under the contract. Essentials terms of the contract were also alleged to have been changed unilaterally by Esaote.

 

Holding Esaote to be the only manufacturer who was found to supply standing/ tilting MRI machines in India, CCI held Esaote to be dominant in this market.

 

The CCI further found Esaote to have misled HoD by supplying old machines instead of new machines as ordered by the Informant. The CCI also held that Esaote acted unfairly and thereby abused its dominant position by refusing to provide Head Coils with the machines to the Informant.

 

The CCI also found Esaote to have demanded arbitrary charges in derogation of its contractual obligations for comprehensive maintenance contract in respect of G-Scan MRI machines. The CCI also noted that Esaote S.p.A has given exclusive distribution rights to its Indian subsidiary in respect of G-Scan MRI machines. Such exclusivity was found to limit provision of services in after sale market besides denying market access to third party service providers. 

 

Accordingly, a penalty was imposed upon Esaote. Besides, a Cease and Desist Order was also issued against them. While imposing the penalty, the Commission applied the principle of relevant turnover and based the penalty on the revenue generated by Esaote from sale of G-Scan MRI Machines in India only. The penalty was imposed by the Commission @ 10% of the average relevant turnover of the preceding three financial years of Esaote.

 

The Final Order was passed by a majority of 2-1 with the Chairperson issuing a Dissenting Note. In his Dissenting Note, the Chairperson held that the relevant market cannot be narrowed to standing/ tilting MRI machines alone as any market delineation would have to necessarily include all MRI machines irrespective of some additional features or functionalities. In the absence of market power, the question of abuse of dominance did not arise, added the Chairperson in his Dissent Note.

 

Order of the Commission (Majority Order and Dissent Note) was passed in Case No. 09 of 2016 and a copy thereof has been uploaded on the website of CCI at www.cci.gov.in.

Linde, headquartered in Munich, Germany, is an international gases and engineering company and is primarily active in industrial gases, medical gases, specialty gases and the related engineering and services sectors. Praxair, headquartered in Connecticut, USA, is an international gases company and is primarily active in manufacture and/or supply of industrial gases, medical gases and specialty gases.

 

Based on its investigation, the Commission was of the opinion that the proposed combination is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in some markets inIndia but the same could be addressed by way of modifications to the proposed combination. Accordingly, the Commission approved the proposed combination under Section31(7) of the Competition Act, 2002, subject to the following divestments to be implemented by the parties:

 

A.  Divestment of Linde India’s entire shareholding in Bellary Oxygen Company Private Limited (Belloxy), a joint venture between Linde India and Inox Air Products Limited;

 

B.   Divestment of Praxair’s three on-site plants in the East Region, namely, Tata 1 and Tata 2 and 3 located at Jamshedpur and two cylinder filing stations located at Asansol and Kolkata; and

 

C.  Divestment of Linde’s one on-site plant in the South Region, namely, JSW – 2 located at Bellary, Karnataka and two cylinder filing stations located at Hyderabad and Chennai.

 

The aforesaid remedies shall be implemented by way of sale and transfer of respective businesses to an independent entity(ies), which meets the parameters prescribed in the order of the Commission.

 

The remedies ordered by the Commission aim to eliminate the substantial overlap in terms of presence of the Parties in the affected regions and for establishment of independent competitor(s) or strengthening of the existing competitor(s) by ensuring that they have an integrated presence in markets for industrial gases encompassing tonnage, bulk and cylinder businesses.

                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has imposed penalties upon 18 sugar mills and 2 Associations (Indian Sugar Mills Association and Ethanol Manufacturers Association of India) for rigging the bids in respect of a Joint Tender floated by Oil Marketing Companies (HPCL/ BPCL/ IOCL) on 02.01.2013 for procurement of ethanol for blending with petrol.

The Final Order was passed by CCI on 18.09.2018on a batch of informations filed by India Glycols Limited and 5 other Informants.

Pursuant to a Notification dated 02.01.2013 issued by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Government of India, regarding mandatory 5% blending of ethanol with motor spirit/ gasoline, the Government owned Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) viz. IOCL/ HPCL/ BPCL invited quotations from alcohol manufacturers for supply of ethanol through a Joint Tender dated 02.01.2013 which was issued by BPCL on behalf of OMCs - as the coordinator of the tender process. Through the joint tender, OMCs invited sealed tenders under the two bid system i.e. technical bid and price bid from ethanol suppliers. The supply was to be made available to various Depots/ Terminals of OMCs across the country for a period of one year w.e.f. 01.03.2013. 

The Informant (India Glycols Limited), however, alleged that Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) and Ethanol Manufacturers Association of India (EMAI) persuaded the OMCs to come-out with a Joint Tender for the purpose of procuring ethanol. The said joint tendering by OMCs was alleged to be an Agreement amongst horizontal players to procure ethanol from various suppliers in contravention of the provisions of Section 3 of the Competition Act, 2002 (‘the Act’) which was likely to cause appreciable adverse effect on competition within India in supply and distribution of ethanol. It was also alleged that the sugar manufacturers who had participated in the Joint Tender of 2013 manipulated the bids by quoting similar rates and in some cases identical rates through an understanding and collective action in violation of the provisions of Section 3 of the Act.

The Commission in its order noted that the bidders through their impugned conduct have contravened the provisions of Section 3(3)(d) read with Section 3(1) of the Act by acting in a collusive and concerted manner which has eliminated and lessened the competition besides manipulating the bidding process in respect of the impugned tender floated by OMCs. The bidders who participated in respect of the depots located in UP, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh in response to the joint tender floated by OMCs, were found to have acted in a concerted and collusive manner in submitting their bids. This was evidenced from the prices quoted, quantities offered and the explanations given by the parties. Such collusion was further strengthened from the fact that the bidders utilized the platform of ISMA and also acted on the signals emitted by EMAI which influenced the bidding behavior of the parties.

Accordingly, a total penalty of Rs. 38.05 crore was imposed upon 18 Sugar Mills and their Trade Associations (ISMA/ EMAI). Besides, a Cease and Desist Order was also issued against them. While imposing penalties, the Commissionapplied the principle of relevant turnover and based the penalties on the revenue generated by the sugar millsfrom sale of ethanol only. The penalty was imposed by the Commission @ 7% of the average relevant turnover of the sugar mills. However, penalty @ 10% of the average receipts was imposed upon the Trade Associations viz. ISMA and EMAI keeping in view the key role they played in facilitating bid rigging.   

The Order of the Commission was passed in Case Nos. 21, 29, 36, 47, 48 & 49 of 2013 and a copy thereof has been uploaded on the website of CCI at www.cci.gov.in.
